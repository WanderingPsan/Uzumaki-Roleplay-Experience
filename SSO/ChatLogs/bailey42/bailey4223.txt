<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But You didn't. - Sun Oct 18 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* - Sun Oct 18 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll see you later. - Sun Oct 18 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Have some business to attend to. - Sun Oct 18 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. Good bye - Sun Oct 18 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Heya.~ - Sun Oct 18 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hello - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How are you? - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm well thank you. Yourself? - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm good.~ - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good. - Sun Oct 18 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What're you doing? - Sun Oct 18 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing it seems. - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Aww, that's no fun. - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm a little bored in all honestly. - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, lets do something!~ - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Like? - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, I don't know... - Sun Oct 18 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, you're a shinobi are you not? - Sun Oct 18 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm!~ - Sun Oct 18 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How is your training going? - Sun Oct 18 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's going okay. I'm learning a lot of jutsu. - Sun Oct 18 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A lot of jutsu hm. What do you specialise in? - Sun Oct 18 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I am a generalist.~ - Sun Oct 18 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Oct 18 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I am still lacking on fire jutsu and genjutsu, though. - Sun Oct 18 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Katon and genjutsu... - Sun Oct 18 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can help with those two if you wish. - Sun Oct 18 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Sure thing!~ - Sun Oct 18 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Follow me then. - Sun Oct 18 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay! - Sun Oct 18 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Which first? Genjutsu or Katon. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ummm, I'll take katon. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And if you have any other elements, I can probably help with those as well. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I know wind, but I'm pretty good at that so far. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Which katon jutsu do you know right now? - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Fire Dragon Bullet. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And Wind is another of my specialties. - Sun Oct 18 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just that? - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Haha. I know some good ones, but nothing over C-rank. - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And mhm, just hat. - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll teach you a few then - Sun Oct 18 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed a single handseal and reared back her head, breathing out a stream of flames. It was similar to Fire Dragon bullet, albeit weaker.

"Flamethrower is almost exactly like Dragon bullet, just tone down the power and you'll have it."* - Sun Oct 18 16:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes, like that. Thats one down. - Sun Oct 18 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put her hands together for another three handseals before breathing out yet more flames. This time she aimed to have them land on the ground, as soon as they did they circled around some imaginary opponent; creating an effective barricade.

"This one is better used in conjunction with a Fuuton jutsu, but its good for cutting someone off. Treat the flames like a liquid so they roll along the ground."* - Sun Oct 18 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay next. Tell me if you're getting tired. - Sun Oct 18 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed yet more handseals, this time a total of five. She cupped both hands around her mouth and blew out a stream of fire. The flames suddenly widened out into a huge fireball, tinging the waters the colour of orange.

"Fireball technique, its similar to Dragon bullet again. Only you cause the flames to widen into a fireball rather than stay in a stream."* - Sun Oct 18 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay. Theres three more I can teach you. - Sun Oct 18 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They'll be harder to learn however as they're nothing like the other jutsu you've learned so far. - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: How much stronger? - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its not so much that they're stronger. Its simply that they work differently to the ones you've learned so far. - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Ahh, I see. - Sun Oct 18 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll start with the most useful. - Sun Oct 18 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) opened up her palm, to show red sparks that now danced along her skin. Once Nina had gotten a good look, she pulled back that arm and tosses the sparks away. Just as they left her palm, they erupted into a ball of flame which sailed towards the water and exploded on impact.

"This ones useful as it requires no handseals at all. Good if you're in a pinch. I can't really explain how it works, so you're going to have to figure it out."* - Sun Oct 18 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Sun Oct 18 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The next two work pretty well together, so I'll show you both. - Sun Oct 18 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a deep breath, combining the air in her lungs with the Katon nature. When she exhale, a translucent gas drifted out and over the water. It was almost invisible save for a slight shimmer in the air.

"This one is called the Misty flames dance. One tiny spark and that gas goes up in a fireball."

She pulled out a single kunai and flowed her chakra into it, igniting the metal in flames. She then tossed it into the gas which subsequently went up in the promised fireball.

"And this is Katon chakra flow. Rather that just putting your chakra into the weapon, treat it as an extension of your own bodies flow."* - Sun Oct 18 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right, now just the Misty flames dance. - Sun Oct 18 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And you have every Katon jutsu I can teach. - Sun Oct 18 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So you know Wind and Fire, no other elements? - Sun Oct 18 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Not even a little bit. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shame. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It really is... - Sun Oct 18 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm going to try and get into the higher ranks soon though. - Sun Oct 18 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh...good luck... - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've been a genin for...hm...seven years now? - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What, B rank jutsu won't be that hard. - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah, you mean jutsu - Sun Oct 18 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm.~ - Sun Oct 18 17:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I know a few B rank jutsu. - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Hassan told me never to teach those to anyone.. - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Well...one couldn't hurt surely. - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Really? Are they any good? - Sun Oct 18 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll let you be the judge. - Sun Oct 18 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) thinks: I hope it's a wind one! That's awesome!~ - Sun Oct 18 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned to the nearby tree, forming three handseals and drawing in a breath just as she would with Great breakthrough. When she exhaled, she released a swarm of extremely sharp wind shards. They smashed into the tree, tearing holes right through the bark and leaving the wood in shreds.

"This one is...really dangerous. I was told never to teach it to anyone without permission. But well, I can't help it if you figure it out can I..."* - Sun Oct 18 17:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Huh, Seems you figured it out. Oh well. - Sun Oct 18 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Haha, thank you Lera. - Sun Oct 18 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're welcome - Sun Oct 18 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What do you want to do now? - Sun Oct 18 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind at all. - Sun Oct 18 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Piggy back ride!~ - Sun Oct 18 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Hm...I can do one better than that. - Sun Oct 18 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took the girl by the hand, reducing both hers and her own weight to miniscule levels. As she altered their weights, the two began to float up into the sky; until they were flying.* - Sun Oct 18 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What do you think? - Sun Oct 18 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It's fun! - Sun Oct 18 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good, I'm glad you like it - Sun Oct 18 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hey Lera. - Sun Oct 18 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: sYes? - Sun Oct 18 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Do you want to spar before we go over the genjutsu? - Sun Oct 18 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure I suppose. - Sun Oct 18 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lowered them both back to the ground and she took up her position a short distance away.

"You may start."* - Sun Oct 18 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Go ahead. - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, what are we focusing on? - Sun Oct 18 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Or is it just like, a fight like I would fight for my life? - Sun Oct 18 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Throw everything you have at me. - Sun Oct 18 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) backstepped away from the girl, drawing in a breath to shoot just a small amount of mud directly at the girls feet. The intention was to cause her to slip and fall, or at least slow her down considerably. It was easy to see by her movements that the little girl was probably better in close combat than Lera was, but then that wasn't a difficult thin to achieve; at least for now anyway.* - Sun Oct 18 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled a bit when Nina avoided her little trick quite easily, a smile that grew a little wider when the wind sprung up around her. The girl was quite accomplished in Fuuton techniques and at such an early age, Lera couldn't remember being that good at her age. However, that didn't mean she was incapable of dispelling it.

With a simple clap of her hands, she breathed in deeply and jumped upwards so she could exhale directly at the ground. The intent was to hit the ground with a gale of wind and have it run outwards across the ground; hopefully tearing Nina's technique to shreds. Once she landed safely, she would wait for Nina's next attack. In the end this was actually quite good training, due to the humungous practice blade she had strapped to her back.* - Sun Oct 18 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) covered her body in Doton chakra, letting it flow over her skin until it turned a dark tone. She didn't try to dodge or block the shuriken, instead she merely let them ping off her skin as if they'd struck steel. The girls shuriken landed in the dirt leaving Lera completely unharmed.

"You'll have to try a bit harder than that."* - Sun Oct 18 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had many methods to escape this little attack of Nina's, though she didn't want to resort to flying or hiding underground. She intended to either overpower all of the girls techniques or take them withought getting hurt. It was very possible that even with Nina's combination. However, Lera didn't want it to be known that she was a one trick pony. So she dropped her Earthen armour and went for a different approach.

Instead, she formed three handseals extremely fast and formed a very small dome directly around her body. Hoping to avoid getting hit by Nina's shuriken.* - Sun Oct 18 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt things beginning to heat up on the outside, causing her to raise an eyebrow; at least the girl was using her brain, she knew how to combine jutsu well. It still wasn't enough however. The dome would suddenly erupt outwards, rock being blasted away by the force of Lera's entire body igniting with flame. The red tattoo's on her arms and back almost seemed to glow as she stepped through Nina's flames.

"Your not doing too badly."* - Sun Oct 18 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave a little shrug as she turned the Fire shroud off.

"I have over seven years of experience behind me, you'll get there eventually."* - Sun Oct 18 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Will you help me? - Sun Oct 18 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind. - Sun Oct 18 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As long as it doesn't get in the way of my own training. - Sun Oct 18 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I can help you with your training too.~ - Sun Oct 18 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Sun Oct 18 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I can try. - Sun Oct 18 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, I'm specifically training with this thing. - Sun Oct 18 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled the giant blade from her back and held it easily in one hand. It was blunted and obviously made for practice, it looked like it weighed a ton.* - Sun Oct 18 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kenjutsu huh. - Sun Oct 18 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Violet is good at that. - Sun Oct 18 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm.~ - Sun Oct 18 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shall we head back? - Sun Oct 18 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: If you want. Can we fly back? - Sun Oct 18 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure - Sun Oct 18 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) strapped the weapon back to her back and picked the girl up to fly off towards the mansion.* - Sun Oct 18 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So what are we going to do now?~ - Sun Oct 18 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll rest for a bit I think. - Sun Oct 18 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You're tired already? We haven't even done much! - Sun Oct 18 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've been training all day, you caught me when I was having a small rest. - Sun Oct 18 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, what can we talk about then? - Sun Oct 18 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm. I don't know. - Sun Oct 18 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What made you want to be a shinobi at such a young age? - Sun Oct 18 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm, I don't know. My parents were, so I wanted to. - Sun Oct 18 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Oct 18 19:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, you'll find your reason I'm sure - Sun Oct 18 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, I wanna be like mommy now. - Sun Oct 18 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who's your mother? - Sun Oct 18 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You are.~ - Sun Oct 18 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Excuse me...? - Sun Oct 18 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: You're my mommy now.~ - Sun Oct 18 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sun Oct 18 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: How do you reply to that??? - Sun Oct 18 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Sun Oct 18 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What makes you say that? - Sun Oct 18 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't know, you just remind me of my mommy, and you're fun to be around. - Sun Oct 18 19:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't have an answer for Violet and it was probably a question that didn't need an answer. So she just held the girl tightly, gently stroking her hair.* - Mon Oct 19 13:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) hummed under her breath, Nina was a special case; lera wasn't really sure what to do with her.

"Yeah, she sort've just started calling me 'momma'. I guess if she wants a mother figure, I don't mind being it."* - Mon Oct 19 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slipped out of the house, taking the oversized practice blade with her. The thing really was too big to be called a sword, it was more like swinging around a giant lump of steel. She supposed that was the point though, if the practice blade was far heavier than the real thing. Then when she actually started to use the real thing, she would find it much lighter.

Though she could now lift the thing without too much issue, the problem she was confronting now was her lack of stamina. Being able to lift and swing the blade was all well and good, but if she could only do it a few times before faling into exhaustion then what use was it? She remembered the tethys had been able to swing his sword all those years ago, he'd never had any problems with a lack of stamina and she didn't think there was much difference in their stamina reserves.

So there had to be something else, some other way she could use the blade without exhausting herself. Maybe it was simply a case of practicing enough with the weapon until she was able to run and fight with it without suffering too much with her stamina. It would be nice if that was simply the case, if not then she hoped that simply practicing for several hours every day would bring her to a competent enough level.

After a good twenty minutes of walking, she reached a secluded area of tree's various of the brown trunks already showed signs of wear. Generations of shinobi having come to areas like this to train, whether it was similar training to her own or if they had been practicing something else. She positioned herself in front of a tree and set to swinging, slamming the large blunt blade into the bark with a methodical accuracy.

While swinging, she let her mind wander away from her; the slow methodical thump of metal against bark proving to be quite relaxing. She thought about a lot thing, Seisuke...always Seisuke and a great many other things. Right now though, she was thinking about Nina; the little girl who seemed to have claimed her as a mother. In a fit of irony she apparently seemed to be calling Violet by the same name as well; she couldn't have known about Lera's and Violet's relationship beforehand.

A sudden voice behind her startled her out of her trance, it was a deep male voice simply stating her name "Lera.." She whirled around, bringing the giant metal blade with her to point at the unknown adversary. As her eyed adjusted to the shadows surrounding the man, her mouth dropped open; seeing it to be Cain "Cain?? Why are you here?" Cain put his back against a tree and slumped to the ground, obviously exhausted "I was looking for you, I'm glad I found you....I need your help"

Lera immediately dropped her weapon and ran to his side, checking him over for injuries; to which he thankfully had none "Say the word, what do you need?" she viewd Cain as one of the few friends she had left that hadn't died, if he needed help she was more than willing to give it. She gave him another once over, seeing the lack of injuries; but his eyes were full of pain, something was definitely wrong.

Cain returned Lera's gaze, resting his eyes on the new additions to her body; the tatoo's the new deeprooted sadness and loss on her face. She'd always seemed liked she was in pain from a horrific loss, but this was different; he could see it as clear as day, the spark that kept her happy was simply gone. He closed his eyes for a moment, forcing himself to stop thinking about what she'd lost this time to cause that. He had his own issues, issues he needed help with.

"Its my sister...she was taken by a group called the black fist, they've been terrorising the vilage my family lives in for months. I tried to deal with them...but there was too many, I couldn't do anyhting. They killed my family and took my sister, just to shut me up..." while she listened, Lera's eyes would be growing narrower and narrower her brow furrowing into a little frown. This is what all these petty little squabbles between shinobi caused, just because one man decided to be a greedy bastard; there were not shinobi left to deal with things like this.

"After you've rested we'll go there immediately, if we'd known about this sooner. We might have saved your family...I'm sorry Cain." Cain just shook his head, in reality it was his fault. If he hadn't bulled his way in, assuming he could do it alone; then this would not have happened "It doesn't matter, don't worry. Like you, I had no love for my father...my sister however. She is innocent, she doesn't deserve a fate like this."

"Alright, are you feeling good enough to walk now? I can carry you if needs be" he took a few breaths and shook his head slowly, standing up to brush the dirt of his clothes. He was exhausted in all honesty, but it wasn't going to stop him "I'm just tired is all, I'll be fine. Come, I will lead the way." with a little nod, Lera set off after him; making sure to pick up the heavy practice blade on her way through.

"That sword...isn't that a little heavy? It looks like it weighs a ton" With a little smirk, Lera took the blade from her back holding it almost lazily in one hand "It is quite heavy yes, but i've been increasing my physical strength. This is just for practice so I can use a very special weapon. Seisuke..he...died, the blade I'm training to use is the only thing I have left of him"

Cain didn't bother to reply to this, no 'sorry for your loss' or sympathy would make her feel any better about her loss. He knew just how much she'd loved him, leaving him with no chance to be with her. Even now, when her lover was dead, he still had no chance; her heart would always be with Seisuke. 

They stayed in silence for their walk, kept at a relatively slow pace due to Cains exhaustion; but they made good progress, soon finding their way onto a road "Alright, we can either follow the road directly to the town; or we can take a more covert route." Lera looked around, observing her choices with a trained eye. The road would surely be a faster route, but it was more likely they would be spotted by enemies.

"We'll take the road, let this 'black fist' come; I imagine we don't have a lot of time to save your sister, so lets get there quickly" Cain was silent for a few more moments before nodding his head and giving his silent thanks, he was lucky to have a friend who would risk her life for him "It should be another hour or so then, Unless they're waiting for me.." sadly, it turned out to be the latter.

They made it about twenty minutes down the road when a man stepped out of the tree's along with several more surrounding them from behind and to the sides. They all wore surprisingly formal uniforms for supposed bandits, they infact looked more like soliders than simple thugs. The first one to step out spoke up with a triumphant smirk on his face "Well well and well, lookie what we have here boys!"

A series of laughs and sniggers rose up around them, with the exception of one who stood nearby the leader with sharp eyes set firmly on here. Some silent understanding passed between her and this sharp eyed man, he knew what she was and she knew what he was; with a shinobi here it seemed as if things might not be quite as easy as she'd thought "Ya know, I didn't think you'd actually be stupid enough to take the road; but it looks like I was right. Oh how Sieth is going to hate that he was wrong."

Cain remained tight lipped staring at the man with a hatefilled expression while the leader looked between him and Lera "And you even brought us something to play with, how nice of you" more sniggers from the people surrounding her; Lera would not have taken her eyes the shinobi among them if Cain hadn't started to laugh out loud too. The leader stared at Cain with confusion along With Lera, she stayed confused for a few more moments until he stopped and stared leader dead in the eye to say "Good luck"

Lera understood the meaning behind his message, so she reached behind her back and took hold of the giant club like blade. Within a few moments, she'd charged forward and pulled the weapon from her back; jabbing it forwards rather than swinging. As the blade was dulled and made for the purpose of practice, it was not suited for combat; however it blade an excellent blunt weapon. 

It slammed point first into the leaders throat, crushing his wind pipe instantly and leaving him to fall backwards with a choked cry. He was one of the unlucky ones, the hit had not broken his neck; leaving him to suffer for several minutes with his crushed windpipe before he finally died. As soon as she'd hit the leader, she spun to the side and raised her weapon to block whatever attack the shinobi was likely to throw.

With a clang, his brandished kunai slammed point first into her sword; Lera was thankful he hadn't used a chakra flow technique, this practice weapon wasn't paticularly durable. Often in a battle of shinobi vs shinobi, the one who attacked first won; she hoped that held true in this case as she swung the blade one handed away from herself. From the forces of her swing, he was sent skidding backwards on his feet; leaving Lera to throw a single ball of flame with her spare hand.

In the space of a few seconds that this exchange had happened, the others had simply stood dumbfounded at the actions that had taken place. They may have worn the unfiforms of soldiers, but by no means were they skilled in any way shape or form. By the time they got over their shock and started moving, Cain had rushed towards the nearest opponent; grabbing him by the neck and giving a vicous twist. His victim fell to the floor, instantly dead.

This left only the one shinobi and five thugs to dispose of; the thugs would be easy to finish, it was possible that Cain could deal with them himself though Lera knew him to be exhausted. The shinobi was going to take a little more effort to finish off, after Lera threw her fireball at him; he formed a single handseal and spat out a spout of water to extinguish it. She didn't know how good he was at physical combat, but this proved that he at least showed the basic knowledge of Ninjutsu.

While the man recovered from his defense, Lera formed a handseal and created three clones. The first two ran towards Cain to help him with the thugs, while the last stood directly in front of her to intercept whatever attacks her opponent threw. Ordinarily, she might have wanted to let the man live; the shinobi were already dwindling out due to wars, better to leave them alive where possible. However, in a fight like this there was no room for compassion; it was kill or be killed.

By the time she had her clones ready, the man had reached into his pouches to withdraw a number of kunai; each and every one had explosive tags attached to them. This told her he was likely not a specialist shinobi like her, but a generalist; she knew a generalist could definitely become a dangerous thing if they trained well enough. He reached backwards and ignited his tags, before tossing them forwards directly towards her.

Lera had no room to be soft here, she would have to kill him if she could. As the kunai flew, her clone went through five handseals; bringing both hands upwards to let loose a large fireball. As soon as they came into contact with the tags, it exploded; causing both her and the man to stumble from the shockwave. She wasn't done there however, so with a simple clap Lera stepped forwards and exhaled sharply at the fireball.

A great gust flew from her mouth, igniting on impact with the flames and sending a humungous wall of flame towards her opponent. He responded in kind, weaving through his own handseals before spitting out a huge wave of water. The two techniques clashed, with her flames dieing almost instantaneously. This left Lera with a great wave of water to deal with.

She wasn't aware of it, but the fight between the thugs, Cain and her clones had all but stopped. The thugs had raised their hands in surrender, now just watching the battle between Lera and their shinobi with open mouths. Even Cain had a look of impressed shock, he'd obviously known what Lera was capable of; but to see her fight seriously was a sight to behold.

In response to her opponents water, Lera ran through another three handseals; slamming her hands to the ground in order to raise a great wall of earth against it. The water slammed against her wall uselessly, most either getting absored or falling to the ground in puddles. Lera knew then that the had to take the iniative, she could turn this fight around in a single attack if she did the right thing.

So her clone jumped up to stand on top of the wall, clapping its hands together and bringing them apart to form a ball of pure lightning. She tossed the ball directly at the now soaked ground, as soon as it came into contact with the wet floor; it sent ripples of lightning spreading through the puddles of water. Unfortunately for her opponent, he couldn't react quickly enough; indeed, how could he have known she would control not just three but four of the elements.

The lightning hit him and spread across his body, causing him to go rigid and grunt from the pain. Lera wasted no time after that, jumping over the wall after her clone and gripping him by the arms. She tied his wrists together with some strong wire, preventing him from using handseals. Most if not all shinobi could escape from something like this, so she kept a close eye on him just to make sure.

She escorted him by the scruff, stopping with him infront of Cain "He's quite good, not good enough though. I didn't expect them to have a shinobi on their side, they probably hi-" before she could finish, her captee interrupted "Yes they hired me to help stop him" he said while pointing at Cain "If I'd known he had help from a Jounin tier shinobi, I would have refused. The money is not worth my life"

After listening to his explenation, she looked to Cain "What do you think? I can leave him here like this, he'd escape these wires after a while. I would rather not kill him" Cain looked at her for a while, then at the thugs who'd surrendered and then brutally killed by Cain. He was certainly angry, it was understandable that he'd want blood. When he'd finished thinking, he looked the shinobi in the eye and said "You won't follow us?"

The man laughed and shook his head "I may like money but I'm not stupid. She didn't fight seriously at all and I used most of my chakra in that fight, yet she used more and doesn't even look winded. I was trained to fight Shinobi, not monsters." Lera gave a little nod, she'd more or less understood that he wouldn't follow and she actually quite liked his comparison to her being a monster. She released her hand from his scruff and stepped away, gesturing to Cain "lets go then."

Cain was still unsure, he hadn't liked him calling Lera a monster; though, he'd known she was strong but if that wasn't her fighting seriously then he was terrified to see it when she did. However, he trusted Lera with his life and with a little hesitation, left the enemy shinobi behind to escape his own bonds "Is this wise Lera? What if he was lieing?" Lera spoke whilst strapping her weapons back on "He won't, he knows he's outmatched in that fight. For a shinobi, chakra is our life force; where that man could use four or five jutsu before getting tired. I can use well over fifty without breaking a sweat."

With that, Cain took the lead once more; pondering just what kind of friend he had made here. At first he'd thought most shinobi were at least as strong as Lera, but to hear that she was a monster by the standards of most was disconcerting. Lera picked up on his hesitation, looking at his thoughtful face "Don't worry, yes I'm probably quite powerful; but there are plenty stronger. I was just born with more elements than most and a much greater pool of chakra. I use these to my advantage."

He didn't reply to her attempt at making him feel better, choosing to remain in his thoughts. The world was starting to look like an even bigger place than he'd first thought and it didn't make him too comfortable. Within another twenty minutes, they arrived at Cain's village. She cast her eyes around the place, taking in all the tiny details. It was obviously a village with little to its name, very little food and very little money. The buildings were in various states of disrepair and the few people who were around had their eyes downcast and bodies hunched over.

After a few moments a couple of men and women approached the two, exclaiming Cains name "Cain! You're alive, thank god for the little things. You shouldn't have charged in alone like that!" Cain gave one of the men a hug, an elderly man who bared a similar appearence. She assumed he was Cains grandfather, it was lucky he at least had some family left "Grandfather, everybody. I've brought someone to help us. Everyone, meet Lera."

The elderly man glanced her up at down, before jabbing Cain with his elbow and sending him a wry grin "So this is the famed Lera! She's just as beautiful as you said she was! Fancy that though, I thought all shinobi were hulking brutes; whats a delicate little flower like you doing as a shinobi eh?" Cain had to laugh, he just couldn't help himself; Lera was many things, but delicate was definitely not one of them.

Lera raised an eyebrow at Cain for a moment before turning back to the elderly man "I hear you need an exterminator for this little pest problem you're having. Point me in the right direction and I'll get to work" the elderly man turned his lips up into a grin, showing some shockingly white teeth "Straight to the business! I like it, but Cain here looks ready to drop; how about we let him rest first eh?"

"No need, I'm going alone. The sooner someone goes to get the hostages out, the better chance all of them have of surviving" Cain immediately took an exception to that, crossing his arms defiantly "I agree with her, we need to be fast; but you're not going alone Lera." she stared at him for a long time, ignoring the elderly mans slightly amused gaze. She then nodded and placed a hand on Cains shoulder, who immediately relaxed assuming she was agreeing "Sorry Cain, but in your state you'll just be in the way."

She didn't give him another moment to protest, sending a jolt of Raiton through her body and hand. Ordinarily, it would have simply numbed his body; but in his state of extreme exhaution, he went rigid for a moment before drooping forwards. She caught him before her could fall, allowing the other villages to take him off her hands "Don't worry, he'll probably wake up in a few hours; by then I'll be back and your pest problem will be dealt with."

The elderly man no longer held an amused expression, instead he stared into Lera's eyes with a little sad expression "Alright, you stay safe girl." and so she nodded and wandered off, leaving the elder to wonder what exactly could have happened to leave such a deeprooted sorrow permenantly etched into her eyes.

Lera soon came across the Black fist's hide out and was shocked to find it was a mansion of nobility. Guards wearing the same uniforms as the thugs before were patrolling the entrance. Unlike the time Lera had infiltrated her fathers mansion, she couldn't just bust in through the front; that would surely get the hostages killed. She would have to gain entrance covertly and find the hostages.

She watched for several minutes, getting a good idea of the mansions layout and the positions of the various guards. It wasn't very well coordinated, these 'guards' were likely nothing more than hired thugs. Lera decided on her course of action and began floating upwards into the sky. It was a common fact that nobody ever bothered to look up and why would they? What were the chances of someone sneaking in from the sky.

However, thats exactly what Lera did; floating high above the mansion for a while before she spotted a good candidated for a little interrogation. Without hesitation, Lera dropped from the sky; landing quietly behind a guard who patrolled alone. She grabbed him around the chest, putting a hand over his mouth and dragging him into a bush. Then a hushed yet threatening tone, she pressed a blade to his throat and said "Where are the hostages being kept! You have three seconds before I tear out your throat!"

The guard was clearly foreign to fear and the threat of death, he whimpered and then immediately spluttered through her hand "In the d-dungeon, bottom of the stairs!" she smiled her most cruel smile and then slammed the hilt of her kunai into his temple. He slumped unconciouss, leaving Lera to throw him over the wall. She intended to burn the place afterwards and didn't have the heart to leave him to that fate.

She made her way towards a side entrance in the house, killing anyone who was in the way. She might have spared to first man, but she couldn't be that soft for everyone. Anyone she killed, she left hidden in various bushes and alcoves; they would be found eventually but by then it would already be too late. Soon, she was through the side entrance into the house; which had been left completely unlocked. Whoever owned this house was awful at security and was going to pay for it.

There were very few guards around inside, likely because the owner probably prefered his privacy; yet another thing that would bite him in the ass. It didn't take her long to find the stairs, hidden behind a metal door leading into a dark closed off corridoor. She could just hear raucious laughter coming from somewhere down there. She recognised that laughter, it was the laughter of a man terrorising a girl...most likely sexually. She had to hurry.

She made her way down the stairs, moving past several empty cells; though one or two seemed to be occupied. She peered in each one, most were occupied by naked women; most barely older than her and some were younger. She recognised them as the hostages that had been hastily described to her by Cain on the journey here. She just hoped they had not yet been raped.

Before rescuing them, she had to help the girl who was in the most immediate danger. She could now hear the whimpers and crying; if she wasn't already being raped, she would be soon. She soon came across the source of the noise. A metal doored cell with a single guard posted outside. The guards expression was stony and nonchalant, he probably didn't care what was happening within. Lera took out a single kunai and took aim, pulling back her arm and then tossing it.

The kunai hit with a sickening thud, directly to the guards temple. He showed a look of surprise for a few moments before slumping forwards. Lera rushed to catch him, wanting to avoid the sound it would make and allerting whoever was inside. Once she'd lowered the man to the ground, she peered through the hole in the metal door; catching a glimpse of what happened within. She saw what looked like a noble man, attempting to pull off the belt keeping his pants firmly wrapped around his flabby stomach. Just in front of him she could see pink skin, a figure huddle up against the wall completely naked.

With anger in her eyes, she gripped the weapon on her back and wrenched open the door. The man turned angrily, shouting the words "I told you not t-" that was the last thing he got out before Lera giant blade slammed into the side of his neck. He died instantly, his skull completely crushed on one side and the bone that was once his neck jutting out of his skin. Lera didn't waste anymore time, she formed a handseal and summoned her full capacity of clones; a total of eighteen which filed into the mansion to clear it out and find clothes.

For the time being she kneeled in front of the naked girl, snapping the chains she wore with ease and then wrapping her in a warm cloak "Did he...?" the girl shook her head vehemently, pressing her body against Lera's and clinging on for dear life "No No. Thank you, thank you so much. I was...supposed to be the first, he didn't get to do it to anyone." Lera breathed out a sigh of relief, she had made it in time "Good, I made it in time. Come lets get you and the others out of here, Its time to burn this mansion down."

She led the girl out of the dungeon and house, followed by the now clothed hostages and a few of her clones. She was surprised to see what looked like bags and cases of money carried by her clones, most likely money belonging to the village. As soon as they were safely out of range, Lera and her clones began tossing balls of flame into the mansion; quickly setting the entire thing on fire.

The rest was simple, she led the hostages back to the village and allowed her clones to had over the money before dispersing them. The intense drain on her stamina was sudden and expected, yet she managed to remain standing. It didn't take long for Cain to appear, pushing through the crowd and confronting her "Lera! Are you okay? No injuries?" after Lera shook her head, then he exploded "How could you leave me like that! I should've been there to help, what if you'd gotten hurt I could've never forgiven myself.

Lera had been expecting this, so she held out a finger and stopped his rant "Cain, I'm sorry, but this is the way it is. This is my life, I face death every day and one day it will catch me. Thats simply how I live and theres no way I'm changing it." Cain seemed dumbfounded by her retort, he'd expected her to come up with some lame excuse, not just straight out admit that she was living on the edge.

"Cain, I have to go. I can't stay away from the village for too long, things are just too unstable right now. I'll see you again some day." Cain barely had time to get out a word of goodbye before she took off into the sky and began flying back to kirigakure. Lera had figured the villagers would try to reward her somehow, but she wanted nothing; she'd come just to help a friend, nothing more or less than that.* - Mon Oct 19 13:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) walked up to violet and tucked a note into her pocket before wandering off. The note said 'come find me with those chains later' a little heart was drawn by the note.* - Tue Oct 20 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) yawned, pressing her back against a tree with the oversized practice blade resting across her legs. Things had started to look a little bit better recently, the village was slowly but surely being rebuilt and Lera had Violet to keep her sane. If she added her self-proclaimed daughter Nina to that list as well, then things were starting to look bright indeed. She wasn't happy to know that people like Hideki were now looking for Samehada and the other blades, they would have to keep them quiet until they had the strength to wield them.

She looked around the little isolated training area she'd made claim to, the trees were in shambles; bark torn off, branches snapped. Even before she came here, someone had used this as a training ground and done quite a fair bit of damage. Lera herself had been working on her skill with the giant blade she was using, though looking down at the metal she could see that her constant practice was starting to take its toll. The weapon had never been made for durability, it existed soley for its sheer weight and size.

Though, she'd started to grow a little fond of the thing; it would be sad to put it down for the last time, though Kirie would probably find use with it. Figuring she'd had enough of a rest, she took to her feet again and turned back to the tree she'd been using as a training stump. From the many hits she'd given it, the wood had been all but descimated. She figured a few more good hits would bring the entire tree down all together. As she gripped the blade with two hands, she pulled back and swung with all her might. Slamming metal into wood with a great thud that echoed through the forest.

The tree shuddered and swayed from the impact, a testament to just how much her physical strength had improved over the past few months. What she once would have never been able to lift, she now lifted easily and with one arm to boot. She looked down at her body with a little smile, she'd never really been fat or out of shape; but her slim, slightly squishy stomach was now toned with a well defined six pack. Her arms were leaner and harder, with well defined muscles. Yet she wasn't oversized like some of those people who liked to 'body build' yet she could probably produce more physical strength than most heavily muscled civilians.

When she thought of her appearence should she start to pile the muscle on, it brought a little snigger to her lips. She would look riddicullous, a girl her size had no business building her muscles like that. It was thankful that her strength was steadily enhanced by the natural use of her chakra, exactly how a shinobi could produce such huge feats of strength with a relatively small frame. She was happy that her progress had come so far, but it still wasn't enough; no matter how much strength, physical or spiritual, she achieved. She would never find satisfaction in it.

With a grunt, she slammed her weapon into the tree once more; finding, to her surprise, that the tree finally gave way completely. It gave out a great crack; before slowly tipping to the side. She backstepped enough to avoid getting crush and watched it fall to the side. It landed in the brush with a great crash; sending dirt, twigs, leaves and who knows what else flying into the sky. It was nice to see that she was capable of this, but she wanted to reach a point where she could take up Samehada and produce the same result in a single hit.

For now, she just moved towards another tree; slamming her weapon into the bark again and again until her already aching arms burned with pain. Violet would probably tell her off for 'going too far' and although she really would do anything for that girl, she would continue to compulsively push herself. Go so far until she could barely stand, until her arms hurt so much that they didn't hurt at all. Even now, the weapon she wielded gained a new chip or dent with every one of her strikes and with each chip she grew closer and closer to her final goal.* - Tue Oct 20 12:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If you don't mind, may I know what this promise is? - Tue Oct 20 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...I don't really know you well enough to be divulging my secrets - Tue Oct 20 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Fair enough. - Tue Oct 20 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So is your answer no? - Tue Oct 20 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Then I ask you one final question. Does this promise include protecting someone, or taking another's life? - Tue Oct 20 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I hate killing if thats what your asking, but if it becomes a necessity I don't hesitate. To put it simply, its to protect. - Tue Oct 20 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. Then I'll assist you in your practices. - Tue Oct 20 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Excellent. - Tue Oct 20 19:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Well. . . Anyone up for a spar? - Tue Oct 20 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took hold of her blades hilt, swinging it from her back to slam the point into the ground. Despite her small frame she showed a surprising amount of physical strength. The blade in question was obviously blunted, made for sheer size and weight rather than combat situations. It was covered in chips and small dents along the edge, proof to the sheer amount of practice she'd been putting in with it.

"My name is Lera, nice to meet you Kuro."* - Tue Oct 20 19:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: You can have the first move, I suppose. - Tue Oct 20 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Alright, I suppose. - Tue Oct 20 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) frowned, immediately realising that she wouldn't stand a chance if she used the blade; she wasn't yet skilled enough to use it against someone like him and he would quickly realise it.  So she fell back onto her old style, pushing the giant weapon out in front of her directly in his path of attack.

With his speed and obvious specialisation in Taijutsu, she would have to act fast; the weapon in his path would likely not even slow him down, so she sought to trip him by forming three handseals and spitting a stream of mud directly in front of her. The mud immediately hit the ground, forming only a tiny wall between her and him. The idea was to simply make him trip over it while she thought of something else.* - Tue Oct 20 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) continued moving backwards, unsure why Kuro hadn't continued his charge; her wall was barely ankle height, having only been made to trip him up. Once she'd gotten a little more distance, she brought her hands together in a single unique handseal and summoned two clones on either side. The clones would immediately begin running diagonally to the right and left of Kuro; preparing the use of their own jutsu.* - Tue Oct 20 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had her two clones breathe in deep, to spit out rivers of mud over the entire area. The mud may disturb Kuro's movements and perhaps even slow him down, but that wasn't its purpose. For now though, Lera had to avoid getting hit by any of his attacks. She was especially weak against the speedy types, which Kuro seemed to be; one hit and she would probably go down.

For now, she just dropped backwards and sank into the ground; essentially hiding herself while her clones could deal with the brunt of his attacks. If kirie was right about this mans eyes, she would not be hidden for long but hopefully the clones would be able to distract him long enough to provide her with an opening.* - Tue Oct 20 20:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll The clone smiled as the orb of Raiton came flashing towards it, to counter it simple clapped its hands together and exhaled a violent gust towards it. The gust would hopefully erase the lightning all together and possibly unbalance Kuro entirely. The other clone copied Kuro, bringing its hands together and drawing chakra into the palms. When it pulled its hands apart lightning would flash between them, forming a ball which it subsequently tossed at Kuro.

Lera herself would backpeddle underground, having a good idea of what was happening with her clones and Kuro. She had a lot of options here, it was a question of which one she could take. She didn't paticularly want to cause any real damage to him, any attack done by her clones would be trivial due to their reduced power; so she decided to go with something that would merely bind him in place.

As quick as she could, she popped up above ground; her hands already formed into a single handseal. From the mud behind Kuro, a figure rose up; taking on the shape and form of Lera perfectly. The figure moved to wrap its arms around Kuro's chest, if successful it would immediately form back into mud; essentially binding him.* - Tue Oct 20 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . .? - Tue Oct 20 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: White eyes. - Tue Oct 20 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had more or less just assumed this would be her victory there, but as Kuro began to spin; not only was her Raiton ball erased but her clone was simply blown away. This meant that the fight was going to be harder than she originally thought, which suited her fine. If this was the case then she would simply throw everything she could at him and see how well he fared. Using her Katon and fuuton techniques was not possible though, not with so many people around.

Instead, she and both of her shadow clones ran through a series of handseals; focusing their chakras onto the surrounding mud. In front of Lera and both clones, a large dragon head rose up from the mud; opening up their maws to release a torrent of hardened mud bullets.* - Tue Oct 20 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was already raising her arms to guard, while channeling Doton chakra through her body itself; but then Kuro simply stopped.

"Eh? Your stopping?"* - Tue Oct 20 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. I forgot I had prior arrangements. I do hope we can continue this another day. - Tue Oct 20 20:55:40 2015
