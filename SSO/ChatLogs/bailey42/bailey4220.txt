<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Wedding's off. - Sun Oct 11 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't say a word to hassan, just threw a scroll at him and wandered off.* - Sun Oct 11 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) walked her way through the village and then out in the wilderness beyond. It was the first time she'd traveled alone, yet she had more than enough skill to stave off against potential predators and even bandits. Her small stature however often gave them the assumption that she was weak and easy to take down. Those wrong assumptions were always quickly put down without fail.

She was finally making her way back to Kirigakure, she was hoping that Kirie would allow her to come back; considering she hadn't been able to send a messenger pidgeon. What she was looking forward to though was finally seeing Violet again. After losing Seisuke, she needed someone to provide the comfort that Fujitora and Hassan were just incapable of providing. Violet was the perfect girl for that.* - Sun Oct 11 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stopped the moment she came across a body of water. She made a clone to watch over her and then stripped off her clothes to jump into the water. The cold water bit into her skin, but she couldn't help but feel satisfied. You just couldn't get this sort of pleasure in Sungakure, there was far too much sand and grit for her liking. It was sort've Ironic that she prefered the watery Kirigakure to the sandy Sunagakure when her best element was Doton.

Whilst in the water, she couldn't help but think of Seisuke. She used to be terrified of water and still would be if Seisuke hadn't gotten her out of that. She couldn't help the tears slipping down her face, it was doubtful that she would ever get over this pain in her lifetime. The only thing she had to look forward to were seeing Violet and meeting Seisuke again after her death. The whole issue with Susumu had all but slipped her mind now.* - Sun Oct 11 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stopped again after she passed the village near kirigakure, taking a seat so she could start a small fire. Luckily she'd brought enough food for the trip along with her, knowing her lack of cooking skills; she probably would've burned down the forest by accident. While she munched on the food, she had two of her clones keeping watch. It was her first time traveling and she knew to be overly cautious of her surroundings.

One mistake could leave her getting captured by bandits or worse. What a testament to Seisuke's memory that would've been, captured and killed by pathetic idiots. For the most part, she was left alone; if anyone happened to see her, they likely left her alone due to the presence of her clones. Anyone who could do that was probably a shinobi and a strong one at that.* - Sun Oct 11 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) walked past the two people and went straight for Violet.* - Sun Oct 11 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked towards the other two, since Violet was apparently catatonic.

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: I will be waiting for your return. - Sun Oct 11 18:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 11 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: I want you to focus soly on one thing at a time. - Sun Oct 11 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wandered into the village as a whole, there were indeed many bodies scattered around. The few survivers that were around had their heads bowed and their bodies hunched over. Even seeing all this, her face stayed stony and without any feeling. On the inside she was in turmoil, despite what she'd said to Sanoke, she felt some blame for this. With Seisuke gone, she had noone to turn to for comfort; she had nothing but herself and Violet.

As she walked she thought about what Kirie had asked her to do, bury only a single body. It seemed inefficient, by the time they'd buried everything it would weeks or even months later. She figured out why though, when she stopped by a pair; a couple laying in the rubble clutching each others hands. They'd been dead for a while and the survivors didn't even show any reaction to them. It was a sad world where this became the norm.

One at a time, she began digging through the rubble; pulling both bodies out at the same time, she didn't have the heart to seperate them. Even in death they clung to one another so tightly. It was easy to carry them to an empty area laying them on the ground so she could turn to dig the hole. It would be so easy just to use a jutsu, open up a hole in the ground and just throw them in. Yet, she wanted to do it by hand; the dead deserved respect and she would give it in any way she could.

She got to work, slamming a spade into the ground and throwing the damp shod into pile. The work was repetetive and monotonous, it helped take her mind of the destruction and the death of Seisuke. Even now, she felt as if there was a hole in her chest; a great void that had once been filled with light. It hadn't drained out, no it had been wrenched out and stomped into the ground along with Seisuke.

Her breath caught in her throat and she had to wipe the tears away from her eyes, pushing those emotions away so she could focus on the task at hand. The hole was growing, it was almost big enough to place the bodies in. A few more spade fulls did it, opening up the final resting place for this couple. It was nothing special, but she did her best for them. As gently as possible, she lowered the bodies into the hole, arranging them so they were still clasping each others hands.

To add a fianl touch, she added a few surviving flowers to the grave, placing them on the small gap between them. Once she was satisfied, she began filling the grave up once more; slowly covering the bodies from view. Even she couldn't help letting a little bit of emotion escape. Just a few months ago, everything had been perfect. She was with her soulmate and she was home safe, but now. Now it had to come this and there was nothing left.

She only had one last thing she could do, carry out the promise she'd made to Seisuke over a year ago. It would take a while, but one day Kirie would step down and Lera would step up. She would help bring kirigakure back to its former glory or even better. It was a long road, but one that was worth it. When she finally died, she'd be able to face Seisuke and know that she'd done him proud.

Once done with the hole, she knelt down in front of it and placed a stone on the overturned earth; carving a little message in with her Fuuton. The message read simply as 'together, even in death'. She stood back up, bowing her head in a moment of respect before heading off back to the mansion.* - Sun Oct 11 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm done - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Good. - Sun Oct 11 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Sun Oct 11 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Oct 11 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: She must know of my skill with Doton...to have the fight on water.. - Sun Oct 11 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) thinks: I've seen her use Doton before and she could somehow fly. - Sun Oct 11 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure - Sun Oct 11 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who's going first? - Sun Oct 11 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As you wish. - Sun Oct 11 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: shinjin - Sun Oct 11 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed a single handseal and created a total of five clones, each clone would stand in front of her while Lera thought of a plan of action. She could just brute force her way through it, similar to how she usualy would; but she wasn't sure of Kirie's abilities. If she went too far, Kirie could end up seriously hurt; or if she didn't go hard enough, she might just lose. For now, she took the safe option; each of her clones starting to spread out while Lera stepped backwards.* - Sun Oct 11 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Komajo - Sun Oct 11 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled as all her clones had now spread out quite evenly, each one directing their gaze towards Kirie. It seemed that Kirie was just as clueless about Lera
s abilities as she was about hers. If she thought Doton was the only thing she were capable of, then she was now in for quite the surprise. The original Lera would begin forming handseals and directing her gaze towards Kirie "You think thats all I can do?" if Kirie was unfortunate enough to look at her, she would be successfully captured within the genjutsu.

While this was happening, the clones would each clap at the same time; gathering chakra in their sternums and taking in deep breaths. When the exhaled, they released great gusts of wind; intending to slam against Kirie and send her sprawling.

If the genjutsu from earlier had been succesfful, then Kirie would now also see multitudes of clones rising from the water around her. Little did Lera know, was that she would be able to see immediately that they were fake with her Byakugan.* - Sun Oct 11 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled again when Kirie sank into the water, she'd just signed her own loss away. Lera would jump, attempting to take to the air so her clones could do their business. Each one ran through five handseals, gathering chakra into their palms. Simultaneously, every single clone slammed their hands into the water; sending electrical currents throughout it. Her Raiton wasn't paticularly skilled, but with the combination of five clones and the water; the end result was quite potent. Anything on or in the water would recieve the shock, which unfortunately included her clones.* - Sun Oct 11 20:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt the hair tug touch onto her ankles, raising her eyebrows at the technique. This was definitely a new one. Due to the nature of her flying technique, she was able to stay airborn; however Kirie also recieved that same token. With her hands bound as well, she could form no handseals and just burn the girls hair. The only thing she could do was end her jutsu and activate her Fire shroud, but seeing as it was only a spar; she just shook her head.

"Seems you got me."* - Sun Oct 11 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. - Sun Oct 11 20:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey there. - Mon Oct 12 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) found herself reminiscing now that she was finally back home. The village was in ruins, there still bodies waiting to be buried and the few people who were left hung their heads and shuffled about their daily business. Morale was low, non-existance even and all Lera could think about was how she should've returned sooner.

She couldn't help but feel a little responsible for these events, if she'd only been here then maybe things would've turned out differently. She knew they were wrong assumptions to make, if she had been here then she'd be dead as well. Every now and then throughout the village, she'd stop to help someone; whether they were struggling with a heavy object or if they simply looked starved.

One particular scene caught her attention, a small child barely over the age of five was huddled against the remains of a building. The poor child was just skin and bones, barely a shred of fat on her and she looked so defeated that even Lera couldn't help but stop. There was nothing she could do to save the child from her loss, so she did the only thing she could.

She took a seat next to the child, who barely reacted to her presence. In these sorts of situations, nobody wanted to be alone; so Lera decided to stay with her. After a few minutes the child had shifted closer to Lera, as if drawn by human contact and Lera opened up her arms. The girl inched her way into Lera's grasp, allowing herself to be wrapped up in a warm embrace. She didn't cry or show any sort of emotion, she just sat in Lera's arms.

The little girl was in a bad way, she was half starved; severely dehydrated, a few more hours at most and she'd probably die. The worst part was, the little girl probably knew it and still just sat and allowed it to happen. Lera couldn't let it happen though, life could be hard; so incredibly hard that it often seemed like it just wasn't worth it. Yet it was still worth living it, just for those few bright moments you shared with a loved one.

So Lera pulled away from the girl and looked her dead in the eye "Live, keep going. I know its hard, I know it sometimes seems pointless. But trust me, its worth it." the girl stared back at her for a while unblinking while she chewed through Lera's words "Why? Mama and papa are gone, home is gone, theres nothing left...you don't get it."

She ran her fingers through the girls greasy hair, suddenly feeling the urge to mother her. The girl thought that she didn't understand how she felt, so Lera showed her exactly how she felt right now. She let the tight hold on her sorrow slip, let the boneshaking sadness show hard in her eyes. The girl may have been young, but she understood the sadness; the tears dripping from Lera's eyes "You lost everything too...but you haven't given up?"

Lera nodded her head, not trusting herself to speak until she pulled her sorrow back in. The girl didn't seem to mind, she'd matured through loss in ways that a child should never have to. Instead of speaking, the little girl nestled herself back into Lera's arms and they remained quiet for a while. Until the girl finally spoke "I'm...really tired..." Alarm bells went off in Lera's head, the girl was on her last legs; if she didn't get food and water now...

She couldn't allow it to happen, so without a word she picked the girl up and ran with her to her home. It was fortunate that her house was so far into the outskirts of the village that it had survived the major damage. The inside was a mess but definitely still liveable. She lay the girl down on the sofa, taking a glass of water and attempting to feed it to her; to get her to drink something. It wasn't working at first and Lera almost thought she was going to lose her, but then by some self preservation instinct she started to take it in.

Lera wasn't a medic by any means, but she knew that the girl should drink a little bit at a time; so she stayed with her, forcing her to drink little gulps of water every few minutes. It didn't take long for the colour to start returning to her face, they'd gotten past the most dangerous part. She continued to force water down her throat, until the girl finally woke up; it took hours for it to work and Lera was exhausted. Yet she felt like she'd done something worthwhile.

The girl stared at her bleary eyed for a while, obviously still delirious; but after a while, the delerium finally cleared and she spoke up "You saved me...why? I don't want to live anymore.." Lera gave her a hard stare, not because she was angry but because she was sad "Because throwing away your life is disrespectful to those who gave theirs to save it. Do you want to know why I keep going? Its because when I finally die, i want to join the people I love on the other side and I want them to be proud of the life I lived."

She took this in for a while, keeping her dead gaze on Lera; yet there was just a tiny spark there, a spark that suggested she was taking on Lera's words "I'm hungry.." Lera let out a sigh of relief and rushed into the kitchen, rooting through the fridge until she found something the girl could eat. It was a simple rice ball and a few strips of cooked bacon she'd bought earlier. She took the food over to the girl who started to eat it, chewing as if she couldn't even taste it.

"You cooked these...?" Lera shook her head and let the girl rest against her while she ate "No..ah...I can't really cook, at all...honestly." the girl looked up at her mid-bite, she could swear there was the tiniest twinkle of amusement there "You can't cook? You won't make a very good mama then, i guess I'll have to make do." Lera could only stare at her with shocked bewilderment. A mother? Her? "Your mama? But I'm not..."

The girl cut her off before she could continue, poking her in the side with a bony finger "You saved me and made me live, that means you have to look after me now. Which makes you my mama." Lera could hardly believe it, she'd considered children with Seisuke yes but this was so sudden "But...I can't I'm a shinobi, I can die at any time and I'll be busy with missions and rebuilding. I don't have the time to look after you"

The girl finally finished her food and lay her head against Lera's chest, snuggling into the warmth "I can look after myself when you're not here...but when you are..." the sheer desperation in her voice made up Lera's mind, if the girl needed a mother then Lera would be it "Okay...I'm your mama then. I'll try to be here as often as I can okay?" the girl sank into Lera then and lowered her eyelids, a little sigh of relief escaping her lips "My name...June.." June then promptly fell asleep.

Lera ran her hand through Junes hair, wondering at how she just managed to get herself a daughter; she was barely even sixteen yet. Though when she thought of Hassans face when he found out, she couldn't help but smile a little. The smile quickly fell from her face, she was finding it difficult to produce smiles lately; so every smile was a gem. Lera unfortunately didn't have the time to hold the girl while she slept, there was training to be done after all.

Instead of just leaving her however, she created a clone and transfered the girl to it; letting it watch over her while she slept. Lera didn't leave the house however, she spent the next half an hour cleaning up. Anything that was broken she threw out the door, to be gotten rid of later. She re-arranged everything that had been displaced, doing what could have easily been done by another clone. She didn't want to rely on her clones to do her menial tasks, it held more meaning if she did it by hand.

Once the house was back in its neatly arranged order, she took a seat on the floor and crossed her legs in a meditative position. She could easily go out and practice her more destructive jutsu, but it was just as easy to meditate on it here and much less exhausting. She didn't even notice when she began to float off the ground, her Doton nature simply taking over while she meditated on a specific technique. There were two techniques in truth, she was intent on practicing the jutsu she'd aquired from Katsune, as well as Mud Wall.

In her Minds eye, she constructed a field filled with opponents and targets. They did nothing for the moment, merely standing and waiting for Lera to being in Earnest. It didn't take her very long, the moment she started forming handseals; her targets began to move. The training was much better with moving targets. Once the handseals were done, she stamped her foot on the ground and sent a ripple of chakra through it towards a single enemy. Spears of rock erupted from the ground, missing them by mere centimetres.

Lera had always been quite good at Doton techniques, which is one of the reason she used it more than her other elements. It also helped that many of the Doton type jutsu were not lethal in any way. Where as Fuuton and katon held many significantly lethal jutsu, several of which she had mastered. While she practiced, she could almost feel the latent potential rumbling under her skin. There was something more to her abilities, she could feel it; but not matter how hard she tried she just couldn't tap into it.

She thought back to a conversation she'd had with Sanoke and Kilm on elements. They'd spoken about elements that you absolutely had to be born with, elements that you could only create by combining two or more of the original elements. Lera didn't know if she had one of these special elements, in all honesty it was completely impossible to tell. Her Chakra paper had reacted oddly when her elements had been shown, but she'd always assumed that was due to her having more elements than the paper could comprehend.

Her paper had flashed brigthly before vanishing right before hers and her teachers eyes. The teacher had been shocked and had hastily tried to make up some sort of reason to explain the way her paper had reacted. Yet Lera now was starting to think there might have been something more to it.  If there was, she had to work hard to try and figure it out. So far, nothing concrete had surfaced; she wasn't skilled with all four of her elements, though she was close. Right now, she was equal with her Katon, Doton and Fuuton; with her Raiton far left behind.

That meant that she couldn't include Raiton in her experiments, but that didn't matter; so far every time she tried to combine an element with another, she would just lose focus or be completely incapable of doing it. Taking that in mind, she wanted to work more on her chakra control; with better control she would surely be able to do at least something. Though Lera was deep in meditation and didn't notice, it was at this moment that June woke up looking around the room with blurry eyes.

June had lost almost everything, her life probably would have been included in that list if this kind but hurt girl hadn't shown up. June had always been quite clever for her age, but even with that she just couldn't understand Lera. She'd lost everything just the same as her, so how could she go out of her way to help someone like June. No matter how much lera said she did it because she wanted her loved ones to be proud, June couldn't help but think that the girl was just inherently kind. Even if she was broken on the inside, that kindness was still there.

The clone she was laid on was fast asleep, June just assumed it was the real one having failed to notice the original sat floating a few inches off the ground just out of sight. For now, she took a real look at Lera; without that ever present sorrowfull look on her face, June noted that she was actually quite pretty, maybe even beautiful. Even the Tatoo's that covered her arms and back were nice to look at, she could understand why someone might like her.  June was drawn by something else though, the feeling that this girl could love with everything she had and do it for an eternity.

It was with a shock that she realised why Lera was so broken inside. It wasn't because she'd lost everything, but because she'd lost her love...or it was better to say her love had been shattered. She couldn't ever imagine anyone wanting to give someone like Lera up, so she must have given everything she had to someone and then that person died. Ironically, June wasn't sympathetic or at all sorry for Lera's loss; she'd lost just as much if not more. Yet, she wanted to help Lera just like she'd helped her.

With a light yawn, June took a look around the room; noticing that it was much neater and tidier than before, she wondered how Lera had managed to tidy everything up without her even noticing, maybe she would be a good mama after all. Now that she'd had a proper look around the room, she noticed something odd; the top a head peeking out from behind the sofa. When she leaned up, she had to stop herself from crying out in surprise. There was another Lera, how could there be two of them. To make matters worse, the second one was somehow floating.

The clone took this moment to wake up, noting the look of surprise on Junes face with a soft chuckle "Shhh, don't worry its a shinobi technique. We sometimes do that when we're meditating, we don't even notice." June stared open mouthed at the clone for a while, trying to process what was happening "So...you're saying...shinobi can make copies of themselves and levitate?" the clone slowly pulled itself up, putting an arm around Junes shoulders "No, not exactly. Copying ourselves is a basic technique, but very few people can make a real copy. Most of the time its an illusion. As for levitating, well...I could explain it if you want."

June didn't bother speaking, instead just nodding for the clone to explain "Well, there are five elements that shinobi can use; there are some special and unique ones too, but I won't get into that. The elements are Doton, Fuuton, Katon, Raiton and Suiton. Most people are commonly born with one or two of these elements, though its possible to train in the use of others. Every now and then, someone is born with more of the elements than normal. I for example was born with four." June wasn't exactly getting the explenation she wanted, but she listened intently; this stuff was fascinating.

"Most of the time you can classify an element with some very simple descriptions, such a fire being hot or Earth being hard. However, with some skill you can move past that and start to diversify the element. For example; Fuuton can be both blunt and sharp, depending on how you utilise it. Anyway, onto how we fly" June nodded enthusiastically, her attention was rapt on Lera; maybe she should look into how to become a shinobi "Like I said before, elements can vary greatly in how they work; Doton more so than any other. Not only can I create hardened rock, but i can also make softened mud."

"In order to fly we utilise something completely different, an abstract concept involving Doton. When someone thinks earth, they may often ascosciate it with gravity and weight. The earth is heavy so thats only natural. WE utilise that concept to decrease my own weight exponentially, to the poin that I'm not longer tethered to the ground and can move through the sky freely. We can also extend this to whatever I'm touching, so if you're not afraid of heights i can happily take you up one day." June took a few moments to take all that in, being a shinobi was quite complicated; Lera had to be some kind of genius to know all that.

"I would...really like that. You think...I could be a shinobi one day? I think I want to." the clone nodded its head, giving the little girl a squeeze "You're very clever for your age, We don't think its impossible. Its a lot of work though...We think the academy will be out of commision for a while, so We can teach you the basics here...just as soon as we get some meet on you bones." at that moment the original lowered back to the floor and opened her eyes, standing up with a yawn. She looked at the clone and June sat on the sofa and dispersed it, causing June to jump and Lera to gain knowledge of their entire conversation.

"A shinobi hm...Its not a safe life, but its a worthy one. Are you sure? there are much safer ways to live" June recovered from her shock and stood up, nodding defiantly "I want to do it, so I can be like you." Lera didn't think it was possible to love again, but this girl was very quickly growing on her; she reminded her of herself, that same defiance and determination to push forwards "Alright, I won't stop you. But as my clone said, you need to get some meat on those bones first and a shower too I think. Come on, to the bathroom" June just rolled her eyes, but followed Lera into the shower area...a bath would be nice.* - Mon Oct 12 13:10:36 2015
