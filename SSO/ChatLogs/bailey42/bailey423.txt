<br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But well...He said he wasn't going to take anymore students after me. - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good luck though - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's fine, I respect his decisions, I'll just have to find another way then. - Mon Sep 14 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But what about you? - Mon Sep 14 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What are your goals? - Mon Sep 14 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Me...? - Mon Sep 14 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm... - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good question. - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've never really thought about it...except to get stronger and make friends. - Mon Sep 14 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see - Mon Sep 14 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I spent so long without friends...I guess I just wanted to be noticed. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's hard to miss you. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...Hehehe~ Thankyou. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That means more to me than you realise. - Mon Sep 14 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's the truth, And I'll be rooting for you to accomplish your goals. - Mon Sep 14 13:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thank you and I hope you can become a good king. - Mon Sep 14 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I hope so too. - Mon Sep 14 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Believing is the first step. - Mon Sep 14 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I think you will, you can do it. - Mon Sep 14 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll try my best to meet those expecatations then, Haha. - Mon Sep 14 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat up and leaned in to put her head on his shoulder.

"Yeah...yeah it is, maybe...maybe thats my goal..to protect this place."* - Mon Sep 14 13:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) decided to take the plunge, shifting her position to give him a kiss on the cheek.

"You'll make a great king someday, I know it."

As soon as she did it, she leaned away again; blushing furiously. She may have overstepped her bounds, after all...what was a mere genin to a prince?* - Mon Sep 14 14:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Mon Sep 14 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked up as the food finally arrived, which was good because she had no idea how to break the awkward silence. Her face was still a foreign shade of crimson, much the same as Seisuke's; he would probably be just as glad as her for the distraction. Without a word she tucked into the food, eating quickly but with surprising ettiquette.* - Mon Sep 14 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Why...Am I stuttering..? - Mon Sep 14 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Why am I...So flustered? - Mon Sep 14 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) broke her gaze away from the food to look at Seisuke; she smiled at him finding it out how she of all people was the one who kept her composure.

"Its good, thank you~"* - Mon Sep 14 14:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Am I...making you nervous...? - Mon Sep 14 14:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y---No... - Mon Sep 14 14:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe...Its a little odd. - Mon Sep 14 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My heart...its going crazy. Yet I feel really calm. - Mon Sep 14 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Strange huh. - Mon Sep 14 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y-Yeah.... - Mon Sep 14 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: My heart is.....beating....So fast...It feels like It'll jump out of my chest.... - Mon Sep 14 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm glad I'm not the only one. - Mon Sep 14 14:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's o-oddly comforting... - Mon Sep 14 14:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You...you're really nice. - Mon Sep 14 14:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why does everyone...say those things about you? Before...they said you were saying bad things. - Mon Sep 14 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm not sure. - Mon Sep 14 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Although...I'm used to being disliked...It comes with the job. - Mon Sep 14 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Mon Sep 14 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...maybe you should show them your nice? - Mon Sep 14 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I tried, and they insulted my family, my goal, my people. - Mon Sep 14 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...don't really know much about the Gezo...heck I don't really know anything. - Mon Sep 14 14:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But...instead of lashing out. - Mon Sep 14 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe you should just explain your ideals. - Mon Sep 14 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll....try. - Mon Sep 14 14:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It just hurts, when people make baseless assumptions. - Mon Sep 14 14:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know... - Mon Sep 14 14:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put her head back on his shoulder.

"Still is...this okay...? I mean...you're a prince...and i'm just an ordinary genin."* - Mon Sep 14 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) visibly gulped, she couldn't imagine being anything more than friends with someone who could only be described as royalty. Yet here she was with a Prince of the Gezo.

"I...I guess it doesn't."* - Mon Sep 14 14:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm okay with it...more than okay with it. - Mon Sep 14 14:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: R-Really? - Mon Sep 14 14:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Definitely... - Mon Sep 14 14:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm glad.. - Mon Sep 14 15:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehehe. I never thought this would happen. - Mon Sep 14 15:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Neither did I.. - Mon Sep 14 15:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its...kinda funny if you think about it. - Mon Sep 14 15:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Funny? - Mon Sep 14 15:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: From my perspective. - Mon Sep 14 15:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lowly genin girl and a prince...heh. - Mon Sep 14 15:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled again and put her arms around his waist.

"Thats just who I am, doesn't matter how much money my parents have; I'm still just a genin and...I'm proud of it."* - Mon Sep 14 15:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Thankyou. - Mon Sep 14 15:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So...Lera...Do you have anything...You enjoy doing..? - Mon Sep 14 15:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: For sure. - Mon Sep 14 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But...I don't do much else besides train. - Mon Sep 14 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The job is my life I guess? - Mon Sep 14 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What about you...? - Mon Sep 14 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I mean...Up until this point, being a Prince and training to achieve my goal has been my life as well.. - Mon Sep 14 15:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So I guess we're on the same boat, But I do enjoy swimming a lot. - Mon Sep 14 15:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Swimming...I've never done it. - Mon Sep 14 15:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Me and water never got along. Being the only element I don't have... - Mon Sep 14 15:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We....Could try it, one day if you'd like...---You have Four Elemental affinities? - Mon Sep 14 15:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm yeah - Mon Sep 14 15:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I would like that. - Mon Sep 14 15:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: The more I learn about you...The more amazing and unique you are. - Mon Sep 14 15:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Th-thanks... - Mon Sep 14 15:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But really, I'm not that special. - Mon Sep 14 15:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Extremely special to me. - Mon Sep 14 15:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) squeezed him a little bit tighter, she'd learned what it was like to have friends and what it was like to have a father...but could she...?

"I...you're special to me too."* - Mon Sep 14 15:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I think...I think this might be one of the best days of my life.. - Mon Sep 14 15:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And....of mine. - Mon Sep 14 15:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I could just...sit here like this forever. - Mon Sep 14 15:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So could I...being this close to you, It's weird...The more I think about you...The faster my heart races. - Mon Sep 14 15:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Have you ever...felt like this before...? - Mon Sep 14 15:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know I haven't.. - Mon Sep 14 15:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I haven't...This is all foreign to me. - Mon Sep 14 15:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So we're both wading in uncharted terrortory. - Mon Sep 14 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then I'm happy, I get to explore this uncharted land with you. - Mon Sep 14 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I wonder...what the others will say. - Mon Sep 14 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I don't care what they think.. - Mon Sep 14 15:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...no, neither do I. - Mon Sep 14 15:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That' - Mon Sep 14 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's good.. - Mon Sep 14 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...*sigh* - Mon Sep 14 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I really want to stay here. - Mon Sep 14 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Something...wrong? - Mon Sep 14 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But...I'm about to pass out. - Mon Sep 14 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see... - Mon Sep 14 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) leaned up to give him another quick kiss on the cheek.* - Mon Sep 14 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took the hand though she stumbled a bit when she got to her feet, training none stop was reall exhausting.

"Mhm, Later."* - Mon Sep 14 15:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thanks.. - Mon Sep 14 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My house is that way. - Mon Sep 14 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pointed towards one of the larger houses in one of the more 'upper' areas.* - Mon Sep 14 15:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...I told you, They send me money *yawn* - Mon Sep 14 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) fumbled with her keys to unlock the door, assuming he would carry her inside. Her house was quite open on the inside, to make room for the multitude of book cases that seemed to cover every wall. At glance, there could be hundreds if not thousands of books in here.

"Bedroom...over there."* - Mon Sep 14 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) would be asleep literally the moment her head hit the pillow, completely exhausted as she was.* - Mon Sep 14 15:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: He'd teach me knowledge regarding the Gezo. - Tue Sep 15 09:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And the basics of Combat. - Tue Sep 15 09:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Congtats~ - Tue Sep 15 09:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Are you a Private by any chance Lera? - Tue Sep 15 09:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No...no I'm not, I don't have any rank in Gezo. - Tue Sep 15 09:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lowly genin remember?~ - Tue Sep 15 09:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You aren't lowly~ - Tue Sep 15 09:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thanks~ - Tue Sep 15 09:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If I was able to pass the Private Exam I'm sure you could with a little studying though. - Tue Sep 15 09:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Er...I dunno...i've never really been interested in those sorts of responsabilities... - Tue Sep 15 09:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Actually...this is the first time I heard you could take an exam for it. - Tue Sep 15 09:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I can understand. - Tue Sep 15 09:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm...Really? - Tue Sep 15 09:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...I said before right...? I know pretty much nothing about Gezo. - Tue Sep 15 09:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: True...How'd you sleep yesterday? - Tue Sep 15 09:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Like the dead. - Tue Sep 15 09:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In a very not literal sense. - Tue Sep 15 09:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm sure you feel better though, What kind of training were you doing? - Tue Sep 15 09:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I was learning a new jutsu....a really really difficult one. - Tue Sep 15 09:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Did you manage to grasp the concept? - Tue Sep 15 09:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrmmm....good question. - Tue Sep 15 09:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm.... - Tue Sep 15 09:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh yeah, You told me you had four affinities earlier....Which are they? - Tue Sep 15 09:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Everything except for water. - Tue Sep 15 09:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gulped and linked her pinky with his, giving it a shake for good measure.

"Hah...guess I better train harder"* - Tue Sep 15 10:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I didn't think it would be this nice... - Tue Sep 15 10:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) went from healthy glow to beetroot red in aproximately 0.2 seconds. She couldn't help stutter when she replied.

"Th-thanks."* - Tue Sep 15 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 10:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I don't know what to say.. - Tue Sep 15 10:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: What do I do...? - Tue Sep 15 10:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I uh... - Tue Sep 15 10:27:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I..uhm...where would I go? - Tue Sep 15 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I mean...we're at war...I shouldn't really leave.. - Tue Sep 15 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I meant after the war.... - Tue Sep 15 10:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We could go and see another Village or just nature itself, a small vavation...Of sorts. - Tue Sep 15 10:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...would really like that. - Tue Sep 15 10:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: T-Then I'll see w-what I can do.. - Tue Sep 15 10:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put a head on his should again.

"I feel like all I'm doing is thanking you..."* - Tue Sep 15 10:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're....giving me a lot of things. - Tue Sep 15 10:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked at him closely, he did look a little off; not that she would know how to comfort him.

"Maybe you don't need to toughen up"* - Tue Sep 15 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I mean...think about it - Tue Sep 15 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If war doesn't shake you up...then...well, its not a good thing. - Tue Sep 15 12:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Nothing much. Just rescued a friend from Zetsumo's grasp. - Tue Sep 15 13:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Not too bad. - Tue Sep 15 13:33:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: There are people more of an hot-head than me. - Tue Sep 15 13:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Lke me~ - Tue Sep 15 13:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll stay on guard then. - Tue Sep 15 13:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: If this is all the more notable shinobi they've got then the Kenryoku has a number advantage. - Tue Sep 15 13:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Going to be troublesome. - Tue Sep 15 13:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Kilm. - Tue Sep 15 13:48:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Then you must understand that I wish to interrogate your mind.. - Tue Sep 15 13:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As long as you don't ask stupid questions like Beth did. - Tue Sep 15 13:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm. - Tue Sep 15 13:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Hrng. - Tue Sep 15 13:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Very well, come with me. - Tue Sep 15 13:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Tue Sep 15 13:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hello, Lera~. - Tue Sep 15 13:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey~ - Tue Sep 15 13:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took the hug with a smile and nodded.

"Sure, I can do some training."* - Tue Sep 15 13:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Where at~? - Tue Sep 15 13:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind. Lead away. - Tue Sep 15 13:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Here? - Tue Sep 15 13:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: This should be good for training, Right? - Tue Sep 15 13:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, I guess. - Tue Sep 15 13:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What kind of training? - Tue Sep 15 13:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Any kind you'd prefer? - Tue Sep 15 13:59:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrm. - Tue Sep 15 14:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Is there anything you need to practice in paticular? - Tue Sep 15 14:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Some Ninjutsu is all. - Tue Sep 15 14:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, the same for me...though I can't use those in spars. - Tue Sep 15 14:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm.... - Tue Sep 15 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm not to sure then. - Tue Sep 15 14:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...well, we could just practice our jutsu in our own way. - Tue Sep 15 14:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I suppose we could~! - Tue Sep 15 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe you could teach me some of yours and I can teach you some of mine? - Tue Sep 15 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats if....we don't already know each others jutsu. - Tue Sep 15 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh wow, That does sound fun. But I forsee that being the problem.. - Tue Sep 15 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But I'll try. - Tue Sep 15 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. - Tue Sep 15 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, what elements do you have? - Tue Sep 15 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Fire, Wind and Lightning. - Tue Sep 15 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrmm...and uh, what jutsu do you know for those? - Tue Sep 15 14:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Uh....Flame Thrower, Wind Release: Godly Wind from the Mountains, Chakra Flow, and Fireball Jutsu. - Tue Sep 15 14:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay~ I can teach you two fuuton jutsu and a Raiton jutsu. - Tue Sep 15 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you teach me chakra flow and Flamethrower. - Tue Sep 15 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Deal...But I feel like you're getting less out of this. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its okay, I don't mind at all. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You sure? - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: hm! - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Alright then. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How about...we each demonstrate one and then we can both learn and teach at the same time. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sounds perfect. - Tue Sep 15 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Can I see Chakra flow first? - Tue Sep 15 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And uh, which one of mine do you want first? - Tue Sep 15 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Surprise me~ - Tue Sep 15 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned to the water and decided on the jutsu to teach him first, probably the most useful of the three; at least in her eyes. Whilst watching his own demonstration, she formed five handseals and drew back her fist. Chakra gathered on her palm, just waiting for release until she finally thrust the palm forward. A huge gust of wind blasted outwards, smashing into the water and throwing it high into the air.

"Great breakthrough is extremely similar to Godly wind, however you release the wind in one great big blast rather than a steady wind. Simple right?"* - Tue Sep 15 14:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. Its really similar to what Hassan-sensei taught me, except that was in my fingers instead of an object. - Tue Sep 15 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm...? Your fingers? - Tue Sep 15 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sounds like an interesting technique. - Tue Sep 15 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm...Its one of the ones he told me I'm not allowed to teach. - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Because its very dangerous. - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see, he must believe in you a lot to teach you it then. - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're lucky~ - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Although, its also his personal technique... - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, I hope so~ - Tue Sep 15 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slipped a hand into her pocket, retrieving a single kunai to use for the jutsu. After learning how to use Hell stab, this looked like childs play to her; though like with every other jutsu she learned, it would be taken very seriously. Before trying the jutsu outright, she glanced to the side at Seisuke who was also practicing his jutsu. She truly felt lucky to have met him, despite what other people said and her original assumptions about him; he was one of the nicest people she'd ever met.

Eventually she dragged herself away from those thoughts, ignoring the blush that crept up to her face. For a moment, she simply stared down at the weapon intently; imagining it as an extended part of her body. This idea had come to her when watching Hassan use the same technique, he'd treated the object as just another part of his body; which probably meant it was the way to go. Once she had a good feel for the kunai, she closed her eyes and imagine the weapon clearly in her hand.

Chakra began flowing from her hand into the weapon, causing the blade to slowly grow brighter in her minds eye. On the outside, it looked to be no different. Until faint blue whisps began rising from the metal. Eventually, chakra enveloped the weapon; forming a woblly and unstable aura around it. It was different to what Hassan had shown her and what Seisuke had shown. Though she'd used Fuuton instead of Katon. For a few moments more, she stared at the weapon before letting the chakra fade away, turning to watch Seisuke finish his practice.* - Tue Sep 15 14:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took several steps away from Seisuke, to be sure he wouldn't get caught up in the wide range jutsu she was going to demostrate. Like with the wind jutsu, she formed the five needed handseals and channeled chakra to her palms. Only this time, both hands started to crackle with a hidden energy. Though her skill with Raiton was relatively bad, the sheer shock value of this jutsu was quite useful.

To finish off the demonstration, she slammed both palms down on the ground and released the Raiton in a wave; tearing through the earth before vanishing entirely.

"Someone who's good with the element could probably do a whole lot more damage, but I'm still not very good at it. Either way, you just have to focus the chakra into both palms and turn it into Raiton. Make sure to coat your hands in a thin layer of chakra so you don't shock yourself though. From there, you can release it into whatever surface...or person you want."* - Tue Sep 15 14:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh...I forgot! I actually have one more Katon jutsu I can teach you as well. If you want. - Tue Sep 15 14:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched the demonstration of his jutsu, listening to his brief explanation. It really did look like an extremely simple technique, in the end it was just a much weaker version of Grand fireball; which she'd learned and mastered quite some time ago. That being said, she was just as skilled with Katon as she were with Raiton; which is to say...not very skilled at all. So she at least expected the jutsu to take a few attempts to get it right.

In reality, she just needed to combine the effects of her Fire Run technique and a weaker version of Great fireball; which could either be really easy, or extremely hard. Catching herself, she realised that as per usual, she was overthinking it far too much. Better to just jump in and try to jutsu out; in the end she could either fail or succeed.

Following that thought, she made the single seal that Seisuke had shown her and started to channel her chakra inwards. She used a similar technique in spitting the fire out to Fire run. Bracing her tongue against her bottom teeth and letting the chakra roll across her tongue and out of her mouth. Fire flew from her mouth and...went approximately 10 centimetres before sputtering out on the floor.

Frowning slightly, she figured that there was too little power in that; in her attempt to make it weaker than Fireball, she ended up making it weaker than it needed to be. The mistake was an easy one to correct however, she just needed to bolster the jutsu with a little more chakra and set it off once more. This time, the fire came from her mouth in a steady stream; flying several metres like Seisuke had and landing in the ocean. It was obviously weaker than Seisukes, but power would come with practice.* - Tue Sep 15 15:02:36 2015

"But every part of you is special."* - Tue Sep 15 15:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stayed deadly still for several moments, staring right into his eyes; she seemed to be trying to pluck up the courage to do something, but couldn't quite bring herself to do it.* - Tue Sep 15 15:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started to breathe a little faster, her eyes closing and her lips parting; she waited for him to finally kiss her, but when it didn't come she opened up her eyes again and rested them on his.

"Oh just kiss me already" with that, she initiated the kiss; screw the consequences.* - Tue Sep 15 15:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laid her back on the cold grass, staring up at the cloudy sky. Her expression was an ureadable tumult of emotions; all seeming to fall over her face one after the other. She could barely understand the emotions she felt, the feelings she couldn't seem to repress.

She had kissed him, actually kissed him herself; not the other way around. It was so stupid of her to even think of it, never mind actually do it. He was a prince, a future king, a ruler. What was she? Just an ordinary genin with no rank or nobility behind her. What business did she have kissing a prince of the Gezo, when she held no rank with them at all?

Even so, despite all this; she just couldn't help herself with him. Every time he looked at her with thos big blue eyes. Every time he smiled that kind smile at her. Her heat would just melt away, taking with it any meager resistence she could put up against it. She couldn't understand the feelings that ran through her; but whether she understood the feelings or not, every fibre of her being told her to act on them.

Slowly, she brought fingers up to her temples, try to rub away the headache brought on by her chaotic thoughts. There were only two ways to make herself feel better and searching for Seisuke wasn't an option for her right now. So she took the second option, a long intense training seeion would definitely take her mind off things.

With a great huff, she forced herself to stand and face the water. There were a great deal of jutsu that she wanted to practice, the most important of which probably being her Fuuton jutsu that Hassan had been teaching. She didn't believe for a moment that someone like Hassan would die in this war, despite his claims to the contrary. So she would practice as hard as she could to master his jutsu, so he would keep teaching her more.

With that thought on her mind, she started with the latest jutsu he'd been teaching her. Not only would the jutsu be immensely powerful and useful if it was mastered. The act of actually mastering the jutsu would gain her more experience in several fields, especially her chakra control. The jutsu itself was Fuuton chakra control on such a tight focus, that just performing the jutsu successfully was a difficult thing to accomplish.

With a grin smile, she held her fingers outwards and formed them into a blade. She could already see the jutsu in her minds eye, an impossibly sharp sword of wind all focused onto the tips of those four fingers. Seeing it and actually doing it however were two very different things.

It took all of her concentration just to focus so much chakra into such a tight space. However the results were a spectacular thing to behold. To the untrained eye, her fingers would appear no different at all. Yet, she could see the tell tale whisps of vapour, faint outlines of concentrated wind on the tips of her fingers. Sharpened to such a degree of impossibility; that no defense could not be pierced by it.

She knew for a fact, that if she were to just push her fingers against the nearby tree; then it would as if the tree wasn't there at all. Her hand would sink into it just as easily as if she would pushing it through water. She knew that with a great deal more practice, then she could likely bring the entire tree down with just one swipe of her hand.

Eventually, she walked over to the tree in question and, with her hand as a deadly blade, she swung. The tree made a loud cracking sound, as the tips of her fingers left a deep groove in the bark. She still got an annoying stinging sensation in her fingers, them having performed a feat that fingers were not nomaly capable of, but that was just another reason to practice even more.

After a few more swings, she finally let the chakra drop and leak away. Her fingers had started to bleed at some point during her practice, the pain was annoying but not impossible to ignore.  She probably would have kept going if not for the fact that it would break her hand, a hand she sorely needed for using handseals.

With her fingers, for the moment, out of order. She decided to move onto the next jutsu in her repetoire, a jutsu she was significantly better with when compared to Hell stab. Though this was just as lethal if not more so. Though Hell stab had a higher destrutive capability, this jutsu had range and for a long ranged Elementalist like her; range was extremely important to have.

Standing before the tree, now dubbed as her practice post. She would form a sting of handseals, moving through them much faster than she'd use to. It was good she'd shown significant improvement in that area as well. In just a few moments, her chakra was moulded and she lifted her head back to draw in the biggest breath she was capable of.

Inside her lungs, the air mixed with her chakra; moulding it further into a fuuton jutsu that was just ready to be unleashed. Then with a single violent exhalation, she released the air and shot it forwards towards the tree. Instead of just a gust of wind, a large number of tiny bullet flew forwards; promising destruction on the tree.

The bullets slammed into the bark of the tree, sending shards of it off at almost every angle. She inspected the damage done with a smile, though it wasn't as much as it could be. There were several small holed burrowed into the tree, deep enough to show that a human may have been severely if not fatally wounded by the jutsu. It was enough for her, at least for now; enough to show that she could kill...if she had to.* - Wed Sep 16 09:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared Yan up and down, it was hard to tell if he was strong or not; the only real way to find out was just throw something at him and see how he took it. For now though, she went with her usual tactics; forming a singular handseal and having three Doton clones rise to stand between them. The usual tactic was usually a good one, at least if she wasn't trying to hurt someone. So while the clones blocked Yan's path, she prepared herself for her next jutsu.* - Wed Sep 16 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ..... - Wed Sep 16 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) dropped her preperations almost immediately, the genjutsu was useless if he had clones to watch his back and she didn't yet know if they were stronger than her own clones. Seeing how they were created, she realised they were exact mimics of her own. So instead of trying to fight back, her clones would simply lurch forwards and attempt to hold his clones long enough for Lera's jutsu to go through.

The jutsu in question had her quickly forming five handseals, concentrating chakra into her hands where they began to crackle and pulsate with Lightning. As soon as it were ready, she slammed her palms down onto the ground and sent arcs of Raiton through the earth. It was her hope that both hers and his clones would be destroyed by their natural weakness. Though they would soak up enough of the jutsu to stop it from ever reaching the original Yan.

"Your move~"* - Wed Sep 16 12:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) frowned the moment she noticed the clones survival and the handseals they were forming; she knew that jutsu well enough to move out of the way. With a grimace, she sent her chakra downards; softening the earth beneath her feet into a fine sand. She quickly sank into it, finding safety underground. However, from the jutsu Yan had shown so far; he was most likely capable of performing the very same time.

So for now, she began swimming backwards; intending to move as far as she could in the shortest amount of time.* - Wed Sep 16 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) winced as she felt the clones wink into existence above ground, she could think of one way to destroy them entirely; though whether it worked or not was a different thing entirely. Whilst still underground, she started attaching explosive tags to her kunai; arming the tags and keeping them within easy reach, she had to do this quickly before the tags went off.

So without further ado, she swam upwards and popped back above ground; within moments the tags were in the air; falling directly in front of her while she formed another five handseals. Just as they passed infront of her, she flung out her palm; sending a great gust of wind into them. If all worked correctly, the tags would fly right for the clones at high velocity; where they would promptly explode.* - Wed Sep 16 13:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) jumped backwards a little bit, assuming that as well as stopping her explosive tags from going off; he would also be destroying his clones. Riding on that fact and with the hope it wouldn't reach far enough to hit her. She started forming more handseals while moving forwards, chakra began channeling into her lungs while she drew the biggest breath she could manage.

With every bit of force possible, she spewed out the air from her lungs; not shooting a gust, but instead a multitude of small bullets. She had enough control now to not cause serious damage if they hit him, instead he'd be left with several stinging bruises.* - Wed Sep 16 14:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gritted her teeth at his impromptu defense, it wouldnt't surprise her if one or two of the bullets had gone through; though that wasn't much of an attack. Though now, she would take advantage of him blocking his own view of things; what better way to hit someone then to cover both the shield and the one who hid behind it.

Smiling grimly, she noted that this was the first time she would actually use this directly on a target; having never done it for fear of harming someone. Either way, she formed the five handseals and gathered the chakra in her breath once more. Then, using her two hands as a sort of funnel; she breathed the air out, igniting it as it left her lips. Hopefully, both Yan's clones and Yan himself would then be enveloped by a huge ball of fire.* - Wed Sep 16 14:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) saw nothing of what happened to the original in the wake of her fireball, only that one of his clones had managed to escape. When the fireball cleared, Yan was no-where to be seen; which meant he had used shunshin to go somewhere or he'd sunk under ground. She considered him dissapearing underground as the more likely options, as she couldn't see him anywhere nearby.

The clone however was going to prove an issue, she couldn't use an explosive tag due to using them all earlier; so the best option was attempt to destroy it before tackling the original. So she jumped to the side, forming handseals and pointing her body towards the clone. If Yan was indeed underground using the jutsu she thought he was using, then  he would feel everything she did and would likely know what was coming next

As she slammed her palms down on the ground, she sent another arc of lightning along it; intending to destroy the clone. If Yan had indeed been directly beneath her, then he would be in for a rough ride.* - Wed Sep 16 14:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) frowned as she looked over to him, noticing the seals he used as ones used for clone jutsu. Clones indeed did come rushing at her, though they weren't paticularly fast; nor did they seem too dangerous. However with this number, she was at a clear disadvantage with only one real option availlable to her. Before she was taken down by a clone, she softened the mud beneath her feet and sank into it.

Once underground she saw, or felt, almost immediately what had happened. She could not feel the clones on the ground above her, which either meant it was something she'd never seen before; or it was a genjutsu she was known to use herself. Even knowing it was a genjutsu, she kept herself underground; moving slowly to the right while she thought of a plan. For once in her life she was actually starting to run a little low on chakra, not low enough to cause her issue; but this was the first time she'd had to use so much.* - Wed Sep 16 15:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: You're attacking with moles..... Lera kick his ass already! -omit- - Wed Sep 16 15:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared at the sudden appearence of a mole, she had never heard of anything quite like this before; though she could not sense the creature in the slightest. Logic and intelligence told her it was still a genjutsu; but that didn't mean she wanted to share her space with it. So instead she focused on the one thing she could feel above ground besides their audience.

Hoping to just ignore the genjutsu completely, she popped up out of the ground; intending to come up right next to Yan, forming her handseals as she did. If all went as planned, she would thrust a single palm towards him; intending to quite literally blow him away with a gale.* - Wed Sep 16 15:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) found herself being shoved and stumbleing her jutsu interrupted, at this rate she was completlely vulenerable and could even be defeated if she didn't do something react. One part, the part of her than wanted to win ignored all consequences and went for the jutsu that she'd been told not to use yet. She attempted to reach out and grab his collar before she fell. If successful, she'd pull him ontop of her and extend her fingers to the side of his neck.

If the boy had any sense of self-preservation, he'd feel the danger behind those fingers; although she would never actually use them to harm him. With her chakra and stamina so low however, she could keep this jutsu up for no more than a few seconds. Enough to say; "I...win" before promptly passing out.* - Wed Sep 16 15:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wasn't injured in the slightest, just really really tired.* - Wed Sep 16 15:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: She's pretty strong. - Wed Sep 16 15:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) flung her flames across the water, setitng steam to rise as they touched the liquid. She continued to breathe the flames from in between her fingers, until her breath caught and she was forced to stop and breathe. She was intent on practicing everything she had to practice, especially after that loss to Yan yesterday. She'd never been so exhausted after a fight before and he...he was full of energy. There was still so much progress to make, so much strength to gain.

Grunting ever so slightly, she formed the single handseal again and reproduced the jutsu. It was the weakest of her Katon techniques and recently taught to her by Seisuke. Flames spilled from her mouth, traveling in a straight line before arcing down into the water again. Her katon jutsu were only really useful if they were combined with Fuuton, however as it was now it simply took her too long to use both jutsu in combat. Though not useful, it wasn't very effective and left her open for far too long.

With a sigh, she let the jutsu drop, settling in to practice another jutsu. The jutsu this time was the shunshin technique, she'd been neglecting to practice it lately; though after seeing Jin use it she realised there was still quite a lot of practice needed for the jutsu. Then maybe it would be more useful in battle.* - Thu Sep 17 08:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Hmmm.... I haven't even touched the field of battle yet, and I was chuunin before then. I did see his battle with Lera, so its no surprise that hes useful there. - Thu Sep 17 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys, Got any missions needed doing? - Thu Sep 17 12:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned away from the mansion and the scene of Tethys promoting a shinobi to chuunin, a shinobi who wasn't even from the village. She would be lieing if she said it didn't bother her a bit, though she knew that Tethys would know what he was doing. If only to make herself feel better, she left the area with the intent of more training; in this case she would spend some time mastering the Katon chakra flow technique.

Before starting, she set up a small area where fire wouldn't spread and cause any damage; she didn't want to lose the weapons used for the technique in the water, so this was the next best thing. Once she'd made a ring of stones and a small pile of wood in the centre of it, she pulled out a holster full of shuriken placing it on the ground by her feet.

She took it slowly at first, holding just one of the shuriken in her hand before channeling her chakra to it. The shuriken remained still and passive for a few moments before it abruptly burst into flames. Despite the fact she was holding a flaming shuriken; she felt no pain nor did the flames burn her at all. Though she knew that if anyone else were to touch it they would immediately be burned.

She stared at the flames for a few more moments before drawing back an arm and then throwing it forwards. Her aim was completely average, no better than a genin fresh out of the academy; though it was good enough to hit a simple pile of wood. As soon as the shuriken made contact with the wood, it burst into flames; burning through a portion of it before dampness and her lower than average Katon put it out.

Still, she was pleased with the technique; although it wasn't paticularly powerful; it could catch someone off guard with ease. If she also threw those shuriken into a gale of wind, the inferno that ensued would be impressive indeed. For now though, it wasn't quite enough; so she bent back down and picked up a second shuriken, quickly coating the thing in fire.

She would only be able to keep this up for a certain amount of time; even if she had so much chakra, there would eventually come a point where even she ran out. With a frown, she thought back to her spar with Yan; her chakra had almost run completely dry, yet Yan seemed to have barely even touched his. She'd never met another genin with more chakra than her, to see it Yan was a little impressive...and it did make her a little jealous.

With a slight nod to herself, she realised that for the first time in her life she had a rival. It had always been that she was either too strong for another genin or too weak to fight the Chuunins and jounins. Finally, she had someone who she could aim for; someone to beat. With a smile on her lips and a nod of her head, she tossed the second flaming shuriken; letting it drive deep into the wood and catch it alight.

Like before, the flames burned for a short while before sputtering out; with some practice they would likely burn right through the wood and leave behind nothing but ash. An actual living person would be a different matter entirely, though she prefered to injure and subdue rather than kill. She let an errant thought go to her two most powerful jutsu, how she'd nearly completely broken Hassans word by using the most dangerous of the two. Both jutsu were more than capable of killing, the second with a single strike if necessary.

The idea of killing was still a foreign thing to her, besides a few rats killed in her early missions; never before had she taken another life. Whenever she thought about having to do it, her hands would begin to shake and she would feel a little nauseous. This fear though, she could never allow to show; for her village, for the people who lived in it. She would kill and kill again; as much as it was necessary. If her sould broke beneath the pressure of it, then so be it.

With a hefty sigh, she grabbed another two shuriken; one for each hand and lit them on fire. She would not think of these things, she had a goal now; a goal to surpass and defeat Yan. A goal to work through the ranks alongside Seisuke. She would do whatever she had to do to get there. Leaving behind a shimmer of flames, the shuriken flew from her hands and slammed into the wood; consuming it entirely in its flames.* - Thu Sep 17 13:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat back against the tree, absent mindedly holding a kunai in between her fingers. She was much better at using the Katon chakra flow, good enough to use it in battle without wearing herself down quickly. She felt herself improving constantly, getting better and better with every second she spent practicing her jutsu. Yet, it wasn't quite enough; she wasn't foolish enough to train herself to exhaustion in the midst of war, but she had to push herself as far as possible.

With the kunai still in her hand, she would set it alight; channeling flame along the blades edge to give it an etherial appearence. She didn't bother throwing it, instead she extinguished the flame and reignited it once more. It was good practice, just using the technique over and over again until igniting the flames became a second nature thing. The training was tedious and a little boring, but it was necessary to progress herself.

Whenever she got bored or tired, she would just imagine Yan's smug face and force herself to keep going. One day she would be happy to look down on that boy, put him on his ass at last. She didn't really dislike him, in fact he was a likeable person; but she wanted nothing more than to beat her self-appointed rival down.* - Thu Sep 17 14:04:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) Tethys wasn't a coward, he was far from it.  Running away from this battle started long before it even started something that Tethys desperately wanted to solve in the midst of war, but surely everyone's life must come to an end.  The pace at which Tethys has been going to escape death proved to only last for so long, so once making it to a certain distance he turns to meet his destruction.  He digs places a finger into his right ear, activating the communication device each shinobi of Kirigakure harbored.


"I am Tethys of the Hogo, damn it!  I refuse to make the likes of you force me to throw away my honor and pride, you damn monsters!  Here I stand, ready to dine in hell with my fallen brethren.  You, creatures of Zetsumo, and Zetsumo himself, strike no fear in this body!  I AM.. I AM TETHYS OF THE HOGO!"


From this point on, he unsheathed his blade, allowing his self to dash into the electrical flames and bombardment of earth bullets.  As if a last attempt to redeem his self, Tethys started swinging with all his might; he even occasionally smacked away an earth bullet.  Still, however, eventually he was jellified and evaporated, leaving nothing of his existence behind.  The black blade would've eventually be destroyed due to the overwhelming effects of the bullets and overall jutsus.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes Sensei. - Fri Sep 18 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) walked over towards the wall and formed her hand into a blade, she was much faster at gathering the chakra than previously; though she still had difficulty compared to someone like Hassan. Once her hand was a blade, she jabbed into into the wall, her fingers sinking through the stone like butter.* - Fri Sep 18 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Not bad. - Fri Sep 18 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: How about a short spar? - Fri Sep 18 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *nod* Okay. - Fri Sep 18 13:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yep. - Fri Sep 18 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Fri Sep 18 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) breathed in through her nose and closed her eyes, sparring Hassan was going to be difficult, but she was also excited. Finally able to have a spar in which she could fight with everything she had. She knew that there was no chance in winning against the man, but for all she was worth she would give it one hell of a good go.

From within her holsters, she pulled out two kunai; channeling her chakra into just one of them so it began to flame. Against Hassan, she would have to be fast; she could not afford to let a Taijutsu master like him get close to her. For now, she moved backwards as quickly as she could; widening the distance between the two.* - Fri Sep 18 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) blinked a few times as Hassan beat her to the combo, of course he would know exactly what she was doing; that was a given. Smiling grimly, she dropped the kunai and softened the earth beneath her feet; hoping to drop into the safety of the dirt using Hassan's flames as a cover. She had to think of a way to bring him down, he could easily counter any Fuuton technique she threw at him and her Katon wasn't powerful enough to overpower him. She thought quietly for a while, coming up with some sort of plan. It wasn't the best plan, but it was better than nothing.* - Fri Sep 18 14:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) moved a little closer to him before suddenly popping up above ground, she knew there was likely to be some form of attack so she would be ready to sink again if necessary. Now on her feet she formed a single handseal and generated three clones of mud, as quickly as she possibly could; she shoved an explosive tag inside of each clone, keeping them ready to explode at a moments notice. * - Fri Sep 18 14:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grinned, she'd of course been expecting an attack; but it didn't matter. The moment she'd prepared the clones, both them and herself sank into the ground. She winced at the amount of chakra she had to use for everything to work, but in the end it was worth it. She was hoping to impress Hassan with this new tactic of hers, though she was surprised she'd never thought of something like this before.

Underground now, her clones would start moving towards Hassan; she knew that it was only by the fact that he had yet to use his speed that this could work. The moment he started moving properly, she'd lose in in an instant.* - Fri Sep 18 14:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) direct her clones to surround him, one behind him and the other two on either side. She was confident that this would cause no harm to him, a man like Hassan would either escape or just take very little damage from the attack. The moment the clones were in position, they shot up out of the ground. None even attempted to lay a hand on her, instead; Lera popped out of the ground further back, forming just one handseal and mouthing the word 'bang'. If everything went well, the tags inside the clones would explode; not so much in flames, due to the mud. Though the concussive force alone would be enough to harm or at least disorient, or so she hoped.* - Fri Sep 18 14:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) saw her chance and took it, the clones had gone up and due to the aftermath of the explosion; she could not see what had happened to Hassan, but there was no letting up now, not against Hassan. She ran forward several metres, forming five handseals and taking in a deep breath. She refrained from using wind here, Hassan could wipe something like that out without even trying; the same could be said for her Raiton.

Instead, she brought her hands up to her lips and breathed through them like a funnel. Flames would spew from her mouth, spreading out infront of her as a large ball of fire.* - Fri Sep 18 14:22:04 2015
