<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He is going to find us a different venue but I told him you should speak with him about the location since you chose the court yard first. - Wed Nov 18 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) swept a hand through her long unkempt hair, with Nina's death she hadn't been looking after herself so well. She knew how hard it was for Kiyoko though, to have taken her first life and for it to have been Nina of all people. Lera didn't blame the woman though, far from it. She was sympathetic, she still remembered the first life she'd taken and it had made her physically sick; Lera hadn't even known the person either, while Kiyoko had known Nina.

The best thing she could do was put her mind from and stay by Kiyoko, there was no blame on the woman but Lera did not want her to think otherwise; she could not show Kiyoko any form of tears. To take her mind of things, she was here to train once again; her leg probably wouldn't take much longer to heal. Though it was probably possible to speed the process up with a healing jutsu, she sort of wanted it to heal naturally at this point. It was going to be her first 'proper' scar.

Putting her mind to the task at hand, she drew her hands apart and stared hard at the dead center between her palms. She was still trying to figure out how to combine these three elements effectively, it was proving far more difficult than she'd imagined. It was bad enough trying to focus on two elements at once, when you added a third it became nearly impossible. So far her results had been limited but impressive, a result so far she'd only been able to replicate rather than improve on.

Whilst whispering under her breath, she attempted to replicate those results once again "Doton in the left....Fuuton in the right....Katon in the middle." She'd found so far that it was much easier if she focused on the focal point of Katon chakra with her eyes. It was almost like she was channeling the chakra from her eyes, though that wasn't the case; it was simply easier to think of it that way. As she pushed her hands just a little closer, her arms began to tremble from the effort; the Katon chakra pushing against the Fuuton and Doton as it always did.

The 'limited success' part came next. As the chakra's finally began to mix and Lera's forehead began to drip with sweat from the attempt, the sheer amount of concentration she had to put in was immense. Of course, if she couldn't turn this into a instinctual action then she would never be able to use this in battle. In the dead centre of her two palms, the mixed chakra began to make a visible appearence. Starting out as a tiny speck of golden light before expanding to a small sphere the size of her fingernail.

Though it was small in appearence, the 'element' certainly made one hell of a racket. The tiny sphere was letting off a deep and dangerous hum, enough to make your teeth shake. With considerable effort, she attempted to force yet more chakra into the technique; it was already consuming more than any technique she knew of, though it was still just a fraction compared to her full chakra pools. Though she was trying so hard to increase its size, in the end it was just another failure.

With a grunt, her hands flew apart and her arms spiraled backwards; almost wrenching her shoulders from their sockets in the process. The little golden ball dispersed into particles and Lera was left looking up at the sky with her back to the ground. She just knew this had to be possible, she'd managed to bring it this far; if only she was able to split her concentration, it would be easy then. She sat up fast as the solution came to her, she thought herself a fool for not thinking of it earlier...it was so damn obvious.

Pushing herself back up to her feet, she rubbed her hands together briefly before making a clone. Her clones could do everything just as well as she could, it went without saying that she could technically have a clone focus on the Katon why she herself focused on the Doton and Fuuton. With that in mind, the clone faced its palms outwards, towards Lera; while Lera herself held her palms close to the clones. With a little nod to one another, they began to focus the chakras.

The clone worked on Katon chakra, focusing it in a tight chunk at the center between their palms. Lera herself worked on combining that Katon with the Fuuton and Doton chakras. The usual deep hum quickly filled the air again as the little golden sphere began to form. This time, it began to grow; though as it did both Lera and the clone started to sweat with the effort of containing it. The sphere grew until it was almost the size of a tennis ball, glowing brightly and humming loudly to itself. It was going well for a while and then it all just went wrong...

With a explosion of smoke, her clone dissapeared; proving incapable of holding this thing for a long period of time. She cursed quietly under her breath, knowing full well that she couldn't hold the sphere by herself. To save herself from whatever was going to happen, she used a jolt of chakra to push the sphere away and dove behind a rock. The sphere expanded violently behind her, releasing what she could only describe as a sonic blast with it. It was thankful that the technique was still incomplete and weak, she had a feeling that it might have killed her otherwise.

Standing to her feet, she looked around and saw just how close of a call she'd really had; when she thought of how she would have left Kiyoko behind, it made her feel sick. At the focal point of the explosion was a crater, the sand didn't look burned or assaulted by heat. It was more like...the sand that had been caught in the blast just...wasn't there anymore. It had been completely disintegrated. A quick glance at the rock further comfirmed her close call, the back of the rock was gone; looking like it had been neatly sliced in two.

Then, with a little twinge of pain she looked down at her palms and noticed that they were steaming slightly. A closer inspection showed her the deep redness; it wasn't so much a burn though, more so the top layer of skin had been erased completely. Still though, she had to whistle under her breath; the power was impressive. Though this now presented a few more issues, first she had to figure out a way to contain it. Otherwise she would risk killing herself and allies whenever she decided to us it. Second, she had to learn how to control it without the help of a clone...which meant a lot of practice. First though, she needed these palms healed.* - Wed Nov 18 13:34:04 2015

The palm of her hand was bright red with spots of dried blood and some fresh welling all over the place.

After she was done she flexed the fingers experimentally, they were tender but at least she could move them now; it looked like she would have to refrain from using Samehada for a while though.

"Thank you and I will...it scared the hell out of me, I didn't realise it would be quite that...potent..."* - Wed Nov 18 13:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Hmmmmmmm? - Wed Nov 18 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Hmmmmmm? - Wed Nov 18 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Are you hungry yet? - Wed Nov 18 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'm always hungry~ - Wed Nov 18 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wound her arm through Kiyoko's standing up in the process.* - Wed Nov 18 16:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) whistled low under her breath, raising an eyebrow at Kiyoko.

"You've been busy~"* - Wed Nov 18 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took off her jacket and propped Samehada up on its stand, she looked longingly at the variety of instruments she had propped in various places; knowing that she couldn't really play any of them with her hands like this. Instead she sighed and pulled up a chair nearish the kitchen, she made sure not to get in the way of Kiyoko and her cooking; but she just wanted to be close.

"Hun, anything you make is bound to be fantastic I don't mind how long it takes~ And for someone as special as you, our wedding should be a grand ocasion~"* - Wed Nov 18 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took the drink with a look of surprise, she couldn't refuse Kiyoko of course and it probably tasted amazing. Lera however...was a bit of a lightweight when it came to alchohol. She thought about it for a few moments and took the drink anyway, one would probably be okay.

"Thank you~" She tipped back her head and took a gulp of the liquid, her eyes widening in surprise at the taste. It all seemed to just blend together perfectly.

"Oh wow...you're a natural."* - Wed Nov 18 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled and gave her a wink, settling back into the chair while she enjoyed the show. Whilst Kiyoko cooked her eyes would practically never leave her, though if Kiyoko were to turn to her she'd look away with an innocent expression.

"Oh? Hehe, we're both light drinkers then. That might make an interesting night~"* - Wed Nov 18 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gasped in mock horror, as if she were shocked to be accused of such a thing.

"Whaaaaaa? Me? Get you drunk? Nooooo. Would I do such a thing?"* - Wed Nov 18 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled and decided to stand up, her leg was mostly better now; as long as she didn't do something stupid with it. With a light smirk, she wandered up behind Kiyoko; more looking over her shoulder; with the recent growthspirts Lera was a little taller, though Kiyoko still had an inch over her. So she had to stand on her tiptoes to accomplish the effect. Then, if she wasn't told off; she would gently blow into Kiyoko's ear.* - Wed Nov 18 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stepped back with an 'What did I do??' sort of expression on her face and went back to her seat, thinking of other ways she could mess with the woman.* - Wed Nov 18 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sniffed in the air and let out a big content sigh, she could sit here like this for hours and just watch Kiyoko work. She could also mess with the woman a bit more...which is what she was going to do.

As soon as her back was turned, she got up as quielty as possible and snuck up behind her again. This time she tried to nibble on her neck a bit.* - Wed Nov 18 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a deep breath of the air, folowing close behind Kiyoko with a big grin on her face.

"It both looks...and smells incredible."* - Wed Nov 18 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sooooooo. - Wed Nov 18 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Dig in? - Wed Nov 18 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't mind if I do~ - Wed Nov 18 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took her seat at the table, filling herself a glass of the Arare and tucking into her food. She was of course, a fast eater, but she held back somewhat so as not to eat it too quickly. Lera was someone who could eat just about anything, but she was also a lover of the finer foods; this was different somehow, it almost had a...homey feel to it. Between mouthfulls she'd be complimenting Kiyoko of course.

"This is incredible!"* - Wed Nov 18 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) she stopped about halfway through the meal, leaning her head back and closing her eyes. A tiny spark situated itself at the corner of one eye, leaving a trail as it ran down her face; she couldn't explain the feelings she had. For Lera, it was a long time since she'd eaten a full meal cooked by the one she loved...in fact it had probably never happened in her life.

In a tiny little whisper, maybe even too quiet for Kiyoko to hear she said "i'm home..." before continuing to eat through her meal as fast as ever.* - Wed Nov 18 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) ate anything that Kiyoko wasn't capable of eating, though she made absolutely sure the woman had enough food first. She finished her side of the meal by downing almost three glasses of the Arare, a healthy pink glow taking effect on her face from the alchohol in it; though she had not had enough to be drunk.

"I...have no words. You're an amazing cook. It was better than any resteraunt because this tasted like....home."* - Wed Nov 18 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wrapped her arms around Kiyoko and turned into the kiss, answering it with an equal passion.* - Wed Nov 18 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her hands to make a clone, it was such a useful technique when you could get a clone to do everything for you.

"Let me do it~"* - Wed Nov 18 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ..Hmph. - Wed Nov 18 17:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) held up her bandaged hands.* - Wed Nov 18 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: How'd you manage that? - Wed Nov 18 17:30:27 2015
