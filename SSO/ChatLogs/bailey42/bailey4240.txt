<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) just held her tighter, trying to relay with her actions if not her words that she didn't blame Kiyoko.* - Tue Nov 17 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Stupid girl...a single arm is not the end of the world...why did you... - Tue Nov 17 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It happened so fast... - Tue Nov 17 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pressed her face against Kiyoko's hair, kissing her head slowly while whispering words under her breath.

"I know you didn't, sometimes things just happen hun. I don't blame you for anything."* - Tue Nov 17 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They would never... - Tue Nov 17 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't even think of what she might do if Kiyoko was executed, she figured she would probably have herself executed instead or do something more...radical.

"I'm with you always, I would never let them harm you or blame you."* - Tue Nov 17 18:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I trust you Kiyoko. I trust you with my soul... - Tue Nov 17 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I can't help but be worried... - Tue Nov 17 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know I know. - Tue Nov 17 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) held her hands out in front of her, pondering how exactly she could possibly do this. In light of the progress everyone around her seemed to be making, she felt the need to come up with something new; something unique...something powerful. In truth, she'd been pondering the idea ever since she learned that it was possible. After learning of people with the ability to combine multiple elements, she felt the need to try it for herself.

Sanoke had said that it was generally only something that could be done by people who were born with it, she had no idea if she had been herself; though it wasn't entirely possible. Even if she was capable of it, what element would she be able to make? She'd heard vague rumors of a Lava element, so possibly that? But then...that just felt...wrong somehow, it didn't fit her at all. Yet she knew with certainty that the element would involve Earth it was her best after all, but which other? Wind or Fire?

The only way to know would be through trial and error, it was almost a good thing she couldn't spar with her injury; it prompted her to practice this. From what she knew, it involved combining one element in one hand and the other element in her second hand. She wasn't sure paticularly which element to start with, so she just chose at random. In her left hand, she flowed her Doton nature and in her right she flowed Katon.

With her hands held across from one another, she started bringing them together in a clap; attempting to combine the two elements into a new one. There seemed to be some resistance between her hands, as if she were pushing against an inivisble wall. After a few moments of struggle however, she managed to place her hands together and mingle the two chakras together. The reaction was a violet one, she didn't create a new element; instead, the two chakras pushed back against each other with Violent results.

Her hands flew apart rapidly, the chakra's rejecting the combination and destroying themselves in the process. After pulling her arms back to her side, she rubbed her now sore shoulder and started thinking with a little frown on her face. It hadn't been so much that she couldn't do it, the elements simply didn't mix...at least not for her anyway. With that in mind, she moved onto the next likely candidate; namely her Fuuton and Doton elements.

Repeating the procedure, she began focusing Doton in the right hand and Fuuton in the left; slowly bringing her hands together once more. The difference was immediate, for one she felt no resistance at all; her hands came together with practice ease. Second, the elements almost seemed to...get along; it was the best way she could put it. They didn't truly combine to create something, but they mingled together; as if waiting for something a little extra.

She could not for the life of her shake the feeling that she was one the right track, but it was missing something...crucial; a catalyst of sorts. What was it though? There was truly nothing she could think of that would even make sense. Dropping the chakra, she forced a flat rock to jutt out of the ground and took a seat. This was going to take a lot of pondering, she thought that perhaps Katon and Fuuton could be it; but then she combined them quite often already, all it ever did was produce a bigger flame.

Then again, whenever she combined those two elements; it was by combining jutsu, not the chakra's themselves. Perhaps by combining the elements at a chakra level is what made the new elements themselves. With her palms back in their original position, she charged the right with Fuuton and her left with Katon; a small thought occured to her, with how those paticular positions felt right somehow. The same way she'd felt that Doton had to be left of Katon, Fuuton just felt better on the right of Katon. It was an interesting thought.

Like the first two attempts, she brought her hands together in a clap; attempting to bring the chakras into a state of combination. Interestingly enough, like the first attempt with Doton and Katon, the two elements seemed to reject one another. She could have put it down to the inherent relationship between Katon and Fuuton, but that wasn't right; that didn't explain why it happened the first time. Now that she thought about it, the rejection wasn't coming from Fuuton; it was coming from Katon.

With a little experimentation; she began to notice that it was Katon that was pushing against Fuuton, not the other way around. Dropping those chakra's, she took up the Doton and Katon natures again; repeating the same experiments. The results were the same, Katon was pushing against the Doton element; with a little more pushing it seemed to feel like the Doton was almost trying condense the Katon into a smaller area. She was willing to bet that the Fuuton was doing the same thing.

A crazy thought occured to her while she dropped the two chakra natures, but it didn't make sense; she'd never heard of anything like it before, it should technically be impossible. Then...just because she had not heard of it before, it didn't necessarily mean it was impossible. There was a reason, she thought, that Fuuton and Doton had gone together so easily; but had felt like they were missing something. It was simply because they had been, they'd been missing the key...Katon.

The idea was ludcirous, the be able to combine three of the five elements would likely give you something beyond the natural power of Ninjutsu. She could hardly imagine the sort of destruction that kind of power could wreak. Lera was never one for destruction, but she did need something that could outclass anything else and this would likely provide that power with a little extra to spare. So with a resolute nod to herself, she held her hands apart and began to focus chakra once again...

Under her breath, she whispered the elements and their positions as she used them "Doton in the left...Fuuton in the right...Katon in the middle." it was difficult though, impossibly difficult. It was, she felt, like trying to perform several tasks at once in seperate places. Without using a clone, it was impossible.  The thought didn't even occur that she genuinely could use a clone, focused as she was at simply getting this right.

At first, nothing seemed to be happening; Just focusing on three elements at once was incredibly difficult and took so much of her concentration. If anything broke her concentration, for even a second; she would likely lose it. Agonisingly slow, she began to manifest the Katon chakra in the centre between her palms. Her hands were already running with Doton and Fuuton chakra respectively, now all she had to do was combine the three together and see the effect.

The Rejection she felt from the three elements was immense, she had to use a great deal of strength just to keep her hands steady. Slowly but surely however, she brought the tree elements together; though nothing happened at first, she soon felt the rejection starting to reverse. The Elements were still pushing away from each other as strong as ever, but she could fee the Doton and Fuuton beginning to mix into the Katon. She was rewarded with an impressive sight, a tiny speck of golden energy.

It wasn't just the appearence that set it apart, it was the noise; the tiny speck let off a deep throated hum that made her teeth vibrate. She was no longer playing with something she understood, not only was it dangerously powerful to others, it was also dangerous to her. As her concentration relentlessly pushed, the tiny speck slowly grew; becoming almost as large as her thumb nail before her concentration broke. As soon as it did, her hands flew apart and the tiny ball of energy dispersed into the air.

She sat against her rock panting, feeling surprisingly drained; despite knowing that her chakra had only been used in a miniscule fraction. It was her head she decided, concentrating so hard on something; even for a short while, it gave her a headache. Yet...if this thing could be mastered, if she was able to produce a workable technique out of it. The possibilities in combat were just near limitless. She looked down at her hand for a moment and flexed her fingers, resolving to find someone who might be able to help.* - Tue Nov 17 19:13:16 2015
