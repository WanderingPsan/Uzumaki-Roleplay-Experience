<br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wandered up to Kiyoko a little mischevious smile on her face, she stopped infront of the woman wearing her usual covering jacket but for a subtle difference. Her legs appeared to be bare save for the hoodie that stopped short just above her knees and she was wearing something Lera never wore...make up.

Holding out a hand to Kiyoko she gave her a little wink and said "I have a surprise...follow me~"* - Fri Nov 13 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) winked again and pulled out a thin strip of cloth, reaching to tie it over her eyes.

"Trust me?"* - Fri Nov 13 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ... - Fri Nov 13 14:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope not at all. - Fri Nov 13 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) ever so slowly, she led Kyoko towards one of the villages resteraunt to where a number of waiters and servers were waiting for them. She led her through the resteraunt past all the curious customers and into a private room. Before taking off the womans blindfold she removed her jacket and propped samehada up within easy reach. Underneath the jacket she was wearing a simple kneeheight dress, it was a deep red colour and it hugged her body perfectly.

"Okay ready?" She said whilst slowly reaching for blindfold.* - Fri Nov 13 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slowly untied the blindfold and revealed the room they stood in. The room was full of candles, glittering from every wall and surface and dead in the centre was a small round table with a single red candle situated in the middle. As soon as the blindfold was off, a butler replesendent in his tuxedo began playing a soft tune on a violin.

"So...what do you think?"* - Fri Nov 13 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took her hand and slowly kissed the top of it whispering against the skin.

"I wanted to surprise you..."* - Fri Nov 13 14:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) led her by hand to her seat and then took her own being careful to cross her legs over like a proper lady; short skirts were notoriously bad at hiding things.

"I was sort of tempted to prop- Oh woops...me and my big mouth. Anyways, I can see your worried about your appearence. Don't be, you're always beautfiul."* - Fri Nov 13 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can eat whatever you want. Money is no object. - Fri Nov 13 14:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.~ - Fri Nov 13 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Spoil me why don'tcha. - Fri Nov 13 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Always~ - Fri Nov 13 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took up her own menu looking over the huge selection, most of it was immensely expensive; they'd come to one of the more...'posh' resteraunts in the village.

"I pulled some strings and rented out a private room. Being my dads daughter has some benefits~ As for what I'm getting...hmmmm. I'm thinking i'll start with the vegetable soup, followed by pulled pork and salad....then maybe a curry, then orange torte for desert?" she was clearly very used to eating at the higher end places, she'd never been short for money.* - Fri Nov 13 14:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled warmly at her "Nervous? Don't be~ here, the tomato and herb soup is an excellent place to start."* - Fri Nov 13 14:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled at the waiter who'd been taking down notes and he wandered off to place their order. While they waited she reached across the table attempting to take hold of Kiyoko's hands if she could.

"How are you feeling?"* - Fri Nov 13 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The time restraint? - Fri Nov 13 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Him and Yan had put a time restraint on him getting in check... - Fri Nov 13 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do you want me to speak to him? - Fri Nov 13 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no, I already did, when a month has passed he will review him and if he has made progress, which he has already, then the time will be extended. - Fri Nov 13 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright thats good then. - Fri Nov 13 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Pretty sure your dad likes talking to me. - Fri Nov 13 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...no I don't think he does honestly. It wouldn't bother him though. - Fri Nov 13 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He might have heard though...not much escapes him these days - Fri Nov 13 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He's shrewd old man - Fri Nov 13 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see, I thought you might have told him. - Fri Nov 13 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We have very different working times...he's often napping while i'm up and about - Fri Nov 13 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn, I see. - Fri Nov 13 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Something weird as hell happened on shift earlier. - Fri Nov 13 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Had to deal with my first extended erectial issue. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Extended ere...wow. Boy do I feel sorry for you - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Guy didn't even know what masterbation was.... - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah...... - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How old was he?? - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I tried to avoi--sixteen I believe he said. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Damn... - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I found it hard to believe but he was dead serious the entire time. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Pshh..what do they even teach anymore. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And he hadn't taken any pills... I don't know how he even has the issue but I treated him. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right right. I wouldn't wish your job on anyone. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Hah... - Fri Nov 13 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My day was certainly less interesting I can tell you. - Fri Nov 13 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? How did it go? - Fri Nov 13 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Prety well, had a sparring session with a Jounin; came to a draw in the end, but it was fun. - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, nothing majorly interesting. - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How is your new business going? - Fri Nov 13 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haven't had any customers yet, but eh; I'm sure i'll get some eventually. - Fri Nov 13 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A huge number of the jutsu I know are quite common. I may have to extend the business to include personal training. - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well I know you have one student.~ But she's rather cheap and pays in other forms of currency. - Fri Nov 13 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled and gave her a sly wink.

"I can't wait till you're fully healed, because I'm going to be taking my payment in -full-"* - Fri Nov 13 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Once you're fully healed, I'll teach you any time. - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right right, making me wait. Hmph.~ - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hah, Just want to make sure you're one hundred percent first. - Fri Nov 13 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I used to push myself to the point of injury, its really not good for you. - Fri Nov 13 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes I understand, love. I haven't even used my healing ninjutsu. - Fri Nov 13 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good~ - Fri Nov 13 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... where is that soup? - Fri Nov 13 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll The soup literally turned up seconds after Kiyoko spoke, having them set down in front of both of them. Lera winked and began eating it almost immediately, normally she would wolf food down at the speed of light but in front of Kiyoko she acted proper.* - Fri Nov 13 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised an eyebrow, she had heard nothing about any Flu shots

"Flu shots? I mean sure...I'm not scared of needles. I hadn't heard anything about Flu shots though."* - Fri Nov 13 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He's having me give the entire shinobi force them. - Fri Nov 13 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Fri Nov 13 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It just goes to show how good you are. - Fri Nov 13 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh, I think you are just trying to butter me up. - Fri Nov 13 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Whaaat me??? Noooooo. Would I do such a thing? - Fri Nov 13 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes,  you do so all the time.~ - Fri Nov 13 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Fri Nov 13 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't help it. Every time I see you I just want to jump on you and have my way with you!! - Fri Nov 13 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) winked again.* - Fri Nov 13 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm. I wonder if you can keep up with me? - Fri Nov 13 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Fri Nov 13 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Keep up with you on what? - Fri Nov 13 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I told you that I love food right? its one of my...indulgences. I tend to eat enough for three people. - Fri Nov 13 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Well... I can't eat that way. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The only downside is the amount of work I have to do to keep this figure... - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'd get fat otherwise. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I sort of eat...rather healthy normally. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I only indulge occassionally. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe. I find that as long as you balance it with some real intense workout. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its fine - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyways. I'll have a curry, a plate of salad and I think a rare beef steak. Don't let me make your choice though, theres a lot of good food here~ - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No I know but I just try to avoid things that are bad for me. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Certain fats and s---ehh heh... woops. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no, I want you to choose. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh jeez...if you keep making faces like that I really won't be able to wait. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right right... - Fri Nov 13 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Something healthy... - Fri Nov 13 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just... this seems like a special night. - Fri Nov 13 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So order what you think I might like....that is on the more indulgent side I think. - Fri Nov 13 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'll cheat. - Fri Nov 13 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh alright~ - Fri Nov 13 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) browsed the menu with a furrowed brow, it was difficult to know what the woman would like. In the end, she settled with something that was pretty well known and most people liked. She remembered Kiyoko mentioning her love for Sushi before...so this would go down well she hoped.

"Perhaps the Broiled lobster...?"* - Fri Nov 13 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I've never had lobster.... - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I picked right! yay~ - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know you like Sushi. Lobster comes quite close. - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Y-yes, I... I must confess I've never been able to afford lobster. - Fri Nov 13 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. You'll always be able to afford it now. - Fri Nov 13 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My parents used to throw money at me when I was younger. I've never exactly been...short on it. - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But not long ago I taught someone a technique that I created myself. - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see.... - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He paid me eight million to do so. - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....wow. - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As you can imagine...i've lived pretty well off since then - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And here I was sweating over a million alone to possibly get my weapons. - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Honestly I was going to buy you them as a present~ - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Fri Nov 13 15:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's a -lot- though. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nah. Money is easy to come by. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Besides. Its just an object. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing is too much when it comes to you. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was thinking of getting regular sized ones and then large ones for more tactical uses...I couldn't have you pay for them.  - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* It doesn't bother me in the slightest. - Fri Nov 13 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe, Alright. Kukiri. - Fri Nov 13 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll find a blacksmith as soon as I can. - Fri Nov 13 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Fujitora will probably know a good one. - Fri Nov 13 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The blacksmith in the village...doesn't do weapons apparently. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah. I already asked him. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh. - Fri Nov 13 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) ll The waiters came around to deliver their food, a considerably large amount for Lera. It didn't look like she'd be able to even fit it all in her body, but she somehow did.* - Fri Nov 13 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...holy.... - Fri Nov 13 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Go ahead and eat~ - Fri Nov 13 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's so... - Fri Nov 13 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) swallowed her mouthful so she could giggle, it was fun seeing someone eat at a resteraunt like this for the first time.

"Hehe, thats just how they make food in places like this I guess. I've never really cared, food is food~"* - Fri Nov 13 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled with such genuine happiness at her words that it almost looked like she was glowing. The idea of living with Kiyoko permenantly was just so...irresistable.

"I truly look forward to the day I come home to find you waiting for me. And Vice versa of course~"* - Fri Nov 13 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finished off the first of her plates and pushed it to one side, starting on the salad next; she left the steak till last...because steak.

"There's not a single rotton cell in you, you're just pure sweet goodness."* - Fri Nov 13 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stuck her tongue out right back, but desolved into giggles afterwards.

"My theory is that I have a special dimension hidden in my stomach and it all goes there."* - Fri Nov 13 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm, understandable. - Fri Nov 13 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It makes sense right?? - Fri Nov 13 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh yes, -totally-.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yep! - Fri Nov 13 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finished her salad and moved right onto the steak, making quick work of it all.* - Fri Nov 13 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Next time I won't be so polite~ - Fri Nov 13 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stopped mid-bite and winked at her, before picking up the remaining of the steak on the fork and wolfing the entire thing down super fast. Ironically, not a single drop was spilt but it wasn't exactly lady-like.* - Fri Nov 13 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: hehehe. - Fri Nov 13 16:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I told you I liked food~ - Fri Nov 13 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I had to learn to eat...fast. - Fri Nov 13 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why's that? - Fri Nov 13 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Because whenever I ate with other people, they usually finished in less than half the time. - Fri Nov 13 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't like making people wait for me. - Fri Nov 13 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see... - Fri Nov 13 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You don't -have- to eat fast with me, Lera. - Fri Nov 13 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know~ I just wanted to show you. - Fri Nov 13 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyways...desert...? - Fri Nov 13 16:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes yes.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded at the waiter who went off to get their food. He came back mere moments later with two plates. On the plate were a slice of cake each. Unlike ordinary cake, the torte was a moist sponge with a subtle hint of chocolate and a tangy orange after taste.* - Fri Nov 13 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched her eat for a while before picking up her own, just seeing Kiyoko happy made her smile.

"I'm glad you like it~"* - Fri Nov 13 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you going to tell me at some point what this is all about? - Fri Nov 13 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If it was just a surprise I feel like you might have let me get dressed up. - Fri Nov 13 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I just wanted to treat you. - Fri Nov 13 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uhuh.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finished off her cake and watched Kiyoko eat hers.

"I could sit here and watch you all day...."* - Fri Nov 13 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not just yet~ But you better keep an eye out~ - Fri Nov 13 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I might just get you one day~ - Fri Nov 13 16:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Get me what? - Fri Nov 13 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats for me to know and you to find out. - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Hmmmmmm.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Tell me tell me tell me.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Noooope - Fri Nov 13 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope! - Fri Nov 13 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But...I wouldn't mind a kiss anyway~ - Fri Nov 13 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) returned the kiss with a happy sigh, she wanted to do it now; so so badly. So she just thought fuck it.

With as much slight of hand as possible, she slipped a little something onto Kiyoko's plate. When she saw it, she would see a golden ring with a tight silver line etched around it. It was simple, but Lera didn't want to give her one of those rings with a giant diamond ont it. She figured that the simpler it was the better.* - Fri Nov 13 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gulped when she noticed the ring and took in a deep breath.

"Kiyoko. I can't imagine any other path for me than spending the rest of my life by your side. I want...I want it to be official, I want our bond to be a strong as the titanium woven around that ring. I love you Kiyoko...will you marry me?"* - Fri Nov 13 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled and nodded with understanding, she didn't want to rush Kiyoko into anything she wasn't yet ready for.

"You can ask me anything whenever you want. I don't want to rush you Kiyoko."* - Fri Nov 13 17:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Were you married before? - Fri Nov 13 17:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No. - Fri Nov 13 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded, speaking with the absolute truth.

"More than anything."* - Fri Nov 13 17:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) breathed a huge sigh, happiness suffusing her body with a light tingle running up her spine.

"Thank you...thank you so much."* - Fri Nov 13 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) kissed her back with another sigh, all the tension was gone out of her body and she fully relaxed against Kiyoko's touch.

"For eternity and onwards..."* - Fri Nov 13 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Fri Nov 13 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well you sped things up, didn't you? - Fri Nov 13 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I guess I did at that. I wanted to meet your parents first...ahh shucks, I just couldn't wait anymore. - Fri Nov 13 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Fri Nov 13 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Does this mean you are actually going to tell your father? Or am I going to have a very awkward conversation with him? - Fri Nov 13 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No i'll tell him - Fri Nov 13 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh jeez it reminds me of something I did to him once... - Fri Nov 13 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It was pretty cruel... - Fri Nov 13 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? Do tell.~ - Fri Nov 13 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I uhhh...told him I was pregnant once... - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh jeez...I was like fifteen at the time. - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...oh. - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It looked like he was gonna explode. - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I wasn't of course. - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I needed to get his attention *shrug* - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But he really did look like he was gonna have a heart attack... - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Wow. - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's so mean! - Fri Nov 13 17:20:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Poor guy was standing a few feet away. I've never seen someone hide behind me so fast. - Fri Nov 13 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Wooooooow. - Fri Nov 13 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) scrunched up that nose and then buried her face agaisnt Kiyoko's neck. When she spoke it was sort've muffled.

"I guess this means you have a huuuuuge family now."* - Fri Nov 13 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed a little making doubly sure to kiss that little hot spot while she was at it.

"My fathers side is...well...big. I have two brothers, a sister, two brothers in law and like...six nieces and nephews. All of which are now your family too~"* - Fri Nov 13 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Oh..god. - Fri Nov 13 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know little Izanami? - Fri Nov 13 17:28:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood up, holding kiyoko up with one arm. Kiyoko would feel her body growing exceptionally lighter, which hopefully helped her with the pain. She took out a considerable amount of money and paid the butler before heading towards the door with Kiyoko still in her arms.* - Fri Nov 13 17:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Guess I'll go do this. . . - Fri Nov 13 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well...lets see. - Fri Nov 13 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyone interested in a spar? - Fri Nov 13 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: - - Fri Nov 13 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: I wish I was allowed to spar. . . - Fri Nov 13 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Lera... Can I try to spar? - Fri Nov 13 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I mean sure. But you're not a combat type are you? - Fri Nov 13 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: On the condition that you will stop before you hit me? - Fri Nov 13 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I guess. - Fri Nov 13 18:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Hi. - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you stay for your entire treatment? - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Rias... - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Of course. Don't want any heartattacks, afterall. - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...good. - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: After your spar can you meet me here..? - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: ....Oh lord....I wonder what kind of 'treatment' he got.. - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That's the guy...with the...issue. - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Yup, I figured. - Fri Nov 13 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Fri Nov 13 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You wanna watch hun? - Fri Nov 13 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Actually I will decline the spar if you need to talk to me... - Fri Nov 13 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Fri Nov 13 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yeah, even though she just bailed after accepting. - Fri Nov 13 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Huh. *shrug* Right. - Fri Nov 13 18:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyone else? - Fri Nov 13 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I would. . .but, it wouldn't end well, and I'm banned from it. . . - Fri Nov 13 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Anywho. - Fri Nov 13 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: he would be interesting to spar. If he ever gains control. - Fri Nov 13 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yep... - Fri Nov 13 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I think you could handle him though... - Fri Nov 13 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Maybe. I haven't been able to go all out in a fight in soooo long. - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: But I will definate need you to teach me a few things in a spar Lera. But later ok? - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It would be nice. - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I miss you being rough with me... - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Thank you for your kindness - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess if you want to talk now...can you follow me? - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Oh trust me...you're gonna get it in full~ - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Now, you needed to speak to me Aki- sure  - Fri Nov 13 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But jeesh...it doesn't look like anyone feels like sparring. - Fri Nov 13 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Lame... - Fri Nov 13 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not even the bored kid? - Fri Nov 13 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: The temptation to call him something like...erection boy...so strong. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I can't win against you. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: No point trying. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And? You should strive to fight the strongest opponents. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I could get in trouble. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: No. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Only relatively stronger. A stomp isn't a fight. It's a stomp. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Don't worry, I won't - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* You get more experience that way, but whatever. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: But you're right, on the condition that it's a fight, fighting against those stronger than you yields the most experience. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Yes. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What if I deigned to use only my hands. No sword, no jutsu. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heck if you make me break that rule, you win. - Fri Nov 13 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: You'd still win effortlessly. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you keep selling yourself short, you'll never progress. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: It's like an elephant vs a mouse. I'd like to at least get horse size. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm not even a taijutsu specialist. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suck at Taijutsu. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I'm a nothing specialist. I suck at everything. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Legit. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* Whatever I guess. - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I can wrestle little children but that's about it. - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But out of curiosity. What exactly are you thinking of specialising in? - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Anything that comes my way. I know better than to be picky. - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right right. If you decide on Ninjutsu. Give me a shout. - Fri Nov 13 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I think the business. We'll go there for a bit. I'll check some stuff over. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wandered off towards the academy with Kiyoko.* - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm? - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Jeez...still no customers. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I need to expand my archives I think. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn.. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tired hun? - Fri Nov 13 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Eh... a little...but I know you are active right now because of everything that is going on. - Fri Nov 13 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: We'll head back if you need to sleep. I can sing to you~ - Fri Nov 13 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: mmgnngn that's so tempting. - Fri Nov 13 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Are you sure? - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Of course~ - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Course maybe we should be responsible... - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And go see my parents. - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ahhhh...that. Are you sure you're ready? - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: No...not at all. - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: We can wait. If you really want to. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But believe me when I say they can't refuse me. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: We can go. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Right. To your house then...don't worry. I already know where it is. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your house got gratfiti'd - Fri Nov 13 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put Kiyoko down with a nod and spotted her gaze drifiting to the grafiti. With a well aimed watergun though it came off easily enough.

"One problem dealt with at least...onto the next."* - Fri Nov 13 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled at the occupants of the room, there was nothing but warmth in her smile and she was putting on her best level of politeness; but she wasn't about to let some alpha male boss her about, she didn't even let her father boss her about. This could turn out to be an interesting evening at this rate. Either way, she was inside anothers home and as such adhered to their rules. From the glance to her shoes, she knew to take them off and thus did so; leaving them at the door.

"Hello everyone. Its good to meet you all, I'm Lera." She gave a quick thought and decided to give her full name, it would probably help the situation "Muhammed Lera."* - Fri Nov 13 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) narrowed her eyes just a little bit, she understood perfectly now; she expected Kiyoko had been exagerating even just a little but this was...this was bad. However for the moment she said nothing; instead removing her jacket and hanging it up on a coat. Underneath she was as bare as ever, with just tight bandages covering her chest. She then went through the process of unstrapping each and every one of her weapons...of which there were a rather large amount. Samehada though, she did not take off; to her, Samehada was a friend not a weapon.* - Fri Nov 13 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) glanced at the 'sword' that was too big for her body, if it hadn't been at a diagonal it would have been scraping across the floor. After a few seconds she looked back at him.

"Samehada is not a weapon, he is a friend. I don't leave my friends by the door. Right buddy?" She was looking back at Samehada as she said those last words, who wiggled in response and made an odd gurgling sort of noise.* - Fri Nov 13 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked sideways at the girl, smiling with both pride and happiness; it took a lot of courage to do that and Lera knew it. It was hard to believe that Kiyoko's father would be so rude though, she refrained from giving him a piece of her mind however. It seemed like Kiyoko was on a roll.* - Fri Nov 13 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) reached out and attempted to grab the mans wrist, channeling chakra throughout her body for a little bit of unnatural strength. She considered making him so heavy that he would make a hole in the floor, but she figured damaging the house would be a bad idea. Her eyes though, were completely cold with anger.

"You will never lay a hand on her." If she was indeed able to overpower the man, she would be squeezing his wrist...hard.* - Fri Nov 13 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave one last glare at her father and followed after Kiyoko; she released his wrist of course but couldn't help with one parting word.

"My own father was like you, maybe a little worse and he burned for it. Learn from his mistakes."* - Fri Nov 13 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That...could have gone better... - Fri Nov 13 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sorry Kiyoko, I didn't realise they were that...bad. - Fri Nov 13 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...it's fine. - Fri Nov 13 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took her own shoes and jacket, feeling the satisfying weight from the varying weapons hidden within.* - Fri Nov 13 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Sigh* I should've kept my temper.. - Fri Nov 13 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's fine...I should have told you ...how to deal with it. - Fri Nov 13 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Everything of mine is yours too. Help yourself to anything in the house. - Fri Nov 13 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Enjoy your rest hun. - Fri Nov 13 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I'll spar. - Fri Nov 13 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Oh.. - Fri Nov 13 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: *smirks* - Fri Nov 13 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: My man told me not to spar you so sorry. - Fri Nov 13 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: No reason. - Fri Nov 13 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I don't want her to spar you. - Fri Nov 13 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov 13 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Hey chill. - Fri Nov 13 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov 13 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You attempt to harm her, your life is forfiet. - Fri Nov 13 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Fri Nov 13 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov 13 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: No its not a threat. - Fri Nov 13 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a seat on the bench to listen to the exchange, figuring she should stop the guy if he went crazy.* - Fri Nov 13 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Fair enough. - Fri Nov 13 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Just dont say stuff like that. - Fri Nov 13 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Not nice. - Fri Nov 13 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I didn't start it. - Fri Nov 13 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: You kind of did. - Fri Nov 13 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Got all upset because I said no. - Fri Nov 13 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Hey, girly. I'll take you up on your offer. - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Girly...? - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Punk. - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Your name is? - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lera - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Saizo. - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right sure. - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nari(Ej247) says: Pfew.. - Fri Nov 13 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Please fuck him up. - Fri Nov 13 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Pleassseee. - Fri Nov 13 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: For teaching, that is. Ninjutsu. - Fri Nov 13 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...Riiight. - Fri Nov 13 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Element? - Fri Nov 13 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I can try fuck you up, too, but I'll lose. - Fri Nov 13 19:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her eyebrows and looked around at the sand rising around her, it looked like a jutsu she knew well but until she saw the actual result. When she did it was her usual nightmare playing over again, a scene of her failing to save Kiyoko/Violet/Seisuke; playing over and over again. It was Lera's worst nightmare, despite Rias's attempt to tweak it down; that was simply because it was Lera's -only- nightmare.

It bothered her of course, but Lera had already been through shit and she knew this jutsu herself. It was a jutsu she found to be quite cruel in all honesty. Putting her hands together, she attempted to surge her chakra and break the genjutsu but was surprised to find that it didn't even twitch. So Rias hadn't exactly been telling the truth when she said she couldn't fight, she was a genjutsu specialist it seemed.

If she tried to fight Rias like this then the image was only going to distract her, as much as she had grown stronger in will; it still bothered her to see the image of her failures like this. So she took a thin strip of cloth and bound it around her eyes; at the same time she reached back and untied just a little of the cloth on Samehada, revealing a bit of the grey a the tip of the blade.* - Sat Nov 14 06:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm.. - Sat Nov 14 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Wow - Sat Nov 14 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He's also attacked my home village before as well. - Sat Nov 14 07:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: What Hassan was talking about - Sat Nov 14 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: A Bijuu? - Sat Nov 14 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: BIjuu. - Sat Nov 14 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I feel like i've heard that term somewhere before. - Sat Nov 14 07:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) glanced at Izanami knowingly, Lera knew more than most would realise.* - Sat Nov 14 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A bijuu is a large creature constructed of Chakra. - Sat Nov 14 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Generally quite destructive and immensely powerful. - Sat Nov 14 07:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: So like what I saw in tetsumi - Sat Nov 14 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Now I remember. - Sat Nov 14 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Anyway! - Sat Nov 14 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *Yawn* - Sat Nov 14 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Enough about that, can I get a spar? - Sat Nov 14 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I haven't had one in like...a few months now.~ - Sat Nov 14 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yea you two spar - Sat Nov 14 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I cant spar with anyone - Sat Nov 14 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm.. - Sat Nov 14 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* I don't mind. - Sat Nov 14 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I believe little Izanami is actually stronger than me though. - Sat Nov 14 07:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Surprised Fuji doesn't raise awareness of Bijuu. - Sat Nov 14 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hah...don't sell yourself short Kiddo. - Sat Nov 14 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *grins* Thanks. - Sat Nov 14 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Start it off. - Sat Nov 14 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'm ready to start when you are. - Sat Nov 14 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm. - Sat Nov 14 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Okay. - Sat Nov 14 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *slaps her hand away* "NOT IN MY HOUSE!" - Sat Nov 14 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: -omit- - Sat Nov 14 07:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) glanced at her handseals, smiling a little; it was nice to see someone who still used the very basics. She was curious to know how much strength the little girl could exhibit, she was obviously faster than Lera but did she have to strength to back it up?

As Izanami neared her, she flowed chakra into her skin and hardened it to the point of diamond viscosity. She stood completely still while Izanami slammed the blunt edge of her blade into her body. It would probably hurt, but hopefully Izanami was not strong enough to break through the Domu technique. As the blade struck, she raised her hand and attempted to bring it down upon Izanami's head; knowing her Kawarami would save her from any damage.* - Sat Nov 14 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) brought her hands together to form her own handseals, Izanami's katon jutsu were significantly better than hers were; so clashing jutsu was out of the question. Instead, she decided the best course was to take advantage of Katon's base weakness.

With handseals completely, she breathed in deep and spewed out a huge volume of water; aiming to override the fireball completely and probably wash the little girl away while she was at it.* - Sat Nov 14 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stayed rooted in spot, glancing upwards at Izanami with raised eyebrows. That was certainly a unique way to gain flight, maybe it was possible to fly with every element. What she hadn't expected was the speed though, Izanami shot forwards like a bullet; slamming the blunt part of the blade right into her stomach.

She let out a little 'ooph' doubling over as the blow took its toll, even with the Domu technique she had definitely felt that. Lera wasn't one to bow out of a fight though and thus she lashed out to grab Izanami's shoulder. In reality, all she needed was one little touch; a poke would do just fine. As soon as she did, the chakra channeling through her fingers would take affect on Izanami; increasing her weight exponentially until she could no longer move.* - Sat Nov 14 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Only if he could do that... - Sat Nov 14 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) winced as the flames took effect, Doton was quite good at defending against the flames but izanami's skill was so much higher that she might as well have covered her skin in paper; for all the difference it would make. With a grunt of pain, she jumped backwards; releasing Izanami in the process.

Once she took her distance she tried to shake off the uncomfortable warm feeling in her hand while the other hand rested on her stomach. Kiyoko was gonna have fun with that bruise for sure...* - Sat Nov 14 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Jeesh...when your kid niece surpasses you.. - Sat Nov 14 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Gotta work harder... - Sat Nov 14 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) rubbed her sore tummy and reached for Samehada on her back. Once the hilt was in her grip the blade would wriggle with anticipation and seemed to swell a little under its bandages. She held up her hand and gave the universal gesture for 'Come at me'* - Sat Nov 14 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) drew back her arm and went for a wide swing, a lttile contact; just a graze really, was all that she needed. If she was able to clip both the clones they would abruptly vanish, with all the chakra having been torn from their bodies. If she was successful, she'd form a single handseal around Samehada's hilt and create her own clones; four of them in total. The only difference is that they did not share her Domu technique, she knew it would cause them to disperse far too quickly.* - Sat Nov 14 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll Waited while each clone formed their handseals, dropping their fake clone versions of Samehada in the process. Then when handseals were complete, they each drew in a breath and exhaled a gust of wind. Due to the clones being shadows of the original; their elemental strength was lesser. However, on contact with the flaming shuriken; the blasts of wind would ignite into a humongous fireball.

Lera watched this with some trepidation, though she knew Izanami could just activate her Fire shroud and take no damage from her puny flames. It still didn't feel right using such force against a girl who was really no more than a child.* - Sat Nov 14 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised another eyebrow, that was unexpected for sure. Her Wind jutsu was torn to pieces, only serving to enhance the strength of Izanami's fireball. Her shadow clones of course were lost instantly. Lera however used the great fireball as a method to obscure Izanami's vision. When the flames reeached her position; and washed over where she should have been. Izanami would see that she simply wasn't there anymore, having dissapeared underground.* - Sat Nov 14 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) 'swam' through the earth as if it were water, she had no idea that Izanami could sense her and so she did of course go about doing what she thought was the best course of action. So she 'swam' to a position directly below Izanami and attempted to reach for her ankles and pull her under.* - Sat Nov 14 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started in shock as Izanami 'dodged' her, almost as if she knew exactly where she was in the first place. The only thought that went through her head was 'Jesus fuck, she's a sensor as well??? What can't this girl do.'

With a slight grumble, she pulled herself above ground; brushing the dirt from her body and shaking it from Samehada. She took in another breath and cracked her neck from side to side. She was about to continue the fight when she saw kiyoko rolling up, looking as if something bad had gone down.

"Hun...? Whats wrong??"* - Sat Nov 14 08:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm..? - Sat Nov 14 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Kiyo* - Sat Nov 14 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My Dau- Nina?? - Sat Nov 14 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I suppose that's her name. - Sat Nov 14 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Sat Nov 14 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I thought she'd followed Ortho...crap. - Sat Nov 14 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In the hospital right?? - Sat Nov 14 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 14 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Wonder who beat up Nina.. whom. - Sat Nov 14 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Hmm* - Sat Nov 14 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Deez nuts - Sat Nov 14 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I should go see her. - Sat Nov 14 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: nods* - Sat Nov 14 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Seems the spar is over now. - Sat Nov 14 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Sat Nov 14 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You pushed yourself too hard. - Sat Nov 14 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took Kiyoko by the hand, immediately lightening her weight until she was floating an inch above ground. No use aggravating her wounds any further.* - Sat Nov 14 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I know...thank you... - Sat Nov 14 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: To the hospital then - Sat Nov 14 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right... - Sat Nov 14 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wandered into the room and looked the girl over, sighing quietly under her breath.

"Silly girl..."* - Sat Nov 14 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Fuck where is Mirai, I need my stitches patched up. - Sat Nov 14 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Sat Nov 14 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Sigh* Come on. Lets get you to a bed, you need fixing up. I'll go find a medic. - Sat Nov 14 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't need to be in bed, I'm just... ugh... - Sat Nov 14 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good. - Sat Nov 14 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) made a clone to sit with Kiyoko and gave her a quick kiss.

"Just in case you try to get away~"* - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...right right... - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Like I want to move.... - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll be back in a moment. - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned and rushed out of the room, time to search for Mirai.* - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: yeah - Sat Nov 14 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sighed quietly in her seat, she didn't know what to make of Nina anymore; it was all a bit confusing.

"No...that was someone else. Nina is...well, she sort of claimed me and Violet as her parents. After Violet died, Nina went with Ortho...I assumed she was either a part of it or she cared more for Ortho...truthfully I don't know what to think anymore."* - Sat Nov 14 09:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Wait what? - Sat Nov 14 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Went with Ortho? - Sat Nov 14 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes. - Sat Nov 14 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: She knew and was close with Ortho before she even knew me and Violet. - Sat Nov 14 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a big breath and nodded, not trusting herself to speak.* - Sat Nov 14 09:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What is it? - Sat Nov 14 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm a little scared. - Sat Nov 14 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Of Ortho? - Sat Nov 14 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Of what he could do to you if he had a change of heart. - Sat Nov 14 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't think he will, he was very genuine.... - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And after what he had to put me through don't you think he would have harmed me more? - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know...but that doesn't stop me from being scared. - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Love, he isn't going to harm me. - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And the fact I might have just saved the life of someone he cares about will only secure that more. - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded again, but it didn't help much.* - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why didn't you tell me about her? - Sat Nov 14 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It kind of was a slap in the face to find out about your daughter from your father.... - Sat Nov 14 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...didn't even of her. - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: After she went with Ortho...I guess I stopped thinking of her as my daughter. - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see. - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She doesn't feel the same. - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She called out your name. - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah... - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I should've made more effort to find her... - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just another mistake to add to my list. - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Sigh* - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked at her quizzically, wondering what it was she could be writing.* - Sat Nov 14 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What're you writing hun? - Sat Nov 14 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: A letter to Ortho, silly. - Sat Nov 14 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh right. - Sat Nov 14 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mkay, that's done. - Sat Nov 14 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've never strained myself like that before. - Sat Nov 14 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It feels like I've been hallowed out. - Sat Nov 14 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...I wish I could share my chakra with you. - Sat Nov 14 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That'd be nice, yeah... - Sat Nov 14 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I could t----I have an idea. - Sat Nov 14 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do you trust me? - Sat Nov 14 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...of course, silly. - Sat Nov 14 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took samehada from her back and held it out so Kiyoko could touch it "Samehada buddy...she really needs a bit of juice, give her some of mine. Please?"* - Sat Nov 14 09:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wrenched it back in a literal nano-second, groaning quietly under her breath.
