<br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grinned and gave Violet a little wave.

"Hey Violet~"* - Mon Sep 07 12:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled happily and grabbed hold of Violets hand, pulling her into the tightest hug she could possibly manage.* - Mon Sep 07 12:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gently let her go, stepping backwards with a pat on the little womans arm.

"Setsuna?"* - Mon Sep 07 12:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked around violet to see an even smaller girl, she didn't think they got smaller than violet.

"Hey~ I'm Lera!"* - Mon Sep 07 12:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked a little odd, confused even.* - Mon Sep 07 12:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Remember what we talked about Lera? About relationships.? - Mon Sep 07 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Yup! I remember. - Mon Sep 07 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: She is my girlfriend - Mon Sep 07 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Uh huh, I know. - Mon Sep 07 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) explodes?* - Mon Sep 07 12:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a deep breath, looking the chuunin up and down. He'd never seen this one, nevermind seen him fight. She didn't expect to win this, but she'd sure as hell give it her best shot.

Without any hesitation, she formed a single hand seal; having two clones made purely of mud rise from the earth either side of her. These two, would step in front of her; effectively shielding her from both view and harm while she started to form even more handseals.* - Mon Sep 07 13:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wasn't a paticularly fast or reflexive person, the moment her clones warned her of the water she knew the only course of action was to drop her jutsu and escape using other means. In this case, she stopped forming the handseals to form just a single seal. One of her clones stepped directly in front of the other; hopefully slowing the tide just enough to give herself and the second clone time to escape.

If successful, she would sink into the ground; the second clone performing the same handseal and sinking with her. Assuming all went well, she and the clone would now be moving opposite directions; to the right and left of Ikaro.* - Mon Sep 07 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had her clone rise from the ground first, forming her handseals as she set foot on the ground. It attempted to draw the chuunins attention and allow the original to pop back up out of sight also forming hand seals. Around the clone mud would begin rising from the ground, flowing towards Ikaro as a river. Moments after it sunk back into the ground, not to hide but simply because it had used up its meager supply of chakra.

Lera herself would take advantage of what she hoped was a suitable distraction, finishing her handseals and directing chakra towards Ikaro. If successful, he would find himself caught in a genjutsu. Multiple clones would begin forming around him, attacking without pause and only multiplying if they were struck.* - Mon Sep 07 14:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stayed silent, watching him carefully for any sign of movement. She realised he was taking it easy and by the way he shrugged off both her jutsu with ease; he didn't consider her a threat at all. Even if she couldn't win this, she wanted to at least impress him. Breathing in deeply, she put her hands together to form more handseals. She formed five in total, hoping that Ikaro would not recognise the handseals used to prepare kawarami hidden within those five.

Once done, she started moving forwards; slowly taking her time to approach the chuunin, she almost seemed confident.* - Mon Sep 07 14:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had no intention of dodging his strike, though she wonder if her jutsu might just stop him from attacking her alltogether. With but a single handseal, she thrust her palm forwards; appearing as if she were trying to slam a palm into his chest, her taijutsu, lacking as it was, would never allow that to happen however. Instead, as she pushed her palm forwards; a great gust of wind would fly outwards intending to blast him backwards.

If she was succesful in averting his strike, she would move away. However, if not; she would stand for a moment and watch the water come, bracing herself to be washed away.* - Mon Sep 07 14:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) widened her eyes, she'd never seen someone literally turn into a puddle before and although a strategy to combat that immediately popped into her mind, she was too slow to actually do it. Her Kawarami activated as intended, only to have her slammed by a wave of water. She was knocked to the ground, forced to grasp at rocks and plants to avoid being washed away. It was somewhat succesful, though her hands were badly scratched as a consequence.

If allowed, she would slowly pull herself back to her feet; flexing her fingers to make sure she could still form handseals. Once satisfied that all was in order, she started going through possible strategies. She could use her Raiton, though her control with it was lacking to say the least; with herself soaked like this, she may just end up shocking herself.

With a small nod, she decided to employ one of the last strategies she had availlable. Though she knew full well his water would counter it quite easily, it was the last thing she had that she was certain he couldn't just avoid with his water form. Running to the side, she moved ontro dryer ground; forming some handseals and pulling back her head.

Exhaling through her teeth, she spat out a stream of flames; flames that would stick to the ground and continue to burn, effectively creating a small bonfire between the two of them. If he realised her plan, then this would be over before it even began; but for now, she simply prepared to use her next jutsu.* - Mon Sep 07 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) cut off her control over the flames immediately, watching them die down till only natural flames were left behind; even those quickly sputtered out, unable to consume the damp grass as fuel.

"Yeah...Or at least, last time I checked I did. I was in Squad 1 the offense squad. Unless its changed?"* - Mon Sep 07 15:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) dipped into one of her holsters and pulled out two scrolls, scribbling the details for the jutsu in each before handing them over to Tethys.

"And yup, hassan-Sensei is awesome at wind."* - Wed Sep 09 08:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched him perform the jutsu, a little frown on her face as she saw the damage potential behind it. She could see, even with only one shot, a well placed bullet could definitely kill an opponent. Considering this was several shots in one go, the killing potetntial was extremely high; this was something she would have to use with extreme care. Then again, she had to actually learn the jutsu first; it was easily far beyond the level of any jutsu she'd used so far.

To the untrained eye, it might look like great breakthrough was a more powerful jutsu. However, she could see that this jutsu had all the power of great breakthrough, only it was condensed down into much smaller spheres. That would take an extreme level of control; nothing like anything she'd learned thus far. Either way, there was no use standing there thinking about it; the only way forward was to try it.

Turning to the wall, she sucked in a big breath and exhaled; using it to calm herself and find her centre, she found it easier to control her chakra if she was calm. Using Hassan's demonstration as a reference, she took in another breath; forming handseals and moulding her chakra into the air as she did. She tried to imagine the chakra being compressed further and further until it took the shape of small spheres.

As soon as she thought it was ready, she exhaled; releasing the wind towards the wall in what she hoped was a bundle of wind bullets. Instead, what came out of her mouth was a very different type of wind. She let out the most mammoth belch she...and probably anyone else had ever heard before. With an embarrassed squeak, she raised a hand to her mouth and tried to fight the obvious blush coming on. Before Hassan could comment on her comical failure however, she got right back to it.

Obviously something had gone wrong there, whether it was simply because she'd have a severe case of trapped gas or the jutsu had failed; she didn't know. Perhaps her mistake had been letting it out all in one go. Hassan had said it was like Great Breakthrough; but there was obviously going to be a few differences. Making a few mental notes to herself, she started forming the handseals again; whilst drawing in the biggest breath she could manage.

Holding it there while she moulded the chakra was actually quite difficult, not to mention that her already minimal level of chakra control made this even harder. Either way, it was better to just try it and fail so she could get back up and try it again. Rather than sit and think about it without ever trying it at all. She figured it was always better to practice a jutsu by trial and error. No matter how many times she got it wrong, she would eventually get the jutsu right.

As she exhaled, she thought about small compressed bullets; imagining her chakra taking that shape and flying right for the wall. She at least this time managed to have the wind come from her mouth rather than an errant belch of epic proportions. However, the wind left her mouth in what could almost be described as an explosion; forcing her head backwards and causing her to fall on her ass.

She rubbed her cheeks with a groan, it felt like it was going to rip her jaw in half, not really a pleasent feeling for sure. Not that a little setback like this would make her give up, she didn't even show any frustration at her failure. Instead her face only showed an excitement that she'd never experienced when learning a jutsu before. Always, she'd been able to learn a jutsu with minimal effort; everything just came easily to her. This though, was the most difficult jutsu she'd ever attempted to learn.

Now that she'd learned the hard way that just blowing wind out of her mouth was possibly dangerous to her own health; she approached the jutsu with just a little bit more caution. She figured, the best way to learn was to not replicate Hassans demonstration exactly but to tone it down and then gradually work her way up. Nobody became a master on the first attempt, that was for sure.

Instead of trying to blow a hail of wind bullet from her mouth, she figured it would be better to start with just the one. As she came to that conclusion, she also started to think about what she'd done wrong with her other attempts. So far she'd been attempting to release the wind from within her and as it left her mouth. So now she would try releasing it as it moved through her mouth.

Forming the handseals, she started to gather the chakra in her lungs; exhaling it outwards into her mouth. Using every bit of control she could muster, she condensed the wind into the smallest ball she could manage and almost seemed to spit it out. With a gasp of delight, she watched as a small bullet shot from her pursed lips and dissapeared shortly before hitting the wall. Clearrly she'd gotten the technique down, now she just needed to get the right amount of power.

Nodding completely to herself, she went through what she'd just attempted several times. It looked like there was a certain way of using the tongue to guide the wind down and out of the mouth; spitting it out in shape of a bullet. When she though she was ready, she began forming the handseals once more and gathering the chakra in her lungs.

Hoping very much that she didn't accidently rip her own jaw off, she quickly exhaled in a big gust. Letting the wind roll down her tongue and out through her pursed lips. The effect was isntantaneous and oddly similar to a machine gun. Bullets rained from her mouth, though no-where near as numerous or as powerful as Hassans. They struck the wall, leaving chips and cracks rather tha boring holes. Clearly there was still much work to be done if she wanted to reach Hassan's level, but the technique had been learned.* - Wed Sep 09 12:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) watched him charge the ball of lightning, a little smirk crossing her lips; she was a little impressed and eager to learn his techniques, but she wouldn't lose for it. With the smile still playing over her lips, she formed a single handseal and started to rush forwards appearing to run straight into the ball of electricity. Instead, she thrust a palm forwards; releasing a large blast of wind straight forward.

Using the inherent weakness of lightning, she hoped to completely destroy his jutsu and perhaps even knock him from his feet. From there, she waited for his next move; not being one who really fought in close range, she couldn't be sure she could win if it moved to close combat.* - Thu Sep 10 14:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) now opening grinning, she formed another handseal; causing the earth at her feet to quiver and constrict before rising to form a human shape. Within just a moment a perfect copy of herself had formed from mud and rock, striding forward to meet Ken in close combat. If Ken continue to attack, it wouldn't even bother to block; letting the kick strike it in the side. If successful, ken's foot would sink into her clones side and stick there.

Lera knew the clone would be relatively easy to destroy with his Raiton, so she would let him do so. While she waited, she'd be forming a few more handseals in preperationg for her next jutsu.* - Thu Sep 10 14:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finished her handseals and directed her chakra towards Ken, hopefully catching him within her genjutsu. If successful, her would find himself surrounded by a multitude of clones; rising from the ground just as her Doton clone had done moments before. Each would attack him in unison, though each appeared to have absolutely no skill with Taijutsu; making them extremely easy to dodge and dispatch.

However, every time a clone was destroyed; two more would appear in its place, threatening to eventually overwhelm the boy. All the while, Lera herself would be walking through the clones in the background; preparing yet another jutsu.* - Thu Sep 10 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed a single handseal, sinking into the ground and leaving him to fend off the multitude of clones. Though none of them could actually cause him harm, she hoped he wouldn't notice that; the point of the jutsu was to force him to exhaust himself. While he fought, she would be moving ever closer under the earth; completely aware of his every movement.* - Thu Sep 10 14:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) goes off on an epic flower delivering adventure!* - Fri Sep 11 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) went through the scroll a little frown etched upon her face, she hadn't expected a mission so simple; not that she'd expected to be fighting bandits or anything...but an E rank? Either way, a mission was a mission and she intended to impress. She paticularly liked the bonus 'sing a song' that she could do, her mother always told her she could sing well. It was better than her cooking at least. She didn't care so much about the money, she had plenty of that; but she simply wanted to impress as much as possible, perhaps get a D rank mission next time.

Before anything, she decided to go to the man who'd ordered the flowers for his lover; maybe if she got some more details on his lovers preferences first, she could impress that much more. Before arriving at his residence, she changed into the best dress she had and put on her formal look. Though a little skeptical that a teenager was sent to survey his love, he did at least seem to apreciate her effort. After recieving a short love ballad from him and a bouquet of his lovers favourite flowers, she set off towards her home.

At the door, she knocked three times and took a few steps back; flowers behind her back and she waited. A few moments later, the door opened up and she started to sing. Thankfully, her mother was right; her voice was almost made to sing, rising and falling in perfect pitch with a clarity that could bring tears to ones eye. The woman simply stood there, a little hand held over her mouth with an astonished look to her face.

As soon as she was done, the woman began clapping enthusiastically; allowing Lera to hand over the flowers and say.

"With love! From (insert name of the dude here)~"

Without another word, she winked and turned away; trying to ignore the crazy fast pace at which her heart was beating, that woman was the first person she'd ever sung to besides her mother and she'd be lieing if she said she wasn't a little nervous.* - Fri Sep 11 14:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looks down at the other scroll she'd just recieved, it was another simple one; but a mission was a mission. With a little nod to herself, she rushed off to complete it.* - Fri Sep 11 14:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) read through the scroll while she walked, it really was extremely simple; at least singing a song had actually been sort of fun, though the labour would probably good for her at least. She contemplated the idea that she could probably fill the hole so easily, just a few handseals and one jutsu; boom, hole filled. Though she expected that defeated the purpose of hard labour entirely. She almost changed her mind about that when she saw the hole, it was absolutely huge; it would take way too long for her to fill it just by herself.

Still, she'd told herself she wouldn't fill it with a Doton jutsu; so she went and grabbed a spade then went at it. The dirt was piled up nearby in a huge mound, someone with a little less brains might have wondered how to move all that dirt to the hole. For Lera though, she just grabbed a nearby wheelbarrow and started piling dirt into it. Lera recognised that she wasn't one of the physically stronger shinobi, with her forte being long ranged ninjutsu; the physical aspects of her training were sorely lacking.

Due to that little issue, she was struggling more than she cared to admit; the tedious and almost endless task of shoveling dirt into a wheelbarrow was starting to make her shoulders burn. Not to mention that actually wheeling all the dirt over to the hole and then letting it fall over the edge was also difficult. Dirt, it turned out, was actually quite heavy. While she worked, she began to think of ways to do this a bit faster; without filling up the hole entirely with a Doton jutsu.

You could almost see the little lightbulb above her head when an idea came to her, she didn't have to do this alone at all. Forming a single handseal, she created four Doton clones from the very earth she was attempting to fill the hole with. Each clone went for their own shovels and wheelbarrows, beginning to move back and forth between the mound and hole to fill it that much faster. Someone else might have sat back and just left them to it, but not Lera. Instead, she mucked in with them; moving just as much if not more, in the end this was actually pretty good training.

Eventually, the hole was mostly fully; the mound of dirt  completely gone. Her clone stood atop the newly filled hole and sank into it; adding the dirt used to create them to its mass. With that done, she went for an extra touch; rolling a strange contraption over the dirt and flattening it down. The only way know this had even been a hole now was the dark circle of earth surrounded by grass. To finish, she tossed grass seeds onto the earth and walked back towards Tethys.* - Fri Sep 11 14:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't help a little sigh escape her lips when she read the scroll, but she wasn't going to complain about it. Though the missions seemed less like missions and more like janitor jobs, she went into the mansion to retrieve a broom and moved onto the kage mansion steps. It would be easy to just blow the dust away with a jutsu, but with Tethy's standing just a few feet away...she figured he'd think it was cheating.

Starting from the top, she started to sweep the dust down the steps; concentrating it into small piles and the collecting it into a little bag. It was definitely boring work, there was definitely more interesting missions to do she was sure. Though she wasn't going to get them until she proved herself a little more, so the easy missions would have to do for now.

Sighing again she picked up her broom and got back to work, sweeping everything down to the bottom of the steps until a small pile of it lay on the floor. The steps got surprisingly dirty quickly, she was pretty sure she'd seen another genin doing the same job just a few days ago. Taking a smaller brush, she swept the the remainder of the dirt into her bag and went over the wastebin to dispose of it. Hoping that maybe Tethys would give her a better missiong next time. * - Fri Sep 11 15:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) nodded once at Tethys's explanation, it did seem like a pretty simple technique and endlessly useful; though she imagined there were side effects, it'd take a lot of training to move that fast and have no side effects. Taking in a deep breath, she formed the handseal and did exactly as Tethys explained. Syncing her breath was pretty easy, she just hoped that the jutsu worked as she intended it.

Stepping forward in almost a jump, she attempted to move as fast as she could; using the chakra in her legs to propell herself forwards. Only, she instead fell flat on her face; her legs tangling themselves up and completely destroying her balance. She hadn't even moved an inch from  her original position, so this was obviously a failure. Ever so slowly, she brought herself back to her feet; rubbing her sore nose with a groan. The only thing she could think she'd done wrong was not put enough into the jutsu.

Forming the handseal once more, she concentrated on putting more chakra into the jutsu; as much as she possibly could. Once ready, she took a step forward and pushed off; abruptly vanishing. However at some point during the technique, she lost control of her speed and fell forwards into a roll; landing on her back with another groan. Clealy you couldn't just put everything into the jutsu either.

Slowly, she tried to get back up; she felt dizzy, dizzier than she had ever felt before, as well as nasous. So these were the side effects to using the jutsu, if that was the case she could only really use it if she absolutely had to. Either way, it was still a useful technique to know. For a while, she waited until the dizziness wore off; which was thankfully quite fast, not fast enough if were a real battle, but not enough to bother her too much.

Back on her feet again, she readied herself to attempt the jutsu one more time; forming her handseal focusing what she hoped was exactly the right amount of chakra to her legs. When ready, she pushed off again and vanished with a slight puff of smoke. Though there was a little stumble along the way, she managed to stay on her feet; though the nausea hit almost as hard as before. For now though, she had at least learned the technique.* - Fri Sep 11 16:39:02 2015

"Okay, this one is pretty simple; though its really useful. You have to direct your chakra to the earth at your feet and soften it, to really really fine sand. Its...kinda like swimming through water, but you have to concentrate at all times. Wouldn't want to get trapped under there~"

As a demonstration, she formed the one handseal that was needed and slowly sank into the ground at her feet. A few steps closer to the pair, she would pop her head back above ground and talk again.

"Give it a go~ Oh and as a useful coincidence, this jutsu lets you sense everything happening above ground...so you sort've see more when your under."* - Fri Sep 11 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh~ Kirie? - Fri Sep 11 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Hmm? - Fri Sep 11 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm teaching these two some Doton jutsu, you wanted to learn some Katon right? - Fri Sep 11 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Fri Sep 11 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: That would be nice. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can teach you now if you want. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Mind making a scroll or two for me? - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I have to go do a mission. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ahh, okay~ sure. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Thanks. - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled out a couple of blank scrolls and scribble her instructions on the inside.* - Fri Sep 11 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its okay~ I like teaching people. - Fri Sep 11 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, you're welcome~ - Fri Sep 11 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Practice and you'll get it down quick~ But still, you got that pretty fast. - Fri Sep 11 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Wasn't good enough. Fast doesn't mean it's perfected. - Fri Sep 11 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, but thats why you practice. - Fri Sep 11 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Of course. - Fri Sep 11 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You'll have to practice that one alot before I can teach you how to trap people underground. - Fri Sep 11 17:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No point in doing that. I simply asked for the point of remaining alive in a battle. - Fri Sep 11 17:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I simply have to keep the mindset of knowing that if I go down my squad'll be considered down without me to support them. - Fri Sep 11 17:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: At the same time, I need to know how to defend myself. That's my reason for wanting to take advantage of the affinities that I possess. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Not sure how to take her... - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its the same for me. I wanted to learn a jutsu for all of my affinities, so I did. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm not too keen on wanting to die either. It'd be cruel of me to abandon Violet. And I know for a fact that I wouldn't do that. It seems this relationship I'm in with her has affected me. For the better, obviously. - Fri Sep 11 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...Violets Nice. I like her a lot too. - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Like her a lot? That's an understatement for my feelings about her. I don't date people unless I love them deeply. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I uh...don't really understand all that stuff. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's not normal for girls to like other girls. That's what I've been told. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why not? - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: First relationships lasting are rare, if you are able to pick that good a partner I be surpsied. - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't know why. I don't agree with it either. Love is love. - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yup...even if I don't really get it. It shouldn't matter. - Fri Sep 11 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't care whether someone likes men or women honestly. - Fri Sep 11 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't see what the big deal about love is. - Fri Sep 11 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uhm...what I think...is its probably really nice. - Fri Sep 11 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Nice? - Fri Sep 11 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I agree with you, HImura. - Fri Sep 11 17:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I just don't see why people have children or get married...I could never do that. - Fri Sep 11 17:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And besides...if its two girls, they can't have children. - Fri Sep 11 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well there is adoption. - Fri Sep 11 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But that's besides the point, I just don't get the whole love thing. - Fri Sep 11 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: That part I won't agree on, but it's a hassle. Living with someone put strains, changing friends to loved ones, and so on and on. Can just be a big headache. - Fri Sep 11 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Trusting someone so deeply? Nope, not for me. - Fri Sep 11 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood in front of him, trying...and failing at looking seductive.

"Really?~"* - Fri Sep 11 17:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So I can't say the feeling is mutual. - Fri Sep 11 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But yes, Clones. - Fri Sep 11 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: My god go back to the training. - Fri Sep 11 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Don't we need some mud to work with? - Fri Sep 11 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope. - Fri Sep 11 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...actually maybe you guys do. - Fri Sep 11 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One second. - Fri Sep 11 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh, Whatever you say I guess. - Fri Sep 11 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Just soften the ground with your chakra and mush the soil around. - Fri Sep 11 17:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Actually.. - Fri Sep 11 17:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't know what to think of Himura, he seemed to be constantly depressed. She almost wanted to help him...almost. With a little shake of her head, she formed a couple of handseals and let summoned a small amount of mud for those two to use.* - Fri Sep 11 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Akemi(Pokemon Bradley) says: WHAAAAAT AREEEE THOOOSE - Fri Sep 11 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It'll be easier to practice with mud, but when you get better at it you can just use normal dirt. - Fri Sep 11 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Akemi(Pokemon Bradley) says: omit - Fri Sep 11 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I see...Ok. - Fri Sep 11 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So if I use this with mud silhouette...that should be good. - Fri Sep 11 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed another handseal, having two perfect replica's of herself rise from the ground in front of her.

"Once again, its just one handseal. The clones are made completely of mud, when they get hit they reform as long as you supply the chakra. You can also use them to bind someone...like this."

One of her clones lurched towards the other and wrapped its arms around it. Soon after it transformed back into sticky mud and effectively bound the second clones movements.

"Use the bunshin jutsu as a basis, only use your earth chakra with it instead."* - Fri Sep 11 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I see I see...Hm ok. - Fri Sep 11 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: While you guys do that, i'll practice my own jutsu~ - Fri Sep 11 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad~ - Fri Sep 11 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned away from the trio and adjusted her attention to a nearby tree, it would serve as a suitable target for her jutsu. Hassan had told her to practice this jutsu, so practice it she would. Though she wasn't keen on the idea of its killing capabilities. Taking in a deep breath, she held the air inside her lungs and began channeling her chakra while she formed the handseals. With a sudden lurch forwards, she opened her mouth and exhaled explosively.

Several tiny bullets of wind flew from her mouth in an almost shotgun pattern. They flew towards the tree at great speed before slamming into it with a great crack. She was as several small holes were burrowed into the tree, smiling at her progress. Before she had barely been able to leave a crack on the wall, though if Hassan had done it the tree would probably have been blown in half. For now though, she was happy with her progress.* - Fri Sep 11 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I did it Lera... - Fri Sep 11 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: That was pretty...taxing... - Fri Sep 11 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're getting there~ - Fri Sep 11 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm....you both know Suimen right? - Fri Sep 11 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Indeed, - Fri Sep 11 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And Kai? - Fri Sep 11 17:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Indeed, - Fri Sep 11 17:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I learned them at the same time. - Fri Sep 11 17:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't know eiter. - Fri Sep 11 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Through a very...not so fun method. - Fri Sep 11 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay, I can teach you both Setsuna. - Fri Sep 11 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll start with suimen, kay? - Fri Sep 11 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 11 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm...Damn. - Fri Sep 11 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I held a class on this a few days ago. - Fri Sep 11 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Thought I taught everyone that didn't know. - Fri Sep 11 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) walked out onto the water as if it were the most casual thing anyone could do.

"Suimen's really useful, you can also walk up vertical surfaces and ceilings if you felt like it. Basically, all you need to do is focus a coating of chakra to the souls of your feet. Water is harder to walk on than a flat surface, but I think you'll get it pretty quickly."* - Fri Sep 11 17:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Get her to go up a tree first. - Fri Sep 11 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's easier to do that, then walk on water. - Fri Sep 11 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I started on water. - Fri Sep 11 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And she actually learns faster than me.... - Fri Sep 11 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Either way going up a tree is neccesary. But you're the teacher here. - Fri Sep 11 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Lera, didn't I learn Suimen with you under Noriko at the waterfall? - Fri Sep 11 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yup. - Fri Sep 11 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Lera, has this then. Don't worry about Himura. - Fri Sep 11 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I learned from Koeki the medical ninja so...whatever... - Fri Sep 11 17:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: *shuttered as he remembered splashing in the cold water.* Its a good spot of training to make you not want to fail. - Fri Sep 11 17:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) summoned her clone, intending to use it as a target for the genjutsu she intended to practice. It was true that she'd gotten significantly better at using her genjutsu, though there were still things she had to practice. In this case she wanted to practic the Mist servant technique a few more times, bring the jutsu up to a level where she could call it mastered. She had never intended to bring her genjutsu up to a specialisation, but at least knowing a few of the jutsu it entailed was quite useful. They made for a good distracion if nothing else.

While she stared pointedly at the clone and formed her handseals, chakra would be directed towards it; intending to trigger the genjutsu and cause it to fall under it. In the clones eyes, all it would see would be a multitude of clones. Clones that would attack and multiply almost endlessly, intent on causing the victim to wear themselves down. Though the clones could actually cause no damage themselves, they made a useful distraction. Now that she thought of it, it might be a good idea to develop a strategy to make it seem like the clones were attacking.

She looked on with a happy smile, the effectiveness and number of clones had increase almost five fold since the first tme she had learned it. Though its mastering took far longer than she'd actually wanted, it was still coming along quite nicely. With a click of her fingers, she disabled the genjutsu and let the clone stand unharmed. The next jutsu to practice on her list was one she'd avoided using, a jutsu that revealed the victims worst fears was a cruel one and not something you would use on a friend.

With a heavy sigh, she formed her handseals and pointed at the clone once more. Almost immediately, a circle of leaves would form around the clone; triggering the start of the genjutsu. In truth, she was not as skilled with this one as the other genjutsu; due to her reluctance to use it or even practice it. She watched as the clones face blanched in horror, staring at some fear invisible to Lera's eyes.

She'd already been shown some of her worst fears during the chuunins exam and even now they still bothered her. So she knew exactly how her clone was feeling seeing the object of her worst fears, for those fears were Lera's fears. With a little shudder, she waved her hand and disabled both the clone and the genjutsu entirely. Lera had to kind of a heart to make people suffer through that kind of genjutsu, in fact she felt a little sick at what she'd just done.* - Sat Sep 12 04:20:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: All I have is Genjutsu Kai, and for wind jutsu I learned everything except chakra flow from Lera... who learned from Hassan. - Sat Sep 12 06:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh. You'll have to ask Hassan-sensei, he said that theres some things he'll teach me that I shouldn't teach anyone else. - Sat Sep 12 06:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And uh, I know two genjutsu. - Sat Sep 12 06:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But They should be in the archives. - Sat Sep 12 06:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I.. don't have access to the archives Noriko made. - Sat Sep 12 06:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I.. lost the key to them. - Sat Sep 12 06:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Oh. - Sat Sep 12 06:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled out some scrolls and handed them to Tethys.

"You might already know them."* - Sat Sep 12 06:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh huh - Sat Sep 12 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well uh, Tethys-sama. Did you learn any new Doton jutsu? - Sat Sep 12 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Apart from making a little clone from the earth, no. - Sat Sep 12 06:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Aw. - Sat Sep 12 06:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Didn't I give him that one? - Sat Sep 12 06:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You want more Doton jutsu? I have a few. - Sat Sep 12 06:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Yeah, sure. - Sat Sep 12 06:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Thanks. - Sat Sep 12 06:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Well, I guess if anybody needs genjutsu disappation or some low level wind jutsus. I won't mind teaching them. - Sat Sep 12 06:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) handed him more scrolls.* - Sat Sep 12 06:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Once I advance my arsenal, you two know I'll be sure to teach you what I don't know. - Sat Sep 12 06:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I look forward to it~ - Sat Sep 12 06:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Hmm. Seems I already have these, but I'll save them to put in the archive. - Sat Sep 12 06:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay~ - Sat Sep 12 06:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway. Anymore missions Tethys-sama...? - Sat Sep 12 06:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I was about to ask... - Sat Sep 12 06:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put an arm around Jins shoulders with a little grin.

"We could go together~"* - Sat Sep 12 06:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Sat Sep 12 07:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: And maybe we'll get something tougher than sweeping the stairs... - Sat Sep 12 07:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Anything but listening to a Political Group Meeting. - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Mission..? - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Fight me. - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course it be that... but sure whatever, if its for a mission.  - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Let's see what you've two got team wise against a little 'ol weak Tethys. - Sat Sep 12 07:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Sat Sep 12 07:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm~ - Sat Sep 12 07:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 12 07:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: If I use fire and set the ground on fire, you can blast it with wind straight at him. - Sat Sep 12 07:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Alright. You two may have the first moves each. - Sat Sep 12 07:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Was going to ask that... But, I'm not too strong in the ninjutsu department. - Sat Sep 12 07:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Its fine, we're here to show our teamwork~ - Sat Sep 12 07:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) whispers: Don't seperate, unless theres a big jutsu he lets out... if he even takes us seriously. - Sat Sep 12 07:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I was going to suggest we go in two different directions. Its harder to fight two opponents that way. - Sat Sep 12 07:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) started immediately with a few handseals, moving herself to the left and directing her attention to the ground inbetween the two of them and Tethys. Once her handseals were done, she took in a deep breath and put a hand to her mouth. With a great exhalation of breath; she let out a large ball of flames from between her pursed lips. Though it was nothing compared to someone who'd been trained in Katon jutsu, it was enough for this case. Jin would know what to do from there.* - Sat Sep 12 07:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) whispers: If you wish, its just I don't know how fast he is. But, I can seperate. If you're in trouble I'll get to you quickly, or if I see an oppertunity I'll take it. - Sat Sep 12 07:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'll get him out! - Sat Sep 12 07:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stopped dead and immediately started forming more handseals, she saw that he'd somehow dissapeared in the aftermath of their jutsu. That mean either two things, that he'd sunk into the ground as she knew he was capable of. Or he had used shunshin to escape. Hoping that she might have seen him re-appear if the latter was the case, she assumed he'd gone underground. The only way to stop him was to get him out now before he changed locations. She didn't really fancy the idea of having to go underground to fight him alone.

Once the jutsu was ready, she slammed her palms down on the ground and sent arcs of Raiton towards the spot he'd once been standing. If her assumption was correct and he hadn't move fast enough, she hoped the Raiton might encourage him to come out.* - Sat Sep 12 07:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) also took a quick jump to the side, watching her Raiton justu wiped out like it was nothing. However, she had accomplished her aim of getting him back above ground. She wasn't a paticularly reflexive or fast person, so escaping the wind jutsu was not completely possible and she was forced to stumble backwards as she was battered by the edge of his jutsu. As soon as she regained her balance, she took note of Jin's attacks and went to do her own.

Going through a string of handseals, she breathed in deeply and let out an explosive exhale of wind. The jutsu seemed incredibly similar to great breakthrough, however instead of a great gust of wind she release a multitude of wind bullets. Capable of ripping through wood, rock and skin if necessary. She didn't hold back like she might have on someone else, she knew Tethys could handle anything they threw at him.* - Sat Sep 12 07:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) saw him slip into the ground this time, knowing that her Raiton jutsu could be negated easily; the only other thing to do was to either join him underground or prepare their jutsu and wait. In this situation, it was better to stick together than split apart. So she started slowly moving towards Jin, keeping her eyes firmly fixed on the ground. 

If she were Tethys right now, she would target herself and try to use the Headhunter technique. Using it on Jin was point as Lera could just pull him back out with her own jutsu. So she prepared herself to use Hiding like a mole if he should attempt to drag her underground.* - Sat Sep 12 07:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was caught off guard by Tethys' sudden re-appearence; if she hadn't had hiding like a mole prepared for use before hand then the jutsu would have struck her. She considered attempting to pull Jin with her, though she didn't know if she was able to. Rather than risk it, she just trusted that he had his own plan of escape.

As soon as she was safely underground, she would pay very close attention to what was happening above ground; thinking carefully of a plan. While she was at it, she'd be trying to follow whatever direction Jin took.* - Sat Sep 12 08:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) popped back up on the other side of Tethys the moment she sensed Jins movement, though she didn't get too close. She ignored the newly found covering of mud on her hair and clothes, thanks to Tethys' jutsu. With her attentions focused on Tethys, she started forming new handseals. Though in truth she had no idea whether this jutsu would actually work on Tethys, it was most certainly worth a try.

As she directed her chakra towards him, she attempted to capture him within a genjutsu. If successful, a number of clones would rise up around him; clones of both herself and Jin. These clones would begin attacking relentlessly, though they seemed to be incredibly bad at taijutsu and dispatching and dodging them was incredibly easy. However, with every clone dispatched another two would take their places. Though she knew a jutsu like this would be not so effective against Tethys, hopefully it would distract him enough for a few moments.* - Sat Sep 12 08:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) (*Jin Karuzo quickly backed away, as he formed a quick tiger seal. He then disappeared in a puff of smoke that was quickly swallowed up by the mud. Which also took the genin's pack with it which made his pontential switch ruined. 

The point he decided to land was rather obvious, as he appeared right behind Tethys. His body suffering from the jutsu, but as best he can he moved his body in position to attack Tethys the moment he landed. Mainly aiming to give a kick if he could recovered in time.*)
* - Sat Sep 12 08:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) (*Jin Karuzo looked over to Lera, as their attacks once again failed to connect, and she moved closer to him. He took a moment to think about, which Tethys would target. He sighed, having no thoughts on what he could do. <He could focus me... And beat me hand to hand, but Lera atleast has some jutsus to support from a far. Lera is more vulnerable to close combat, and my jutsus can only help mid to short range.> 

Dumping out the contents of his back pouch.He then formed a series of handseals, and took to running besides Lera. Charging chakra through the pack. He let go of it mid run. He then stopped besides Lera ready to jump in against Tethys if he showed up.*)* - Sat Sep 12 08:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had no chance of moving quickly enough to get away and her skill with shunshin was so bad that using it in battle was almost pointless. There was a chance she could slip away underground but that would only get here away for a moment or two. So doing the only thing she could think of, she formed a handseal; moving backwards as fast as she could at the same time. In front of her two clones would rise from the mude Tethys had created. If they were indeed quick enough, they would block his path and make an attempt to grab him.

Though the chances of success were minimal, the clones would form back into mud around his body. However, if Tethys was indeed too fast for her; she'd end up being swatted aside much like Jin was.* - Sat Sep 12 09:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took his hand allowing herself to be pulled up. She faced him with a wry grin, still clutching her shoulder where Tethys struck her.

"Thanks~ I'm Lera, nice to meet you."* - Sat Sep 12 10:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) couldn't help but blush, this was the first time anyone had put the charms on her and he certainly did it well.

"U-uhm...no, It'll be fine I think..and thankyou"* - Sat Sep 12 10:40:12 2015
