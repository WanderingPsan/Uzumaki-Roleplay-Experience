<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lifted the heavy pack onto her shoulders, stumbling under the sheer weight of it. Just a little earlier on, she'd spent time gather rocks of varying sizes; slipping them into a backpack for her training. It might have been fact that she was putting too much onto herself, training too hard; but she had a lot of goals to meet and not enough time to meet them.

Just lately, she'd been having a new and interesting idea; she remembered rumors of a group who carried the seven legendary swords; one of which she posessed herself. She knew Violet had one of them, the dual Raiton blades; though she had no idea what they were called. With that, there was already two back in the hands of Kirigakure and Lera suspected that Fujitora might have at least one other, if not more.

She had an idea to rebuild the organisation that was once unique to Kirigakure, the seven swordsmen of the mist. Before she could even think about such things however, she would have to master the use of the Samehada; why would anyone bother to listen to her when she couldn't even lift the thing. She had no doubt that the blade would accept her if she were to learn how to use it, a thankful benefit to having such large pools of chakra. So all she needed to do, was learn how to use it.

This was the reason for the heavy pack she wore, she figured that if she trained as normal while wearing this pack then her physical strength would naturaly increase; it was only a matter of putting the effort in. June, who still live with her, observed the pack with a frown; placing her hands underneath it and attempting to lift it while it was on Lera's back. She struggled for a few moments before just giving up.

"How can you lift that? It must weigh a ton." Lera placed a hand on June's head and gave the girls hair a little ruffle, something she hated her doing "Shinobi are generally a little stronger then everyone else, on account of our constant use of chakra. Its only natural that our bodies are strengthened as well. You'll start to show the effect as you get older and get better at using chakra, give it time."

"Hm...if you're already stronger than normal, why do you need to train like that?" Lera had to laugh a little at that, June was still clueless to some of the things Shinobi could be capable of "Even if we're naturally stronger, we still need to train. I always focused purely of elemental and spritual skill, rather than close combat disciplines. I'm going to correct that now. Besides, the weapon I want to use it a heavy thing. How can I hope to swing it fast if I'm not strong enough"

June didn't bother with a reply, she just nodded and returned to her chair and book. Lera watched her go with a little smile, reminded of herself in some ways. Though Lera never really thought herself a genius or prodigy, she knew that some things did come easier to her; that she somehow often learned at a much faster pace. Personally, she saw it as nothing more than exceptionaly hard work; but sometimes she did wonder if there was a little more to it.

The little girl she'd taken on showed the same signs Lera had once shown at her age, she had a exceptional mind; soaking knowledge up like a sponge. If Lera had to equate her to anything, it would be a large empty book; just waiting to be filled to the brim. In fact, Lera had suspicions that Junes 'book' might actually be bigger. Lera got a little giddy when she thought of the possible heights June could reach.

With June now safely occupied, Lera trailed out of the house and off towards the very edges of the village. She had a number of missions from Kirie to complete, all of which could be included in her training. With the pack weighing down on her back, she trailed off through the village; deciding to start with what she deemed as the most important of the missions she'd recieved. Ever since the attack on Kirigakure, wild life had managed to worm its way in.

Most of these animals were of no issue, in fact they were nothing more than a nuisance. However, the wild dogs were causing quite the issue; there were still hundreds if not thousands of bodies yet to be found and buried. The wild dogs often found these bodies first, feasting on their dead flesh as an easy meal. Lera had several ways she could find them, the easiest would be to just find a body and wait for a dog to come along.

There was an issue with that plan though. There were still many bodies in kirigakure and there was no guarantee that a wild dog would specifically come for whichever one she found. Then there was the dogs sense of smell, a dog could smell her presence before it even got within sight; it was unlikely any would dare to come near if she was already there. This left only one option to her, to use her Wolf Jenna; the only issue with this was that she hadn't wanted to subject Jenna to the villages current condition.

She realised that there was truly no choice at all, she would have to summon the wolf if she hoped to finish the mission at all and while bait may work in lurring a dog; it didn't feel right giving a dog such false hope only to kill them right after. So, with a heavy heart, she bit into her thumb and performed the summoning process; calling the wolf Jenna to her side. As soon as the wolf appeared, it rocked its head back and forth; scratching at its nose "What is that smell! It smells like...dead...people....Master, what happened?"

Lera, with an even heavier heart, explained it all to the wolf; who nodded her head with big sad eyes, the wolf was still a pup but she understood more than most "So you need me to find the dogs that are eating the dead people? Alright, I can do that." without any further words, the wolf put her nose to the ground and started leading Lera away; following trails that were invisible to the naked eye. Her Wolf was right on the money, leading her on a straight shot to the nearest dog. In the end, Lera didn't even need to do anything either.

She'd never seen a wolf fight a dog before, but now that she watched it first hand; she saw just how different the two species really were. The dog didn't stand a chance, Jenna had its throat out in moments using superior strength, speed and above all, intelligence. Once the dog lay bleeding in the mud, Lera went over to it and pushed down on the corpse with her foot. As she utilised her chakra, the dog slowly sank into the ground; burying it without any effort.

This only left one mission for Lera to complete and it was by far the more morbid of the two, at this point; the remaining bodies in kirigakure that hadn't been buried were now in various states of decomposition or were still buried underneath rubble. That more or less left it up to the last few remaining shinobi in the village to get their hands dirty and do the job that noone really wanted to do. Lera treated it like training though, with the weighted pack on her back it really did become training.

She kept Jenna at her side, more for the company she could provide through this grim task. She could have asked Jenna to help her locate the bodies and Jenna did actually offer, but Lera just shook her head; she wanted to do this herself, she felt like she owed the dead and she would at least try to pay back her debt by respecting their bodies. She went to the nearest pile of rubble, the remains of what was once a house. Quite a few houses had been cleared away to begin the rebuilding process, but there were still many left in ruins.

She started slow, pulling rocks off the mound and leaving them in a pile nearby; the house was a large one, so the task was going to take time. In just a few moments her back was already starting to burn, the weighted pack digging deep into her muscles. She wasn't used to carrying heavy burdens like this and was almost tempted to lighten the weight with a jutsu or two, but that would defeat the purpose; she needed to gain strength, harden herself. That would never happen if she gave up half way.

So, ignoring the burn, she carried digging deeper into the rubble; revealing caved in rooms andother areas. Eventually, she came across a little hollowed out area and what she saw made her draw in a sharp breath. There were two shinobi, a man and a woman; looking as if they were trying to and succeeding at holding the rubble back. Both were quite well preserved, having been out of open air. It was what lay between them that made her breath catch in her throat.

There was a childs body, barely even four years old; the child had been dead for a while, but not from injury. The child had starved to death, protected from the rubble by the bodies of its dead parents; parents who'd saved their child in the hopes it would be rescued. Lera hardened her resolve, clearing away the rubble from the bodies and carrying them out one by one. Like the last bodies she'd buried, she would bury these three in the same grave; together, just as they would have wanted it in life.

With the bodies out, she began digging the hole; slamming her shovel into the dirt and opening a hole in the loam. It was difficult going, her back seemed to burn more and more with every bit of dirt she pulled from the ground. By the end of this, just moving was probably going to be a realtively difficult feat; but Lera didn't care, she wondered if Violet would be willing to give her a massage. It took her almost an hour, due to the rests she had to take every few minutes; but she finally opened up a hole big enough for the family.

She carefully arranged their bodies in the grave; the parents on either side and the child in the middle. She made sure the child was being held by both parents, hoping that the small gesture would give their spirits at least a little peace. Then, with a shuddering breath, she took up her shovel and started to fill the hole back in. This part was much easier, it didn't take anywhere near as long as digging had taken; but with her exhaustion, it was proving to be extremely difficult.

Once she was finally done with it, she laid her shovel to the side and used a stone for a makeshift grave marker. She carved the words 'Protecting our loved ones, even in death', as she wrote the words; she thought of Seisuke and the blade he had left for her. In a way, those words were true; even in death, he still looked over her. She would master his blade and do his memory proud, so on the day she died; she could meet him with her head held high.* - Fri Oct 16 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) walked into the area with a rather large pack on her back, she looked absolutely exhausted as she dropped it to the ground with a loud clunk.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slumped into Violet, she barely had the strength to hold herself up right now.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gripped the hilt of the practice blade Fujitora had given her, lifting it over head to swing it down with as much force as she could. Right now she was starting with the very basics, before trying to strike a target she was going to work on simple practice swings. In the past few weeks her physical strength had increased considerably. The huge chunk of metal, which was once difficult to lift, now felt almost right in her grip.

That isn't to say she didn't feel how heavy the thing actually was. With every swing her arms burned a little more, the biggest issue here is that; although she now had the strength, that strength didn't matter if she couldn't swing the blade without exhausting herself. She'd seen shinobi using large weapons before and had assumed it was simply using the large reach to their advantage. There was a lot more to it than that however, this would have been much easier if she had someone to teach her; but she was alone in this.

She thought back to how she'd actually been intending to focus further on her elemental aspects for a while and it did feel like she was on the cusp on some great realisation. That was going to have to wait though. Kirie had said she'd intended to master her weapon within three months, if that was the case then Lera would either do the same or master hers much faster. Though it wasn't exactly a competition, she often felt like kirie looked down on her as inferior. It wasn't a nice feeling to have.

At this point, a thick line of sweat was coating her forehead; dripping onto her nose as she panted for breath. She was much stronger now than before, but swinging this big lump of metal around really did take it out of her. She figured that was one of the biggest parts to having the skill. It wasn't just being able to use the weapon better than others, but it was being able to use it without spending so much stamina.

With a shuddering breath, she let the blade drop into the dirt; the blunt end slamming into the earth with a great thud. She had to at least be a little impressed with her self, this thing was massive and just a few weeks ago she would've struggled to just lift it. Now she could lift it using only one arm, which was quite a feat in her books. There was still more to do though, so she tied the 'blade' to her back and went for a run.* - Sat Oct 17 20:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had what looked like a huge metal sword on her back, though it was obviously blunt and not suited for combat.* - Sun Oct 18 11:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I usually let ladies go first. - Sun Oct 18 11:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) shook her head with a sigh and formed a single handseal. Springing up around here was a total of eight different clones, with Lera showing off her exceptionally large pools of chakra. The eight clones positioned themselves a distance in front of Lera, spreading out to face off against Kilm.* - Sun Oct 18 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I gotta learn that . . . - Sun Oct 18 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) merely took a few steps backwards herself, to avoid getting stuck in the syrup trap. The clones however didn't move a muscle, allowing themselves to get stuck to the ground. The main reason was relatively simple, they just didn't need to move; an advantage to being a long distanced fighter. Each and every single clone would begin forming various handseals; with the two in the middle spitting out rivers of mud. Their aim wasn't to hit Kilm, but to simple coat the ground in mud.

With the ground now coated in mud, another three of the clones finished their handseals and formed three giant dragon heads out of the mud. Before the dragons were able to fire, the final three clones spat out condensed streams of flame; adding a flaming aspect to each of the three dragon bomb attacks.* - Sun Oct 18 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) frowned, she'd forgotten he had that technique; which she shouldn't have considering he's the on who'd given it to her. However, now that he was unable to see what she was doing; she and four of her eight clones would begin forming more handseals. Once ready, they'd spit out clouds of gas; covering the area on the other side of mud wall. Lera didn't care that any resulting explosion would destroy her clones. If anything her chakra pools were both a strength and a weakness, because she barely felt the drain; she would often use far too much.* - Sun Oct 18 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: There goes my chakra. - Sun Oct 18 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a decent distance back herself and watched Kilm's clones do their thing. She waited for the exact timing to destroy as many of his clones as possible. Then, without warning; one of her clones simply burst into flame, igniting the surrounding gas in a huge fireball. All of her clones, except for the one using Fire shroud, were destroyed. Hopefully, all of his clones were also destroyed in the process.* - Sun Oct 18 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) made as if to fall backwards, only when she hit the ground she immediately sank into it. Her clone on the other hand, would drop its fire shroud and run through a number of seals. She wanted to take out both of Kilms remaining clones immediately, so it finished the handseals and took in a deep breath. Upon exhaling, it would release a wide area of wind shards; intend on tearing the two clones to shreds.* - Sun Oct 18 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) felt her clone get washed away above ground, destroying it in the process. She didn't mind however, it had done the job it needed to do. Now Lera was going to start making her way towards where Kilm was stood waiting, she was practicing her close combat; so if she was going get better then, this spar had to go into close combat.* - Sun Oct 18 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) would position herself so she was behind Kilm, suddenly pushing upwards and jumping out of the earth. Her attacks were by no means fast or skilled, but her physical strength had come in leaps and bounds. She reached up for the large blunt weapon on her back and went to swing it towards Kilm's side. She had to use both hands due to the weapons sheer size and weight, but if it struck Kilm would be in for a world of pain.* - Sun Oct 18 12:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) continued her attack, though with her current skill she could only follow up with a single attack at a time. However, she did the most intelligent thing she could do in this situation and that was to attack in large swings; to make dodging a little more difficult. So thats the first thing she did, swinging the blade wide towards Kilms hip. Her attacks were slow, but it was clear that just one hit would be enough to do some serious damage.* - Sun Oct 18 12:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) went in for a wide spinning attack, holding the weapon with just one hand so her other was free to do something else. Her muscles strained to keep hold of the weapon, but her physical training seemed to be paying off. As she came back around, her now free hand would created red sparks; which she intending to toss right into Kilms chest as balls of flame. She toned the technique down consderably for obvious reasons, as full power could cause serious harm.* - Sun Oct 18 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was obviously getting tired, she hadn't yet mastered the use of this weapon and every swing was like trying to swing a tree. She still continued though, pushing herself to go as far as possible. Grasping the weapon in two hands once again, she attempted to swing it towards Kilms feet in order to knock him to the ground.* - Sun Oct 18 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Going to get tired soon. - Sun Oct 18 13:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) went in for on last attack, this time she made it a feint; chargining forwards Kilm with the intent to stab the weapon forwards. However, a the last moment she swerved her blade to the side and spat out a little bit of mud at his feet. If all went well, she hoped to have him slip on the mud and fall to the ground; so she could then point her weapon towards him and declare victory. Thats -if- it went well.* - Sun Oct 18 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled her weapon back and strapped it onto her back.
