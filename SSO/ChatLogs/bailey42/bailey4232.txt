<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled and put an arm around Kiyoko's shoulders.

"Thats my Kiyoko...always trying to help people~"* - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015

"Thats right...mine~"* - Mon Nov  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stared at Kiyoko for a good few minutes, processing her words and thinking of a reply "I...disagree with them.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) returned to her seat next to kyoko.

"How odd...he's normally in his office..."* - Mon Nov  9 04:27:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) peered down at her dress, understanding why she didn't switch her position like Lera. A little smirk settled on her lips while she scooted a little closer.

"Mhmmm, good~ all the more reason for me to stay."* - Mon Nov  9 04:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Bye] - Mon Nov  9 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lay quietly in bed, staring up at the ceiling with a bemused smile on her face. It was quite a wonder really, she didn't think herself capable of caring for another human being...but it was hard not to care for Kiyoko. It went without saying, she still thought about Seisuke...Violet, all the people she'd lost in the few short years she'd known them. This time though, she was determined to make it last; determined that Kyoko would not suffer the same fate.

With a swing of her legs, she twisted herself out of bed and got to her feet. With the heat of Sunagakure, there was no need for bed covers or even bed clothing; so she stood stretching in her birthday suit, loosening her stiffened muscles. She'd slept for far too long, but it was the first time in over a month that she'd actually slept well; she had Kiyoko to thank for that. Still feeling a little groggy, she hopped into the shower room; enjoying the feeling of lukewarm water on her clammy skin.

She stood enjoying the shower for almost twenty minutes before deciding to get out and dress for the day. She'd never really made any real attempts to make herself 'pretty' and today was no exception, Lera was a lot of things but vain wasn't one of them. She made a half hearted attempted at brushing her hair and put on what she called her 'battle outfit'. In reality, it was just a loose fit pair of trousers and bandages wrapped tightly over her chest. Though over that went her usual attire, the grey hoodie that was quickly becoming her signature.

All that was left was to grab Samehada and wander out of the door, to the fresh morning air. Morning was easily her favourite time of day; it was the only time of day where Sunagakure's heat was actually bareable. With a genuine smile, one of the few she'd made since the tragedy at Kirigakure, she breathed in the fresh morning air and wandered into the village as a whole. Things in Sunagakure had gotten significantly better since the last time she'd stayed for an extended period, not only was it flourishing but it was also growing.

Her father was doing a good job with Sunagakure, that much was obvious; even if he was a bit forgetful at times. Lera liked the fact that a good number of the villagers seemed to know her, not for her deeds but for simply who she was. There were a number of nods and the ocasional hello, to which she replied to brightly and politely. In just a few days her demeanour had noticeably changed, she felt...alive again; happy even. She had Kyoko to thank for that it seemed. It was odd, no matter how many times she told herself she couldn't love again; something just came along to prove her wrong. She just couldn't help herself, it was her nature to love.

Once she'd gotten out of the village area, she passed through the main gates; nodding to the guards as she did. What she intended to practice needed absolute privacy, not just because she wanted noone to see it; but because it would be dangerous to anyone nearby. Once she was a good distance away, she located a suitable object for her practice and wandered over to it. The object in question was an exceptionally large rock, possibly four or five times the size of Lera herself.

With an act that borded on casual, she waltzed up to the rock and wrapped her arms around it lifting it upwards into the air as if it were the easiest thing to do. The rock did weigh quite a lot, truth be told more than she was capable of lifting; but for Lera it made little to no difference. With her ability to alter the weight of almost anything, she simply made the rock as light as a feather and proceeded to lift it above her head. The hard part came next, also the dangerous part; if she got the timing wrong by just a little, it would kill her.

Fortunately, the timing was just right. She dropped her arms as if she were trying to crush an invisible enemy. At the last moment, she changed the rocks weight once again...this time in the opposite direction. Making objects heavier was something she'd been toying with for quite a while, if she could make objects lighter then surely she could do the opposite too. In a flash, the rock suddenly weight several times its natural weight; causing it to slam into the ground with a titanic thud.

This little trick though, wouldn't do a whole lot on its own. It would only work if her opponents sat still for long enough to allow her to do it, which is why she'd thought of something entirely more deadly. With a single handseal, she spat out a torrent of mud and watched as a single mud clone formed from it. The clone would grip the rock and begin carrying it into the sky, Lera followed close behind; unwilling to get caught up in what she intended to do here.

The Mud clone raced upwards, burning through its supply of chakra; but with her huge reserves it had more than enough to do what it intended. Once it reached a certain height, it gripped the bottom of the rock and deactivated the flight technique. Slowly, the rock and the clone gripping it began to fall; gaining speed as it did. Things took a turn as soon as the clone began focusing on its real goal, the Rocks weight began to increase at an exponential rate pushing the two down faster and faster.

Then finally, with a shattering crash; the rock slammed into the ground, with an effect akin to a small bomb. A huge amount of dust was thrown upwards into a cloud, followed by a shockwave that rocked the earth. Lera had an extremely good view of the events from the sky, safe in the knowledge that whatever damage would not reach her. Eventually, the dust began to clear; giving Lera a view of the crater and the remnants of broken rock at the center. It was a devestating combination for sure, though it took time to prepare. This, Lera decided, was trump card number one.

She stayed up in the air for a while and it was fortunate that she did, for she saw a glint of white stalking towards the crater. Whoever it was, they were quite good at hiding; though obviously not trained in doing so. As soon as she noticed the first, she noticed the others too; dotted about in the sands obviously waiting for a signal. They were probably desert bandits of some kind, not at all unlike the ones she'd come across before. She had no need to confront them, so she just watched them hesitantly venture into the crater; at least until one of them looked up.

As soon as one saw her, a shout rose up from the group and they all turned to look at her. She was faintly amused by their attempts to bring her down, throwing rocks, shooting arrows...all of which fell short. She was simply too high up to for them to reach, by natural means; which is why they resorted to unnatural means. Lera was surprised to see a ball of wind heading right for her, a wind bullet no less. Which mean there was a shinboi among them, a rogue most likely. She dispelled the bullet with a simple swing of Samehada, but the fact that they had a shinobi was a cause for worry.

Gradually, she lowered herself to the crater; settling into the center, surrounded by the group of bandits. Just to be safe, she created a single clone who would stand at her back; making sure she would not be blindsided. She viewed the group of bandits surrounding her, noting their attempts at completely closing her in. A single member of the group stepped foward, one who's clothing she recognised being the first bandit she'd spotted. He removed his headscarf and revealed the crossed out Sunagakure headband underneath, so he was a rogue.

"As you can see, little girl, I'm a shinobi too. While you know some fancy tricks, I do beleive I'm older and more experienced than you are. Give up quietly and I won't have to kill you." Lera thought back to the wind bullet technique he'd used and raised her eyebrow, the mans jutsu had been quite frankly pathetic. She knew genin, fresh out of the academy, who could do better than that. "Seriously? You're not joking right? Because, either you have a seriously over inflated ego or that wind bullet of yours was you holding back. because it was sort've pathetic."

She watched the Rogue's piggy little eyes widen as he gestured to his men, the bandits slowly began stalking towards her and the clone; the clone which she dispersed, she was going to do this one alone. For a brief moment, she glanced down at Samehada in her hand and grinned "Just me and you buddy, shall we do this?" a little squeak and a wriggle from the blade was all the confirmation she needed. So, clapping her hands around the hilt of the blade, she gathered her chakra and blew out a gale; watching as a good number of the bandits were picked up and thrown into a nearby dune.

There were a few expletives from the Rogue, probably realising that he'd bitten of a little more than he could chew. So he soon had a fireball spewing from his mouth, directly towards Lera. She found his attempts moderately amusing, there were a number of ways she could make his fireball look like nothing. Though she was reluctant to dispel it with Samehada, not while knowing its dislike for flame. So instead, she formed a few handseals around Samehada's hilt and spat out a great deal of water towards the flames, essentially quenching them completely.

The moment the flames were out, she spun to the side; clipping a Bandit on the arm. The bandits arm snapped with a crunch and sent him spinning into one of his comrades. Due to how large Samehada was, her swing continue slamming into the side of another Bandit; throwing him to the floor. She didn't like to kill still, but sometimes there were just unfortunates in battles like these. The second man she hit lay on the floor, breathing ragged breaths and ocasionally coughing as his pierced lungs filled with blood.

It was a sad affair, but she believed that deaths were sometimes necessary and unavoidable. She was soon greeted by another blast of chakra from the shinobi, a second wind bullet heading right for her back. She could only really focus on one area at a time with Samehada, so to stop this she just waved her hand at the wind; as if she were throwing something. A bright red spark appeared on her palm before igniting as a ball of flame. The flame would fly straight for the wind bullet, slamming into it with a resulting explosion.

The Rogue watched her fight with a look of disbelief on his face, he'd obviouls heard the saying 'don't judge a book by its cover' but this little girl had just shown mastery of a third element and he had a sneaking suspicion that she might be capable of Doton as well. Lera however was quite enjoying the fight, showing off as she did. The bandits were quickly falling to Samehada and soon, only a select few remained; most of which were backing away as if to escape. She wasn't inclined to chase after them, feeling no need to cause any more death than necessary.

When she finally turned to the Rogue, she noted that his face now held a look of horror rather than disbelief; it was obvious he had no intention of fighting anymore. So Lera turned her lips up into a innocent smile and adressed him "Run and stay the hell away from Sunagakure. If I hear even the slightest inkling of you doing anything like this again, I will hunt you down and finish you off personally. Am I understood?" the Rogue nodded meekly before charging off across the sands to whatever hole he crawled out from.* - Mon Nov  9 13:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....dragons... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Those aren't real. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: However, once you've signed a contract... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh they are. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I once...knew someone who could summon them. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The previous owner of my blade... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...weird... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The summoning scroll unfortunately...was lost. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're amazing creatures, I got to see a full adult dragon up close. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What is it you summon? - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I summon wolves. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They make excellent scouts. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: often sniff out trouble before it hits you - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Saved my ass a few times...gotta admit. - Mon Nov  9 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm...interesting. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you're interested you can sign my scroll. Or you can try and find your own. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've very uncertain about all of this. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm....I'm not sure...I can see two things really. - Mon Nov  9 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can see you using swordsmanship, but not like me. I'd see your style as being more delicate, finer in approach. Unlike mine which is more brute force. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I can also see you fighting from a distance. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Perhaps with ninjutsu, or perhaps with weaponry. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In the end though, the choice falls to you. Nobody can tell you what you want to do. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. - Mon Nov  9 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, there is chakra flow. - Mon Nov  9 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled out a kunai and flowed wind through it, giving it the look of a long dagger rather than a kunai.

"Like this."* - Mon Nov  9 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But other than that...I don't really know of any element specific weapons...or at least...well..actually no thats a lie. There is one...the only one of its kind. - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But can you use the Raiton element? - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no...wind. - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah..hm.. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A sword? - Mon Nov  9 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Is that possible? - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Hm...Just need to find someone who can teach you basic swordsmanship - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And yeah, its tecnically possible with any object. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As long as you have the chakra to do so. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh. - Mon Nov  9 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Thought she wanted to teach me, seems not. - Mon Nov  9 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) saw the look on her face and smiled "I wish I could teach you how to use a katana, but sadly I probably couldn't use one myself. Now if it was a big sword like mine...sure, but you have to be pretty strong to wield one of these."* - Mon Nov  9 14:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And it's related anyhow isn't it? - Mon Nov  9 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Well, i won't stop you if you want to use a large blade. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In some sense I suppose. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's alright that you don't want to teach me though. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The biggest differences is the weight and the range. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe, I'd love any chance to spend more time with you. I just want you to pursue a style thats right for you. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmm... - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) scooted a bit closer to her, a sly grin on her face.

"That sounds like an invitation to me~"* - Mon Nov  9 14:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe....do you want to spend the night at my house? - Mon Nov  9 14:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) put her arms around Kiyoko for her signature squeeze, resting her chin against Kyoko's head.

"Heh, I definitely wouldn't say no, but we can go at whatever pace you want. I just...like having you close."* - Mon Nov  9 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (Worst part. Bryson over there was Violet XDDD) - Mon Nov  9 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had to laugh a little at that last comment, if Kyoko was going to play hard to get; then Lera didn't mind playing along.

"Of course. But its only a matter of time before you succumb to my charms~ hehehe"* - Mon Nov  9 14:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh yeah? We'll see, I think that you are the one in for more of a challenge. After all, I -did- sort of get you to like me as you were in the middle of telling me that you would -never- be with someone again.~ - Mon Nov  9 14:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suppose you got me there....but I have to have some victories no? - Mon Nov  9 14:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mnnn.... yes. - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The lap incident. - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, you were cute~ - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .....right. - Mon Nov  9 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled a bit and gave her another squeeze, Kyoko had the right thoughts the other day; Lera really did like squeezing her.

"You're cute when you're grumpy too~"* - Mon Nov  9 14:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) decided on a whim to slip an arm underneaht Kyoko's legs and shift the girl to her lap. A more comfortable position.

"Up we go~"* - Mon Nov  9 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not if you don't want me to. - Mon Nov  9 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmph... I suppose it wouldn't hurt... if you enjoy it. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Just gives me a fit of nerves. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, don't worry. As long as you're touching me you won't fall. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-okay. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) hopped upwards and into the air, floating upwards so they were at least fifty feet above the village. She then positioned herself so she was floating on her back, allowing Kiyoko to essentially sit on her. Thus. Lera became the magic carpet.* - Mon Nov  9 14:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Fuuuucking shit. - Mon Nov  9 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay? - Mon Nov  9 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Y-yeeeeeep. - Mon Nov  9 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, don't be nervous. Once you get used to it, its rather pleasent actually. - Mon Nov  9 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Greetings. - Mon Nov  9 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....a-are we just... - Mon Nov  9 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are we just going to sit here? - Mon Nov  9 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. Well, we can fly around a bit if you want. - Mon Nov  9 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I thought you were just going to take me to your house...but... s-sure? - Mon Nov  9 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Mon Nov  9 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You enjoy torturing me. - Mon Nov  9 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a hold of Kiyoko's hand and then very slowly turned her body so Kyoko would no longer be sitting on her, but floating on her own.* - Mon Nov  9 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Oh jeez. - Mon Nov  9 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shhh, don't worry. You won't fall. - Mon Nov  9 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nnngng... - Mon Nov  9 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How am I ever going to fight if I can't even take a bit of heights? - Mon Nov  9 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) taking it slow, she began to fly around the village; getting a little higher as she did. She watched the people below going about the daily lives, watched the children playing in the sand and the adults laughing with each other. She couldn't help but smile.

"See...? Isn't this worth it?"* - Mon Nov  9 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) span around in midair again, gripping both Kiyoko's hands in hers; she floated directly below her, smiling up at her with her best innocent smile.

"I can show you a world of adventure~" there was a little consprital wink at the end of that sentence, implying something entirely different to adventure.* - Mon Nov  9 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled again and hugged Kyoko close "I can see you're getting a little nervouse, we'll set down I think"

She took her descent slowly so as not to scare Kyoko so badly, though she one day wished to show the girl what a fast descent felt like. They landed just outside Lera's home, with Lera pulling Kyoko inside.* - Mon Nov  9 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) forgot to describe her house before, so...it actually looks relatively normal. But then, Kyoko has yet to see the bedroom.* - Mon Nov  9 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) jolted in surprise, it wasn't often someone could catch her by surprise; but Kyoko had certainly succeeded. There were no complaints though, Lera soon let out a happy sigh and settled into the kiss; gripping Kiyoko's shoulders in a gentle embrace. When Kyoko pulled back, Lera was left a little lost for words; merely staring into Kiyoko's eyes.* - Mon Nov  9 15:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had a little nervous laugh before joining her on the sofa, it had been a long time since anyone had unbalanced her like this.

"No no...you just caught me by surprise."* - Mon Nov  9 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh, me... catching someone like you by surprise. - Mon Nov  9 15:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What -is- this world coming to? - Mon Nov  9 15:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh....I guess I'll have to be on my guard from now huh. - Mon Nov  9 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) gave a mischeavous smile and gently forwards to bite Kiyoko's bottom lip. It was a gentle bite and there was no maliciousness to it.

"Lets arrange that shall we?"* - Mon Nov  9 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) propped samehada to one side and slowly undid her jacket, all she wore underneath was tight bandages across her breast a pair of loose fitting trousers. Like this, her tatoo's were in full view.

"Oh...I dunno...this and that."* - Mon Nov  9 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: ...oh...fuck. - Mon Nov  9 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) leaned back against the cushions, stretching her arms out "My my...its mighty hot in here."

With a little tug, she pulled the bandages away, leaving her chest bare for Kiyoko to see.* - Mon Nov  9 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Nngn....why. - Mon Nov  9 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) looked at Kiyoko quizzically, a raised eyebrow and an amused expression.

"Hmmm? Whats wrong? We're both female here, you've seen it all before no?"* - Mon Nov  9 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....well..yeah...but... - Mon Nov  9 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm trying to be g-good. - Mon Nov  9 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good? Bahahaha. - Mon Nov  9 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But being naughty is SO much more fun... - Mon Nov  9 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I am not a very .....*mutters* God I am going to hate myself for saying this. *Back to normal voice* naughty girl.... - Mon Nov  9 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can teach you~ - Mon Nov  9 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You are relentless... - Mon Nov  9 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) moved across the sofa...just a tiny bit closer.

"Am I...?"* - Mon Nov  9 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Fuck...she moved. - Mon Nov  9 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed a little again, she was enjoying her reactions more than anything else; this was the most fun she'd had in a while. She stopped her approach mid-way and suddenly got to her feet.

"Hmmmm. I think I'll have a shower...maybe you want to join me...?"* - Mon Nov  9 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ..... - Mon Nov  9 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: This woman is going to be the end of me. - Mon Nov  9 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. Its just a shower~ Nothing wrong with that right? - Mon Nov  9 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...just naked... - Mon Nov  9 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And wet... - Mon Nov  9 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And....soapy... - Mon Nov  9 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...thats why its called a shower! - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And....h-hot... - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) was slowly inching forwards, it was barely noticeable.* - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...water! - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...erg.. - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Come oooon. - Mon Nov  9 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Romp? I've never heard it put like that before...besides, its not like I'm gonna do that in the shower~ - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats for -after- the sh- I mean... - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well so what if I use.... hetero terms....  - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are just... - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Fun? - Mon Nov  9 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So ...  - Mon Nov  9 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Cause thats what I'm having right now. - Mon Nov  9 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slumped down onto the sofa, right next to Kiyoko with barely an inch to seperate them.

"Oh my....now who's trying to 'romp'?"* - Mon Nov  9 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. I win~ - Mon Nov  9 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) stood up, taking Kiyoko by the hands and pulling her towards the back part of the house. There was a significant difference to her bedroom compared to the rest of the house, in here there were books literally everywhere; there was not a single surface without at least a stack of five. In the corner was a large grand piano, with a large harp pressed up against it; though neither looked as if they had been used for quite some time.

Then she pulled Kiyoko into the shower room, it was pretty bog standard; though sealed for that extra...steaminess.* - Mon Nov  9 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: God help me... - Mon Nov  9 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) spoke while pulling the rest of her clothes off, now that everything was in view; kiyoko would see that she was well toned and had a body built for athletics. She was also clean shaven...

"I like books, they're....like having you're own little worlds. I could read for days."* - Mon Nov  9 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Devil...save me? - Mon Nov  9 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) held her breath while she watched Kiyoko strip, eyes roaving up and down her body without missing a single detail. Once the bra fell away, her breath released in a gasp her mouth forming a silent 'O' . It was interesting to note that the blush appearing on Lera's face spread down to her breasts, a strange little gimmick she'd been born with. It took her a breathless moment to bring herself back under control, to pull back her open hand slowly reaching towards Kiyoko. No...she would save herself, the nectar would taste that much better.

"You wish to feel my strength? I don't mind showing you..."

While she spoke, she slowly backed away towards the shower itself and turned the nob. Light sprinkles of water began splashing against the floor, quickly filling the room with a thick foggy steam. Lera almost felt relieved for it, it obscured Kiyoko's body ever so slightly...making it a little easier to resist the tempation.* - Mon Nov  9 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lll The sensation of skin on skin was almost a tipping point, but Lera had promised; almost promised at least, to not do anything of that nature just yet. Kiyoko was pushing it hard however, Lera's tightly wound patience was slowly tensing to snap. She knew that turning around would break that patience entirely, so she remained with her back against Kiyoko. Her hands however, seemed to have a mind of their own.

Fingers reached behind her back, trailing up Kiyoko's thighs and settling on her hips. The area under the shower was quite cramped, it was easy to find an excuse to press her backside harder against Kiyoko's front. All the while, little moans escaped her lips; accented by short sharp gasps as she threatened to push over the edge.* - Mon Nov  9 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) let out a noise that could be akin to a strangled squeak, she almost lost it right then; almost span around and assaulted Kiyoko with what would be the greatest sexual experience of her life. The comment about showing her strength, popped into her head however. So she lashed out towards the shower door and ripped it from its hinges; letting it drop with a clatter.

Feeling a little better, she hoped to take advantage of what she assumed would be a shocked Kiyoko and twist around so she was now in the back.

"Phew....you nearly got me there, you'll have to try a little harder hmmm?"

Then, before Kiyoko had a chance to answer; she let a finger trail upwards against her stomach and rest directly on a nipple, slowly teasing it...* - Mon Nov  9 17:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) twisted her mouth into an evil, but not cruel, grin. Now that she was back in control of herself, this would be all to easy "I have a feeling....that you almost want that to happen. You want little Lera to show you her strength hmmmm?"

While one finger still tease a nipple, flicking it back and forth, the other hand would be slowly inching downward. Resting just a few centimetres above her crotch. The forefinger of that hand, slowly and sensually rubbed against the skin; hoping to induce more of those whispery groans she loved so much.* - Mon Nov  9 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) turned Kiyoko to face her, feeling her own urges returning; Kiyoko seemed to want it so much though, so Lera would not resist. With a gentle touch, she turned Kiyoko to the wall and pushed her against  it. One of her knees, pushed in between her legs; rubbing ever so slightly against her lips. Then, she took hold of Kiyoko's hands; pushing her arms high against the wall. There was no escape now.

Leaning in close, she let her lips brush against Kiyoko's earlobe while she whispered a few words "I thought you wanted to 'take it slow'...?" there was a subtle hint of victory in her tone.* - Mon Nov  9 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pressed her entire body against Kiyoko, rubbing flesh against flesh in a bid to satisfy her urges yet she was a little curious, curious to see what Kiyoko would do.

"Then...take contol~"

Despite her words, she pressed lips against the bottom of Kiyoko's chin, trailing them down till she was level with her throat. Lera was a known biter, which she showed Kiyoko in full by nibbling the flesh on her throat and neck.* - Mon Nov  9 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) released Kiyoko's arms and loosened her vice like grip, she wanted to see if Kiyoko could...or would even make an attempt at escape. She pulled her knee back, just to give the woman a chance to change the tides if her body would allow it. Meanwhile, Lera would slowly be moving downwards with her mouth; resting her lips against one of her nippes, where she would slowly begin teasing it with her tongue and teeth.* - Mon Nov  9 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled at her victory and continued with her work, moving further down Kiyoko's body until she was on her knees with thighs gripped tight in her hands. With the skill of someone who'd clearly done this before, she pushed her tongue against Kiyoko's little pink lips. She gave plenty, but withheld just enough to keep Kiyoko on the edge. She wanted Kiyoko to go crazy, she wanted to see her lose it; it was already close, so close...just a little bit more.* - Mon Nov  9 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: :P are you comfortable? - Mon Nov  9 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wrapped an arm around Kiyoko's leg, pushing her finger against against her hole; teasing it ever so slightly. While her the thumb of her second hand began pressing hard against her clitoris; rubbing up and down to really push her well over the edge. She only did this for a few moments before she could stop herself no more. She pulled her lips apart with thumb and forefinger, opening that hole just enough for her tongue to slip inside.* - Mon Nov  9 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) drank it up, tasting the sweet juice that flowed from in between her legs; Kiyoko had a different taste, but not at all a bad one. Lera found herself wanting more, she intended to push Kiyoko until she was broken from ecstasy. The finger that had once teased against her lips, now pushed upwards; aiming to venture inside. Lera knew from experience that it didn't take much to get a girl going, not if you knew just the right spot to rub. She found it quickly, rubbing the tip of her finger against it while lips parted around her Clitoris.* - Mon Nov  9 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finally pulled away from Kiyoko and settled against the wall next to her; she was pleased with her reactions; one hand still rested against her crotch, gently stroking up and down to tease out that last bit of juice.

"So...still want to take it slow?"* - Mon Nov  9 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) giggled a little bit under her breath, returning her tongue to its position; This time she closed her lips around the Clitoris, teasing it with her tongue ocasionally sucking on it. Her fingers played around kiyoko's hole, pushing against until two were slipped inside. She used a trick she'd tested on herself a few times, hooking her fingers upwards and slowing pushing them against her G-spot.* - Mon Nov  9 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat at Kiyoko's side, with a head resting against her shoulder; intertwining their fingers together. Lera was satisfied, though she hadn't been on the recieving end; she much prefered to give then to recieve.

"Don't worry, I don't intend to."* - Mon Nov  9 19:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) bench pressed the rock high one last time before letting it drop the ground with a crash. She'd worked up a good sweat, coating her forehead with the substance. The rock she'd been lifting was many times her size, far bigger than she could lift naturally. Though, that was the advantage to being able to change the weight of any known object. She could technically use a pebble to train with and it would make almost no difference.

Getting back to her feet, she began rolling her shoulders; loosening the tension held therein. She felt good, better than good actually; it'd been an extremely long time since she'd felt quite this good. With a happy sigh, she slumped against the wall; daydreaming quietly about kiyoko. She felt horrible for thinking it, but she genuinely felt more attracted to her than she had anyone else...even Seisuke. Pushing herself back up to her feet, she decided to keep her mind working by doing some more training.

She'd recently had a little idea to make her exercise a little more effective. Knowing now, how to increase the weight of objects. She figured she could do the same to herself, increase her weight until movement became difficult. Surely, by doing that often; her base phyiscal strength would be able to increase dramatically. When she thought about physical strength, her face turned red and her thoughts returned to the previous nights events. She couldn't help but giggle and feel the crimson blush spread to her cheeks she felt like a twelve year old girl discovering love for the first time.

Pushing those thoughts aside, she took a deep breath and began focusing on her chakra. She took it slow at first, increasing her weight by small amounts. It wasn't very noticeable at first, but she felt the difference when she tried to take a step. It was similar to walking on bad footing, the ground was perfectly flat but it felt rough and harder to walk. It gave her another idea as well, just a slight alteration in weight like this could make an opponent lose their flow. If the tiniest increase made walking feel so..different, then changing a weapons weight or the weight of an opponents fist...it could make all the difference.

That was an idea to put into practice another time though; the surprise on an opponents face was more than worth the wait. With a slight smile, she returned focus to her training; aiming to increase her weight even further. This time, she felt the difference immediately. It was like somebody had just dunked her into thick mud and she now had to wade through it. It would take a few attempts to get the weight just right for her training, but this weight would do for now.

With the look of someone who'd just shit herself, she began forcing herself to walk forwards. Her feet impacted the floor with thuds, giving off the sound of someone who weighed several times more than she did. It was hard going, but after a few minutes she managed to get the hang of it. It helped that she was already quite strong physically, stronger than the average shinobi anyway. It made her think back to the time when she could barely lift a sword, now she was swinging samehada around as if it were made of paper.

Reaching back, she gripped the hilt of Samehada and pulled it from her back; extending the weight increase to include the blade as well. Samehada seemed to squirm a bit under the extra weight and its natural abilty to absorb chakra forced her to use a little more than she would normally need; but it worked in the end. If anything this was excellent practice for using the technique more than anything else. With Samehada in her hands, she raised it high over her head and began some basic swing practice.

She noticed the effects almost immediately, five swings later and her arms were burning; chest rising and falling at an accellerated rate. It was exhausting, enough so that her limit was coming up at an extremely rapid rate. Normally, she could swing Samehada over and over for almost an hour before she couldn't do anymore; but nearly at the ten-mark and she felt ready to collapse. When she hit her fifteenth swing, her concentration slipps and her weight suddenly returned to its natural level.

With a huff, she dropped to the ground; swinging Samehada much faster and much harder than intended now that the weight had been reduced. This forced her to lose her balance and she found herself sat on the sand, panting from the exhertion. Increasing her weight for training certainly helped, but it seemed that there was a point she could consider to far. It wasn't good training if the extra weight meant she barely lasted a minute. With this in mind, she allowed herself to rest for a while.* - Tue Nov 10 13:39:12 2015
