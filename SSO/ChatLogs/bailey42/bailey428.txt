<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wandered into her house, taking a seat on the couch. She had a plan to surprise Seisuke, but it would only work if he did as he was told.

"You take a shower first, that room over there."* - Mon Sep 21 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) cracked her knuckles as she watched him enter the bathroom, the surprise she had planned would probably make him lose his mind; but she was looking forward to seeing him all flustered. As soon as he was in the bathroom, she stripped off her own clothes and casually walked into the room with him.

"Here, let me wash your back~"* - Mon Sep 21 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) picked up a sponge and started running it over his back, a look of pure innocence on her face. She couldn't hide the gleam in her eye though, she was enjoying his reaction.

"Me? I'm washing your back obviously."* - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) made a show of getting as close as she possibly could while she gave his back a thorough scrubbing. Eventually, she reached around him to hand over the sponge.

"Now do me~"* - Mon Sep 21 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slowly turned herself around, gathering her hair so it fell over one shoulder.

"Go ahead~"* - Mon Sep 21 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmmm? - Mon Sep 21 17:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: N-Nothing! - Mon Sep 21 17:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) suddenly turned around, attempting to grab his arms so he couldn't turn away again. There was a mischevious glint to her eye while she looked up at him, waiting to see his reaction.

"Mhmm...gotta enjoy the little things"* - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) smiled into the kiss, pushing him back against the wall; she was liking her new motto, especially if she could do things like this without feeling guilty about it. She wanted him to take the initiative however, so she just put her arms around his waist and kept the kiss going.* - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) laughed a little, the adrenaline starting to pump through her veins. She grunted a little when it was her turn to be slammed against wall, but she found she quite liked being handled like that. From then on, she couldn't stop herself anymore; forcing him down onto the floor of the shower with her.* - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Tue Sep 22 07:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) settled at the end of the pier, she had one jutsu on her repetoire she was yet to master; especially since she intended to teach it to Seisuke by way of apology. She formed the handseals and created 12 different clones, all surrounding her person and watching her. The drain on her chakra for using so many was definitely no joke, never before had she worried about using all her chakra; yet with these there was certainly something to worry about. She would have to worry about that later.

For now, she had the clones start moving against each other; fighting amongst each other in pairs. It was odd to watch her own clones fighting each other, like watching perfect reflections of herself fight each other. She was very aware of what was going to happen when she released the clones and it would probably mean passing out, but that was fine; she would find a bed before that happened. 

Soon her clones were using jutsus on one another, lighting up the water with an indigo orange of fire and wind. She let them go all out, though she could feel her chakra draining away rapidly. Eventually, she had to tell them to stop; before they managed to destroy each other. She didn't want to pass out on the pier where just anyone could find her.

With a slow walk, she made her way home; ignoring the looks from villagers, it wasn't every day they saw a girl with 12 perfect copies of herself walking through the village. Eventually, she made it home; where she took a seat on the bed and promptly ended the jutsu. The wave of exhaustion that followed was unbearable, she passed out instantly.* - Tue Sep 22 10:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 23 10:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y-You said that aloud - Wed Sep 23 10:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Back together, huh? - Wed Sep 23 10:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y-Yeah...Maybe I'm just overreacting. - Wed Sep 23 10:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, I don't care what people think. - Wed Sep 23 10:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Ah, I doubt a genin like me should be hearing this. - Wed Sep 23 10:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Enjoy the little things remember? - Wed Sep 23 10:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're right.. - Wed Sep 23 10:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But yeah! Onto the gift. - Wed Sep 23 10:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmmm, I'm curious now. - Wed Sep 23 10:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's definately not the best...But. - Wed Sep 23 10:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took the scroll with a raised eyebrow a little smile playing over her lips.

"A jutsu? You didn't have to..."* - Wed Sep 23 10:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) leaned in to give him a quick kiss.

"Thanks~ You know how I like to learn new jutsu."* - Wed Sep 23 10:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Would you like to go learn the technique now~? - Wed Sep 23 10:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure~ - Wed Sep 23 10:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) pulled out the scroll and unfurled it, raising her eyebrows at the complicated diagrams and explenations within. Without at least the basic understanding of Doton, most people would probably see this as nothing more than gibberish. Even for her, with her intelligence and book knowledge; this was difficult to understand. She noticed that it was listed as a B rank, which explained quite a lot; it would be difficult to learn but she was up for the challenge.

"This...is quite a complicated jutsu."* - Wed Sep 23 10:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: mhmm, I think i would~ - Wed Sep 23 11:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) spent some time reading through the scroll, digesting all the information within; it took her a while to get a complete understanding of what the jutsu did, it was much harder than seeing it in person. When she figured out what the jutsu did however, she was impressed; either Seisuke was extremely lucky or he'd had a good idea of what she could do with. It appeared the jutsu would create a dome around whomever she targeted. She would even be able to leave the top open to allow for an attack.

"This jutsu...is going to be extremely useful."* - Wed Sep 23 11:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm....Thats a difficult question. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I use earth a lot, to defend myself. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I also use wind and fire. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see~ - Wed Sep 23 11:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't think I have a favourite...though I don't use Raiton much. - Wed Sep 23 11:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) finally rolled the scroll up and put it away, tucking it into one of her hidden pockets. She had already memorised the hand seal needed to perform the jutsu, though the fact that it was only a single handseal was surprising. For a jutsu like this, she expected to have to use several handseals; but apparently that wasn't the case at all.

She took a deep breath and looked towards the ground in front of her. After forming the one necessary handseal, she directed her chakra towards the ground; attempting to have it rise and shape into a large dome. The ground quivered slightly, a few rocks popping out of the ground as it tried to follow her command; but it was no use. Soon she dropped her hands and the ground remained just as inert as before.

"As difficult as I expected."* - Wed Sep 23 11:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmmm. It'll definitely be a good one. - Wed Sep 23 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know...I can't imagine entering the chuunin exams now. Last time I was so much weaker..but now. - Wed Sep 23 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're practically radiating with strength~ - Wed Sep 23 11:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh, why thankyou kind sire. - Wed Sep 23 11:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took a seat on the ground and closed her eyes; it was going to require more focus and concentration than just looking at the earth and hoping it happened. Which mean she had to blot out any and all distractions from Seisuke, when her mind wandered back to the events of the previous night....she had to force herself to not grab his arm and drag him away somewhere private. With a little sigh, she shook her head and shoo'd away the distracting thoughts; cursing herself for letting her mind wander again.

With her eyes closed and her thoughts cleared she brought her fingers into the shape of the seal and imagined a clear image of the earth directly infront of her. Using her minds eye as a directive, she coated that earth in her chakra; trying to force it upwards into the previously mentioned shape of a dome. She imagined it clearly, but performing it was proving to be something else. Ever so slowly, slates of earth did start to rise; but it went no further than a few inches above ground. Leaving a jagged circle of rocks behind.

"Hrmmm."* - Wed Sep 23 11:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) breathed in quietly through her nose and exhaled through her mouth, calming herself even further. From experience, she knew that it was best not to force these things; otherwise she would exhaust herself with little progress. A gentle hand with her jutsu was how she learned, possibly even how she learned slightly faster than your average genin. Either way, Hassan had once called her a prodigy and she intended to live up to that.

Repeating the same steps as before, she concentrated chakra into the floor; using the ring of stone she'd already left behind as a good indicator for where she needed to focus her chakra. This time she was gentle with it; rather then forcing the earth to rise at her command, she guided it upwards. With a sound of stone grating on stone; rock slowly rose upwards, curving at the centre to form a dome. She opened her eyes to look, seeing that it wasn't quite perfect yet; but it was a good start.

"Not too shabby..."* - Wed Sep 23 11:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? okay~ - Wed Sep 23 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrm? - Wed Sep 23 11:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mud silhouette and headhunter hm. - Wed Sep 23 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thank you~ But I already know them both. - Wed Sep 23 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You kn---Alrighty. - Wed Sep 23 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wh- - Wed Sep 23 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Whats this one? - Wed Sep 23 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Exploding Flame Shot... - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That...sounds...explosive. - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I hear it is~ - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Brb den~ - Wed Sep 23 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) opened up the scroll, noting the name as Seisuke stated and the rank of the jutsu. It was a Katon type and thankfully, it wasn't too high of a rank for her to understand. She was happy to learn any new Katon jutsu, they were poweful jutsu; especially when combined with Fuuton type jutsu. Seisuke was really outdoing himself with the gifts, she would have to think of some way to reward him...

Once agian she had to shake herself to move away from those thoughts, it wasn't helping her practice. Forcing herself to concentrate, she looked down at the scroll and started to read it. From what she could tell, it was a jutsu that kept up to its name sake. One had to conjure flames in the hand and throw it; upon hiting its target the flames would explode or combust the target. Whats more, the jutsu was completely without seals. Fire wasn't her first choice of element however, so her skill wasn't quite as up to scratch as it could be.

Even so, she was willing to try hard at learning the jutsu. She held out her hand, to the air; envisioning a spark on the tips of her fingers. According to the scroll, the flames were ignited with a spark and then thrown as a ball towards her opponents. It wasn't as easy as she thought it might be though, when she tried to create a spark all she accomplished was a tiny puff of black smoke.* - Wed Sep 23 12:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) had a sudden surge of inspiration, a way for her to kill two bird with one stone; practicing both her shadow clones and learn the Exploding flame shot. She formed one quick seal and summoned two clones to stand at her sides. These clones immediately held out their hands and began practicing the jutsu. She watched with a smile as they produced similar whisps of smoke from their palms as she did.

Not one to be left behind, she began practicing herself. With her eyes closed once more, she focused on just creating a spark. The flames could come afterwards. She could see and feel her hand clearly, learning hell stab had given her a clear understand of how the chakra flow worked in her hands. In this case it helped a lot.

With her eyes still closed, she channeled chakra to her hand and imagined it running out of her palm and turning into a bright spark. In a way, it was similar to using Raiton though this focused on producing a spark in the form of heat rather than electricity. She didn't see anything, but she definitely heard it. A light crack echoing through the area; echoing from her palm. Smiling to herself, she formed another handseal and dispelled her two clones; ignoring the wave of exhaustion that came over her. It wasn't so bad that she had to rest now.* - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
