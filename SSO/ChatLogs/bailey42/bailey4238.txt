<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) ll Lera's other two clones would begin running even as the shuriken fell, shouting warnings to the original. Lera was not capable of keeping her jutsu active and using another jutsu at the same time. So she was forced to release Hassan while she activated the Domu technique and swung Samehada above her head. She successfully deflected most of the shuriken but could not hit them all, the one she missed left a nice gash on her forearm; cutting through even her Domu armour.

She winced at the pain but kept a firm hold of Samehada to ready for another attack. Her clones once again shouted warnings, alerting her to Hassan's quick recovery. She had no desire to find herself cut up by Hassan's technique, so she swung Samehada downards intent on destroying his jutsu entirely. She wasn't completely successful, not being fast enough to dispel the technique entirely; nor was her skill good enough. Instead of being cut though, Samehada made contact with the technique and the force of the attack pushed her backwards and into the wall.

Lera on the other hand, was getting her shit wrecked; she did the only thing she could think to do and pushed off to fly to the side.
