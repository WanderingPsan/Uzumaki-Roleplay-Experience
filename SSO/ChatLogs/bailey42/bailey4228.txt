<br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) sat alone on a tree branch, samehada resting lazily across her legs. She had a good vantage point from up here, she could keep her eye on the skies and the ground; just in case something decided she looked a little tasty. Every now and then she'd glance down at Samehada fondly. Even though it was fully co-operative with her, she couldn't help but like it. It was surprisingly affectionate, at least as long as you continued to provide it with chakra anyway; which she did in bucket loads.

Ever so gently, she rubbed her hand down the blades edge; being careful not to catch her hands on the sharp scales. It still continued to suck away at her chakra, if it weren't for her exceptionally large pools; she would have run dry a long time ago. It was a wonder it was still going, it did stop every now and then; but surely there would come a point where it was well and truly full. Either way, until she truly mastered the weapon; using it in a real life and death battle would be risky.

With a sigh, she gripped Samehada's hilt and dropped from the tree; landing gracefully on the forest floor. The area was mostly clear, besides a few forest critters but they generally just left her alone. She wagered she'd traveled a good majority of the forest now, but had yet to come across a beast on the same level as the one Marissa had been fighting. She was starting to get the feeling that she'd gotten everything possible out of surviving here, it was more or less time to leave.

All she had to do was make her way to Fujitora's base and wait for him, though that was easier said than done. She reckoned she'd come pretty close to the base a number of times, but had always turned herself away so as to extend her stay for as long as possible. Despite that, things were starting to get very samey, she'd defeated most creatures with relative ease, a few had given her a little trouble; but she'd yet to sustain even a scratch. So with a yawn, she trailled off into the forest, towards Fujitora's base.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I want to see how good you are with it before I decide whether to teach you this or not. - Sun Nov  1 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Hm... - Sun Nov  1 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its good...but not good enough for the technique I had in mind... - Sun Nov  1 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Are those you're only three Doton techniques? - Sun Nov  1 18:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright...I can teach you three Doton techniques. One of them should be perfect for your current level...the other two will be difficult. - Sun Nov  1 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One of those by the way, is a personal technique of mine - Sun Nov  1 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: R-Really? - Sun Nov  1 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So far i've only allowed one other to learn it - Sun Nov  1 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And they paid me to do so - Sun Nov  1 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I.... - Sun Nov  1 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I thank you.. - Sun Nov  1 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. We'll start with the easiest I suppose. - Sun Nov  1 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) formed her handseals and channeled doton chakra into her hands. Upon slamming her palms against the ground, she sent chakra through it; forming stone spears that shot upwards around an invisible target.

"Quite a good offensive technique, difficult to dodge; especially if you're not expecting it. I can't explain how it works, but the visuals are pretty self explanatory. Give it a go."* - Sun Nov  1 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad. - Sun Nov  1 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Now...we come to the tougher one. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: This one, I will expect to be paid for. - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: How much..? - Sun Nov  1 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I would normally ask for several million...would you like me to show the technique first? I'll let you decide. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sure. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Actually. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I trust your judgement. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well I have to show you the technique so you have an idea of how it works first. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So. Allow me to demonstrate. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's also true. - Sun Nov  1 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) wandered up to a nearby tree and clasped her hand into three fingers. With a short thrust forwards, she neatly slice through the thick trunk causing the tree to start falling. However, before it had a chance; she grabbed the trunk with one hand and began flowing her chakra through it. Then with ease that completely went against her small build, she lifted the tree above her head and balanced it on one finger.

"This is a Doton technique that goes past the basic concept of Earth, this is Doton at its very core. Would you like me to explain how it works?"* - Sun Nov  1 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: THe first one is a common technique. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I only ask for payment for this technique. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Even so. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You didn't have to teach me - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I enjoy passing techniques on - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway, i'll explain how this works. - Sun Nov  1 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) crossed her legs, floating in midair. She still held the tree, so she threw that to one side and began to explain.

"This technique takes Doton an abstract concept, manipulating it at an incredibly low level. If you think about it, when it comes right down to it; Doton is mass...weight. Using your chakra, you manipulate that weight and lower it for any object you're touching. It also works in reverse, though I've yet to figure that one. Finally, as you get better you can alter the weight of the very atmosphere around you; allowing for flight."* - Sun Nov  1 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good. - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Keep practicing it and you'll soon be able to fly. - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Thank you Lera.. - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I owe you so much for my progression. - Sun Nov  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* its no matter. - Sun Nov  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) shook her head and took the original offer, which was five million.

"That will cover the technique."* - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I insist. - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, if you say so. - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd like to think of you as a friend. - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...well, There are likely other techniques I can teach you. - Sun Nov  1 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---And really? - Sun Nov  1 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Perhaps the Shadow clone technique - Sun Nov  1 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Interested? - Sun Nov  1 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I already know it---Honestly That technique is like Shunshin no Jutsu. - Sun Nov  1 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: In Sunagakure. - Sun Nov  1 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Nov  1 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You'd think it'd be less popular.. - Sun Nov  1 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You would think so. - Sun Nov  1 19:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well....Either way, I can teach a few taijutsu to you both. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Taijutsu? Good. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right...then - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Attack me please. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright.. - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'll g-go first..! - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Momura, coordinate attacks! - Tue Nov  3 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well you can attack together if you want, but I just want to show you a few techniques. - Tue Nov  3 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright uhm... - Tue Nov  3 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-You go after me. - Tue Nov  3 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: One technique I don't need to teach I guess...She's quite a speedy one too. - Tue Nov  3 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) is not the daughter of Violet what.* - Tue Nov  3 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) took in a breath, she had no desire to take any damage and despite the giant sword on her back; lera was actually pretty bad at Taijutsu. To make up for this, she flowed chakra across her skin; hardening it to an impossible degree. With this, she could happily ignore kyubishu's punch; he would most likely hurt himself with that punch more than anything.

As for Momura's kick, she swept her hand to the side; intending to push her leg away and possibly even redirect the kick straight to Kyubishu. She wasn't actually after a spar, she just intended to teach the pair a few new taijutsu techniques.* - Tue Nov  3 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised an eyebrow at kyubishu's little performance, reaching up to grip the hilt of Samehada. Then with a great swing, she intended to slam the flat of the blade into his body as he fell towards her. She treated it sort've like a game of baseball, only with a giant sword and a spikey man.* - Tue Nov  3 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A battle maniac huh...well, I should probably tell you I'm actually an elementalist. Close combat is not my Forte....but...if you really want to play... - Tue Nov  3 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I'll s-spar you...K-Kyubi. - Tue Nov  3 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Momura, attack her. Be aware of that sword! - Tue Nov  3 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Attack.? - Tue Nov  3 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: D-Don't hold back..? - Tue Nov  3 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Don't. Hold. Back. - Tue Nov  3 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright.. - Tue Nov  3 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) slowly slotted Samehada back into its place on her back and removed her Domu armour. She then formed a number of handseals and pointed a finger at Kyubishu. If all went well, she would give him a little wink and form a dome of earth around him; essentially trapping him in. She left a small area where the rock was thinner, so he could escape if he noticed. With that done, she faced Momura with a consprital smile, waiting for her to attack.* - Tue Nov  3 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Lera let be handle it if me is close combat... - Tue Nov  3 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can play with the other guy. - Tue Nov  3 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: C'mon, I need more. - Tue Nov  3 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) raised her eyebrow at the little girls odd technique, she wasn't expecting it and not being the fastest of people in the first place was actually struck by it. It stung a little bit, but no more than that.

"Come on, you can do a little better than that no?"

Clapping her hands together, she channeled chakra throughout her body and then brought a palm forward as if to strike the air. Bellowing from her palm, a gust of wind would come; aiming to unbalance Momura if anything. She had no intention of causing any real harm to the girl.* - Tue Nov  3 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Ow.. - Tue Nov  3 19:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) didn't waste any time putting her equipment to the side and tearing her own clothes off and pulling Violet closer.

"I missed you to...it was a long and lonely month in the forest..."* - Tue Nov  3 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) grinned and put her fingers together, creating eighteen clones...thats right, eighteen. Each and every one of those clones were ready to pleasure Violet in ways she'd never experienced before. They even spoke in unison.

"This much..."* - Tue Nov  3 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: thats not bad at all - Tue Nov  3 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) lay panting on the bed, barely able to move a finger. All eighteen clones going at it at once was quite the experience, but it was more exhausting then it needed to be.

"That...was...awesome."* - Tue Nov  3 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(Bailey42) curled herself around Violet, cuddling up to her while they rested.

"And I you..."* - Tue Nov  3 20:37:45 2015
