<br><font color=yellow>*Hozuki, Sirozan(XxkasukuxX) Sirozan begins wondering the outskirts of The Hidden Mist at dusk, Which his superiors tells him that it's dangerous, Blowing them off and begins looking for a massive water source, Since his village is running low on A hydratation liquid. He begins walking and thinking about the lectures he'll hear from his superiors when they hear he returns from outside the village, Before he can remember, he looks up and it;'ss very dark out thinking, "Well, I need to hurry before wild animals start thinking they can attack me..." after this statement he is very cautious walking about. Looking back and uses his peripheral vision to his advantage. After walking several minutes he gettings very bored and even considering returning home. But, this actually made him want to travel faster, he then crouches down and begins to scout a tree branch and locks on and releases his stance and goes soar towards the branch, then begins to get a rhythm taking one foot at a time on branch consecutively. He then hears something like someone following him, lashing out his kunai and attaches a wire on it and fires it's behind him as a trap wire. He then feels this same wire move and stops and gulps thinking, "As my predictions was right." and says in a calm voice, "Come out, I can tell your there...". He then gets into a basic fighting stance cleching his fists and yells, "COME ON NOW, YOU CAN'T HIDE!" then he hears a tree branch breaks close to him and his heart begins to beat very fast. The figure begins to appear from what of the dark with Sirozan's kunai stating, "This trap was successful, Your senses are redefined, But You Should have stayed home, Boy." Sirozan's teeth begins to clamp hearing, "Boy." He begins to walk from the darkness smirking, touching his headband and swinging Sirozan's kunai on a finger. He looks like clan from the Hidden Mist called "Hoshigaki" with a rogue headband and with rags on his back. Sirozan then comments on his headband, "I see your -where- from The Hidden Mist...?" with his guard on even more alert. The Hoshigaki then asks, "That trash of a village? Psshh, Anywhere is better then there..." Sirozan then jumps down from the tree on to the ground with the Hoshigaki following him. Sirozan then thinks, "He's following me so he must be a lethal threat...I have to attack off-guard so i can continue searching." The Hoshigaki then pulls out a jar from his kunai holster and begins to consume the contents of it saying, "Ahh...That's goood water...Now, This is what's going to happen. Your going to give me all your suppiles or Die...or, i can rob you AND kill you." with a maniacally laugh. Sirozan says, "You won't do either you punk!" and picks up a giant stick the size of a 4x4 and perpares to attack the Hoshigaki. The Hoshigaki then throws the jar to the ground and shatters it perpares a defense. Sirozan then begins swinging the stick violently with relatively ease matching the Hoshigaki's stolen kunai. Sirozan then props up the stick on the ground and throws his body weight into a kick towards the Hoshigaki's gut. The Hoshigaki then wipes the blood from his mouth and leans up and perfroms some handseals and shouts, "Water Style : Water Clone Technique!" then punches the clones expelling all of the water onto the ground. Sirozan suprised kneels down and uses his finger to lick up some water and he starts to sulp it up saying, ' AHHHH! Water taste so good...This is going to be clockwork now!" then his muscles begin to pump alittle with every sip. The Hoshigaki then tells Sirozan that he better look up and Sirozan sweepkicks The Hoskigaki, The Hoshigaki is suprise by his speed and elbows his jaw and begins to start flying backwards. Sirozan then grabs his stick and begins to walk and stops to zooms into the place he elbowed The Hoshigaki, barely hereing the Hoshigaki annouce his Water Style : Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave trying to outrun it then getting hit dead on to the back,"W-What..NOOOOooo..."when the blast settled he found him self inside a bubble of water. The Hoshigaki then pops up with a ripped shirt and taking deep breaths looking fatigue saying, "I underestimated you, Now it's time to see the real power of the Hoshigaki Clan!" rushing into the floating injured Sirozan perform and landing harsh connecting chains of combos with very loud grunts then Hoshigaki says, "See you are weak, Hidden Mist trash..Should have stayed home child, Heh.." Sirozan then begins to wake softly saying, "Well....I told you wasn't going to kill me...or rob me......NOW TO KEEP MY PROMISE!" with a electric voice. With Sirozan's rage on a new peak his body begin to liquify and he comments on his teeth saying, "My Teeth...I'll Rip You Apart!!!!" The Hoshigaki then is stunned by his transformation. Sirozan races towards the Hoshigaki and throws everything at him with bashing combos connecting and breaking every move the hit touches. Sirozan then picks up the nearly dead Hoshigaki and states, "You gave me a fight i thought i wasa going to lose...Thank you, For this Great Fight, But you have to die...But, Before that. I'll tell you my name, I am Sirozan from the Hozuki clan, Hozuki, Sirozan!" he then tosses the almost lifeless body of the Hoshigaki then, soaks up the water like a sponge. Then, swims up towards the sky and goes shuffling into his pockets and hosters thinking, "It's -gotta- be in here..." and then opens a pocket wide and finds a underwater lighter saying, "Yes, Now I can finish this." after he flickers the lighter and surrounds it in a small water bubble putting one hand on the bubble performs couple of handseals and shouting, "Water Style : Water Dragon Bullet!!!!!" a large amount of water formed into a giant, powerful dragon with the underwater lighter infused into the water is rushed at the almost-lifeless Hoshigaki the size of a large oak tree is expelled into the  Body of the Hoshigaki causing a large devasting wave of water covering alot of the forest with a small explosion of the underwater lighter inploding. After the water settles, He slowly floats down reverting from his Water Hydration Technique, Looking at the now officially lifeless corpse, with complete white eyes with -no- iris. of The Hoshigaki. Sirozan didn't waste no time giving the Hoshigaki pity and limped and buckled towards the Hidden Mist Village with required water inside his body.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Uchiah, Kagami IV(ShinyPierce4) sits on the ground, legs crossed, not entirely sure how this meditation thing worked. "Full state of understanding... I understand how boring this is going to be." Katsu whispered to himself, putting his hands together to form the tiger seal. That was common for most shinobi, some even used it to regain lost chakra at a subtle rate. In addition Katsu closed his eyes, trying to wander off to a mental state of solitude. "Full state of understanding.. Do I have to understand myself?..Or the element...Possibly both?"<br><br>

Katsu fought the urge to scratch the back of his head. This meditating stuff was quite the difficult task. Especially for someone as impatient as he was. "Well I understand myself... As confusing as I am.. But what is Katon?.. What is Fire?" he wondered. "Fire can't truely be controlled can it?.. Even when we manipulate it into jutsus..It can still hurt us cause it isn't truely, 'Ours'... Hmmm.. Katon is the element of not being controlled. The chaotic portion of mother nature... The power to destroy"<br><br>

Katsu created a mobile image of himself. Walking around the dark abyss he considered to be his mind. It was empty, quiet. Within the next few steps, he noticed a change. There was something on the ground. He looked under himself, there was ripples, indicating the substance to be that of a liquid. "Water?.." he questioned. But there was a flash of light, which temporarily blinded him. "W-..What is this?" Katsu asked, instinctively covering his face, yet it had no meaning, for he was still blind. The light faded however, allowing Katsu to regain his vision, yet the sight he saw made him wish he had lost it permanetly. Around him was a field of flames, towering higher then that of the hokage mansion.<br><br>

//The flames quickly spread. Closing into Katsu's location.<br><br>

"T-..This isn't water...It's oil!" he realized, moments before being engulfed by flames. It was in his head, yet the pain felt real. His skin was scorching hot, and his hair lit like that of a match, reaching down to cover his face. "Ahhgg!.. This pain... Why does it feel real when this is just my imagination!?.." he screamed.
Katsu closed his fist, bending his knees with a forward lean. "Control the flame that controls me... Control the flames that control me... Control the flames that control me!" he kept repeating. With each repition the flames receeded into his body, until it was just a small manifestation of Katsu's inner flame. The pain vanished, almost as if it was never there.<br><br>

Upon exiting his meditative state, he exhaled heavily. Beads of sweat ran down his face, his shirt and jacket already soaked. "Man.. This isn't going to be very easy..."*

<br><font color=yellow>*Bright(RebornEra) | It started out as both kunai clashing into each-other with amazing force; thus causing sparks from the colliding metal to jump into the air and fade away. Both their hands firmly gripped on the leather grip placed around the kunai. Also their eyes blood shot red, pupils split apart and formed into a small camma's that stuck out in the cloudy grey sky. Though something was wrong... It seemed that Bright a large wound that ran down his arm from the previous attacks given by Tsuna (Uchiha Leader). The blood trickled down his forearm, falling of and plunging to the ground once it reached his palm. Tsuna's movements suddenly changed, shifting his weight toward the side; causing him to spin with great momentum, leg extending out at great speeds afterward. A powerful spin kick to the chest, smashed with his skin, sending Bright flying back into the air; quickly recovering himself mid-fall. Bright's hands reached back to his pouch, pulling out two kunai with a red wrapping around the grip. With one powerful swing with the kunai, both was sent flying toward the side of Tsuna. The kunai plunged into the ground, missing him by inches only. Bright was more of a Ninjutsu and tatical fighter if anything, though had amazing speed to cover up some of his flaws. Both hands clashed together afterward, forming a barrage of handseals; creating a devistating flame element to form inside his stomach, pushing up to his throat and exiting from his lips. Six large balls of flaming orbs were aiming right at Tsuna with incredible speed that shouldn't be tampered with. This was apart of Bright's plan to cover Tsuna's range with flames and heat. Before the fireballs landed on Tsuna, two large explosions took place at Tsuna's feet; covering the range to twelve feet wide and eleven feet in height. Not even Tsuna himself could avoid this, though taking defensive actions by preparing himself from the harsh burns. His skin tightend up, feeling the harsh heat that wrapped around his body; causing 2nd degree burns to fill most areas that possesed skin. Luckily burning one of his eyes, slightly crippling Tsuna. The six flaming balls then smashed into Tsuna, melting away skin along with the previous attack that gave him second degree burns. Even though his Sharingan was unlocked, Tsuna didn't have enough reaction time to avoid all attacks. Along with smoke blocking away his vision already.*

<br><font color=green>*Natsu(Guest-1084507334) says: When can we begin?
<br><font color=yellow>*Herakuru(Dillion13) was one of this best Hyyuga in his clan, he was alway's training on his most famous Jyuuken Gentle fist stlye, one day he was hitting a log "Huff, Huff" Herakuru would say as he would begin to get dazed from all the training that he does, but he does not give it he keep's hitting it more and more until, 'SNAP!" The log had broken in half this had shown how strong Herakuru had become in the day's back then he could not even leave a mark on a log. Falling down he had begin to close his eye's falling off into the sleep. Thinking about the Main branch and the side branch of the Hyuuga clan.

He opened his eye's to find out that it was night, he was worried tha the missed his meeting. He had heard some rumbuling in the bushes he had looked around and claped his hand's together. 'Byukugan!" Herakuru had said. He looked around and had seen somoenes Charka. He then got into his Juuyken Gentle fist style.

The stance he had been training on all his life, well not all but most of the time. He used this stance in all of his fight's it would be able to take away you're use of Charka if it hit you. Herakuru threw a Paper bomb into the bushes where he had seen the man's Charka.

It had exlpoded and Herakuru watched as the man jumped up into the air. He was very weird looking, the man landed on the ground right infront of Herakuru, he did not waste any time the man tryed to hit him right in the face, but with his Gentle fist style it was a easy thing to dodge it.

He moved right under the attack hitting the man in the stomach trying to stop his Charka flow, hitting he Herakuru kept on going he would not stop he would hit him on the arm and the shoulder, then doing a 360 spin he come's back around and hit's the man with his palm.

Making him go flying. This was so eas for Herakuru but then he was caught off guard getting hit in the face he flew back, Herakuru was very injured and he was not able to move as fast as he could before, he knew now that this guy was a heavy hitter. Herakuru waited until the man had come closer.

Then putting one of his hand's down close to hit shoe's and the other one high up he then would get into his new found move stance, a Green circle would apprear right around him and Herakuru would begin to hit the man "2 hand's 4 hand's, 6 hand's, 8, hand's 16 hand's, 24 hand's, 32 hand's, Ahh!! 64 hand's!" Herakuru would say as he would hit the man with his palm making him go flying. The man was out cold or maybe even dead. Herakuru had realized tha this was just a test. To test his Gentle fist style.*
