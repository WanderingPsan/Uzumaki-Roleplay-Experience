<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Only one? - Fri Dec  4 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Oh wait no, two. - Fri Dec  4 08:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hmm...theres a kenjutsu technique I can probably teach you as well - Fri Dec  4 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: When you start learning how to use your Kukiri I mean. - Fri Dec  4 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And then...I think I'll teach you shadow Clones... - Fri Dec  4 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You have good enough control. - Fri Dec  4 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Fri Dec  4 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Shall we go then~ - Fri Dec  4 08:19:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll start with shunshin. Get the worst out of the way right? - Fri Dec  4 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right. - Fri Dec  4 08:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) put her hands together in a simple handseal, channeling chakra into her legs and feet. She released that chakra all at once, pushing off at extremely high speeds; it almost appeared as if she teleported.

"Its not really teleportation, its just instantaneous speeds. You have to use the chakra in your legs and feet as a...booster, release it all at once just as you're pushing off. Be careful though, if you fall over it will hurt quite a bit..."

She then stood in Kiyoko's path, ready to catch her if something went wrong.* - Fri Dec  4 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) caught her quickly, holding her in place until the dizziness wore off.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe we should have done that one last. - Fri Dec  4 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Maybe...but better to get it out of the way right? Then you don't have to worry about it. - Fri Dec  4 08:49:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) placed her down int the bed and laid next to her.

"I didn't realise it would take so much out of you...sorry."* - Fri Dec  4 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: So having as much chakra as this can be a problem... - Fri Dec  4 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I suck at gauging other peoples chakra levels... - Fri Dec  4 09:01:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Well...since you already know how to make Lightning shadow clones - Fri Dec  4 09:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed the seal and created her own clone.

"I think of it like this. Ordinary bunshins are like...an empty container. Theres nothing in there, no substance. So I take that container and fill it, to make the shadow clone."* - Fri Dec  4 09:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: All their experiences...everything they've done, goes straight back to you. - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah - Fri Dec  4 09:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Though you also get their exhaustion...so be careful. - Fri Dec  4 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its easy to overstrain yourself like that. - Fri Dec  4 09:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We think alike. - Fri Dec  4 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) nodded at her, she still had trouble getting her head around people having trouble for chakra.

"Chakra has never really been a problem for me...but yes its good practice."* - Fri Dec  4 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Heh...yeahhhh, I don't really understand it either. I just...kept getting more chakra somehow. - Fri Dec  4 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And it still keeps rising. Weird huh. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You think so? - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Like, it reminds me of this Jinchuuriki I knew once. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Your chakra reminds me of Tetsumi. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh? You know what a Jinchuuriki is? Interesting, thats not common knowledge. - Fri Dec  4 09:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took hold of Mitsunara's hand, moments later the girl would find herself floating without any apparent assistance; while they 'flew' back towards the arena.* - Fri Dec  4 10:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mines? - Fri Dec  4 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. - Fri Dec  4 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: When I'm done...you owe me some help with my training... - Fri Dec  4 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: M'kay. - Fri Dec  4 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright...I'll be back soon. - Fri Dec  4 10:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stepped away from the village, the map for sunagakure in one hand. She studied it thoroughly, memorising every nuiance and hidden little nooks. With Lera's uncanny ability to memorise things photographically, it was easy to commit it to her memory. Once she'd learned all she could, she tucked the scroll back into her jacket and started walking. She sort of wanted to take this a little slower than her usual pace, knowing that training with Sanoke could be in store after the mission was done.

It would have been easy just to summon thirty clones and have them search along with her; but that would leave her exhausted and unfit for any follow up training. That being said, she did make ten of them; sending them each off in different directions. At the same time, she would bite into her thumb and summon a wolf; a wolfs nose could be a useful thing when looking for something like a mine.

While her clones sank into the ground, she would continue walking; keeping her eyes peeled for any sign of a cave or mines system. She was also aware that the desert wasn't exactly the safest place in the world, what with all the wild predators and even the ocasional group of bandits. Her wolf barked out a warning however, when one such danger attempted to creep up on her.

She spun around, facing what looked like a scorpion; extra large with a ridged carapice to protect the soft innards. It was about the size of a small puppy and it seemed to be targeting her wolf, rather than her. Big or not, it was still just a scorpion however. She reached behind her back and pulled Samehada out, holding it loosely in one hand. The scorpion barely had time to react when she slammed the weapon down upon it, cracking through its hard shell and crushing the soft innards.

With a slight yawn, she turned away from the quickly cooling corpse and set back to walking; it was fortunate she was well trained, most of the dangers in this desert meant nothing to her. Looking around, she really could see no signs of any mines; but she wasn't really keen on the idea of reporting a failed mission, having not failed a single mission to date. Sighing to herself, she grabbed the wolf around its waist and lifted off into the sky; maybe she would get a better view from an arial vantage point.

The only issue with this plan however, Lera's sight was average at best; it was harder to spot something noteworthy the further she flew, even if it did increase the field of view. Either way, she could see nothing but sand and rocks for miles; short of checking every single rock, the only way a mine would be here would be if it was buried under tons of sand. Another sigh loosed through her lips as she settled back onto the ground, only to flinch from her wolf barking out a second warning.

She wasn't fast enough to dive out of the way, but she was more than fast enough to change her skin to stone as a large wooden club smashed down on the back of her head. Under the effect of the Domu technique, she was more or less impervious to an attack like this; especially from some half rate bandit. She didn't even move an inch from the blow, instead just sighing and pushing her attacker away. She heard a large thump followed by an 'oomph', the sound of a man it seemed.

When she turned, she was graced by the view of three men dressed in desert rags; which explained why she hadn't seen them, they looked starved and half out of their minds. She looked between the trio with a little frown on her face, she didn't want to hurt them obviously; they looked like the sort who were doing this out of desperation. However, they trio had different ideas. While the first was dragging himself out of the sand, the other two were leaping for her; swinging crude rusted knives to whatever portion of skin they could reach.

Lera just let the knives break on her stone like skin while she watched them with a look of pity in her eyes "Look guys...I really don't want to hurt you. You look hungry and thirsty, why don't you pop on over to Sunagakure yeah? You'll be fed there." the trio looked at her with wild eyes, obviously scared but desperate just to take a little bit of money. They didn't respond to her words, instead they just leapt back onto the attack.

Lera shook her head sadly and stepped into the three, slamming three quick jabs into each of their necks. They all slumped to the ground,  completely knocked out. Lera still felt bad for them though, so she waved a hand at the nearby sand and crushed it under the weight of her gravity jutsu. With the added weight, the sand dipped downards; leaving a sizeable hole. She then lined the sides and floor with hardened rock; to stop if filling with more sand. Then finally, she'd fill it with a Sution jutsu; the men would surely appreicate this impromptu swimming pool when they awoke. As a final touch, she left a little bit of money for each of them; enough to feed them for months.

At that moment, her clones started to dissapate; reporting their findings back to her. It didn't seem like there was any mine to find, she hated the fact that she would have to report this back as a failure; but it was necessary. So with a final sigh, she released her wolf and started walking back towards the village. Not looking forwards to the prospect of telling Sanoke it was a failure.* - Fri Dec  4 10:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Block it please. - Fri Dec  4 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed her handseals and created two Katon shadow clones. Then, whilst cracking her neck from side to side; she began moulding her chakra in preperation for what was probably one of her most dangerous combinations.

"I hope you're ready Sanoke"

The first clone would start forming handseals, spewing out flamable mist directly in front of her. Then Lera would form just one handseals, breathing in deeply before releasing a steady vortext of wind straight for Sanoke. Due to the nature of this paticular wind technique, the gas was sucked inside the wind. Finally, before the wind had even reached Sanoke, her third clone formed a few handseals and spewed out a condensed stream of flames right into the wind.

Her wind just ignited violently, turning into a huge spinning vortext of flames. It completely eclipsed Sanoke and his clones, likely incinerating him if he didn't absorb it.* - Fri Dec  4 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Woohoo.. - Fri Dec  4 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, let's head out, yeah? - Fri Dec  4 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We've got directions in the scroll, yeah? - Fri Dec  4 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) clapped her hands together, a grin forming on her face. Lines of clones would begin appearing, all formed from Katon; fifteen of them in total. It was interested to see that her ninjutsu could be nullified so easily, especially when she didn't hold back even a single ounce of her strength.

"Thats awesome! Now lets see how you handle this one!"

The clones worked in pairs, one clone forming the seals for Great breakthrough while the other formed seals for Fireball. Clearly, she was intent on turning the arena into a field of flames. Once she releasd the jutsu, The various Katon and fuuton jutsus would mix together; turning the entire left side of the Arena into a huge wave of flames. Naturally, the original Lera would fly up into the sky to avoid getting caught in her own attack.* - Fri Dec  4 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) dropped back to the ground, letting her clones vanish in a poofs of flame. She rolled her shoulders, enjoying the refreshing feeling of using so much chakra at once.

"Hrmmm. Thats a pretty nifty technique, none of my ninjutsu will work at all? Then what can I do...hmmmm... maybe lets try this."

Putting both palms out in front of her, she began channeling her elements to combine; creating that familiar sphere of golden energy that Sanoke had seen once before. This time, it grew to be much bigger; as big as a football. It let out a deep and extremely loud hum, begging to be released. However, instead of realeasing it; she let it disperse naturaly and tipped her head back in a laugh.

"Hah, nah. Not gonna use that"

Instead, she formed another seal; creating a Mizu clone this time to stand by her side. The clone formed its seals and took in a deep breath, converting its entire chakra and water supply into a huge explosive wave; heading straight for Sanoke. To make matters worse, Lera would also form some seals; before plunging her hands towards the wave and electrifying it.* - Fri Dec  4 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Eh. I still have more than half left ya know. - Fri Dec  4 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And I got Kiyoko to name it - Fri Dec  4 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its called 'Pandoras Light' - Fri Dec  4 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyways. Last one. I'll throw every element at you, see how you deal with that eh? - Fri Dec  4 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) quickly created another four clones; Earth, Fire, Water and a shadow clone to stand in for lightning. With the clones prepared, she started preparing to launch the most powerful jutsu she had for every element. Starting with the water clone, it would repeat the actions of her previous attack; creating a wave of Water to smash into Sanoke. Her shadow clone formed the seals to electrify it once more.

Meanwhile, Her doton clone slammed its hands down on the groud; intent on having four spikes to jut up and out the ground around Sanoke, they seemed to be aimed for his clones rather than Sanoke himself. Finally, the Katon clone and Lera herself would jump high; forming seals as they did. The Clone spewed a great ball of fire down towards Sanoke, while Lera released a hale of extremely sharp wind shards. The shards would travels through the flames, only increasing their ability to tear through flesh and even steel like paper.* - Fri Dec  4 12:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) thinks: Ummm... now she's training... ummmmmh.... eh... might as well~ - Fri Dec  4 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took the scroll from sanoke and read it thoroughly, it seemed pretty simple; just a basic extension of the Hiding like a mole technique. Though it was rated at C rank, so it couldn't be -that- easy could it? Either way, the only way to find out was to try it out. After reading through the scroll, she tossed it back over to Sanoke and gradually sunk into the ground.

She took it slowly at first, 'swimming' across the surface as quickly as she could. Then an idea came to her, maybe it would be enough to make Sanoke jump for once. Whilst underground, she pulled Samehada from her back and began 'swimming' towards Sanoke at high speeds. The blade poked out from the sand above her, looking an awful lot like a sharks dorsel fin. Moments before reaching the man, she jumped out directly in front of him; tipping the blade onto her shoulder.

"That was pretty easy."* - Fri Dec  4 13:40:54 2015
