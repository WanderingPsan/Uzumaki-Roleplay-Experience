<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) split the wave of water sweeping towards her, swinging samehada down upon it. The training was starting to get repetitive, but she continued out of necessity more than anything. The improvement had been significant at least, not only with her ability to destroy oncoming Ninjutsu using Samehada; but also with her ability to transition between different elements and ninjutsu in general.

With a smile, she placed samehada on her back and cracked her knuckles. Her clones, standing watching her a short distance away; returned her smile with smiled of their own. This was easily her favourite part of the training, trying to outspeed her two clones in ninjutsu. Obviously, her clones were not quite as strong as she was; but with the fact that their was two of them and only one of her, winning in speed had proven to be annoyingly difficult.

She gave them no quarter though, immediately forming a single handseal to release a gargantuan wave straight for her two clones. The wave was abruptly stopped by a wall of mud, to which Lera replied by stringing another five handseals together and driving her hands towards the wave. There was still a stutter between jutsu, a slight hesitation that would get her killed in battle; but compared to the complete failures at the start of her training this was a huge improvement.

The Lightning flowed through her hands and into the wave, energising it to the point where the entire wave flashed blue with it. However, her clones still had the upper hand in casting speed and they knew exactly what move she would take. One of them had already formed handseals perched on top of the wall, drawing in a breath even as she was releasing her Lightning. Then, a great gust of wind was abruptly released; smashing into her wave and tearing through the Raiton chakra like paper.

The second clone followed up, also jumping to the top of the wall in order to release a simple flamethrower in her direction. It was all she could do to counter it, signing a single seal and spitting out her own stream of water. She still needed more speed, she had to mould the chakra faster...form the seals faster; she had to be unbeatable. The clones started moving, splitting up faster than she could catch them both with a jutsu. As it was, she formed yet more seals and released a hail on wind shards; only able to watch as the barrage travelled in between her two clones uselessly.

In a few more moments, the clones were on either side of her, each forming their own seals in order to release a ball of flame and a small wave of water. Lera still wasn't quick enough, not to block both of the jutsu at once. Instead, she formed a single handseal and created a wall of mud to stop the flames. The wave however, slammed into her back; pusing her against the wall, if not for Samehada on her back consuming the wave...she might have actually suffered an injury.

What bruises she did recieve were instantly healed by the blades unique abilities. She gave a slight huff and slammed her hands together in more seals, deciding to just get rid of both the clones at once. When she exhaled, she began moving her head erratically, firing off clouds of powerful wind shards in all directions. The wind tore through both her mud wall and the two clones, dispersing them and leaving her with their exhaustion. She momentarily slumped before Samehada restored her stamina with the chakra it had eaten; she found it odd, how even now she was still learning new things about the blade. It seemed, the long they were together; the greater their bond became.* - Thu Dec 10 13:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Theres also a Doton jutsu - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: That can counter that ability. - Thu Dec 10 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: I need it... - Thu Dec 10 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Why not both? - Thu Dec 10 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Have you ever accessed your elements? - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Well if your willing to teach both I will call you sensei~ - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Not really... I been focused on my genjutsu - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright then. - Thu Dec 10 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We'll start with Raiton then, since that hurts the most. - Thu Dec 10 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) held her hand out to Rias.* - Thu Dec 10 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) nodded her head and held up her other hand, between herself and Rias.

"Raiton as an element is known for its ability to pierce, unlike wind which is known to cut. Highly concentrated Raiton can tear through earth like paper, which is why its quite a good counter for that jutsu you were talking about. When you imagine Raiton, imagine taking your chakra and rubbing it together; make it fast...fast enough to produce friction and sparks. I find that assigning a colour to each element makes things easier...for example."

With her free hand, she began to manifest the elements on her thumbs and fingers. A red flame appeared on her thumb "Katon is red." A deep blue droplet of water appeared on her index finger "Suiton is dark blue" A visible shard of wind appeared on her middle finger "Fuuton is green." a tiny piece of dirt appeared on her third finger "Doton is brown...and finally." a tiny spark appeared on her little finger "Raiton is white blue."

"The best way to learn how to access an element, is to experience it first hand...which is why I have to aplogise for this." Suddenly, a painful shock of Raiton ran through her arm and into her hand still clasping Rias'. It would be painful for the woman, no doubt...but with no lasting damage.* - Thu Dec 10 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Tch. Trill never does stuff like this. - Thu Dec 10 20:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) released the womans hand and stepped back.

"That feeling is what you're aiming for...but you need to control it. You'll just end up shocking yourself otherwise. Anyway, what I want you to do...is replicate that feeling and expel it from your entire body. Thats the most basic of Raiton tecniques."* - Thu Dec 10 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Hrm..? Ah.... someone is teaching the Hokage... I see... Mrm. - Thu Dec 10 21:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took a seat on the ground and started to gather chakra on her palms. From there, she began 'juggling' what looked like a tiny ball of golden light, while she waited for Rias to practice the technique.* - Thu Dec 10 21:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) moved to sit behind Izanami, reaching out to put a hand of her shoulder. Iza would find that the gravitational pull on her body was growing, weighing her down and making it much harder to move around.

"Alright, I'm increasing the gravitational pull on your body. I'm holding it back ever so slightly so you have a chance. Do you feel the chakra? The way its pulling your body down. What you need to do is reverse that, counteract my gravity with your own. When your able to move again, regardless of my jutsu; I'll consider you to have learned this."* - Fri Dec 11 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm, focus on the idea of 'mass' instead of just trying to fight my jutsu. - Fri Dec 11 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled a little as the weight began to fall off of Izanami, so she redoubled her efforts; bearing down on the girl even harder than before.* - Fri Dec 11 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) removed her hand and abruptly stopped fighting against Iza's weight, if it worked as it was supposed to; Iza would jump up several inches off the ground due to the sudden decrease of weight.

"Yep. Looks like you got it."* - Fri Dec 11 06:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) walked over to the rather large rock nearby, gripping it with a single hand. With only a little effort, she lifted it off the ground and over her head.

"Practice decreasing the weight of this rock, like this."* - Fri Dec 11 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lowered the rock to the ground and stepped away.
