<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: We can also spar here then. - Sun Dec  6 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Outside the village, where we can't break anything. - Sun Dec  6 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Okay then. But it'll be watched for safety, too many deaths coming from the outside as of late. - Sun Dec  6 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Let's go then. - Sun Dec  6 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: How much do I need to hold back... - Sun Dec  6 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) breathed in deep, closing her eyes; she had no idea how much she would need to hold herself back to not cause any serious harm. So far, Sanoke had been the only person she could throw her full power at without fear of killing him. Either way, it was best to prepare first; forming a single handseals to create a total of five katon clones that would stand in front of her. She did not yet have the skill to chain multiple jutsu one after another, so she and her clones would watch and wait to see what Fujitora did.* - Sun Dec  6 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) grinned wide and left her clones to destroy the golem while Lera would deal with Fujitora. She knew that he would defeat her in close combat quickly enough, so she wanted to keep her contact with him as minimal as possible. As he got closer, she would dive to the side; forming handseals and attempting to released a humungous gust of wind into his side. Her ninjutsu was incredibly fast and far more powerful than the last time they'd fought.

Meanwhile, the clones would all begin forming handseals; intent on wiping the Golem off the face of the earth. The first would spew out a flamable gas directly infront of itself, the second and third would release two Divine winds in conjunction. Creating a twister like funnel of wind aimed for the Golem; while it twisted, the gas would be sucked up inside of the funnel. Finally, the last two clones would fire concentrated streams of fire into the wind technique. Amplified by both its nature and the Gas mixed within, the technique exploded outwards; turning into a gigantic twisting inferno.* - Sun Dec  6 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) grunted and channeled chakra into her body, coating it in Doton for the Domu technique. Though Fujitora was still able to get through her Impromptu armour, it lessened the sting of the blows at least. Before he could essentially finish her off; she gripped the hilt of Samehada and brought it down as a sort of shield. Then, using the enhanced strength granted by the Domu technique; she shoved against Samehada, attempting to push it into Fujitora.

Her clones would break off into two groups, two of them staying behind to finish the golem off while the other three turned back to Fujitora. They came running, aiming to get behind the man and grab hold of him. The final two clones would form more seals, breathing in to release Lera's lates Katon technique; two great dragons of flame, bearing down on the injured Golem.* - Sun Dec  6 10:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) grunted in frustration, she'd never really specialised in close combat and Fujitora was proving that now. Even as she was knocked off balance, she dropped Samehada and formed her handseals. If she couldn't hit him head on, she would just overpower him with a much larger attack. While she breathed in, she suddenly started moving her head erratically; spewing massive amounts of wind shards in every direction. With the one safe spot being directly in front Kiyoko.

Her three clones that had attacked Fujitora were unfortunately destroyed, the other two however attempted to hide behind what the assumed was the broken Golem.* - Sun Dec  6 10:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) frowned as her right arm fell limply to the side, a ltitle sigh escaping her lips; it was exactly the same technique Shin has used. Except, with Fujitora she couldn't win just by blasting him with her ninjutsu. So with a grin, she stared Fujitora down and said "Not leaving me much choice here brother."

Though her Right arm was weak and shaky, she forced it upwards to point palm facing outwarids; along side her left arm. She'd begin gathering chakra in her palms, focusing three elements into a single refined point. Too Fujitora's eyes, the sight would be terrifying; he would be able to see the concentrated chakra and possibly even the different elements that went into it. As it was, a golden ball of energy formed infront of her palms; growing in size until it was as large as a Melon. It let off a deep but extremely loud hum, begging to be released at her target.

Everything seemed on edge, the atmosphere was tense with it; the guard looked like her could draw his blade on them at any slight movement. For now, she waited; leaving Mirai to take the lead. Instead, she'd continue to keep an eye on the area; paticularly those kunai turrets, just incase someone was a little too trigger happy.* - Sun Dec  6 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Why does it look like they have more money than Sunagakure? - Sun Dec  6 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Similar to my neighbourhood...I better keep an eye on Kiyoko.. - Sun Dec  6 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stepped through the gate assuming to be following Mirai through; she already had a good idea of what she would do, but with Mirai taking the lead she would have to follow orders.

"What first? I can make shadow clones to ask the locals if you want me to"* - Sun Dec  6 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: What plan? - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: One of us could try to get kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Draw them out. - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We're rather well equipped, most would think twice in touching one of us - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: I...didn't actually think that was a plan. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So, one of us should use henge. If we're going with that plan. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: How is that a plan? - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Once you find out about the individuals who were kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: If we do that though - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: One of us could dress the part. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We should get a good idea of who's been kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Find a pattenr. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Of course. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Then we can make ourselves appear suitable. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) put her hands together into a single seal, creating a total of five clones; each one would go in seperate directions from the group, stopping to knock on doors or talk to anyone walking about. The question was always along the lines of "Hello, I'm a shinobi sent to investigate the dissapearences in your neighbourhood. Is there anything you could tell me that would help with our investigation?"* - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Wait...well I mean why would they kidnap us anyway. Seems like they're going after rich wealthy targets anyways, like people of the Hotomi clans from what Sanoke said. We would have to be one of them to get any attention. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh...I am rich and wealthy you know.. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We said we were going to dress the part Chikyu. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That's why we are getting information on the victims. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Oh yeah you are rich! - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: And, I guess. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I live in a neighbourhood exactly like this, only with less defenses. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) has her clones dissapate when they were done sweeping the neighbourhood; relaying any and all information back to Lera, which she proceeded to write down. Once she'd finished she passed the scroll the Mirai.

"Here, the information my clones came back with."* - Sun Dec  6 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Did you ask any of the Hotomi guys? - Sun Dec  6 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We should go to them together. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can visit there next. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That information can be used later. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm going to send a clone back, see if I can get some information on those names. - Sun Dec  6 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) creates another clone to go back to the archives, or whatever Suna has on its residents; to do a little research on the names she recieved.* - Sun Dec  6 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I can see if my clan has connections as well...bound to be a few. - Sun Dec  6 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: So it was the father... - Sun Dec  6 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) left the talking to Mirai, instead sitting down on the floor so she was a similar height to Lily. Lera had a soft spot for children, she hated to see one so upset. So she attempted to catch the little girls attention, sending her a warm smile.* - Sun Dec  6 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Lily..hm - Sun Dec  6 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Please let me deal with the child.. - Sun Dec  6 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) looked up at the little girls mother and then back to the child, it sounded like the child had seen the intruder. Lera wasn't a mother yet, but she thought herself to be pretty good with the kids. So she attempted to catch the little girls attention, speaking softly towards her.

"Hey. We're going to get your daddy back. We're super strong shinobi after all. Don't you worry." she said this from her position on the floor; making herself appear to be as little a threat as possible.* - Sun Dec  6 16:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Oddly suspicious... - Sun Dec  6 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) kept her gaze on the child, before standing up so she could move to kneel directly in front of her. She was trying to get the little girl to look at her.

"Do you trust us little one? Because we can find your daddy much much faster if you can tell us anything you saw..."* - Sun Dec  6 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) spoke soflty and extremely quietly to the little girl, barely loud enough for her to hear. The others close by would have to strain hard to hear her speak.

"Y'know...I lost my daddy too. I can't get him back, but I can get yours back. But I need you to help me..."* - Sun Dec  6 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: What time did you hear the noise? - Sun Dec  6 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) widened her eyes and reached forwards to hug the child; trying to calm her again.

"Then your daddy is a great man." the next words she whispered "We'll save him."* - Sun Dec  6 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) ruffled her hair ever so slightly, shifting her gaze between each member of the family and then to Mirai. Assuming Mirai would catch her look, she specifically nodded her head in the direciton of the teenage daughter. The look on her face plainly saying 'She's hiding something'.* - Sun Dec  6 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Thank god she understood that... - Sun Dec  6 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) released the distraught child, giving her one last pat on the head so she could return to Mirai.* - Sun Dec  6 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: If thats true...then their might be people still watching the household. If they got the wrong mark, they might come back for the child. - Sun Dec  6 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Use your eyes... - Sun Dec  6 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh my god! - Sun Dec  6 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) jumped, Mirai's scream causing her heart to leap out of her skin.

"Holy s- What?"* - Sun Dec  6 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I forgot that a sale is going on. - Sun Dec  6 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ...... - Sun Dec  6 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Seriously...? - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Can't it wait? - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: There will be another sale. We've got a job to do... - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And I have a plan. - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Anyways let's all discuss this at the other relatives house. - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Then you all are free to go. - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So which one of you wants to henge into the little girl. - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll do it - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It'll be a shadow clone - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So, none of us are actually in danger. - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: That way, we can let them take my clone back to wherever they're keeping these people - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I mean I saw something with my Byakugan. - Sun Dec  6 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: But wait, they said the guy attacked their father. You sure they won't accidently hurt the clone and disperse it? - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wouldn't your clone just like poof. - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: My clone can at least take a couple of hits before its destroyed - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But it can travel long distances. - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And what did you see? - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Some strange thing. - Sun Dec  6 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's very creepy. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I see.. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Anywho since they will be staying here. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We will return as the family. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Your clone will go to the kitchen as if trying to get a cookie. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right...are we using the clone or not? Either way, I would like to b- Right. - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sound good? - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll know immediately if something happens to my clone. As well as where it was. - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed her fingers into a handseal; creating the clone. The clone then in turn formed another seal, becoming a perfect copy of the little girl Lily.* - Sun Dec  6 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) made sure that Samehada was hidden from view, that shit was too obvious.* - Sun Dec  6 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) flinched, she felt her clone die; knowing that Mirai and Chikyu may well be in trouble now, but she didn't want to leave the family without protection.* - Sun Dec  6 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Shit.. - Sun Dec  6 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Stay alert... - Sun Dec  6 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lll The clones inside the room took action immediately, rushing at the two teenaged girls that seemed to be under attack from an unknown source. They couldn't see the figures, but they could kick out at the thin air that seemed to be pinning the two teenagers down. Another clone made for the little girl, noticing that she seemed to be able to 'see' the attackers. Pulling out a number of shuriken, eight in total, she channeled Fuuton chakra into them and tossed them into the air. The Shuriken would start to spin alone, moving in circles at incredible speeds. The clone would then, with a hand on the girls shoulder, say "Point to them!"

Meanwhile, the original Lera called out to Samehada; the blade moving down the hall at high speeds towards her. Once the hilt was in her hand, she burst into the room to survey the scene within.* - Sun Dec  6 18:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) moved to catch the girl Lily before she could strike the wall, throwing Samehada to the ground. Whatever the figure was, it was invisible and seemed to posess some unique techniques. Either way, it had just made a mistake in clearing the room of obstacles. There was now nothing in the way that Lera might accidentally hit. While forming seals she yelled out to Samehada "Samehada, point at him!" the blade seemed to move, specifically aiming its tip towards the centre of the room.

Lera would then release hell upon the man, a tight condensed cloud of wind shards. The range wasn't paticularly wide, so as to avoid hitting the other people inside of the room. If the man didn't move however, both him and the wall behind him would be torn to pieces.* - Sun Dec  6 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) flinched as Samehada squealed in alarm, she had been about to make the weapon grab the kidnapper in its mouth but the warning alterted her to another presence. She took a firm hold of Lily, noticing the bunshin aiming for Lily's ankle. She slammed her foot down on that hand and shouted at Samehada, the weapon would lurch forwards; shooting a long odd looking blade from the tip of its bandaged mouth. She caught the weapon out of mid-air and stabbed it down at the floor boards; hopefully catching the man beneath. She didn't know that this was in fact just a clone.* - Sun Dec  6 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Dammit! - Sun Dec  6 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) growled under her breath, though she didn't swear; not infront of children. She took the blade in her hand and carefully inserted it back into the tip of Samehada. Then, she took a small cloth from her pocket and wiped it on the blood of the intruder. She had at least struck a blow on him and the blood might prove useful in identifying him. Once it was safely tucked away inside her pocket; she went towards the door and then turned back to the family.

Lowering her head and dropping to one knee, she spoke loudly enough for them all to hear "I swear it, on my name as a Hassan; I will bring this man to justice for his crimes." while she spoke, she slowly raised her head; revealing the burning determination in her eyes.* - Sun Dec  6 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) picks Samehada up and returns it to her back, moments after she created a number of Shadow clones that would begin to scour the area for clues; both inside and outside the house.

Meanwhile, Lera answered their question "Its end the moment I find him."* - Sun Dec  6 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I'll need to find Chikyu and Mirai... - Sun Dec  6 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) made her way back to where she felt her first clone destroyed, finding Mirai and Chikyu in what she assumed was a sorry state. She did of course leave more clones with the family, just incase. Arriving at the scene with her two partners, she made another clone; one to pick Mirai up while Lera picked Chikyu up.

"Hospital first, tell me everything on the way. I'll report it."* - Sun Dec  6 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It was just a mess. - Sun Dec  6 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I've come to find out that it's not a ghost. - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's simply someone using Ninjutsu. - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: A strange one. - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yes I know... - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Maintain a mountain. .  - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What? - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Who even maintains a mountain? - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stood and waited for the other two to give their reports before she gave hers.* - Sun Dec  6 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hey Paine! - Sun Dec  6 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: chikyu...y-your...there t-too? - Sun Dec  6 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's me. - Sun Dec  6 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: I'm here too! - Sun Dec  6 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took a breath and stepped forward to give her part of the report.

"I stayed behind with the family to protect them in the event that something went wrong, which something did. A 'ghost' like man assailed the family, pinning the two teenaged children down and...the only way I can describe it; it was like he was sucking the life out of them. My clones inside the room were able to stop him but he used some sort of force technique to blast everything away. I managed to land a blow on him at that point, injuring him; though I don't know how badly. Before I could do anything else, he managed to take the eldest son while a clone attempted to take Lily. I was able to save Lily...but the son was taken. I apologize, but that was my failure."

She then pulled a small piece of cloth from her pocket; unfolding it to reveal a redd stain "I do have a sample of his blood, Kiyoko may be able to cross reference it with the medical records; just in case he's known to the village already. And finally, I left my clones with the family; but I suggest they be moved to another safer location and given twenty four seven protection...the attacker seemed quite intent on the youngest child"* - Sun Dec  6 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Oh...one other thing - Sun Dec  6 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The little girl, Lily. - Sun Dec  6 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: She was able to see the man, despite his invisibility. - Sun Dec  6 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh. . ? - Sun Dec  6 19:45:16 2015
