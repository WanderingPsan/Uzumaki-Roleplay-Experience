<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yessssssss. - Fri Dec  4 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stepped back a bit and clasped her hands together in a single handseal, drawing in a breath and gathering chakra to her lungs. She turned to a wall and released her breath steadily, spitting out a steady spout of water. It impacted the wall, loosening a few stones and leaving behind a crack or two.

"This is the basic Sution technique, the watergun. Form the handseal and take in a deep breath...imagine it as spout of water; from a literal water gun. As for accessing your water element....envision your chakra as a flowing liquid."* - Fri Dec  4 19:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Great! - Fri Dec  4 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) clasped her hands together in yet another single handseal, what seemed to be a re-occuring thing for jutsu of this nature. She turned to the wall again and released her breath for more water. This time, it was closer to a wave; though not so impressive at exploding shockwave, it was still quite a step up from Water Gun.

"Its pretty simple...just do the same as watergun, but increase the volume."* - Fri Dec  4 19:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: What is an Uchiha? - Fri Dec  4 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed another single handseal, so many damn one handseal jutsu seriously, and drew in a breath. When she released it a stream vortex of wind flew forwards, impacting with the wall; it had little effect, the jutsu being meant for combinations more than anything else.

"Divine wind, its not so great on its own; but combine it with an explosive tag and boom! It becomes quite effective. Wind is a lot different to water, imagine your chakra as the finest and sharpest blade; the more you learn to refine it, the greater your wind becomes."

She then turned to the other Hiroshi and formed another single handseal, directing her chakra towards the water from their various water techniques earlier. A perfect copy of herself would rise from the water, taking place in front of the two boys. It soon sank back into the sand with a wink while Lera explained the jutsu.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) turns to the side and holds her palms out towards the wall. She squints in concentration while gathering chakra to her palms muttering a few words under her breath "Doton in the left...Fuuton in the right...Katon in the middle"

As she spoke those words, a little ball of golden light would be manifesting in front of her palms; growing larger until it was the size of a football. She kept it stable and held in place, unwilling the let the thing go off; considering it would kill them both instantly. The light itself let off a deep and loud hum, practically begging to be released.

"This is a new element I made. What do ya think?"* - Sat Dec  5 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) dispersed the ball before it could do any damage and turned back to Trilliam.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Kinami practically gave up when her opponent was Ai. Momura wanted to give it her all, but Hideo didn't show up. Then when she fought Ai, Ai held back on her which only got her more frustrated. - Sat Dec  5 13:58:24 2015
