<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well, a few of them anyway. - Mon Nov 23 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Zenaki and Erin I think their names were..? - Mon Nov 23 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) started doing 'naughty' homosexual things in front of Bryson.* - Mon Nov 23 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I liked Zenaki, She seems pretty smart and I offered to help her with some stuff. - Mon Nov 23 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Erin was pretty cool too, She healed my hand up. - Mon Nov 23 14:09:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: W-Why..? - Mon Nov 23 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Because the last time I saw her help someone she went off with them and came back several hours later and he was never seen again. - Mon Nov 23 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: O-Oh...well I only offered to be nice and because she said she might be able to mend my arm quicker... - Mon Nov 23 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That isn't possible, she isn't a priestess. - Mon Nov 23 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Ok well...i'll try... - Mon Nov 23 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: I already offered to help her though...so it might be a little awkward. - Mon Nov 23 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: What type of help.... - Mon Nov 23 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: She said she was from Konoha so I just...offered her help if she needed it. - Mon Nov 23 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ....She's part of this village. - Mon Nov 23 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: She said she was part of Konoha a while ago but came here...like me. - Mon Nov 23 14:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: R-Right...guess that means i'll have to avoid Erin too...but i'll take your advice... - Mon Nov 23 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...Why do you need to avoid Erin? - Mon Nov 23 14:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: *Sigh*Wouldn't matter anyway...i'd just be shot down again if I asked her out... - Mon Nov 23 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...Oh you asked Erin out? - Mon Nov 23 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Not yet...but I was thinking about it... - Mon Nov 23 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Well I don't know Erin, perhaps she isn't bad. - Mon Nov 23 14:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: It's true though...what Mirai said was true too...i'd probably just mess up in the long run. - Mon Nov 23 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Why does Mirai have a gourd? - Mon Nov 23 14:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Apologized for your sins - Mon Nov 23 14:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh...shit not really. - Mon Nov 23 14:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But doesn't god see fit to kill families and leave people alone and in pain? - Mon Nov 23 14:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So wouldn't he also go to hell? - Mon Nov 23 14:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: God doesnt intervene in human activities - Mon Nov 23 14:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So what does he do? - Mon Nov 23 14:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Watches over you and only helps when you absolutly need it - Mon Nov 23 14:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Really? Huh, That's funny. - Mon Nov 23 14:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What did you just call Kiyoko..? - Mon Nov 23 14:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Thats actually pretty funny. - Mon Nov 23 14:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: *Muffled* Oh my god I'm going to lose it. - Mon Nov 23 14:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) was obviously struggling to not laugh as well.* - Mon Nov 23 14:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: God is a all mightly being with the power to extingush all life in this planet with a snap of his  fingers - Mon Nov 23 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But he doesn't intervene is human activity though? - Mon Nov 23 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: By that definition, Edge is a God. - Mon Nov 23 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I had to. - Mon Nov 23 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) almost breaks into laughter, but turns it into a cough instead.* - Mon Nov 23 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So...he can't really do that. - Mon Nov 23 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: But he keeps all his powers in check becasue he does not intervene in our affairs - Mon Nov 23 14:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Also if he doesn't intervene in human activity...how do you know he's real? - Mon Nov 23 14:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Except you said that he does, when it's REALLY necessary. So that was a lie. - Mon Nov 23 14:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) ll Now that Kiyoko had begun laughing, Lera couldn't help herself. She had to join in.* - Mon Nov 23 14:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Edge is nothing but a child compared to God... - Mon Nov 23 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Who do you think would win in a fight? - Mon Nov 23 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Edge or God? - Mon Nov 23 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: My lord god, please dont strike these ignorant children down, the know not what they do - Mon Nov 23 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: I kinda want to keep going because of how funny this is. - Mon Nov 23 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: This guy is like brainwashed or something. - Mon Nov 23 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: He'll try to purify you. - Mon Nov 23 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: He could try. - Mon Nov 23 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: I could pretend to be Satan if you want? - Mon Nov 23 14:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Hahah, Do it. - Mon Nov 23 14:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Please. - Mon Nov 23 14:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Alrighty then~ - Mon Nov 23 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lifted Kiyoko from her lap and placed her back on the bench, wandered to stand a few feet in front of Bryons. Her grin was practically demonic as she turned to face him, flames starting to lick upwards and around her body. Then in a quiet yet demanding voice, she said "Bow before Satan..."* - Mon Nov 23 14:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: God she is going to get into so much trouble. - Mon Nov 23 14:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) just rolled her eyes and dropped the flames.

"Boring guy. But let me say something. Believe what ever the heck you want to believe, but don't foist it off on others. Thats just rude."* - Mon Nov 23 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: It would be best to say the same to you - Mon Nov 23 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: *Shrug* I don't wanna stop you from believing in a god. Do whatever you want. - Mon Nov 23 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Noone can make me believe any different - Mon Nov 23 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Okay. - Mon Nov 23 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Heh, good acting 'sister' Lera. - Mon Nov 23 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Ehhh, I'll try harder next time. - Mon Nov 23 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: The flames were a nice touch. - Mon Nov 23 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Next time I'll make the earth shake a bit - Mon Nov 23 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Heh, That'll scare him for suuuuuuure. - Mon Nov 23 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Pfft - Mon Nov 23 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Been really quiet today...kinda nice actually. - Mon Nov 23 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Thats good to hear. - Mon Nov 23 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Leraaaaa? Should we go train more? - Mon Nov 23 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hmmmmm? - Mon Nov 23 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure~ - Mon Nov 23 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Rias! Hows the preperation for the Exams? - Mon Nov 23 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Bye, Lera~ - Mon Nov 23 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stood up with Kiyoko in her arms, skipping off into the sunset.* - Mon Nov 23 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sooooooo~ - Mon Nov 23 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Soooooo. - Mon Nov 23 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: What should I teach you this time... - Mon Nov 23 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Whatever you'd like.~ - Mon Nov 23 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hrmmmmm. - Mon Nov 23 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright...I'll show you how to make a bigger gust of wind. - Mon Nov 23 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Wooo. - Mon Nov 23 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Bigger wind. - Mon Nov 23 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) turned away from Kiyoko and ran her hands slowly through five handseals. She drew in her breath, right down to the bottom of her lungs and then released it in one great gust. The gust was much greater than both Divine wind and Gale palm, enough to knock down a tree if used by someone skilled.

"This is Great breakthrough. Its much stronger than Gale palm, but takes a bit longer to use. The power comes from your lungs in this one, you have to draw your breath in as deep as possible and infuse it with your chakra. Then you just...release it in one big exhale."

While she explained she'd work her way behind Kiyoko, pushing her palms upwards right beneath her breasts.* - Mon Nov 23 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smirked and maneuvered her hands directly in front of Kiyoko, performing each handseal slowly enough to be memorised. She was enjoying her chance to both teach and tease Kiyoko at the same time.* - Mon Nov 23 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) drew her hands back again, placing them on Kiyoko's waist and dragging them back to rest beneath her breasts.

"Take your breath all the way down to the bottom, fill your lungs as far as they go."* - Mon Nov 23 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Much better~ - Mon Nov 23 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) gave her breasts a quick squeeze before she stepped away.

"A little bit of Taijutsu next?~"* - Mon Nov 23 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smirked again and created a clone.

"We'll start with something a little bit simple then, how to re-direct another persons strike. This works with most attacks and could technically work against a blade as well, but please don't try that."

She demonstrated the technique at full speed first, having her clone rush her with a straight telephonic punch. Using the palm of her hand, she pushed against her clones wrist and re-directed the strike past her face.

"It works dependant on how fast your reflexes are, but it should prove useful if you're forced to defend yourself."

She repeated the technique again, but this time at a much slower rate; allowing Kiyoko to see it in every detail.

"Alright, now you try. My clone will attempt to hit you, though it will always stop just short of the mark just incase." with that her clone faced off against Kiyoko and would punch when signaled to do so. Not once would it try to actually hit her however.* - Mon Nov 23 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright...and when you redirect a strike....you counter it like this! - Mon Nov 23 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) had her clone rush her again, throwing a punch right for her face. Lera took a step forward and pushed the wrist aside with her left hand, while her right hand lauched a strike towards the throat. Once again, she pulled back and demonstrated the move in slow-motion; though it was a pretty fundamental technique for anyone to learn. She figured there was no need to explain the effect; being that Kiyoko was a Nurse, she probably knew more than Lera about it anyway.

"Make your fist but have your index finger pointing outwards ever so slightly; jab the point of your finger joint right into the throat."

With demonstrations over, she had the clone face off Kiyoko once more.* - Mon Nov 23 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its good to know a little bit of everything...just in case~ - Mon Nov 23 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyways, you're looking pretty sweaty there hun~ - Mon Nov 23 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) leaned in and kissed her forehead, getting the taste of sweat on her lips.* - Mon Nov 23 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) hummed under her breath, reaching down to gently pinch Kiyoko's ass.

"Mhmmm...true, your ass is plenty cute enough~ even without all this exercise..."* - Mon Nov 23 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lunged for her, grabbing her in a tight embrace followed by a kiss. When she drew back, she was grinning.

"I can't help it. You're just too beautifut. But right right, training~"* - Mon Nov 23 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stepped back with another wink, thinking about what to teach her next. Pulling out a shuriken, she flowed her chakra into it and pushed it upwards into the air. It stayed floating around her, spinning with a light breeze of wind.

"Either this or chakra flow? Which one first?"* - Mon Nov 23 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sort of Yeah, but this is more...hnn...guiding the shuriken with wind rather than strengthening it. - Mon Nov 23 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But Chakra flow first. Okay~ - Mon Nov 23 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took out her tanto and handed it to Kiyoko.* - Mon Nov 23 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled and put her hand over Kiyoko's, directing her arm into the right stance for holding a Tanto; she had been taught the basics in using a Tanto at least, it might help Kiyoko later with her Kukiri hopefully.

She once again sidled up behind Kiyoko, pushing and pulling her body so she stood at an angle; with the tanto held out infront of her and her other hand hidden behind her waist.

"This is the basic stance for using a single bladed weapon like this, I imagine it will be a bit different for your Kukiri; but this should help at least~ Anyways, chakra flow."

Lera didn't need much contact with the weapon to flow her chakra into it. So she moved a single finger to touch the hilt of the weapon whilst she still held onto Kiyoko's hand. She closed her eyes and concentrated chakra onto the blade; imagining an ever sharpening shard of wind. The greenish blue haze settled over the weapons; extending it by almost two inches. It was her hope that by experiencing the chakra flow like this, Kiyoko would be able to get a good feel for how it worked.

"Can you feel it? The chakra flowing through the weapon; thats the feeling you should be aiming for." at this point she released Kiyoko and stepped back "Imagine your chakra sharpening down the finest of points, this is wind at is most fundamental nature. Also, don't treat the weapon as a tool; but as an extension of your arm. Don't try to force chakra into it, instead try to extend your flow of chakra to include it."* - Mon Nov 23 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lurched forward as soon as Kiyoko cut herself, though stepped back again with a grumble when she was waved off. When Kiyoko completed the technique, she clapped her hands together but immediately went to examine her cut hand.

"Can you heal it...?"* - Mon Nov 23 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: .... - Mon Nov 23 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hnnn... - Mon Nov 23 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm no good with medical stuff.... - Mon Nov 23 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We can go ask him.... - Mon Nov 23 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right. - Mon Nov 23 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) picked up the tanto and sheathed it, tieing it to Kiyoko's waste moments after. She then picked the woman up and carried her off, Lera just blowing things out of proportion.* - Mon Nov 23 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Didn't he go to his house? - Mon Nov 23 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Wheres that...? - Mon Nov 23 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uh... North East district. - Mon Nov 23 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Far right. - Mon Nov 23 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) le knock knock.* - Mon Nov 23 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) wandered in carrying Kiyoko.

"Bryon?? Can you heal her please???" ironically, there was no serious injuries; Lera was just being overdramatic about it.* - Mon Nov 23 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: What is the problem? - Mon Nov 23 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) walked up closer giving Bryson access to her hands, but never putting her down.

"Thanks..."* - Mon Nov 23 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) nodded her head and took Kiyoko over to the sink, acting as the horse.* - Mon Nov 23 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thank you again. - Mon Nov 23 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Anytime... Its what im here for - Mon Nov 23 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) snuck a little bit of money onto Brysons counter, Lera don't take shit for free.* - Mon Nov 23 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Be careful now ok? - Mon Nov 23 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Y-yeah, training just...not used to this sort of thing. - Mon Nov 23 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: She'll get better, I'll watch her veeeery carefully. - Mon Nov 23 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) starts edging before the door, opening it up. Before she left, she looked back over her shoulder and said "I left a donation on your counter. Bye~" she then rushed out before Bryson could say anything.* - Mon Nov 23 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Ugh...that sucked...watching you hurt yourself like that. - Mon Nov 23 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I should let off some steam... - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sanoke. - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Spar? - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Nah it's okay.. I'm fine Lera. - Mon Nov 23 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Mon Nov 23 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Still scared me though... - Mon Nov 23 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? And a bit. - Mon Nov 23 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: In a bit? - Mon Nov 23 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Want to see how this battle turns out. - Mon Nov 23 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ah...sure okay. - Mon Nov 23 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Iza. Spar? - Mon Nov 23 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Uh...I can't right now sorry - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Damn... - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Man...Watching these kids spar is really getting me excited...Sanoke wanna train with me? - Mon Nov 23 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Mon Nov 23 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Mon Nov 23 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Kazekage. . . - Mon Nov 23 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 23 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I promised Lera I'd spar her after. You could take her, though. - Mon Nov 23 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Can I show you my progress? I can't spar, but I'd like to show you. - Mon Nov 23 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ...Last time I spar'd pops he laid my leg open - Mon Nov 23 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 23 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm gonna try this time though Lera. - Mon Nov 23 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I promise. - Mon Nov 23 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ..... - Mon Nov 23 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Aw come on... - Mon Nov 23 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll just have to throw my best at you then huh... - Mon Nov 23 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Fine... - Mon Nov 23 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I won't hold back on my jutsu this time.... - Mon Nov 23 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: This'll be good. - Mon Nov 23 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Two elementalists, strong ones, going blow for blow. - Mon Nov 23 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Let's not fight here though. - Mon Nov 23 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah.... - Mon Nov 23 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) spat out a little bit of mud first, that shit was handy.

"Oops...well...you want to start pops?"* - Mon Nov 23 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: .... - Mon Nov 23 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thank you. - Mon Nov 23 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Finally taking me seriously... - Mon Nov 23 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) clapped her hands together in a seal, creating a total of five mud clones that began spreading outwards. She was showing off her chakra pools here by using a jutsu that might usually drain significant amounts. The real Lera stepped backwards, pulling out Samehada and guarding her body with it. She'd seen first hand his speed when using that armour, the little gap between them would be nothing to him. She realised the best chance she had was withstanding the first attack so she could counter.* - Mon Nov 23 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Maaaaaaaaan... - Mon Nov 23 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you're gonna use a bunch of clones... - Mon Nov 23 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Maybe I should get serious.. - Mon Nov 23 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Mon Nov 23 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Do it. - Mon Nov 23 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ... - Mon Nov 23 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Mon Nov 23 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ..... - Mon Nov 23 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: He has such powerful wind ninjutsu... - Mon Nov 23 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) widened her eyes a bit, seeing for herself how his wind armour seemed to grow more concentrated. She suddenly wanted to throw everything she had at it, to test exactly how much she could push him. She tied Samehada back onto her body and started forming handseals along side all of her clones. The clones user the already existing mud she'd created and spawned what looked like five dragon heads from the mud.

Lera however, would fire a huge concentrated fireball directly towards Hassan. With his speed, he could likely get away; but at that moment her five mud dragons would fire a hail of hardened mud bullets directly through the fireball. She turned her attack into a wide ranged hail of flaming mud bullets.* - Mon Nov 23 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *blinks* - Mon Nov 23 19:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) blinked a couple times as she lost him, her own flames covered his escape but she didn't even see where he'd gone. She spent a few moments looking around frantically, before she spotted him hiding behind Aza and co. She cursed silently under her breath, knowing that she couldn't throw anything at him if he hid behind the others; for fear of hurting them badly. She knew that he could dissapear from her sight again at any moment, so she prepared her counter for what was sure to be an attack.

Her five clones began channeling their chakra, the first apparently sinking back into the mud; trying to hide the fac that it had gone underground. The other four began to prepare a necessary defense for the original, ready to errect barriers at a moments notice. Lera herself formed a few handseals and began spewing a near invisible gas to cover the area; making sure it didn't reach the audience.* - Mon Nov 23 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) attempted to jump away the moment he vanished from her gaze, assuming that she was the intended target. Her clones reacted as they had originally intended; activating a four layered earthen dome that would surround the original Lera; before they were abruptly destroyed by Hassan's hell stab. The clone that had sunk its way into the ground couldn't even follow Hassan's movement with the magnetic senses given by the jutsu; so it instead bided its time staying hidden underground for the time being.

Lera on the other hand, felt her chakra link to the mud clones vanish; so abruptly she didn't even have the chance to repair them. Hidden within the four layered dome as she was, she expected that she'd not be struck by whatever follow up attack Hassan had planned. That being said, she also knew that even four layers would quickly be destroyed by Hassan. She had to prepare herself for the next few attacks, starting by spewing out enough water to give herself a decent water source.* - Mon Nov 23 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) paused her handseal mid-stroke, having been about to make yet more clones. She grumbled some obsceneities under her breat and caused her dome to crumble away and the ankle deep water to flow out.

"Seriously....you couldn't take it to the end? Jeez.."* - Mon Nov 23 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm out of chakra.. - Mon Nov 23 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh huh. - Mon Nov 23 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: ....that fast? - Mon Nov 23 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You could've got me and you know it. - Mon Nov 23 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Plus I got everything I needed out of that. - Mon Nov 23 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Let me tell you this.. - Mon Nov 23 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I barely used any chakra at all... - Mon Nov 23 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: All my jutsu are lethal. - Mon Nov 23 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I know... - Mon Nov 23 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And most are forbidden. - Mon Nov 23 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I didn't even break out my new stuff. - Mon Nov 23 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So I can't really take it to the end most o the time. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I just wanted to use full strength, it's been a while. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right right... - Mon Nov 23 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I had actually forgotten how to do it, Hahahahaha! - Mon Nov 23 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You dodged that big combination easily though.. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I copied Kenshin's thing a while back. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And he copiedme in a sense. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right... - Mon Nov 23 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Pops. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Woo.~ - Mon Nov 23 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I completed that thing I showed you - Mon Nov 23 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I just have to make a technique out of it now. - Mon Nov 23 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Good luck. - Mon Nov 23 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah.... - Mon Nov 23 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: As long as Kiyoko doesn't tell me off too much~ - Mon Nov 23 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm... - Mon Nov 23 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *glances* - Mon Nov 23 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She let me name it, Sir. - Mon Nov 23 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled at Kiyoko, knowing her new element scared her.* - Mon Nov 23 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm~ She had a way better name than me. - Mon Nov 23 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I want a turn. - Mon Nov 23 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh? You want to spar now? - Mon Nov 23 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *nods*  - Mon Nov 23 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hmmm...I have plenty of chakra left I guess. - Mon Nov 23 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Alright.~ - Mon Nov 23 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) brought her hands back together, using the water she'd already made in her fight with Hassan to create another four clones; this time out of water. She knew Izanami used fire and was extremely good at it, Lera wasn't going to hold back so much.

"Lets do this."* - Mon Nov 23 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) watched as each one of her four clones formed just a single handseals, drawing in breaths and reaching for their chakra reserves. Then in unison, each of the four clones would spew out humungous waves of water; though each one depleted their entire reserves to do so and thus vanished. It was fortunate her skill with Water wasn't that great, she needn't fear swamping the village by accident. She assumed, however, that this would be enough to deal with the Fire and probably swamp Izanami and the first two of her clones.

Lera herself would pull out five shuriken and channel her Fuuton chakra into them, tossing them upwards into the air. They flew upwards and stopped in mid-air, beginning to circle the area; ready to be guided towards any target.* - Mon Nov 23 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: NANI? - Mon Nov 23 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Mon Nov 23 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took note of Izanami's clone rushing towards her and the fact Izanami herself had escaped up into the air. She stood still, calmly analysing the situation and what she could do. To deal with the clone rushing her, she opened up her palm and pointed it at the ground; sending a ball of Lightning to impact with the soaked earth. She intended to use the water as a conductive element, to send the shock through it and towards the clone rushing at her.

As for the real izanami, she sent her five waiting shuriken spinning towards her; only to have them stop and begin circling the girl instead. She was taking a tactic right out of Hassan's book here.* - Mon Nov 23 20:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) frowned and reached for Samehada on her back, deflecting the giant shuriken would be an easy thing to do; but then Izanami would know that. Instead, she released her grip on the hilt and ran through some more handseals; constructing a mud wall in front of her and hoping this would block the shuriken. Meanwhile, Lera's own five shuriken would suddenly shoot inwards; intending to strike Izanami in her middle.* - Mon Nov 23 20:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) didn't see her coming, or see what had happened from behind her wall; she did however hear the crack of her wall being broken as Izanami smashed through it. To fend off the debree, she channelled Doton chakra across her skin; having rock and pebble alike bounce of her skin as if it were stone. At the same time, she reached behind her back and brandished Samehada; ready to recieve Izanami in close field combat.* - Mon Nov 23 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) jumped backwards, bringing Samehada to cover her front; she wasn't quite fast enough however. Samehada was able to absorb a great deal of the chakra, despite its grunts of displeasure from the Raiton. However, as Lera landed back on her feet; her left arm dropped to her side, momentarily out of action as the Raiton ran through it.* - Mon Nov 23 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Sorry buddy... - Mon Nov 23 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) settled her stance and rested samehada on one shoulder, she glanced down to her left arm; slowly lifting the limb to shake the numbness from it.

"I'd say it was closer to a draw honestly. But I used nearly half of my chakra for once...makes a nice change."* - Mon Nov 23 20:55:40 2015
