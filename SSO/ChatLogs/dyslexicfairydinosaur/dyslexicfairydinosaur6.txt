<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sat a little further away from Iza and held her palms together; bringing them outwards so there was a good thirty centimitre gap between them. She took in a quick gulp of air before focusing her chakra and whispering loud enough for Iza to hear.

"Earth in the Left....Wind in the Right...and Fire in the middle."

As she spoke those words, she'd be mixing the three elements into a single new one. It started as a simple golden speck suspended between her palms, but it quickly grew until it was the size of a golf ball. At this point, the new element was letting of a deep vibrating hum; begging to be released.

"This is as big as I dare take it here...Its not quite complete yet, theres a few kinks to work out; but I'm nearly there. After you've learned Earth, it'll be ready to be taught." with that, she closed her hands around the golden light; snuffing it out.* - Sun Nov 29 20:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The academic answer. Yes thats right. - Sun Nov 29 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But theres more to it then that. - Sun Nov 29 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) settled into the cushions ready to talk about her favourite element.

"Earth is a lot of things. Its both Solid and flowing, hard and soft. Earth is one of the most free and diverse elements you'll ever learn. Earth can do a lot of things, manipulating the earth is one of those things yes. But it goes much further than that, as far as manipulating gravity itself."* - Sun Nov 29 20:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. It works both ways as I'm sure you remember. Both to increase and Decrease. - Sun Nov 29 20:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyway. We'll start with the basics today. Finding your Earthen chakra. - Sun Nov 29 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: For that, you should be in direct contact with earth. - Sun Nov 29 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) picked her up again.* - Sun Nov 29 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed a few handseals and slammed her foot into the ground, a large flat rock would jut upwards out of the sand; providing a nice surface to sit on. There was enough room for the both of them. Once Lera was seated in a meditative position; she gestured for izanami to do the same.* - Sun Nov 29 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 29 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) steadied her breathing and held both hands in her lap.

"Close your eyes. Blot everything else out, just focusing on nothing but yourself and the rock underneath you."* - Sun Nov 29 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It'll come to you naturally. - Sun Nov 29 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) closed her own eyes, concentrating her chakra into the rock below her. She had an idea for helping Izanami gain control over the element at a much faster rate. The hardest part was learning the feeling. So Lera concentrated Doton chakra into the rock without Izanami knowing about it. She would hopefully feel the chakra and be able to tap into that feeling.* - Sun Nov 29 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) twitched her lips into a smile, trust Iza to get the idea quickly. Once she was lost in the rock, the girl would probably be there for a while. So as gently as she could, she withdrew her chakra and stood up; stepping off the rock so Iza lose herself in it alone.* - Sun Nov 29 21:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) slipped out of the house into the still warm air that was Sunagakure, it was about time for her to restart her training again; enough wallowing in her own self pity. At least, she considered, he had died of natural causes; death brought on by years rather than injury. With a shuddering breath, she shook off those morbid thoughts and wandered out of the village to find a secluded space.

She still struggled with the guilt, the guilt of missing the fight and failing to help those who needed it. That was part of the reason why she'd now taken Izanami on as a student, though the girl was already an accomplished elementalist in her own right; Lera felt almost responsible for her injury. To lose the use of an arm, to lose the ability to do battle; Lera couldn't imagine what that felt like. She felt as if she should have been there to stop it from happening.

So that was why she'd decided to give the girl the ability to fight without that arm, starting with the Handseal-less Doton jutsu. Then, when lera had gained mastery over Pandora's light and when Izanami had gained enough skill with Doton. She would pass the light onto Izanami, giving her a weapon she could use with the need for handseals...a weapon powerful enough to protect her against anything.

However, there was still a fair amount of time before that could happen; Izanami was still so young and inexperienced. She might have been a powerful elementalist, but the light was still an incredibly dangerous element to handle; a little too much for someone so young. So, in the meantime; Lera was going to train, train and then train some more. Until her own elementalist skills were unrivaled by anyone yet living in this world. Until the day she passed on to face a proud father on the other side.

Lost in her thoughts as she was, she went a far way before finally snapping out of it and coming to a stop. The village now, was an image of raised walls in the distance; just a small speck on the horizon. She hadn't meant to come quite this far, but it suited her purposes just fine. The reason for wanting such isolation, is that she intended to use the full power of her elemental skills; something she rarely did for fear of breaking something by accident.

She'd noticed something recently, something that had never been much of a problem until now; but after seeing people who could cast ninjutsu consecutively at high speeds, she realised that she needed to work on it. Specifically, she needed to work on her own casting speed; train until she could cast jutsu after jutsu, fast enough to give even the fastest of Taijutsu users no chance to avoid it. Then maybe one day, she may even be able to cast jutsu at the same time.

Taking in a deep breath, she began forming the handseals; forming the seals so fast her hands became blur. Within seconds, she was spewing a huge ball of flames; blasting the sand with such intense heats that it vitrified into molten glass. Even as the stream was cutting off, she had placed her hands together; attempting to gather her chakra together in order to perform a second jutsu. However, the chakra just took too long to gather; far too long.

It took several seconds before she had gathered the necessary chakra; enough to release a heavy blast of wind from her palm. Molten glass and sand alike spread outwards in a cloud, but it was still too slow; the few second lost in between jutsus would give an opponent ample time to counter attack. The only thing she could think to do was to just keep forming those jutsu, casting one after another as far as her chakra would allow it.

The stream of wind cut off as she slammed her fingers together in another seal, breathing in deep to release a torrent of water onto the sand. Without even waiting for the waters to settle, she brought her hands back and then clapped them together. Only to draw them apart again with the intent of creating a ball of lighting. She grunted at the effort, the concentration needed for switching between elements at such high speeds. It still took her a long time, too long to form the ball of lightning. By that point, the water had almost completely soaked into the sand.

That didn't stop her though, she tossed the ball directly at the wet sand; not even watching while Raiton spread through the wetness like a disease. Her hands were already forming zet more seals; bringing her hands down to the sand beneath her feet. A few seconds later a great wall rising in front of her, eclipsing the sun from view. She didn't stop to marvel the size, to see just how far she'd come in these few short months. Instead, she was once again forming more seals; her body straining as she changed her element for the sixth time.

She gritted her teeth through the growing pain in her forehead, the constant switching was giving her a headache. It was also more exhausting than she expected, her stamina taking the drain even if her chakra didn't. Several seconds after the wall had risen, she'd gathered her chakra and was slamming it against the solid. Again though, it was too slow; too slow to be useful in a battle. Even as Raiton rippled through the Earthen wall, ripping it to shreds; she was forming another five seals, taking a deep breath in preperation for yet another jutsu.

By the time the jutsu was ready, the debree of electrified rock was already settling in the dust. She released the jutsu anyway, sending the biggest blast of wind she was capable of mustering. It went without saying, Lera was capable of some very powerful jutsu; what could only hold mediocre power in one person, held exceptional power in hers. The debree of her Earthen wall was sent rockiting away in her gust, A gigantic cloud dust raising high into the sky.

Even with that, she still wasn't done; raising her hands to form more handseals. However, it was at the moment she stumbled; her body essentially stopping her from doing any more. She raised her hand to a warm wetness spreading from her nose, surprised to find that her nose was bleeding. This was probably her body's way of telling her that this was too many jutsu and too fast. Even so, she didn't care what her body said; whether she was supposed to take it slow or not, this was the fastest way.

Wiping her bloody nose, she stood up once again; forming a handseal for a single Shadow Clone. The newly created clone joined in on her training, spewing out a deadly flamable gas while Lera formed yet more seals. It was just fortunate that this training allowed her to test out combinations as well as practice her speed; it was two birds with one stone. Moments after the clone had released the gas, Lera spewed out a steady torrent of wind. The wind spiraled in a vortex, sucking the gas up to give the wind a deadly explosive aspect.

The clone itself had already begun forming more seals even after its use of gas. It took in a deep breath and let out a stream of concentrated flames. The flames ignited the wind on contact, catching the gas in the middle to increase the flames size at an explosive rate. The result was a giant twister of flames, boring through sand and stone alike. The flames soon died out, the clone dissapearing as they did and Lera was left to fall to her knees coughing.

Blood now flowed freely from her nose and her skin had taken on a pale and sickly pallor, her body truly was screaming at her to stop now; any further and she would pass out, a dangerous thing to do in the middle of the desert Kiyoko would never forgive her for it. With a grunt, she forced herself back to her feet and shuffled back towards the village; promising herself to return and continue this training.* - Mon Nov 30 13:46:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Lets see how much stronger she's gotten... - Mon Nov 30 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) made no motions to defend herself, non at all. She wanted to test how far Chikyu had come, what better way than to take one of the attacks. That being said, she wasn't stupid enough to take an attack on bare skin. So she covered her skin in chakra, changing it to a darker brown colour. As for the attack, she stepped into it; allowing the blade to slam down on her shoulder. The sound was akin to steel on stone; cracking against her shoulder with a great deal of force.

Lera winced a little and was forced to drop down to one knee, a tiny crack even appeared in her Domu armour "Excellent, you've grown again. I'll aknowledge you." Reaching upwards, she attempted to grip the blade and push it away; jumping back to her feet and moving backwards all in the same motion. With a lopsided grin, she clapped her hands together and thrust a palm towards the girl; sending a blast of wind to push her back and possibly off her feet.* - Mon Nov 30 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) gathered chakra to her throat, pointing her mouth towards Chikyu's charging form. She then spat a small amount of mud, a few buckets full at most; her aim was specifically her feet. With Chikyu's level of skill, it probably wouldn't trip her up; but it would hopefully destabilise and slow her down. With that in effect, Lera attempted to step past the oncoming attack and directly into Chikyu's chest. She knew the issues with using Large swords just as well as anyone, in extreme close quarters it was near impossible to get a strike in.

However, with her Domu armour deactivated; She knew that Chikyu's physical strength was much higher. Either way, she'd attempt to push Chikyu to the ground and straddle her body.* - Mon Nov 30 15:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) found herself being throwing behind Chikyu, though she rolled back to her feet rather than fall to the ground. She wasted no time, in forming another seal; aiming her chakra towards the mud that Chikyu had just slipped from and was trying to escape from. Rising from it would be a pair of hands, quickly followed by a head and then a torso as a perfect copy of Lera was created lunging straight for Chikyu's ankles.* - Mon Nov 30 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) merely got back to her feet, allowing the clone to be swiped away and destroyed. She could have reformed it but didn't see the point. Once back to her feet, she cracked her neck from side to side and waited for Chikyu to recover completely.

"Alright. Lets try a different element. Something not so dangerous. Water or wind...hmmm."* - Mon Nov 30 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) nodded and decided on using the water element, it was one of her weaker elements after all; better to give Chikyu a chance. She started off by forming a number of handseals and taking in a breath before spitting out a shot of water straight at Chikyu. Though it wasn't hugely strong, it held enough power to leave a nasty bruise and it traveled at extremely high speeds.* - Mon Nov 30 16:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) grinned past her water and cut off the flow, forming a few more handseals as she did -so she can deal with that, what if I add more-. With another breath, she spewed out yet more water; the volume was significantly larger this time. If the water didn't swamp Chikyu and wash her away, it would more than likely stop her in her tracks.* - Mon Nov 30 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) cut off the water once again, seeing the clone coming at her. There was nothing left for it but to completely blow everything away. Her hands formed into a single seal, before spewing out yet more water. This time it was in a huge violent wave; washing away everything infront of her. She held back enough to not harm the girl, but put enough power to blow her away.* - Mon Nov 30 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) cut her water off again and waited for Chikyu to recover.* - Mon Nov 30 16:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) shook her head and nodded to Shin, leading him away to the training field.* - Mon Nov 30 18:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Alright - Mon Nov 30 18:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmmm . . . - Mon Nov 30 18:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) brought her hands together in a number of handseals, gathering chakra to her palms before slamming them down on the ground. A great wall would spring upwards and out of the sand in front of her, hopefully stopping the mud from ever reaching her. Either way, she would tilt into a run, charging up the wall using suimen and coming to a rest at the top; staring down at Shin for his next move.* - Mon Nov 30 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled and brought her hands together in another single handseals, these were both jutsu she knew and unfortunately for Shin; she'd since learned how to counter Fire after the last time they fought. Taking in a deep breath, she concentrated chakra into her lungs before spewing out a humungous amount of water. The last time they'd sparred, Lera had not been able to use the Suiton element; obviously she'd been busy.

If all things went as planned, she would not only engulf the flames and completely wipe them out; but she would also swamp Shin and his three clones.* - Mon Nov 30 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: 31.4 - Mon Nov 30 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) noticed her vision getting hazy, as if a film was placed over her sight and she was being spun in circles. She realised immediately that she would not be able to move like this, at this rate Shin would pick her off easily. If that was going to be the case, she would simply have to focus on her defense until whatever was happening wore off. Reaching for the hilt of Samehada, she closed her useless eyes and brandished the weapon ready while channeling chakra across her skin. If she could see or move, she would just have to react to whatever hit her first.* - Mon Nov 30 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: You know what to do buddy... - Mon Nov 30 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) frowned as she lost the control of her right arm, Samehada falling to the ground with a thud; this was not what she expected. Next time she would just wipe the guy out in one move, though that wasn't nearly as fun. She had no desire to let anything do the same to her, so as the Domu faded away; something different would cover her skin.

Whatever clones that were now reaching for her would suddenly find themselves engulfed in flames; bodies likely burned to a crisp at the close proximity of Lera erupting in a shroud of flame.

"Now now...I didn't know you could do that...can I do it with one arm I wonder.."* - Mon Nov 30 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: `  - Mon Nov 30 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: This is a good handicap... - Mon Nov 30 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) reached down and grabbed hold of Samehada with her left arm, tipping it back and literally throwing it with all her might. The intention seemed to be to throw it at Shin; though she lacked the skill with her left arm and it went overhead, landing behind him.

"Oh jeez...I'm so bad with my left...Oh well."

With a look of glum acceptance, she reached into her holster and withdrew a number of shuriken. Into each shuriken, she charged an amount of chakra before tossing them up into the air. The shuriken seemed to begin to fall before stopping and starting to circle the area. There were five of them in total, just waiting for Lera's direction to strike.* - Mon Nov 30 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) waved her hand, the flying shuriken taking action and flying towards one clone each. They were fast, extremely fast; to the point where they were a nothing but a blur (17 tile speed). With any luck, tfive of the six clone would be taken care of immediately. The other would have to deal with her flames anyway; not that it mattered for she intended to end it.

She called out apparently to Shin, however her attention was not on shin but the weapon sitting in the sand behind "Hey buddy...?....eat."

Samehada sprung into action immediately, bandages at its tip shredding off to reveal a gaping maw with rows of sharp teeth. If it wasn't stopped, it would clamp its teeth around Shin and begin devouring his chakra.* - Mon Nov 30 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) didn't topple off the wall, though she did -fall- it did not last for long. Her flames abruptly vanished, to be replaced with a lowering of her own gravity; causing her to float in mid-air still looking down at Shin. She was covered in numerous cuts and grazes but the Fire shroud had taken the worst of the damage. Assuming she was no longer under the genjutsu, she adressed shin from her new position in the air.

"Still want to go...?"* - Mon Nov 30 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I see... - Mon Nov 30 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) floated back down to the earth, going over to retrieve Samehada.

"Are you going to remove this seal on my arm?"* - Mon Nov 30 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Oh, right - Mon Nov 30 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You'll have to roll up you remove your sleeves. - Mon Nov 30 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) just tore the sleeve off, she never wore the same outfit twice; even if they were all the same. Rich people problems.* - Mon Nov 30 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Well. - Mon Nov 30 19:38:27 2015
