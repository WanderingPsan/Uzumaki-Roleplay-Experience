<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) puts a hand on Samehada's hilt and sets her gaze on the two. The pair would suddenly feel an immense and terrifying pressure; giving Lera the appearence of someone many times larger.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) flowed Doton chakra throughout her skin, she was trying to test every aspect of Kinami's strength not just her ability to resist the pressure. The fist struck against her hardened skin, sending her skidding backwards in the sand. Blood sprayed from her mouth as both her lip and inside of her cheek was torn to shreds. When she finally came to a rest, she put a hand to her mouth; wincing at the pain. She assumed Kinami was at least following the sparring etiquette and avoiding the truly dangerous blows. If it hadn't been then Lera might have even been knocked out.

"Ouch jeez...you've really been training hard haven't you."

She removed her hand from her mouth, it seemed the injury was already completely gone; both the torn lip and any sort of bruise that had been developing "Good...very good. Alright, lets go again"* - Sun Dec 13 14:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) clapped her hands together in a single seal, drawing in a breath and mixing it with her chakra. In the same moment her skin would be returning to its normal colour, moments before she exhaled a huge wave of water directly towards the oncoming Kinami. She didn't stop there however, pulling back her hand she released a ball of Lightning into into the wave; electrifying it with flashes of blue.* - Sun Dec 13 14:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: --Is she trying to kill her? - Sun Dec 13 14:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiser Ibbaki(Dillion13) thinks: ...C'mon, Senpai. - Sun Dec 13 14:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) clapped her hands together again while her eyes focused on the airborne Kinami. She drew back her palm and put Kinami in her sights, the girl had seriously made a bad move to go airborne against a Fuuton user. Stepping forwards, she thrust her palm towards the girl; releasing a concentrated blast of powerful wind. With the girl airborne, dodging the jutsu would be near impossible. That being said, Lera was still holding back; she prefered not to kill the girl accidentally.* - Sun Dec 13 14:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Hm.. - Sun Dec 13 14:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) watched Kinami fall backwards as she was struck by the wind, bouncing back off the floor to rush at Lera. The girl was faster somehow, either she'd been holding back or she was using something Lera had yet to know about. Either way, she spun her hands into a few more handseals before spittinng out a torrent of mud directly in front of her. If it worked as intended, a large wall of mud would form within moments; essentially blocking Kinami's path. 

She wasn't sure if the girl had the strength to break through it; but she would certainly be capable of moving around it or jumping over it. To counter this, Lera formed another handseals and created three clones; one behind and one on either side of her. Each clone was pointing in each possible direction of attack whilst preparing to strike the girl should she appear.* - Sun Dec 13 14:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) looked down in surprise, seeing her wall crack and then break apart; leaving a neat hole for Kinami to get through...and face off against Lera's waiting clones. The two either side of her turned to the girl, finishing their run on handseals and slamming their hands into the ground. Currents of lightning ran through the ground towards Kinami and the wall. Whatever was left of the wall was quickly blown to pieces by the element it was weak against. Kinami however would get the shocking force of her Raiton if she didn't dodge.

Meanwhile, Lera and her third clone took several steps backwards; waiting to see if Kinami would get through it.* - Sun Dec 13 14:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sighed and dispersed her clones.

"Really? I was hoping you'd be able to hit me...well maybe next time."* - Sun Dec 13 15:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) went and took Makeinu back off her clone.* - Sun Dec 13 15:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) rocked the little girl gently, letting her sleep in her arms. This child was going to be spoiled to hell...* - Sun Dec 13 15:13:00 2015
