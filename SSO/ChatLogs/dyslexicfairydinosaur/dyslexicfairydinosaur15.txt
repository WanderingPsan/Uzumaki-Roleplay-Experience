<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) started walking off towards the village entrance.* - Sat Dec 12 14:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) slipped out of the village and started her long walk towards the Desert of Death area, Judging from the reports she'd been given, it seemed like one of the deserts creatures was venturing outside of the area itself and causing issues. It was a little odd however, usually there were guards or some shinobi squad specifically for dealing with issues like this; so why send her? She got her answer rather sooner than she expected, coming up to a camp of some rather bedraggled looking shinobi.

She was greeted with caution, but visible relaxed once she was recognised; by no means was Lera famous but they at least knew of her, being head of a clan like the Hassan's earned her some reputation at least "So whats the issue gentlemen? I hear theres a beast venturing out of the desert, some kind of giant mole?"

The leader of their little group stepped forwards nodding his head with his lips spread to a grim line "Most of the time, we'd deal with any and all threats trying to escape the desert...but this...we just can't stop it. Its fast, extremely adept at hiding its presence and no matter what we do...we just can't seem to scratch its hide. Whatever it is, its not something an ordinary genin could deal with." Lera nodded her head and stepped past the group to the edges of their camp "Well...its a damn good job I'm not an ordinary genin isn't it. Alright, you guys wait here with my clone. It'll alert me if it makes it here before I find it, Hold the line people."

With that, she started treading towards the desert itself. The gates were still a fair distance to walk, but she had a sneaking suspicion she would be enountering the creature before entering the desert itself. She wasn't exactly wrong either, she heard it before she saw it; a slight rumbling in the ground beneath her feet. Before it could try and catch her by surprise, she leapt up into the air; holding her position several feet off the ground. What surface though was...a little smaller than she expected, there were also more than the reports stated it seemed.

There were four of the mole like creatures, not with drill like noses of metal...but noses that seemed to be made of bone. She rolled her eyes and dropped from the sky onto the first one she saw, driving Samehada down onto the creatures back. Moments before striking it, she exponentially increased the weight of bother herself and Samehada. Once it made contact, a great crack resounded through the area as the creatures spine shattered to pieces. She was almost dissapointed it was so easy, she'd been at least expecting a little bit of a challenge.

Before the other three 'moles' had a chance to react, she threw Samehada at one and clapped her hands into several handseals; turning her attention to another. She released a jutsu directly into the moles face, sending a cloud of wind shards to tear through its flesh. It looked rather a lot like someone had just blasted the creature with an oversized shotgun, turning it into a mangled mess of fleshy guts. This left only two left to deal with, one was already wrestling with Samehada; who had torn off its bandages in order to clamp teeth into its hide.

The final mole however, had recovered from its hesitation and was charging towards her; its drill like nose resdy to bite into flesh. She called out to Samehada, who paused for a moment to spit a sword out towards Lera; she wasn't paticularly skilled with swords such as this, but it would suit her purpose her. Once she caught it, she flowed Wind chakra into the blade and side-stepped the moles charge. She let the creatures own strength work against it, swiping the blade across its flank and opening up a sizeable gap for various organs to spill out of.

This only left a single mole to deal with, still wrestiling with Samehada; it was easy enough to finish off however. She pulled the folded Windmill shuriken from its holster and opened it up. A little chakra flow was added and she tossed it towards the creature, the windmill let off a shrill whistle as it flew; alerting the creature, but it wasn't enough to save it from its fate. The windmill struck it head on, slicing through meat and bone like butter; leaving a neatly halved twitching corpse, steaming in hot desert sun.

It was all too easy as she wandered off to retrieve her windmill and Samehada, the reports had rated the creature as extremely dangerous and much much larger than these pitiful things. Obviously, reports were exagerated; or at least thats what she had thought anyway. Her thoughts were soon interrupted by another rumbling, a rumble she physically felt running up her legs. Her eyes widened and she flew back into the sky, obviously there were still more to deal with....and then it lunged out of the earth with a great crash.

The monstrosity before her was nothing less than that...an absolute beast. Unlike the creatures she'd just slain, this thing was huge...big enough to be classed as a medium sized summoned creature. A wide grin split her face, this was more like what she was looking for. This would actually give her a bit of a challenge, even if it couldn't kill her; it would still be a fun fight to have. The creature titled its head towards her, unleashing a loud and impressive roar into the sky.

The roar was quickly accompanied by a bullet of wind, which brought an even bigger smile to Lera's face; if it could manipulate wind natured chakra, then this could actually prove to be difficult. Dealing with the wind was no issue however, a quick slice with samehada and she cut the wind in two. The creature roared its outrage, but couldn't reach her while she was in the sky like this. It wouldn't be any fun if she just stayed hiding up here though, so after returning Samehada and Kiba to her back; she started to drop out of the sky.

While she dropped, she formed some handseals and released yet another cloud of wind shards; aiming to rip into the creatures hide. As it was, the creature had a surprisingly good level of resistance; suffering only minor cuts and grazes. That being said, her attack had defnitely pissed it off considerably. Its steel like nose began spinning and it charged towards her; aiming to completely eviscerate her to nothing. Lera wasn't about to let it get her so easily however, but she wanted to enjoy this.

There were plenty of ways she could stop it, but she took the one ladened with the most risk. She charged forwards, aiming to slip underneath the creature and brace herself against its underbelly. With a little grunt, she pushed upwards; lifting it off the ground where its squealed in both alarm and annoyance. With another shout, she tossed the creature as far as she could; using her gravitiy manipulation to its fullest. It flew a few metres before coming down in the sand with a crash.

She didn't let up even for a second, stringing her hands into another series of handseals while it attempted to recover. Soon however, she had formed a giant dragon of flame which was quickly flying towards the creature. Flames slammed against flesh, sending out a sickening stench of burned meat and a shrieks of pain. She actually felt a little bad for that, Lera was willing to do the dirty work; but that didn't mean she was willing to inflict unecessary amounts of pain like this.

That moments hesitation was all the creature needed to rear back its head and burrow into the sand. Not only did the sand put out the flames on its flesh, but it gave it the perfect chance to escape. Lera was definitely unwilling to enter the ground herself, knowing that was a battle she would outright lose; no questions about it. So instead, she pulled samehada from her back and took off into the sky; holding the blade aloft "Track it buddy! We're following it!"

The blade wiggled in her grip, pointing its head in the direction of the rumbling; which was growing fainter by the moment. She took pursuit, following Samehada's direction; the creature made its way back into the desert, obviously intent on fidining some hole to lick its wounds. She had no intention of allowing it to escape however, even though it was cruel; her mission was to kill it, a threat to the safety of the village...it couldn't be allowed to live anymore.

It soon resurfaced, obviously favouring a number of its injuries. It hadn't noticed her watching from the sky yet, she thought it might be a good idea to finish it as quickly as possible. So she quietly settled down on the sand a short distance away, it had still yet to notice her; too busy licking its burns and cuts. The plan was to simply incinerate it completely, before it really even had a chance to feel the pain that came with such a death.

Forming a handseal, she created a single katon shadow clone; that would in turn start to form its own handseals. She was going to use her favourite combination, to hopefulyl completely destroy the creature. Once her clone was prepared for the combinations; she drew in a breath and spewed out an odorless gas. The gas spread out neatly in front of her, staying far enough away from the mole to not alerts its powerful senses.

With that, preparations were more or less complete; she had to be fast though, otherwise the creature would probably escape. So, forming a single hanseal; Lera started off the processm, releasing a small tornado like stream of wind towards the creature. The creature definitely noticed this, swirling its huge body around with a cry of alarm. It was too late however, the stone had been set rolling and the creatures demise was the only end result.

Her wind technique sucked the gas into it, only further increasing its flamability. Then, the katon clone added its own technique into the mix. Transforming the tornado of gaseous wind into a gigantic twisting infernor. The mole could do nothing but let out a short shriek as the flames impacted its skin, biting deep and turning muscles into blackened ash within mere seconds of contact. It didn't last very long, she soon cut the wind off and watched the flames settle.

The scene was a horrific one, all that remained of the creature was a smoking mass of flesh and ash; at least its death had been a quick one, it would've been much slower if someone else had come to do the job. Either way, she dispersed her clone and started on her way back towards the vilalge; she stopped by the camp to inform the other shinobi of the completed mission before going back to report.* - Sat Dec 12 15:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We'll try to hold back on the big techniques...lets leave the village intact eh? - Sun Dec 13 04:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Haha, alrighty then.~ That should be easy considering I still can't make any handseals - Sun Dec 13 04:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm, I'll hold back. - Sun Dec 13 04:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You can go first. - Sun Dec 13 04:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) winked and formed a single handseal, creating a generic shadow clone. The clone then proceeded to tie Lera's left hand behind her back before dispersing.

"To make things a little more fair~"

With one hand tied down she couldn't use at least ninety percent of jutsu, so instead she reched behind her back and gripped the hilt of samehada; swinging it out with a single hand. Knowing that Izanami had the advantage in close combat just made things more interesting. Pushing her foot back, she lunged forwards; lowering her own weight at the same time for a burst of speed. She stabbed samehada forwards, intending to slam the blunt point into Iza's stomach.* - Sun Dec 13 04:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stopped her blow short, just as it was slipping past Izanami. She dropped the blade, allowing her to move her hand much much faster as she sped it towards Izanami's face for a backhand. If she successfuly touched the girl, she'd dramatically increase her weight for a mere moment. It was pointless trying to hold her down with the technique, knowing that the girl could now do the opposite. She simply intended for the sudden increase in weight to destroy her balance and possibly drop her to her knees.* - Sun Dec 13 04:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) was by no means a fast person, in fact she was rather slow by the standards of a taijutsu user. So the kick swept at her legs with surprising ease, causing her to start falling onto her side. She wasn't done there however, reaching out for the sand beneath Izanami's feet. She simultaneously sofftened the sand using the Mole technique and pushed a great weight down upon it. If it worked as intended, the softened sand would give way and cause Izanami to fall into it.* - Sun Dec 13 04:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled a little, Iza was more or less doing what she'd expected her to do. She jumped back to her feet and looked at the spot she'd sank down "Buddy? Still got a beat on her?"

Samehada wiggled a little, still in its position on the floor; it wiggled around until the tip of its bandaged blade was pointion in a certain direction, the direction Izanami had gone "Perfect!~"

Channeling chakra into her closed fist, she created what looked like a shimmering blue ball of lightning. Pulling her arm back, she tossed it in the direction Samehada was pointing; aiming to shock the girl hiding underground. The position wasn't perfect, partly because Lera wasn't a marksman; but mostly because Samehada was only giving the general direction. However, Raitons nature to conduct through the ground would hopefully make up for that.* - Sun Dec 13 05:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) motioned towards her blade on the ground which seemed to leap into her grasp.

"You okay?"* - Sun Dec 13 05:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright, go ahead and come at me~ - Sun Dec 13 05:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Maybe I'll get to use my new trick... - Sun Dec 13 05:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) completely ignored Izanami's attack, going with an entirely new tactic only made possible by Samehada. She was barely able to see Izanami's attack, but she saw enough to counter. While her skin slowly turned a darker brown, she swung samehada down at the incoming girl. It went without saying that the girls katana struck her torso; cutting through even her Domu technique with a spray of blood. Yet, assuming izanami had been knocked down by her own strike, when the girl got back up; she would see that Lera's injury was already completely healed.* - Sun Dec 13 05:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lll There was indeed chakra running through Samehada, but it was indistinguishable from Lera's own chakra.* - Sun Dec 13 05:37:00 2015
