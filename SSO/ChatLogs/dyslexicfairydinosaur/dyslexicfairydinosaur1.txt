<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Right. No more of those chakra flowt ricks, though. - Fri Nov 20 19:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its better if I show you away from the village, Its not exactly safe. - Fri Nov 20 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What's up? - Fri Nov 20 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I want you to tell me what kind of chakra's you see. - Fri Nov 20 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Maybe it would help me gain more control of it that way. - Fri Nov 20 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Easy enough. - Fri Nov 20 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) created a single clone that wandered off to a short distance away, Lera then made two tall walls with a gap between them so the pair could see the clone.

"Hide behind the wall before it blows up, kay?"* - Fri Nov 20 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) 's clone saw that the walls were complete and it was still in sight, it then held its two hands out palms facing forwards. Ironically, for Sanoke's sight; even her clone had chakra on par with a Bijuu. That chakra began focusing in the clones hands, with the Doton element in the left and the Fuuton element in the right. For a moment, the clone prepared itself for the task ahead; knowing it was likely about to destroy itself.

Then, it would begin in ernest; channeling a third elemental chakra to hover before its hands. To Sanoke's eyes, these chakra's would then slowly begin to mix together; creating something entire new and incredibly powerful. To normal sight, a tiny golden speck would manifest infront of the Clones hands; steadily growing into a small sphere.

As the sphere grew, so would the chakra supplying it; it was near blinding in its sheer power. A deep throated hum would start to resonate towards them, centering from the sphere; while it did, the concentration of her clone reached its peak. Lera herself could only hold this new element at a certain level before it lost stability; the clone being weaker than her, was even more limited by this fact.

All at once, the sphere's circumference would grow exponentially; effectively removing both of the clones hands and rising its deep hum to ear shaking levels. As soon as she saw this, Lera clapped her hands and filled the gap between the walls; summoning several more layers of it for good measure. Then the explosion happened. A Bright golden light could be seen from behind the wall, the chakra expanding rapidly and effectively erasing everything in its path.

Fortunately for Lera and Sanoke, they were both far enough away to escape damage; though the first layer of walls showed damage, parts of it simply missing. With a sigh, she lowered her walls and revealed the scene ahead; a crater had formed in place of her clone, sand was quickly filling it up. However, it seemed as if the sand from the crater was just...gone; completely destroyed on a sub-atanomical level.

"So...what did you see?"* - Fri Nov 20 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Atoms? I got that feeling as well, good it was confirmed... - Fri Nov 20 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But as you say, I can't control it. - Fri Nov 20 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) held up her bandaged hands before slowly unwinding the cloth to revealed her pink still healing palms. The skin looked brand new and very fragile.

"First attempt I made I ended up removing the skin from my palms. Thats how I knew it was...whatever you just said. Since the skin wasn't burned or cut off...it was just gone."* - Fri Nov 20 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: To be honest. I haven't use anything in a long time that even scratched the surface... - Fri Nov 20 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its partly thanks to my buddy here, practicing with him somehow increased my reserves. - Fri Nov 20 20:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I want to improve the control of this new element. - Fri Nov 20 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . . - Fri Nov 20 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You could use Kage Bunshin to help you. Since you're all connected, you can work together for a single jutsu. - Fri Nov 20 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Have one around for each of the elements. - Fri Nov 20 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Then you'll be the forth pushing it all together, and forming the jutsu. - Fri Nov 20 20:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: I'm going to go practice now Momura. Still want to see it? - Sat Nov 21 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) whispers: Y-Yea. - Sat Nov 21 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Maybe I should get Koji's opinion as well...maybe later. - Sat Nov 21 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) led Momura to an isolated area outside the village, there were severe signs of damage; that even the sand had yet to fill in. There was remnants of a large crater and various rubble from constructed walls.

"Alright. In order for me to show you this, you must listen to everything I say okay? This...by any means, is not safe."* - Sat Nov 21 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Sat Nov 21 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Good. - Sat Nov 21 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) makes a big rock for her to lean over.* - Sat Nov 21 19:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Luffy??? - Sat Nov 21 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I think you need a bit of wolf dick. - Sat Nov 21 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Call it what you want, just accept it! - Sat Nov 21 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) summons a wolf.* - Sat Nov 21 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed a single handseal and created a clone, the clone would wander a short distance away towards the centre of the crater. At the same time, Lera would construct several layers of walls; with a gap in between the two so Momura and herself could see everything the clone did. With everything set, she nodded towards the clone and watched what it did with a ever so slight look of worry on herself. She'd already shown this to Sanoke, who could protect himself. Momura however, likely couldn't if it all went wrong.

The clone would hold its arms outwards, facing its palms to open air. It would start concentrating humungous amounts of chakra into those palms, getting the amount right before it added the elemental composition. With a deep breath, it began in ernest; changing its left hand to Doton, its right to Fuuton and focusing a point of Katon chakra directly infront of its palms. Focusing on three elements was especially difficult, it was only due to expert control that she could do it at all.

As the three chakras started to mix together, a tiny golden speck would appear in place of the katon chakra. Steadily growing until it was the size of a glowing golden golf ball of energy. Once it reached this point, a deep hum would suffuse through the air; betraying the little ball for something immensely powerful. It was only at this point her clones could keep control, being weaker than the original. After removing the skin from her palms though, Lera was reluctant to practice it without knowing she could definitely do it.

Breaking her from her thoughts, the clone let out a quiet grunt telling Lera that it could no longer keep control. Forming a final handseal, Lera closed up the gap in the walls; adding a few more layers before she grabbed Momura and rushed a little further backwards "Brace yourself!". The clone hidden behind the wolf would suddenly lose control of the sphere; having it expand rapidly with greater power than Lera had yet to achieve so far.

Momura and Lera were lucky to have moved backwards, the energy covered her walls; completely removing them from existence. A few more feet on the technique and the pair would have likely been killed. After a few more moments, the energy receded and the pair were able to view the devastation. Not only was the crater now twice the size it was previously. But everything touched by the explosion was completely gone, as if it had never existed.

"Oh damn...sorry Momura, that was more powerful that last time."* - Sat Nov 21 19:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I call it Dust Release...mainly because of the way it reduces everything to Dust. - Sat Nov 21 19:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its not very safe. This is how I injured my hands. - Sat Nov 21 19:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: However, That pretty thing will kill me if I can't contain it. Not much use in battle if just using it would kill me right? - Sat Nov 21 19:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Because Doton is...good at increasing the strength of your blows. - Sat Nov 21 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh. - Sat Nov 21 20:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hm? - Sat Nov 21 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) jumped ontop of a rock and brought her fist down upon it. At the last moment, she increased the weight of her fist several times. The rock shattered almost as if it had been exploded from the inside, crushed under her weight. She hopped away as it crumbled, landing gracefully next to Momura.

"That was a Doton technique."* - Sat Nov 21 20:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Unless you'd like to go first, Chikyu? - Sat Nov 21 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) orders her usual black coffee and about three different meals for herself.

"Get whatever you want~"* - Sat Nov 21 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sipper her coffee as it was all delivered. As for the food, she would normally eat at extreme speeds; but prefered not to in polite company. So she acted the civilised lady for the moment.

"Nothing much, I just figured we should catch up. Haven't spoken in a while right. Actually, I also want to show you something...I'm curious to know what your eyes will pick up."* - Sat Nov 21 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lll As soon as Koji views Lera's chakra, he would note a humungous amount was running through her body; likely higher than anything he'd ever seen, higher even than a Bijuu on rampage.* - Sat Nov 21 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lllAlso notes the symbiotic relationship between herself and Samehada.* - Sat Nov 21 20:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyway. - Sat Nov 21 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Tell me what you see. - Sat Nov 21 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) held her hands above the table whispering a few words under her breath.

"Doton in the left...Fuuton in the right...Katon in the middle..."

As she focused on those three Chakra's, Koji would be able to see the three natures mixing together; creating a tiny golden speck in between her palms. She dared go no further for fear of killing everyone in the building by accident.

"I can make it bigger...but I dare not do it here."* - Sat Nov 21 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Oh...the sword? - Sat Nov 21 20:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And the fact that he's alive. - Sat Nov 21 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Haha, I won't pry too much then. Hmm, can Samehada talk? - Sat Nov 21 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lll The blade seemed to wiggle in her hand, making a series of grunts and squeeks.* - Sat Nov 21 20:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled and nodded, almost to herself more than to Koji.

"I need to figure out how to contain it for a more stable form. While I can make a pretty big explosion now....its not good for me if I kill myself right?"* - Sat Nov 21 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, you should try distributing it through two points, or rotating your chakra in a flow. hat control wil keep you from killing yourself...Should. - Sat Nov 21 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hm...I've thought about using it for an elemental chakra flow technique - Sat Nov 21 21:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh? You mean use Samehada for it - Sat Nov 21 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its true that he's durable - Sat Nov 21 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But he feels pain like we do - Sat Nov 21 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Of course, I don't know how durable he is but logically if your attack is held by both of you... - Sat Nov 21 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: That should minimize the damage. - Sat Nov 21 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: And strain.. However it wouldn't be a single devastating blow. Hmm. - Sat Nov 21 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I know. However. The flow technique would constantly damage him, it would not destroy him yes - Sat Nov 21 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But...imagine your body being pulled apart at an atomic level - Sat Nov 21 21:11:02 2015
