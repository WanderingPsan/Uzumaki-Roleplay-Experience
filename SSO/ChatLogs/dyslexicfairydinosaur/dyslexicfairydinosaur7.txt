<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And Fuuinjutsu as well...well For that. I suggest finding a red-head called Shin. - Tue Dec  1 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Or AI. - Tue Dec  1 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Technically I know Summoning which is Fuuinjutsu...but thats pretty limited. - Tue Dec  1 20:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: Could you show me that? the summoning jutst!  - Tue Dec  1 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: say Jutsu** - Tue Dec  1 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Good. You know the basics the- You want to see summoning? - Tue Dec  1 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: I could summon someone to be my friend! - Tue Dec  1 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I mean sure...but it only really works if you have an animal contract. - Tue Dec  1 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaiko(Lostlolidragon) says: I'll find one! - Tue Dec  1 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) bit into the skin of her thumb and rubbed blood on her palm, a few handseals later and she slammed a palm to the ground; summoning a small wolf at her side. The wolf blinked a few times and looked around at all the sand "Master? Why'd ya summon me here? I hate sand..."* - Tue Dec  1 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: There...the summoning technique. This is Jenna, say hi Jenna. - Tue Dec  1 20:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hm...One moment. - Tue Dec  1 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed a quick seal and created a clone, the clone would be able to explain all the finer details to Kaiko.

"There, now I can teach you both at the same time."* - Tue Dec  1 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm - Tue Dec  1 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) ll Jenna slowly leaned forward, taking a sniff at Kaiko's hand before giving it a quick lick "Thanks~ Nice to meet you miss."

The clone would stay by The wolfs side while the original Lera pulled Izanami off to one side.* - Tue Dec  1 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Meditate on your doton for me Iza. - Tue Dec  1 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: More meditation? - Tue Dec  1 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Just for a moment. - Tue Dec  1 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I want to see it. - Tue Dec  1 20:37:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Okay. - Tue Dec  1 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: (Do you wanna go with having already learned Mud Silhouette? I don't really care either way) - Tue Dec  1 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: (yeah, i didnt mean to learn it tbh, but i learned it in one click .-.) - Tue Dec  1 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: (but yeah i learned it XD) - Tue Dec  1 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: (yeah I know Dun worry. I have the same issue XD) - Tue Dec  1 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took her hand and pressed it against Izanami's forehead, Lera was no sensor; but she knew what Doton felt like. After a few moments, she stepped back and nodded.

"Alright. You're ready to learn."* - Tue Dec  1 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) lll Clone Lera watched her wolf interact with Kaiko for a few more moments before clapping her hands.

"Alright, Jenna can't stay long; strict parents and all that." the wolf just rolled her eyes and vanished in a puff of smoke "So you want to learn how to summon first right? I'm not sure exactly how to teach you to be honest."* - Tue Dec  1 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *grins* - Tue Dec  1 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'm ready. - Tue Dec  1 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. Which one first....besides the one you've already learned. - Tue Dec  1 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What do you suggest? - Tue Dec  1 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hiding like a mole - Tue Dec  1 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its both one of the most useful and easiest. - Tue Dec  1 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *nods* Okay, I'll start with that one. - Tue Dec  1 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right. - Tue Dec  1 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stepped back away from Iza and abruptly sank into the sand; no handseals were performed for the jutsu, making it perfect for Iza in her current state. After a few moments of 'swimming' underground, she popped back up next to Iza and began the explenation.

"Alright. Use your Doton to soften the earth...or in this case sand beneath your feet. Its imperative that you keep the chakra steady around your entire body, if you panic and lose it you may just bury yourself alive. Any questions?"

Clone Lera would nod at Kaiko and run her through the basics of Summoning as well.

"The idea being summoning is to use your blood as a sort of sacrifice to summon a creature across space. Mine as you can see, is a wolf. First, create a tiny insision in your thumb; though anything will do. Then rub the blood on your palm...perform the Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey and Ram handseals respectively...and well, the rest you'll have to figure out."* - Tue Dec  1 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Speaking of Training...I need to get on with mine... - Tue Dec  1 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) grinned down at Iza, she really was as fast a learner as eveyrone said.

"Yeah. Normally you keep your mouth shut, but well...I'm sure you'll get the hang of it."* - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hmm....headhunter next I think. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Headhunter? - Tue Dec  1 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: E-Everyone's getting trained.. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: P-Paine-senpai s-still hasn't taught me..h-hmph. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) made yet another clone and sank back into the ground with a little wink at Iza. A few moments later, her hands would appear directly below her clone and grip it by the ankles, before dragging it down till only its head was left above the sand. Lera soon popped up next to it.

"Its simple really. You just use the Mole technique to drag your opponent into the ground. Great for trapping people without hurting them."

The clone would then drag itself up and out of the sand, making itself a target for Iza.* - Tue Dec  1 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-That's a jutsu? - Tue Dec  1 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) Your primary element is: Fire
Your secondary element is: Earth
Your tertiary element is: Water
Your quadranary element is: Lightning
Your quinary element is: Wind* - Tue Dec  1 21:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) ll Clone Lera would nod at Kaiko "Keep practicing. You'll get it eventually...in the mean time. Genjutsu?"

Real Lera would absent mindedly pat Izanami on the head after she completed the technique "Alrighty...The last two I can teach you for now...this is where things get complicated."* - Tue Dec  1 21:13:36 2015
