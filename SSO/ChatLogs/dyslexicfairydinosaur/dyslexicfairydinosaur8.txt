<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) put her chin on Kiyoko's shoulder, giving a wink at Mitsu.

"I know you wouldn't. Maybe we can arrange a day where we can all meet up in private~" she said it as if she were joking, but there was a hint of seriousness in there too?* - Wed Dec  2 20:33:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) grinned again, but finally released Kiyoko so she could step to the side.

"Interesting~ Seems theres a lot of girls like us around. Though, I'm afraid I'll have to leave it there. Theres some training I need to do for today."* - Wed Dec  2 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nng... y-yeah.. of course. - Wed Dec  2 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) tipped her head in Mitsu's direction and gave Kiyoko a quick kiss before she started to wander off.* - Wed Dec  2 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And besides- I'm sure you've things to do as well! Mrm. - Wed Dec  2 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll be just outside the village if you need to find me hun. - Wed Dec  2 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) stepped outside the village, going far enough so that she wouldn't be disturbed; but close enough so that she could still be seen from the entrance if someone needed her. Once she had judged the distance to be far enough, she formed her hands into a seal and summoned a single Katon clone. The clone was not exactly necessary for the training, but it would help her test combinations during the practice. She was determined to not exhaust herself so much to the point that she nearly fainted again.

Taking a deep breath, she started the practice; beginning things slowly. Her clone formed the handseals for a Fireball technique, while Lera fomed the seals for Great Breakthough. They both released their jutsu in the same moment; clashing the two together to create a humungous ball of flame several times its natural size. Before the flames had even died away, Lera was already breathing in to spit out mud as another jutsu. However, it seemed to hitch in her throat; causing her to cough and splutter.

Even while wiping her mouth, she was muttering words through her gritted teeth "More...faster....stronger...more." she breathed in again, reigning in the dregs of her failed jutsu so she could spit out a torrent of mud on the searing hot sands. The sands sizzled and popped while her clone started forming the seals for another jutsu; preparing to spit out a searing stream of flames. Lera didn't pause for a moment after releasing the mud, she slipped her hands into more seals and directed her chakra at the mud.

It still took longer than she wanted it too, longer than she needed it to; but after a few moments the head of a dragon rose from the mud, a bright glowing light emnating from its mouth before it released a blitz of hardened mud bullets. At that very moment, the clone released its stream of flame; impacting with the bullets and turning them into searing bullets of rock. The rocks impacted in the sad, sending flames shooting upwards into the sky.

Lera capatilised on these flames, forming a single handseal and drawing in a breath. Once again, it took too long for the chakra to form; but she was able to release a steady stream of wind that spun in a vortex. It ignited on touch with the flames; becoming a spinning inferno. Herself and the clone were already preparing to form the seals for more jutsu when the clone simply vanished; leaving Lera to fall onto her knees. It was her body telling her too slow down again, even in battle she did not try to utilise jutsu so quickly; knowing that it strained her body too much. So, rather than scare Kiyoko by looking like death; she headed back into the village.* - Wed Dec  2 21:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) pulled the jacket over her head and strapped Samehada to her back, with kiyoko soundly asleep; now was a good time to go off and train by herself for a bit. She knew that Kiyoko probably wouldn't approve at her current line of training, but it was necessary to progress to an even greater stage of elementalism.

As per usual, she was working on speeding her cast time up to dispraportionate levels; if she completed this training as intended, nobody would be able to escape her ninjutsu no matter how fast they were. Sanoke was the ideal test subject and trainer for this, she knew he had the speed to avoid her jutsu and he could possibly even take her full power without any damage. Thats if he wasn't busy anyway.

With a sigh, she headed back out of the village and to her usual spot; leaving a little note with Kiyoko to tell her where she was, no need to worry the woman unnecessarily. While she walked, she thought about the previous days events with a little smile on her face; she'd only been joking when inviting Mistunara into the bedroom with herself and Kiyoko. Yet the girl had seemed up to the idea, even Kiyoko hadn't denied it.

She had a sly grin on her face when she arrived at her usual spot, the thought of what might happen between the three of them had her feeling a little giddy inside. However, those thoughts would only distract from her training; so she pushed them aside for now, she'd speak to Kiyoko about it later. Nodding quietly to herself, she started to get to work; starting slow like before and gradually speeding up.

First, her hands wove together into the seals for a Mud wall; she slammed her hands into the floor and summoned the wall at the largest size she could accomplish; which with her current power over Ninjutsu, was quite impressive. She immediately began weaving her hands into more seals, before the wall had even fully constructed itself. Just as she finished the seals, the wall crumbled in on itself.

She still had trouble transitioning from jutsu to jutsu, it was true that she could likely beat most opponents with one single high powered jutsu; but most opponents wasn't enough. There was another reason she wanted to use Sanoke for help in this training, she figured if her jutsu could get him; then they could get anyone alive.

Tipping her head back, she released her breath in one violent exhale; sending forth a hail of wind shards. What was left of her wall was abruptly torn to shreds by the powerful wind, leaving behind nothing but bits of rock and dirt. Following on from that, she formed yet more seals and took in another breath; only when she released, all she accomplished was a thick cloud of acrid smoke.

She was still too slow, still so incapable of transitioning to new jutsu; that pretty much settled it, she definitely needed help with this one. She would have to ask Sanoke first chance she got, though she was still a better elementalist then probably anyone in Sunagakure; Sanoke had helped in the past, maybe he could again.

She was about to turn and leave when she beheld a large heavyset man watching; he was clothes completely in tight fitting black cloth, a man employed for moving through the shadows. Lera however, recognised him; if only for the way he moved if not for his face that was conveniently covered. Her eyes widened and her eyebrows shot up, she hadn't expected to see him again not after last time.

"Cain?? What are you...I didn't think I would see you again." Cain responded with a laugh, moving forwards with a confident swagger while he pulled off the mask "I knew you would be able to recognise me, nothing gets past you. You've gotten more beautiful since I last saw you though." So he was still pining for her, Lera had felt bad about rejecting him before; she expected he'd given up, clearly not.

Cain shook his head, seeing the look of guilt on Lera's face; though he still hoped, he knew he more or less didn't have a chance "Don't worry Lera, I'm not expecting anything off you. I just wanted to see you again, nothing more than that." Lera let loose a sigh, looking sideways to the ground. The last time she'd seen him, she'd said that she would never love again; but now she was engaged...she didn't want to hurt him, but she wasn't going to lie.

"Cain...Its not that..its...ugh. I sort've...got engaged. I'm getting married in a few months.." Lera winced a little at the brief look of hurt flashing across his face, but it was quickly replaced with his usual lopsided grin "Okay, I just want you to be happy Lera; thats all, don't worry about me. So who's the lucky guy?" and he thought it was a man too, that made things awkward.

"Her name is Kiyoko...I can't explain to you in words how I feel about her. I gave up on Love Cain, I gave up on being happy...then she just stepped into my life and tore down all my barriers with a breath. I love her without exception, she is my soul, my heart, Mo Banrii. I will do anything for her." Cain watched her speak with a dull throbbing in her ears, what he wouldn't have given for her to talk about him that way.

He would have to change the subject, at this rate he would not be able to compose himself any longer "A girl huh, well congratulations either way; I'm happy you've finally found her." and he meant it, seeing her happy warmed him on the inside; but he couldn't help but wish it was him standing with her "Anyway, I've got a job nearby. Another bandit camp, feel like joining me for it?"

Lera noted the sudden quick change in subject, she could see it in his face; the way he struggled to hold his composure, she welcomed the change of subject "More bandits huh? Sure, i'll give you a hand. Whats the deal with this one?" Cain almost sighed with relief at her acceptance of the new subject, he immediately got on with the explenation "There are two portions to the camp, the main portion where the bandits live and the portion where they keep the slaves..."

Her eyes widened at that and she spat into the sand with disgust "Slaves??? They have slaves?? Tell me what I need to do and I'll wipe them out." Cain nodded, his mouth forming into a grim line; the only reason he'd taken this job was because of the slaves, the number of bandits was a little much even for him...but with Lera on his side "We go in, clear out the bandits and rescue the slaves."

She nodded towards him and then gestured for him to lead the way, which he did happily. She followed along, keeping up with his pace easily; despite the huge sword on her back. The camp was in a large dip in the desert, surrounded by high Dunes. The bandits were idiots, if not for the slaves she could just let off a big jutsu and murder them all in one fell swoop.

Looking closely, she could see the odd few slaves milling about through the camp; easily distuingished by their ragged clothing and chained ankles. Most of them were going about generic tasks, but there was one in particular that caught her eye. Before one of the largest tents, a big man was was watching the slaves moving about. Without warning, he lashed out and grabbed the nearest slave, a woman, and force her to stand infront of him.

Lera narrowed her eyes watching the spectacle, even as Cain put a hand on her shoulder her body tensing as if ready to spring at the bandits "Lera, calm down. If we rush in now they may just take the slaves as hostages, better to wait till nightfall when all the slaves are in their own quarters." she tensed her fist at this, hardly able to stop herself from disobeying that little bit of advice "I've seen that look before, that woman is not going to her own quarters tonight"

As if to confirm her suspicisons, the large man lashed out again; tearing the womans ragged robe from her body and leaving her naked in front of him. From the view she had, she could see the woman trembling and the shine of silver falling down her face. Lera let loose a hiss through her teeth "I'm killing him. Now. Stay here, I'll get the slaves out. I don't want you getting caught in the blast."

Ever so slowly, she sank into the ground and began moving underground towards her target. It didn't take her long to reach the man, gripping him by the ankles and dragging him into the ground. Before he even got a chance to shout, she slit his throat and left him to choke on his own blood. Popping out of the ground, she ignored the surprised squeak from the naked slave; instead gripping her arm and pulling the woman behind her.

As soon as she was safe, Lera formed a handseal; watching as 34 little red sparks manifested in the air, soon forming into perfect Katon clones of herself. Theirs was a dual job, to hold back the bandits and remove the slaves from the camp. The clones quickly went to work, cutting their way bandits as they came running. As her clones did their job, Lera removed her jacket and put it on the slaves emancipated form. On closer look the 'woman' barely appeared to be fifteen, a fact that brought a snarl of anger from Lera's throat.

The girl watched Lera with a mixture of awe and fear, though she remained quiet; even as she was picked up and flown back to Cain's position. Once there, she turned to Cain and spoke again "How many slaves are there, do you know?" Cain nodded at her, as well as the rescued slaves that were quickly filling their position; he had to admit, Lera worked fast "We've been watching the camp for a while, by our count there are twenty three."

Lera quickly turned and did a fast count of the slaves; there were twenty two here, meaning they were missing one "Shit...wheres the last one." she was about to head back into the camp when the girl she'd saved tapped her on the elbow "U-uhm...this is all of us...My..m-my momma was taken a few night ago. She didn't come back" Lera swore under her breath, now she would commited to helping this girl find her mother too. She wouldn't be able to help herself.

Either way, this meant she could be done with the bandits. With a quick handseal, she made a single shadow clone which ran down into the camp. It quickly found a Katon Clone and combined its effort with the clone to create Pandora's light. Lera just watched from afar, with Cain and the slaves her lips a thin line. The explosion was huge, a gigantic golden sphere of light that enveloped everything within the camp.

Yet in a matter of seconds, the light was gone and nothing was left behind. Cain watched the spectacle with an open mouth and widened eyes, not noticing Lera's eyes on him. She could've sworn she saw a brief flash of fear on his face. She wasn't wrong either, Cain had never seen anything like this; this was a power no human should have. There was simply...nothing left, she'd completely removed every trace of the bandits and their camp. He knew now why she'd been so confident.

"L-Lera...that was...insane, how can you produce power like that??" she ignored the gasps of awe, the squeaks of fear from the slaves watching her handi-work "Its a new element, I created it recently. Its called Pandora's Light. Its...extremely effective, as you can see." and he did see, he saw that she was becoming something he didn't quite understand anymore. The shinobi world was no place for him after all "I knew you were talented, but to create a completely new element? You're really something. Anyway, we should get these slaves back"

She tilted her head in a nod "You're right, I'll let you handle that. This one though, will come with me; time to find her mother." the girl was staring at her with wide eyes, partially out of fear for power she didn't understand; but also out of surprise, she didn't know a shinobi would go so far for her. Cain replied with a nod backing away towards the other slaves "I'll meet you back at Sunagakure sometime Lera see you later."

Once he was gone, a line of slaves trailing after him; she took the girl by the hand and gave her a reasuring nod "No need to be scared of me, I won't harm you. Do you have any idea what they were going to do with her? And whats your name?" the girl took a big gulp of air and nodded her head again "M-My name is Kara...and uhm...my momma. She said they were selling her...It was uhm, to a mansion I think. I overheard them talking in the t-tent. They said it was to the Priscilies..."

Lera smiled in relief, she had a name; that made things much much easier. Even better, it was a name she knew as well. The Priscilies held an estate just a few hours walk from Sunagakure, it was likely there that Kara's mother was being kept "Alright Kara. I'm Lera and you're in luck. I know where that mansion is, lets go get your momma okay?" Kara nodded again and allowed Lera to lead her away, the poor girl was hungry and dehydrated too; so Lera let her get her fill of food and water as they walked.

It didn't take long to arrive at the estate. Lera hid herself out of sight and began disgusing her appearence. Better that they don't realise they've been attacked by a Sungakure shinobi. With a little wink to Kara, she created a single clone and handed Samehada to it; the blade was too noticeable to take in with her "Okay Kara, my clone will protect you while I'm gone. I'll be back soon okay?" Kara gave another little nod and watched as Lera trailed towards the mansion.

As she got close to the gate, Lera heard a shout of warning; followed by a small group of guards rushing out of the gateway to face off against her. She counted six, they looked skilled enough; but likely no more so than your average civilian solider. The lead guard stared her down, taking in her hidden appearence "Who are you and what do you want? You look the unsavoury sort, so be warned; their are archers trained on you right now. Make any indication of attack and we will end you."

Lera smiled a bit at that, at least he was professional about it and this was easily one of the better gathering of guards she'd seen, they actually had a plan to take her down. It might have worked too if she didn't have a way to make their blows ineffective. She decided not to kill anyone though, these guys were probably just taking orders; no need to kill unnecessarily "Well, the blunt truth then. This estate is accused of keeping slaves, release them or face the consequences."

The guard frowned at her, he hadn't heard anything about any slaves here before "Slaves? We don't keep slaves, don't be preposterous" with a raised eyebrow, Lera realised he was telling the truth; either he was ignorant or the woman wasn't here "A woman should have been brought here...about thirty five years old. In the last few days." the guard nodded knowingly, he knew that one "Her? She was brought in for trying to steal from the estate, she was lucky the master let her work it off as a maid."

That settled it then, Lera's target was definitely here; under the guise of a thief it seemed, the 'master' was quite clever it seemed "I wiped out a group of bandits just a few hours ago, they were selling slaves. The woman you have here is not a thief, but a slave bought from those bandits." the guard looked flabbergasted, but he quickly composed himself "No way, for one. Wiping out a group like that alone? impossible. Two, the master would never do such a thing." Lera tilted her head again and stepped forwards, her arms raised to show she meant no harm "Prove it then."

The guard nodded as if this made the most sense to him and walked fowards, intending to grip her by the arm. As a precaution, she activated Domu; to make sure nothing could harm her. She was gratified that they didn't try to remove her mask, they probably realised she would refuse anyway. After a few minutes of walking, she arrived in what appeared to be a large office; with a middle aged man sat at the far wall desk. There was a woman stood behind him as if waiting for orders, by the dead look in her eyes; Lera figured this was the slave.

The man looked up, frowning at Lera and the guards "What do you want? can't you see I'm busy, who is this riff-raff. Throw her out." the guard had been just about to answer when Lera stepped out of his grip with ease, he didn't react to her movement; shocked by her physical strength "As the master of this house, you have been occused of keeping a slave; release her now or face the consequences." the slave behind the desk looked up sharply at Lera, a flicker of hope igniting in her eyes.

The 'master' stared at her with a look of dumbfound stupidity, he'd thought to get away with it flawlessly "Guards! kill this bitch and throw her to the dogs!" Lera let loose a small sigh through her lips, stepping forward even as the guards hesitated to react. However, after a few seconds there was a sword stabbing towards her back. As soon as it struck, the blade stopped; not even scratching her hardened stone skin "Really now, Quite pathetic really. You don't stand a chance you know. I've wiped out entire armies with ease." it was a little white lie, but by the fear on his face she knew he believed it.

The head guard stepped up at the moment, halting his guards with a hand "No. Don't attack her. I don't want you guys killed needlessly. Sorry ma'am, we truly had no idea. Take that slave and leave peacefully if you will, we will deal with the Master." Lera nodded, smiling behind her mask; she did love a peaceful solution. So she walked up to the woman and gripped her by the waist before jumping out of a nearby window. The woman let out a shriek of surprise until she realised that Lera was flying.

She flew with the woman until she got back to Kara, as soon as they saw each other there was a rush to embrace; the woman holding her now crying child closely. Lera watched them for a few moments before they stood and face her "Thank you! I don't know how we can ever repay you for this." Lera removed her mask and shook her head at the pair, a light grin on her face "No payment is necessary, just seeing you both safe is enough. Here, take this." She tossed them a small bag of money, probably more than either of them had ever seen "Theres a village about half an hours walk south, Good luck you two."

The woman stared at the money bag in her hand, wondering just how rich Lera must be to be capable of handing so much money over so easily "Th-Thankyou! Come to our house some time, we live in the village north of Sunagakure." Lera nodded her agreement, it would be nice to make friends with the people "Sure, I'll see you two some other time then." then with a slight wave, she took off once more and started making her way back to Home and kiyoko.* - Thu Dec  3 12:05:45 2015
