<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I wouldn't have a wedding because just like a funeral...that's all you have to remember lost ones by... - Sun Nov 22 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lera. - Sun Nov 22 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Could we go train? - Sun Nov 22 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sits up, stretching with a yawn.

"Sure~"* - Sun Nov 22 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm... - Sun Nov 22 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So.... - Sun Nov 22 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What now? - Sun Nov 22 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hmmmmmm. - Sun Nov 22 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You wanted to learn Chakra flow right? - Sun Nov 22 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes yes.~ - Sun Nov 22 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Is that the next thing I should learn? - Sun Nov 22 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) pulled out her Tanto, which she still carried from the good old days and handed it to Kiyoko.* - Sun Nov 22 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Theres loooooads you could learn. - Sun Nov 22 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But Chakra flow suits the style you want to learn best right? - Sun Nov 22 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Can I actually use it this early? - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I don't see why not. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You're good at this. - Sun Nov 22 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But if you want to learn a different one, I don't mind. - Sun Nov 22 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I already taught you Divine Wind. - Sun Nov 22 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe best... I don't want to look foolish. - Sun Nov 22 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So i'll teach you the stronger one. - Sun Nov 22 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Theres actually three versions of this...each stronger than the last. At least, thats how I see it anyway - Sun Nov 22 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) put her hands together in a clap, channeling chakra to her palm before thrusting it forwards. It released a blast of wind, a little more powerful than Divine wind but not powerful enough to cause serious damage.

"This one is Gale Palm. Its stronger than Divine wind, but not as strong as Great Breakthrough. Its perfect for the next step up. In this one, the palm sort of acts as a booster; you 'push' the wind forwards and release it at the peak of your thrust. Let me show you~"

At this, Lera would attempt to go up behind Kiyoko and grip her gently by the wrist; pulling her arm back and then slowly pushing it forwards in a thrust. She said the words "And release" when her arm hit the peek of its thrust.* - Sun Nov 22 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Got to try and be more hands on with her training... - Sun Nov 22 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Giggity -omit- - Sun Nov 22 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Hmmmm....Maybe I should teach her shuriken manipulation as well... - Sun Nov 22 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I bet she could use wires with the Kukiri when she gets them... - Sun Nov 22 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Not bad at all. See? I told you, you're a natural at this. - Sun Nov 22 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) put her arms around Kiyoko's waste, pushing herself up against her back and whispering in the womans ear.

"Do you want to learn another one...?"* - Sun Nov 22 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhmmm...Maybe some non-elementals? - Sun Nov 22 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Non elementals? Like what? - Sun Nov 22 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Let me thing. Shunshin, Wire Bind, manipulated Shuriken, some taijutsu, some genjutsu...Suimen... - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thats...about it? - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Oh - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And the Shadow Shuriken tech - Sun Nov 22 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Not the teleport thing...nah-uh. - Sun Nov 22 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hehe, yeah it makes me feel sick too. Its good as a quick escape method though. - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmph. - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You pick. - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh... - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hm. - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I assume you already know Suimen right? - Sun Nov 22 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nope. - Sun Nov 22 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You don't? - Sun Nov 22 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm a sad shinobi. - Sun Nov 22 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Not really, its odd how it doesn't seem to get taught in the academy these days. - Sun Nov 22 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: With your chakra control though, it'll be a cakewalk. - Sun Nov 22 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Need to make some water for her to walk on... - Sun Nov 22 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Let me just make a little pool, for you to practice walking on. - Sun Nov 22 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I had a special kind of academy experience... - Sun Nov 22 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) went towards one of the biggest rocks she could find and picked it up whilst lightening its weight. She found a good position and placed it back on the ground, before exponentially increasing its weight; causing it to make a deep impression on the sand. Once it was deep enough, she tossed the rock away and quickly lined the edge of the 'hole' with more rock; using her Earthen corridor technique to do so.

With the hole ready, she just let out a constant stream of water into it; filling it up until they had a small pond.* - Sun Nov 22 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Special kind...? - Sun Nov 22 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Well, don't you worry love. Whatever you want to learn, I'll do my very best to teach you. - Sun Nov 22 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Like...I don't know how to use Kukiri, but I should be able to show you the basic form right? - Sun Nov 22 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. If you trust me, I'll do everything I can. - Sun Nov 22 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyway, i'll show you how to do Suimen. - Sun Nov 22 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took a few steps towards the pond, stepping onto the water and then walking to stand in the middle.

"Suimen is super easy, its basic chakra control." she lifted her leg to show the sole of her foot, where a very light blue haze could be seen "The idea is to coat your feet in chakra, it acts as a sort of....whats the best way to explain it. It sort of sticks you to the water. However, be careful! Too much chakra and you'll push the water away from your foot, too little and you'll just fall in. Its harder to walk on water as you have to modulate your chakra to match how the water moves, but I know you can do it."* - Sun Nov 22 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled wide at how easily Kiyoko got it, but then...she knew she would. Part of her sort of wished Kiyoko had the Earth element as well though, the things she would teach her...

Holding her hand out, she intended to draw Kiyoko in for a quick kiss before releasing her again.

"In just a few months you might even be better than me~"* - Sun Nov 22 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) winked at her before drawing her off the water.

"Did you want to learn another one? I think Manipulated shuriken would be good for you."* - Sun Nov 22 15:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright....you're gonna need some shuriken and some wires.... - Sun Nov 22 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh... I don't have those things. - Sun Nov 22 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took out a spindle of strong wire aswell as a holster of shuriken to give to Kiyoko. She then turned away, making a big show of tieing wire around her index finger and through the centre of a shuriken.

"Keep an eye on my finger okay?"

She leaned back her arm and tossed the shuriken forwards, letting it fly straight towards a rock. The shuriken stayed straight until it was about the hit the rock. It was then that Kiyoko would be able to see her finger twitching, sending vibrations and movements down the wire. The Shuriken changed its course into a curve, making several circles around the rock and wrapping it in wire.

"The key here is the wire. You have to be able to alter the shurikens direction with the most minimal of movements. Though, of course I don't expect you to be able to do it perfectly right away.* - Sun Nov 22 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) looked on with raised eyebrows, shaking her head a little bit with bewilderment.

"That took me hours to learn....You really are good at this you know?"* - Sun Nov 22 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I am? - Sun Nov 22 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean... Yeah, of course I am. - Sun Nov 22 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah...that was fast. Really fast. - Sun Nov 22 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Next i'm gonna find out that you actually have all five elements and never realised. - Sun Nov 22 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no, I really don't. - Sun Nov 22 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh huh... - Sun Nov 22 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sounded disbelieving, but she had a smile on her face that gave her away.* - Sun Nov 22 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I can show you more if you want me too. - Sun Nov 22 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not really tired. - Sun Nov 22 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Okay. Then, i'll show you how to break a genjutsu. - Sun Nov 22 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) clasped her hands together in a few handseals, directing her chakra towards Kiyoko and making eye contact. If successful, a great number of clones would rise up around her; none made any attempts to attack, instead they just circled.

"This is the Mist servant technique. A genjutsu that creates these clones as you can see. The thing about this technique, is that the more you strike them; the more they multiply. Great for tiring your opponents down. Now, let me show you how to break it."

Stepping forwards towards Kiyoko, Lera formed a single handseal; making sure Kiyoko could see exactly what it was. She then placed her fingers on Kiyoko's forhead and momentarily halted the womans chakra flow, before suddenly surging it. Kiyoko would notice he sudden break of Lera's genjutsu as well as the feeling of chakra surging through her body.

"Another one that having great chakra control is useful for. Did you feel what I did to your chakra? The general idea, is that you will halt the flow of your chakra and then suddenly surge it; breaking any disruptions to your chakra and nervous system. Though, this won't always work; some genjutsu is just too powerful to be broken this way. Anyway, give it a go~"

She quickly formed her handseals again, placing Kiyoko under the Mist servant technique once again.* - Sun Nov 22 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) enveloped her in another big hug.

"Excellent~ At this rate, I could teach you everything I know in one day."* - Sun Nov 22 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright~ Home? Or back to the square. - Sun Nov 22 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Up to you. - Sun Nov 22 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) rolled her eyes, but picked her up anyway.

"You always say that~"* - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Because I am nice.~ - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And considerate.~ - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And I love you.~ - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I already knew that! - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) put Samehada to the side and slumped into the sofa with a happy sigh, Kiyoko was of course strategically placed on her lap.* - Sun Nov 22 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its good to relax...~ - Sun Nov 22 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And Actually...I have a question! - Sun Nov 22 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) nodded her head, making herself more comfortable aswell; it was hard not to be when they were like this.

"You know that thing I was working on? The new element? I finished it and I want you to name it~" She was obviously taking inspiration from Hassan's story here.* - Sun Nov 22 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thats why I'll show you first~ - Sun Nov 22 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay okay.  - Sun Nov 22 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I can show you it here, at like....a really really tiny amount. - Sun Nov 22 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Just so you know what it looks like. - Sun Nov 22 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 22 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) held her hands outwards, as far from kiyoko as she possibly could. Focusing her chakra's, she began combining the three elements; to create the new element in front of her two palms. As the chakra's came together, a tiny golden speck appeared letting off a quiet but deep hum. She allowed it to grow to the size of a thumb nail before leaving it there. There was a little bit of strain in her voice, but she was able to speak.

"Thats what it looks like...it can obviously be much bigger, but I don't want to risk it."* - Sun Nov 22 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) let her chakra wane away, the tiny amount of golden energy dissapearing with it.

"It erases....if it goes off; anything near is just uh....gone."* - Sun Nov 22 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: In more detail. It destroys objects on an atanomical level. - Sun Nov 22 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ................. - Sun Nov 22 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sort of my last resort I think? - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It just.... - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's... - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Don't worry! I'm not going to use it until I'm sure it won't hurt me too, - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That's so dangerous... - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) pat her head gently.* - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah it is. - Sun Nov 22 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm working on a way to contain it. - Sun Nov 22 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So I can use it without hitting anything but my target. - Sun Nov 22 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Pandora's light. - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Oh damn. Thats way better than what I thought of. - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Trumps atomic release any day... - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled down at her, nodding her agreement.

"I love it~"* - Sun Nov 22 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Good good. - Sun Nov 22 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...thank you for letting me name it. - Sun Nov 22 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I want you to name all of the techniques I make~ - Sun Nov 22 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) wrapped her arms tightly around the woman, sinking down onto the sofa until they were laying together.* - Sun Nov 22 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) laughed affectionatelty and put her lips against the top of Kiyoko's head.

"I love it when you're gushy~"* - Sun Nov 22 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) only seemed to squeeze the woman tighter.

"I love all of you, even the goofball parts~"* - Sun Nov 22 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) struck quick! Attempting to gently grab Kiyoko's tongue between forefinger and thumb, she was as gentle as possible; so as not to cause pain.

"Hah!"* - Sun Nov 22 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) laughed again and released her tongue, only to stop any reply with her lips. She kissed her hard, trying to push her own tongue against Kiyoko's.* - Sun Nov 22 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) wasn't about to break off the kiss to breathe, whatever basic physical need was suddenly replaced in its entireity by Kiyoko. Her hands wound their way towards Kiyoko's lower back, gripping her waste tightly.* - Sun Nov 22 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took her hands even lower, going underneath Kiyoko's dress and moving upwards to rest on her bare back. She could almost feel Kiyoko's desire for more and Lera wouldn't be one to stop her. She very very briefly stopped the kiss to say "Do whatever you want to me love..." before kissing her once more.* - Sun Nov 22 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) layed back, pulling her arms open and outwards as a sign of her acceptence; she wanted Kiyoko to take control and do anything she wanted. Whats more, the hand on her throat was giving her an odd feeling in her chest. Maybe Lera actually wanted to be dominated for once.

"Yes..."* - Sun Nov 22 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) couldn't let out a gasp, her air cut off by Kiyoko's kisses; but she moaned quietly, sounding oddly like a kitten as Kiyoko ran fingers all over her body. To Kiyoko's touch, she was extremely sensitive. The moment her lips were teased, her kitten like sound turned into a much louder moan. Liquid would immediately start to leak, coating Kiyoko's fingertip in the moist substance. Meanwhile, her own hands found their way back under Kiyoko's dress; digging short fingernails into her skin.* - Sun Nov 22 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) gasped when her lip was bitten, the pain as little as it was; only served to arrouse her further. She could feel that Kiyoko was teasing her and as she formed the hicky against her collarbone, she wanted nothing more thant to have Kiyoko sink her fingers deep inside. Kiyoko didn't seem to be relenting though, it was quickly going to become a competition between who could hold themselves back for longer.

That being said, Lera was not below begging for it "P-please...just give it to me..."* - Sun Nov 22 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) gritted her teeth, she was losing the battle; Kiyoko's consistent sucking on her skin was threatening to push her over the edge. Her breathing was replaced by a loud groan followed by short gasps while Kiyoko started to tease her clit. It wasn't enough though, she was expertly being kept on the cusp whilst being denied any more than that.

"M-More!..please..."* - Sun Nov 22 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: She's...too...good... - Sun Nov 22 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) released Kiyoko from her own grip, to dig her fingers into the sofa beneath them. As soon as she heard her words, she wanted nothing more than this extra special something Kiyoko spoke of. No matter how much she tried to force herself, she just couldn't cum from this; Kiyoko continued to expertly keep her right on the edge with no indication that she'd be doing anything more. That being said, with the constant teasing her clit was enlarging and growing more sensitive with each passing second.

"U-ugh Please!! I...c-can't!"* - Sun Nov 22 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) felt her clit suddenly pinched between Kiyoko's fingers, instantly driving her over the edge. Her hips bucked upwards and her voice resorted to a loud moan, it was lucky they didn't live in conjoined houses; otherwise neighbours would know just how 'active' the pair was. As she finally started to reach her climax, that sweet smelling liquid would spill out from between her lips; coating the sofa and Kiyoko's hand. The climax seemed to draw on for several seconds before Lera finally slumped back into the sofa with her head turned on its side.

"I...I want it...please."* - Sun Nov 22 18:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) clenched her fingers and gripped onto Kiyoko tightly, hugging her while the tremors wore off.

"Your....mean."* - Sun Nov 22 18:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Mnnn I did tell you I knew how to dominate you. - Sun Nov 22 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Good at this.... - Sun Nov 22 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) braced herself for whatever Kiyoko was about to do, she was a mixture of excited and nervous; but she couldn't imagine disliking anything that Kiyoko did to her. She wasn't prepared for what was done though, she let out a little short gasp at the unfamiliar wetness of Kiyoko's tongue against her backside. It was new and different, something she'd never tired to do before with anyone. She didn't at all dislike it though.

Raising her hips, she gave Kiyoko easier access whilst her own hand snaked downards to rub against her clit.* - Sun Nov 22 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) slipped her fingers inside herself, reaching a point of no return at record speed. It was something about the soft touch of Kiyoko's tongue that just sent her into a frenzy. Soon her asshole was contracting around Kiyoko's tongue and more juices were flowing down and inbetween her crack. She was so close to her orgasm that Kiyoko could easily throw her over the edge with a few tiny actions.* - Sun Nov 22 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) the little motion of Kiyoko squeezing let out another moan from Lera, causing her muscles to convulse with the orgasm that ran through her body. Juices would spill freely, while Lera experienced her first full bodied orgasm. Her legs came upwards, twisting around Kiyoko's back and holding her in place. She gritted her teeth and gripped the sofa tightly in a huge effort to keep herself still. Yet she couldn't help the twitches and convulsions that ran throughout her body.

Even as she still coated Kiyoko's face with her juices, her convulsions would start to die down and she trusted herself enough to release her legs from Kiyoko.

"Agh...U--ahhh..."* - Sun Nov 22 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) didn't have the capacity to care for where she landed at the moment, instead; here eyes stared up at the ceiling with a hazy look to them while her breath continued to come in sharp gasps with the ocasional moan. Her body still twitched as the orgasm gave its final gasping breath; when it did, her hands sought out Kiyoko; attempting to draw her back for a hug. She didn't even have the capacity to speak.

"Hah..."* - Sun Nov 22 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) slowly opened up her eyes, seeing the scene they'd created and the mess she'd made on Kiyoko's face. Then, quite literally like a dog, she started to lick Kiyoko's face clean; paying paticularly attention to her lips.* - Sun Nov 22 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) finished licking her clean and ended it with a quick nibble on her chin, before she fell back against the cushions again.

"Legs...jelly...can't move..."* - Sun Nov 22 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Amazing... - Sun Nov 22 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Love you... - Sun Nov 22 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) squeezed her closer again, gently pressing her lips against her throat.

"Shower...?"* - Sun Nov 22 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Nngn..y-yes. - Sun Nov 22 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Give me a minutes.... - Sun Nov 22 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) slowly...ever so slowly, pulled herself upwards; her entire body felt weak, yet satisfied. She'd never felt like this in her life, it was a good feeling.* - Sun Nov 22 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We can wait... you need to relax. - Sun Nov 22 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You might roll an ankle trying to get up now. - Sun Nov 22 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ha....You...were really good... - Sun Nov 22 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You should take control more often... - Sun Nov 22 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) slumped back down again, taking Kiyoko's advice.* - Sun Nov 22 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Next time....its my turn... - Sun Nov 22 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll make you squeal~ - Sun Nov 22 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I told you that I knew how, did you doubt me? - Sun Nov 22 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: No...I trust everything you say. - Sun Nov 22 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But that...i've never experienced that. - Sun Nov 22 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You... liked it right? - Sun Nov 22 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I loved it... - Sun Nov 22 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn... - Sun Nov 22 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Good. - Sun Nov 22 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hah....were you worried I wouldn't? - Sun Nov 22 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: A little. - Sun Nov 22 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) tapped her nose.

"I'd like anything you do to me."* - Sun Nov 22 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-How're you? - Sun Nov 22 19:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...no. - Mon Nov 23 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean I used to not think much of it but...ever since I killed those two...and I spoke about it a few days ago. - Mon Nov 23 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Things have just been weird...I feel different. - Mon Nov 23 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...You feel different how? - Mon Nov 23 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I feel like a murderer. - Mon Nov 23 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...weren't they trying to kill you? - Mon Nov 23 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah but... - Mon Nov 23 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then you aren't a murderer. - Mon Nov 23 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I know I could have just stopped them... - Mon Nov 23 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I didn't have to kill them...but I wanted to. - Mon Nov 23 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Especially the second one...I even tracked him down to kill him. - Mon Nov 23 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That's how far I went... - Mon Nov 23 12:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't know, I just don't feel right now. - Mon Nov 23 12:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: That...does kind of make him a murderer. - Mon Nov 23 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well... even if you wanted to kil them, and didn't have to, they were murderer's too right? Or at least trying to be. - Mon Nov 23 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...I mean they attacked me first. - Mon Nov 23 12:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know our situations aren't identical though. - Mon Nov 23 12:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess... - Mon Nov 23 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just don't want to turn out like them though...that's probably what worries me the most. - Mon Nov 23 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn...it should honestly. - Mon Nov 23 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But you have lots of people that care about you who aren't going to let that happen. - Mon Nov 23 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess...it's probably the reason I try so hard to make friends. - Mon Nov 23 12:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ...and ask girls out a lot. - Mon Nov 23 12:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn. - Mon Nov 23 12:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You'll get the hang of it. - Mon Nov 23 12:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 23 12:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So why do you think you only can talk depressed when speaking with others? - Mon Nov 23 12:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Perhaps because of your chosen topics. - Mon Nov 23 12:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You could tell stories of your childhood, you could discuss your goals. - Mon Nov 23 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh...Well childhood is a little difficult because I don't want to talk about my family. - Mon Nov 23 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right. - Mon Nov 23 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And the only goals I have right now are to quit drinking and smoking...which I also don't like talking about. - Mon Nov 23 12:54:24 2015
