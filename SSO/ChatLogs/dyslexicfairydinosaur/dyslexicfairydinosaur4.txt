<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *walks away* - Wed Nov 25 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) widened her eyes, though he was not paticularly fast; she could see in his movements that he was a taijutsu based fighter and a much better one than her. With a grunt under her breath, she slipped samehada from her back and used it to guard her body; at the same time flowing Doton chakra throughout her skin for some extra defense. Despite her attempts, if his kick struck she would be forced to stumble backwards; his strength was impressive to say the least.

However, if he did kick samehada; he would find a small portion of his chakra leeched away (about 3-5%). Knowing that she couldn't afford to sit on the defensive, she twisted samehadad to the side and went for a large swing; hoping to make it difficult for him to dodge.* - Wed Nov 25 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: He's too fast close range...he'll hit me sooner rather than later... - Wed Nov 25 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) couldn't move samehada fast enough to block the next kick, nor could she move fast enough to dodge. So she did the next best thing instead; focusing her chakra onto her shoulder and bracing for the impact. The kick slammed into her shoulder with a thud, her Domu absorbed a great deal of the damage; but it still stung like a bitch. Using the momentum of his attack, she jumped backwards; deactivating her Domu and then jumping again, this time directly upwards.

Assuming she wasn't stopped, she would rise into the sky and then keep rising; seemingly starting to float a ways above Hiroshi's head.* - Wed Nov 25 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Man. . She is flying. . . That is awsome. . .  - Wed Nov 25 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) kept her eye on him, having them widen a bit as he performed the handseals for Great Breakthrough. Without waiting for him, she dropped Samehada and started to fall; copying his handseals exactly albeit significantly faster. She hoped to land before he had a chance to fire, but if not; she would fire her own Great breakthrough as he fired his.

Not only was her wind significantly larger, she was able to put more than tripple the power into it; likely wiping his ninjutsu out and blasting him away.* - Wed Nov 25 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Could probably disable him with a touch... - Wed Nov 25 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) landed on her feet and drew in another breath, spitting out a slew of mud to the ground; this gave her a mud source, if he wanted to continue fighting that is. While he struggled to his feet, she held out her hand; Samehada leapt into it from the ground, apparently with a will all of its own.* - Wed Nov 25 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ...Hm. Nah. - Wed Nov 25 18:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Oh. Sure. - Wed Nov 25 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) formed a handseal and created ten clones from the mud, she winced a bit at the sudden loss of chakra; but they would make things much faster.* - Wed Nov 25 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Wow okay. - Wed Nov 25 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Lets go? - Wed Nov 25 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Yeah first stop is my shop bring all the clones with you lets go Hiro. - Wed Nov 25 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: O you right - Wed Nov 25 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure. - Wed Nov 25 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) nodded to each of her clones, they immediately started fanning out in all directions; aiming to make the northern part of the desert a minefield. Thankfully, unlike ordinary elemental clones; the Doton Shadow clones could travel far from Lera with ease. Each one of her clones sank into the ground, dropping a figurine just a few inches below the surface every few minutes.

The village was large so it was going to take a fair amount of time. Lera had no issues with exhaustion however, thanks to her chakra pools being so large. Every minute or so, Lera would rise her head back to the surface in order to take a breath; though her clones had no need to breath and continued unperturbed.

She knew that it wasn't necessary to cover the entire area, with Trilliam and Hiroshi working on it as well. However, the fact that Lera was capable of creating so many clones meant that most of it was covered by her. She made sure to memorise the locations of each and every one that she placed in order to relay it back to whoever was going to be leading the army.

This was a good idea, though she wasn't entirely sure how a few figurines could be helpful; though she could feel a slight tingle on her fingers, an undercurrent of dormant chakra hidden within. Considering Trilliam had said they needed a trigger in order to 'explode' it would suggest that these were indeed the mines. Trilliam had obviously figured out something new since she'd last taught him her techniques.

Once that was done, she moved out of the field and waited for the others to join her.* - Wed Nov 25 18:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) gripped samehada's hilt with a single hand and drew it outwards. The girl was fast, but not so fast that Lera couldn't at least keep up with her; she'd fought faster people at least. When she swung the sword, she knew immediately that Paine was no amateur; she was as skilled as Lera at least, if not more so. With a grunt, she stabbed the tip of Samehada into the ground and angled it slightly; using the flat edge of the blade to guard herself against the strike.

If successful, the blade would slam against Samehada and ricochet upwards due to the slight angle. At that point, Lera would go on the offensive herself; driving Samehada forwards and hopefully into the girls chest.* - Fri Nov 27 14:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled a sort of grim smile as her sword was blocked with ease, they were surprisingly even with the weapons; though Lera had a sneaking suspicion that Paine was holding back. She sort of wanted to bring that little extra something out of the girl, make her use everything she had rather than just the sword. So when Paine artfully dodged her strike and then swung the blade towards her; Lera whispered the word "Samehada" under her breath.

It almost seemed that the sword leapt to block all of its own accord, though Lera put her own strength into the block just as much as the blade did. She caught the attack on the edge of Samehada, this time spinning her body around Paine and aiming to slame the hilt into the girls side.* - Fri Nov 27 14:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) was openly grinning now, usually when she fought it was either against someone who overpowered her thoroughly or someone she barely had to try against. It was nice to fight someone so evenly for once. Knowing that Paine was a taijutsu specialist however, it was clear that the girl would have something more to fight with. Still as determined as ever to bring it out, Lera started to flow chakra throughout her body. However, she'd felt in Paines strikes; her attacks would pierce Domu with ease.

To counter this, she raised Samehada again; holding it horizontally to block the vertical strike to her shoulder. However, she didn't block the full strength of Paines blow; intending to only weaken the blow to the point where it would strike her stone like stick with a 'ching', leaving no damage behind. Lera followed up on this move by pressing her entire body forwards. Intending to almost 'tackle' Paine. However, with her holding Samehada infront of her; she intended to push the weapon against her. While the sword would not damage her physically, it would begin taking chakra.* - Fri Nov 27 15:04:06 2015
