<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) widened her eyes as Paine finally showed her true colours, she was not fast nor reflexive enough as the foot slammed against her back; damaging even her Domu. She winced at the pain but did not let herself stop, instead she pitched forwards into a roll and back to her feet to face Paine again. That being said, even she was not totally immune to pain and she doubled over momentarily with a groan.

Assuming Paine wouldn't take advantage of her momentary hesitation; Lera stabbed Samehada into the sand and released the hilt. She cracked her neck from side to side before spitting out a fair amount of mud. None of the mud was aimed to hit Paine, or get anywhere near her infact. However, she now had a mud source.

"I knew you were holding back. Now its my turn."* - Fri Nov 27 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Now...lets see what she does. - Fri Nov 27 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled and brought her hands together with a smile, she formed but a single handseal; focusing her chakra towards the mud she had created. The mud began to ripple and form into copies of her...a whole crowd of them. Each clone would be blocking Paine's path. Ironically, this was a feat she could only achieve with her elemental clones.

"So you can deal with one of me. How about thirty?"* - Fri Nov 27 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I'll end it in the next one... - Fri Nov 27 15:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Whaaa? - Fri Nov 27 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) brought her hands together once more, watching as Paine zoomed around destroying clones before they even had a chance to reform. The remaining 20 or so all dived towards Paine at once, with no real strategy of attacking; merely attemping to holding her down with sheer body mass. That body mass quickly changed to mud as every single clone reformed to it, intending to cover Paine completely. 

Whether that all worked or not, Lera's real intention was to blast the girl away. With only one handseal formed, she took in a deep breath and suddenly spat out a humungous wave of water; intending to simply blow the girl away and possibly slam her against the far wall.

If this was a success, she would cross her arms over her chest and say "I think thats enough." if not, she'd wait and see what happened next.* - Fri Nov 27 15:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) retrieved samehada, placing it on her back once more.

"We'll do this again sometime. See you pain"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) put the watermelon somewhere safe, still a little confused at the random gift.

"Alright. I will be using my speciality this time around. Try to hit me."* - Fri Nov 27 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I will go full s-strength. - Fri Nov 27 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-And u-use my new t-techniques. - Fri Nov 27 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Go ahead. - Fri Nov 27 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) raised an eyebrow, at the missing Momura. Lera had been around the block a few times and knew most techniques or could at least work them out mid-battle. Glancing around the area, she could not see Momura from any direction; including upwards. She highly doubted the girl could turn invisible, so that left only one other logical option. Though, she wondered when the girl had found the time to learn Doton techniques; as far as Lera remember, she hadn't wanted to.

Either way, she slipped her hands into five different handseals; gathering a blue crackling chakra to her hands. After a few more moments of waiting, she slammed those palms into the ground; sending the wave of Raiton through the sand. With any luck, she'd be able to hit the girl who was likely hiding under there.* - Fri Nov 27 20:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-One thousand y-years of death! - Fri Nov 27 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) raised her eyebrows in surprise when Momura popped up above ground, actually pushing her upwards with the strength of a simple poke; the girls physical strength had certainly improved. However, unfortunately for Momura, Samehada covered her backside and thus the girl poked the weapon head on. 

Samehada would squeal in surprise and annoyance, to be touched without the intention of its master was not something it enjoyed. Thankfully for Momura, samehada had no interested in her chakra at all; if Lera wasn't having it absorb the girls chakra, then it just didn't bother.

Lera herself span around and clapped her hands together, turning on the source of the attack; she flung her palm towards the girl and sent a blast of wind. Her intent was to rip her from the ground and send her flying.

"You really shouldn't touch him you know..."* - Fri Nov 27 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) coughed a little at the smoke bomb but remained calm and collected while she reviewed the situation. She was being easy on the girl that was for certain, but she was utlising tactics which was no expected. Upon seeing the three Momura's rushing at her, she took in a deep breath and abruptly erupted into the flames. The girl would hopefully be forced to step back and the clones, if thats what they were, would be destroyed.

If Momura continued with her attacks, she would likely connect; at the cost of burning herself.* - Fri Nov 27 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) dropped to the ground, reacting almost instantly to the attack; her fire vanished from existance and she instead began focusing her chakra onto her feet and the ground itself. As she struck the ground, still taking damage but falling through the sand like it was made of water.* - Fri Nov 27 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) would allow herself to be thrown, working on her gravity the entire time. Instead of slamming against the wall as Momura likely expected, she landed against it almost with a grace. She 'stood' on the wall for a few moments before dropping back to the ground and nodding at Momura.

"You've gotten better. I'll go all out next time."* - Fri Nov 27 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright.. - Fri Nov 27 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) breathed in deeply, putting her forehead against Kiyoko's.

"Together forever. Even in death..."* - Sat Nov 28 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) opened her eyes again, a tiny little sparkle sitting in the corner of one eye.

"Are you okay...?"* - Sat Nov 28 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 28 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just everything's hard right now. - Sat Nov 28 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I know... - Sat Nov 28 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It will hurt...for a long time. But you're strong enough to move past it. - Sat Nov 28 09:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Am I? - Sat Nov 28 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yes. - Sat Nov 28 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) looked right into kiyoko's eyes when she said this. The look in her own eyes said she believed it completely.* - Sat Nov 28 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) drew her close again, running fingers through her hair.

"Theres nothing I can say that will make it hurt less. Just know that I'm here for you."* - Sat Nov 28 09:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What about you? - Sat Nov 28 09:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took in a short breath through her teeth, she should've known Kiyoko would ask.

"It hurts, a lot. But...I don't want to cry for him. He would hate that."* - Sat Nov 28 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know you said that... - Sat Nov 28 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But what do you need? - Sat Nov 28 09:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: All I need is you. - Sat Nov 28 09:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thats all I'll ever need. - Sat Nov 28 09:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What do you need from me? - Sat Nov 28 09:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I just need you here with me...thats all. - Sat Nov 28 09:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) started humming under her breath, the humming quickly turned into a song.

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY9dQ8hUi7U)* - Sat Nov 28 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) finished her song and just held onto Kiyoko silently. With her chin resting over her shoulder, Kiyoko would not be able to see the silent trail of tears running down Lera's face.* - Sat Nov 28 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Crap, Lera... - Sat Nov 28 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I don't know what to do... - Sat Nov 28 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled and let out a shuddery breath.

"I know I know...no tears.."* - Sat Nov 28 09:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I gotchu, you got me. - Sat Nov 28 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Always. - Sat Nov 28 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) closed her eyes at the first kiss, leaning into it with a sigh. Her arms tightened around kiyoko's waist when the kiss was pulled back; only to find herself staring deep into Kiyoko's eyes. There was pain in Lera's eyes, pain but also love; a deep and endless well that seemed to burrow down forever. Then the kiss came again, deeper and romantic; Lera mirrored it with a rising need and passion of her own. Little spots of colour were growing on her cheeks, only growing more pronounced with every repeated kiss.* - Sat Nov 28 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sucked in a breath between her teeth, as they fell to the ground; the kiss this time held something different, a desperate need for more. At Kiyoko's words, she let loose a little moan and gripped Kiyoko's dress; she was about to rip it off, when she remembered that she only had a few of these dresses left. Instead, she slowly pulled it off her, removing it and savouring the effect.

When it was off, she tugged at her bra revealing Kiyoko's breasts and causing her to inhale sharply again. Truthfully she'd been holding herself back, wanting to give Kiyoko time to adapt to her loss; this gave her a chance to release all that pent up sexual frustration. She wasted no time in lowering her head to Kiyoko's breast and wrapping her lips around a nipple, teasing it with both teeth and tongue.* - Sat Nov 28 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sat back up, tearing her own jacket and chest wrappings off. She stopped for a few moments more, just letting her eyes catch every inch of kiyoko's body; she would never get enough of looking at perfection. Reaching down, she tore Kiyoko's underwear off; sparing no moment and slpping two fingers inside. If Kiyoko wanted her to let go, she would let go. While her fingers worked away inside, quickly finding and pressing against her G-spot. The thumb of her other hand would be making slow circles around her clit.* - Sat Nov 28 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) pulled her fingers out for just a moment, long enough to stand and pull her pants off. Before sitting back down over Kiyoko. She lifted one of the womans legs and placed it over her shoulder. It took just a little shift forward to press their lips together, rubbing clit against clit. Lera's face turned into a blush, extending all the way down to her breasts in her usual odd little quirk. Just the idea of the two of them being close like this got her wet and within a few moments she was mixing juices with kiyoko.* - Sat Nov 28 10:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) didn't want to get up from her position, so she made a clone that quickly rushed off into the bedroom. It came back with a number of...toys, a thin silver vibrator and a slightly larger double ended one. Lera didn't know if Kiyoko had ever been penetrated before, so she started with the smaller one. Quickly flipping it onto vibrate and pulling her crotch away so she could slip it inside. The double ended one, she pushed inside herself; ready and waiting for the next step..* - Sat Nov 28 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) worked the vibrator in and out, her other hand pushing the other dildo into herself. She'd never bothered to use toys with Kiyoko before, but that didn't mean she didn't have any; they were just all back in Kirigakure. After several minutes of working the vibrator on Kiyoko, she pulled it away; attempting to keep the woman from reaching a climax...not yet at least. With a gulp, she took hold of the dildo sticking out of her and slowly pushed it into Kiyoko. She pushed on it until their clits were pressed together once more; hoping to gods that it wasn't hurting her. If there was no indication of pain on Kiyoko's face, she'd start pulling back and then forwards again; slowly gaining speed.* - Sat Nov 28 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) raised her eyebrows, but gave Kiyoko what she wanted; she slammed the dildo home, as deep as it would go. From then on, she worked it in and out fast and hard; no longer caring to be gentle. Even as she pleasured Kiyoko, her own body was starting to tingle with it; small gasps escaping through her lips. She wanted to make Kiyoko feel good though, the best she'd ever felt. So she sought out the discared vibrator with a hand and reached underneath the woman; searching for her asshole and shoving it inside. Her second hand would be periodically pinching Kiyoko's clit between forefinger and thumb.* - Sat Nov 28 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) sped up and began thrusting even harder if that was possible, pulling her fingers away to lean over kiyoko with a smile that spoke volumes. Even as she climaxed Lera did not let up, giving the woman no moment of rest while she continued to push the dildo in harder and harder. She was coming close to her own climax now but not quite yet. Whilst still thrusting, she leaned over to whisper in Kiyoko's ear "no holding back right...?" before sinking her teeth into the womans neck; just hard enough for it to be felt, but not hard enough to break skin.* - Sat Nov 28 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) removed her teeth, only to sink them back into her shoulder; as she came closer to climax her teeth bit down harder and harder, leaving deep red marks in Kiyoko's skin. Her own fingers sought out her clitoris, rubbing it hard even as she continued to thrust. It didn't take long, her body finally shuddering with a pleasure that caused her to slam the dildo in one last time; the hardest yet. She twitched and shuddered, tasting blood in her mouth as her teeth pierced skin. this lasted a few moments more until she slumped fowards onto Kiyoko.* - Sat Nov 28 11:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) opened her mouth, licking the wound she'd left behind on Kiyoko's shoulders. With a grunt, she reached back and pulled the dildo out from the both of them and discarded it on the floor. With that she slumped back against Kiyoko; casually nibbling her ear lobe while she whispered.* - Sat Nov 28 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: There...I didn't hold back.. - Sat Nov 28 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) slowly got herself up, disentangling herself from Kiyoko's prone from. She reached down and picked her up; taking her somewhere more comfortable. Once in the bed, she cuddled up to her again.* - Sat Nov 28 11:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) smiled and ran her fingers down Kiyoko's body, just trailing the sensitive skin.

"I didn't go to far did I...?"* - Sat Nov 28 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No... I expected more. - Sat Nov 28 11:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) took hold of the covers and wrapped them around the both of them, pressing their bodies together hard.

"Well...maybe next time I'll make a few more of me and we'll see how it goes~"* - Sat Nov 28 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: A few more of y--- - Sat Nov 28 11:38:52 2015
