<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) Paid the money before taking the giant shuriken from the blacksmith. Moving it off the counter and onto the ground, where a large metallic sound clinked as it touched the tilled floor. Fishing inside of his backpouch before revealing a sash. Tilting his shoulder downward before placing his fingers into the gripping directly in the middle of the giant shuriken. Sliding it up his shoulder and onto his back. Placing the sash over the shuriken and pulling tightly towards himself so it would stay in place. No motioning to stand upright before lacing the sash tightly to himself effectivly binding the giant metal to himself.

In a sprint he'd exited the store, using the giant shuriken for weight training as his vigously ran from the shop. Instead of walking he'd kept an upbeat jog everywhere he went, the effects of the giant shuriken already weighting down on him. "Jeez" he'd said, starting to strain a bit.* - Sun Oct 25 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) sweated profusely, the weight of the giant shuriken easily taking a toll on his stamina reserves. His clothes were soaked and a musty stench protruded from his body. Kneeling down upon a single knee before releasing the sash and allowing the shuriken to crash to the ground. A giant "Phew!~" was released from him before standing upright. This was no break by all means though, rushing into a basic fighting stance while eyeing a tree. A short stillness passed before he'd rushed quickly towards the tree with one foot outward bashing the tree harshly as leaves shook and danced down to the ground.* - Sun Oct 25 13:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can imagine, it looks pretty heavy. - Sun Oct 25 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) placed a hand upon his chest, gripping a white sash tightly before pulling it apart. The large fine metal strapped to his back hit the ground with a clang. One of the points landing towards the ground, Garachi lifting his foot and lowering it on the top portion of the shuriken, in the flat space between the points to force it further into the ground. Stepping away from the shuriken he'd place his attention towards the eastern wall. Bursting from his careless stance into a sprint before lifting a single foot. It clashed with the wall with quite a bit of power. After making contant he'd quickly placed his left foot upon the wall, pushing off into a backflip and a landin on his feet. "You don't mind if i train while we talk do you" He'd say not putting much focus on Takeda.* - Sun Oct 25 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Nope, you do what you want. - Sun Oct 25 18:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) nodded at Takeda's question, making another wild sprint at the wall. "I don't have the smarts for anything else" He'd say while forcing himmself off of the ground. Lifting a single foot into the sky as he spead towards the wall. As contant was made with the wall, it sounded off harshly. Placing his other foot upon the wall and pushing off with a grunt. As he'd land, he quickly began his sprint around. Without breaking focus on the wall he'd asked "What about you".* - Sun Oct 25 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) Was in corse for the wall again, the tacking sound of his sprint ringing through the area. The dust he'd began to scrap up poluted the air. Each step significantly increasing his speed. Pressing agisnt the ground with his left foot as the right raised, foot turned sideways and he flew through the air. His left quickly tucked inwards as his right clashed around the thick wooden wall. The kick didn't have much effect on the wood, not noticable dent or blimish. Dropping down to the ground as he'd tilt upon one knee.* - Sun Oct 25 19:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) took a few well placed steps backwards, eyeing the small fence before charging forth. While mid rush his left foot press upon the ground fercely, taking into tha air as his right would come up. Clacking with the wood a cracking sound was heard as he pushed one of the plants forth with the power of his kick.* - Tue Oct 27 11:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) placed his finger upon the sash that had binded the shuriken to his back, with a swift tug the large metal came crashing to the ground. Dancing back and forth on its points till it ratteled onto the ground. With the extra weight gone Garachi quickly formed a basic Taijutsu stance. Taking off from his pose quickly into a spirt, it wasn't long before he'd press agaisn't the ground harshly with his left foot boosting him into the air as he extended his right to meet with the wooden fence. The sound of bending wood rung through the area, although it didn't break. Once his foot made proper contant with the wood gate he'd push off it land back into his orignal spot.* - Thu Oct 29 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) landing back into his spot after pushing off the gate slid backwards a bit, allowing a small cloud of dust to raise from the ground. The dust quickly vanished and Garachi back into a stride towards the wooden gate, pressing agisn't the ground and jumping into the air once more. With his foot extended and a powerful kick bashing across the gate a small wooden chip came flying out. Spinning into the air before landing on the ground outside of the walk way. Garachi seeing this fell to the ground, headfirst of course. Raising back to his feet as he'd rub the top of his head, turning back and forth to see if anything had witness him. Quickly remebering that the village was already trashed so he most likely wouldn't catch any slack.* - Thu Oct 29 10:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: See you later, Toudou. - Fri Oct 30 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) hand reaches up tugging at a sash wrapped tightly around him, binding the giant shuriken to him. The giant metalic object fell to the ground with a clang. Garachi behind to sqaut down, leaning to one side with his hand pressed upon his knee before leaning to the next to get a good strech. "I don't know how to use any weapons yet, so maybe no weapons" He'd ask with a uplifting poundering tone at the end, standing upright to strech his spinal region.* - Fri Oct 30 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) wasn't new to this paticular technique, pressing onto the ground with his left foot as his right extended to make contant with her's. With the clashing of the Dynamic Entries he'd hope to cancel them both out rather than overpowering hers, surprised how quickly she'd closed the distance between the two.* - Fri Oct 30 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) went reeling backwards, sliding across the ground as a small cloud of dust danced into the air, fadeing shortly after. With this Ketsuki had already formed a stance, Garachi following suit. Tilting slightly forth before rushing Ketsuki sending an open palm towards her stomach since she was quite a bit taller than him. He didn't entend for any of his blows to cause any serious pain but a slight tap to let her know where contant was made if it had landed. Garachi sent his right palm forth as his left sat open to follow up on the next available action.* - Fri Oct 30 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) noticed Ketsuki's body was much more solid than that of anyone he'd encountered before. His face twisted and contorted in a confused way before a strong jab placed rightly upon the side of his face send him sliding backwards. His feet planted firmly on the ground forced dust to dance up in a rather messy spectacle. Rubbing his face witht the back of his hand where the contact had just been made he'd rush forth once more.

Once the distance had been closed a powerful kick was sent towards her chin. Taking more of a jumping effort due to the sheer distance it was from him. Regardless of the kick landing he'd contuine his forward spinning motion stright into a string of two low kicks. Hoping to catch her off gaurd with the sudden technique.* - Fri Oct 30 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) was sent reeling backwards as the forearm pressed harshly agisnt his chest. Now sliding upon his back before shifting his weight and landing back onto his feet, still sliding onto the ground with his hands placed firmly agisn't it. As the sliding stop he'd began to breath heavily, it was a good training session but his current stamina did not permit him to fight for long periods of time without exerting himself. Raising back up to his feet before brushing the dust out of his hair and off his back. "Thanks for the lesson" he'd say squinting at the women in a fashion that seemed to be pondering what to call her next. Placing a finger upon his chin as he'd look up into the air. Coming out with "Teach!" in an excited manner, the finger on his chin now pointing towards her. He'd finish off cleaning the dust before asking her "You seem pretty good at Taijutsu, is there any techniques that you can teach me?* - Fri Oct 30 02:14:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: I plan on it. - Fri Oct 30 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) readies himself, taking a step backwards from the gte before leaping into the air. With one foot tucked under his being and the other extended towards the gate it soared through the air with more fevour then grace. The base of his foot making harsh contact with the wooden planks that held the gate together. A wood wrenching sound came from the gate as he did this, a small portion of wood breaking off before he'd pushed himself away with the same foot that caused the damage. Landing safely into the spot he had just exited before.* - Fri Oct 30 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) after pushing off the gate and landing back into his spot a small spec of dust began to dance into the air, forming dust clouds for a brief moment. Though before they cleared Garachi had began his sprint again, running towards the gate and lifting from the ground, having his right foot extended simotaniously with leap into the air. Once more the base of his foot crashed agisn't the wood, furthering the damage the damage that had already been delt, a large clacking noise errutped as he did so. This time the plank shot from its hold, making Garachi unable to push back into his spot but simply fall to the earth from where he had been in the air.* - Fri Oct 30 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh..Hello again. - Fri Oct 30 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) hand quickly moved towards the sash that binded the shuriken to his chest. Pulling it strongly as the metal came crashing to the ground. Facing his attention completely towards one of the tree's in the near by area. Pushing off with his feet as he'd become airborne. Placing his leg outwards as it'd crash agisn't the base of the tree. A small mark being left by the raw power and technique of Garachi. After making contact with the tree his body reeled backwards slightly landing onto the and instantly going into a spinning high kick, barely scraping the bark. After that moving into a spinning low kick that rung out of the tree's exerterier. Standing completely back up and gainnig his form before unleashing a flurry of punches towards the tree followed by kicks, once he'd stopped he'd been soaked in sweat from head to toe. Huffing intensely while one hand was placed upon the tree.* - Thu Nov  5 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) afting his huffing session upon the tree, Garachi made his way achely towards one of the higher sitting tree. Tilting his head upwards while placing his left hand over his eyes, blocking out the rays of the sun. Laying his sights upon the branch high up. Hiking on the tree up towards the branch, gripping it tightly and pulling himself up. After his chen had reached the branch he'd allow his body to drop back down. Repeating this exercise constantly, now straining with each pull "Hrrrrr". A call throughout the woodland. After the last pull-up his arms completely gave out, having him crash towards the ground onto his back.* - Thu Nov  5 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) raised from the ground, looking over at the bramble and twigs that surrounded the forrest. Regaining enough stamina to move, though he had still been breathing quite harshly. A large log sat in the center of the derbis, Garachi placing each on his hands on the corisponding ends of the log. With a growl he lifting the log into the air and onto his back, his teeth shown from the strain his body was experiencing. The log had easily been three times the weight of the giant shuriken he kept on his back for weight training. Placing his leg outward in a single step, the intense weight making his walking slow down to a halt. Each was grogish, autoably grunting with every single movement. Fianlly reaching what he'd make his next training exercise he threw the log off his back. It crashed to the ground with a heavy blasting thud.* - Thu Nov  5 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) arrived at the base of the small lake, placing his hands on the ends of his shirt as he lifting it over his head along with the rest of the accessories that came with it. Tossing it onto the ground as he'd leap into the water. As his body made contant with body of water a cool visage consumed his being, his only sight was bubbles raising towards the surface for a small while before it'd cleared to reveal the walls of the lake covered in his vision by a blue tent due to the water that surrounded him. Swimming over towards the wall behind him as it had been the closest, placing his palm on it has he'd point his body back towards the center of the water. Having taken a deep breath before jumping in. He extended his leg as he'd push of the wall of the lake going forth at a rather speedy rate. As he'd reach a halt he'd began to spin profusely. Twisting into a single higher kick before trasitioning into a low kick.* - Thu Nov  5 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) began to travel upwards from the water to gain more oxygen. Breking the surface he'd inhale deeply, spending a short time treading the water and sucking in more air before traversing back into the depths of the lake. Swimming back towards the wall he'd began at his training again lauching himself from the wall with his foot extended, allowing the resistance of the water to enhance his technique. As the kick ended he'd quickly toss himself sideways into a upwards kick followed by a lower one. Swimming back towards the wall to complete the task again.* - Thu Nov  5 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) reached the wall placing his palm agisnt the rugged, bumby texture. He began to fell the exghustion in his body by the combination of the water presure and harsh training. Sharping his eyes with intent he placed his foot upon the wall pushing himself with the opposite foot extended. The muscle in both legs had tired drastically from this alone, ignoring the exghust of his body and twisting his waist to throw a combiton of  high and low kick. The bubbles in the water raising to the top as he'd follow. As he bursted through the surface a large huffing of air was followed by him laying flat upon his back. Allowing the water to carry his exghusted body as he'd breath in deeply, floating towards the southern side of the lake as he did so.* - Thu Nov  5 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) gained his breath, flipping over in the water and gripping the wall, pulling himself out of the water. It wasn't log till he felt the beaming sun began to dry him laying down in the grass and closing his eyes for a small time while allowing the sun to dry him. Garachi had no idea how much time had passed when he'd awoke but the shade of the sky had began to fade. Raising back to his feet he'd wipe his eyes. With a strong yawn he'd fall into a basic taijutsu stance. Throwing a flurry of punches that had ended with a single Dynamic Entry into the air, comboing that into a very powerful roundhouse kick. Dipping his body towards the ground and he extended the power of the roundhouse kick into a lower aimed ankle kick.* - Thu Nov  5 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) didn't waste to force used while he had preformed the lower kick poriton of the technique. Allowing the force to quickly be channeled into another flying kick, pressing harshly upon the ground as he'd soar into the air. Extending his right leg while he had traveled a short distance, landing with a skid onto the ground. Stopping for only a brief moment before he'd go through a simple taijutsu string. A back hand into a kick aim at the side of the knee, placing his hand behind him for support. Pushing himself back up towards a standing positon while he'd lifting the same leg used for the knee shot stright into the air. Stomping down onto the ground in the fashion that he'd of done if the knee shot had connected with a humonoid figure and left them on the ground.* - Thu Nov  5 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) had utterly blocked out all things other than the tree standing before him, with a lethal sprint he'd made quick work of the distance between the two. Pressing harshly upon the ground as he'd began to lift up, extending the opposite foot outwards. The distance quickly closed to bring out the clashing sound of flesh and bark. Garachi with this contact to the tree fell back to his feet taking a powerful hop backwards to return to his orignal spot.* - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) Now back at the original spot his eyes sharpen upon the tree once more. Gaining a basic taijutsu stance before rushing madly towards the tree again. Pressing agisnt the ground with his left foot and allowing the right to extend forth clashing with the hard exterioir of the tree. The bark had felt slightly warm from the suns constant gaze upon it. The contact felt good upon his skin as he'd pushed off the tree landing in his starting spot.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) again eyed the tree, taking a sudden breath before sprinting out towards it once more. Each footstep ringing out with a clacking sound, before a harsh press had lifted him into the air. His right leg coming out the reach the tree. The warm feeling of the bark consumed the bottom of his foot quickly. Pushing off into his starting point once more.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) pushed off the tree hoping backwards with each step upon the ground until he'd reached a good sprinting distance from the tree. With a calm breath he rushed forth towards the unmoving source of oxygen. Audible breaths rung out with each step, lifting into the air with the finale footstep as he'd extend the opposite foot to make contact with the tree. As he did he'd pushed off once more preforming a backflip and landing back into the spot he'd started.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) Spirited towards the wooden fence quickly pressing his foot agisn't the ground, giving him a lift into the air before extending the opposite foot to meet the gate. The sound of wood cracking had rung through the area in a instant as his foot made contact. A small chip of wood falling from the gate, dancing onto the ground landing in a still position.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) fell to the ground, placing one hand to help him balance.  Skipping backwards into his old positon before picking a new spot on the gate to target. Rushing forth untill the distance had been closed enough for him the leap into the air, pressing one foot outwards and onto the gate. With a loud clacking sound the gates plank reeled backwards. Flying off the gate and into the derbis that had currently been the village.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) Garachi seeing the power of his kick improving traveled towards a building, something build with much more strength than wood. Eyeing the building for a breif moment to make sure there were no occupents currently. Stepping backwards before spirinting wilding at the building jumping into the air and pressing his foot harshly agisnt the hard metal material that had built the strecutre.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) landed on the ground, the metal aching his foot slightly, just slightly enough to prove a good training. Taking a few steps backwards he'd began again at the door, while closing the distance he placed his foot onto the ground harshly pressing himself into the air and the opposite foot away from his body. Clanging agisnt the metal once more he'd backfliped into the starting positon like he usally does.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) landing in the starting spot he made no attempt to rest, making another wild spirt for the building and pressing agisn't the ground, throwing his leg outwards to find a nice home on the metal door. The sound of flesh and metal had already become familiar to his ears. Reeling backwards from the force of the kick as he'd skid backwards in the dust.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) Lifted his foot up, shaking it for a bit to calm the small aches in it. It seemed the instant his foot touched the ground he was right into another sprint. Jumping into the air he'd throw a sevear leg towards the metal once more, clanging out as he'd press agisn't the wall the of the building.
* - Fri Nov  6 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) Throwing himself back towards the starting positon once more he wasted no time spiriting back towards the building. His body began to show the workout, with beads of sweat rolling down his body and a visable slowing in his stride, although this did not stop him from getting into the air once more. Placing his foot outwards as it rang with the metal.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) says: Mmm..Alright. - Thu Nov 12 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) with his immense strength, sent a single punch towards one of the standing logs. Busting the wood easily before sending another punch towards the standing wood figure. Repeating this actions over and over untill all that remained of the log was a pulp of wood and rope. Garachi moved to the next task sending a reeling kick towards the center of the next log. Cracking it profusly with what seemed to be a simple kick he'd contuine his taijutsu spectacle moving from log to log as he'd shatter them with ease.* - Thu Nov 12 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) swifting moved from the log to log, now working solely on his punching skills. Standing with both arms placed just before his face and he'd go to work on the log. A barrage of punches sent to the upper half and center of the log. He'd already had a immpresive amount of strength in his body, but after this training theres no telling what his punches would be capable of.* - Thu Nov 12 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) stoped, huffing as he'd attempt to catch his breath. A quick glance around he saw that all the trainnig logs in the area had been decimated. Rubbing his head as he couldn't recall even destroying that many logs. Having to move on the next hardest thing in the area he'd quickly moved over to a stone placed in the center of the training field. With a single fist reeled backwards he sent to towards the stone. The clacking of a flesh and rock echoed through the area, pullling his fist back he'd seen a bloody stain, though no pain acoured in his hand. Taking tape from his backpouch and wrapping the bloody fist before the other fist.* - Thu Nov 12 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) pounded both fist together before raising them directly over his face. With the wrap on his hands he'd now be able to get through the training without damaging his knuckles, or breaking them for that matter. Sending a single punch the stone, he could feel that it was much more sound than any object he'd punched before, and that breaking stone would take more than the raw strength he had at the moment. Sending another well stanced punch towards the stone, clashing loudly and ringing through the area* - Thu Nov 12 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) sent a single full power blow at the stone, as it connected he could already feel the busted the skin over the knuckle. He could feel the warm liquid quickly consume the base of his hand as he turned it over the white of the wrapping began to fill with red. Even with the busted knuckle and the pain that came with it he couldn't help with point his focus else were. A small indent had been made by the force and skill he'd placed with his punch, right in the center of the stone. With a small smile he'd walked from the training area with his hands tucked inside his pockets.* - Thu Nov 12 23:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) "Oooo a fight" Garachi thought to himself before folding his legs inward and taking a seat. Placing his hands upon his now inverted knees as he'd leaned foward with excitment, a smile trickled upon his face.* - Sat Nov 14 22:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) rose from his seat on the ground, brushing of the dirt from his pants. Flanks dance to the ground from the black dungeree's. "Well, i guess he's not ganna fight" He'd say making his way back into the village.* - Sat Nov 14 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) began towards a tall tree, placing a fist upon his knuckles. Forceing a cracking sound from them before switching hands. Reaching the base of the tree he'd lift his hands up in a simple boxing stance, arching his arm backwards before unleashing a punch of uncanny power towards the wooden structure. A small breaking in a bark was quickly seen as the tree shaked leaves that shivered down like snow, filling the green ground with tints of orange and yellow. Garachi pulling back his fist began to assess the damage he'd caused.* - Sat Nov 14 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) eyed the bark on the tree, one hand pinching at his chin as he'd hum out. "Hmmm" in a low pich with his face inches away from the now busted bark. Reeling his body back into an upright position as he'd crack his knuckles once more, falling back into a boxers stance. This time instead of one furious punch, he let out a flurry of them. Biting into the tree's bark with gnashing strength. Each attack crunching loudly in the area. Garachi moving backwards to see the pulp of bark and sap that laid before him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) assested the damage to the tree quickly before moving on to his next task. As he traveled he'd pulled out white medical wrap, soft to the touch. Extending all his fingers as he'd work the tape around his knuckles and the base of his wrist. Trasitioning arms as he'd finished on the first. His walk was halted at a large stone, eyeing it for a breif moment before moving smoothly into a boxing stance. With a swift punch the stone flaked off small fragments of rock. * - Sat Nov 14 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) pulled his fist back, but it was quickly answered by the opposite arm. Clashing into the rock as fragments rung out. Chipping away slowly at the boulder he'd went back and forth with powerful punches. The white wrap soon began to turn to a mixture of red and brown, from both his blood and the derbis and resadue of the battered rock. With an unrelently determination he constantly assaulted than ananiment rock. Crunching through its hard shell with each punch.* - Sat Nov 14 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Garachi(Moonsplitter) noticed the rock had become stained with red, almost mistaking it from the rocks blood rather than his own. With one finale punch a large amount of derbis bounced from the rocks frame and onto the ground. Garachi removing the wraps and allowing them to fall upon the earth as he'd walked off, his training for now was complete and his knuckles needed time to heal before he'd began training this intense again, good thing he was a fast healer.* - Sat Nov 14 23:22:01 2015
