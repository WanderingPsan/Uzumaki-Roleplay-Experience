<br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly sighed, he was terribly lazy and that in itself was his downfall. As he ran his hand through his hair, deciding he'd get the Pushups out of the way first. Sighing to himself he casually moved and positioned himself, himself. With his body completely stretched out, his hands placed flat on the ground with his arms being shoulder length apart. He wasn't really weak, nor the strongest kid around. As he slowly, lowered himself downtowards the ground. Just before his stomach touched the ground. 

He pushed back up, filling the tension in his arms, at least meant he was doing the exercise correctly. As he went back down again, before comming up, he was going to finish this one way or another. As he sighed to himself, repeating the process. Of lowering his body downwards, before pushing himself back up. He sighed to himself, this was going to be a long day. 

Scratching his head, he returned back to work, deciding this time he'd make it a little harder on himself for the remaining hald of the pushups. He put his left, foot on his right ankle. Leaving only a single foot on the ground, as he lowered himself down and pushed upwards, he felt his muscles aching. At least now he'd get a good work out. 

Cracking his knuckles, he yawned slightly. Beginning to regulate his breathing, inhaling through his nose and exhaling through his mouth. As he smiled as he continued the process of lowering himself down, before pushing himself up again. After he had finished the fifty, pushups. He slowly sighed, cracking his knuckles. As he decided to take a momentary breather.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly sighed it was time for him to begin, working on the crunches since he had succeeded in finishing the pushups, as he laid flat on his back. Lifting his knees up, as the boy slowly placed his hands behind his head. Pulling upwards, causing his stomach to crunch, and he felt it. Of all exercises he seemed to hate crunches the most, as he repeated the process. Of lowering his body back down, to just before it touched the ground he pulled himself back up so that his knees touched his chest. As he sighed slightly, lowering himself back down. 

Cracking his knuckles, he only wanted to gain the attention of his parents, something he wasn't able to do. As he cracked his knuckles, before returning to his exercises. Moving up and down, as he continued to practice he wanted to get stronger. He would in fact become a Leader he wanted to, he figured after this he'd probably do some meditating. 

As he continued, he was beginning to reach the end, as he decided he'd speed it up a tad. As he finished, he cracked his knuckles sitting up he yawned slightly deciding he'd do more on his own some time.* - Sun Aug 30 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly nodded, as he raised his hands to chest level. He decided to do what his friend was doing, which was doing it at a comfortable pace so that he wouldn't mess up then gradually go faster. As he raised his hands to chest level, as he began weaving through the seals. Doing them in a randmon order, as he moved through them he made few mistakes but he was going at a comfortable speed. As he smiled slightly. 

He enjoyed handseals, it actuall made him feel as if he was doing a jutsu. But he didn't know any at all, raising his hands to chest level once again. He repeated the process doing as many seals as possible without messing up so that he could get the most out of it. As he yawned slightly as he cracked his knuckles briefly before he returned his concentration back to doing the seals. 

Eventually he decided he'd move up the speed a tad, though when he did he incurred many errors and messed up a lot. Sighing, he decided he had done enough to call it done for now* - Sun Aug 30 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly sighed as he decided it was about time to practice as he raised his hands to chest level. He had already memorized the handseals, and could perform them all with little to no mistakes. As he raised his hands to chest level, he quickly began weaving through a series of handseals. As he moved through them, he tried his best to go fast but not to mess up, he obviously wasn't doing to good at that. As he sighed, cracking his knuckles. As he sighed, deciding he'd take it slow again. 

He cracked his knuckles, before once again placing his hands at chest level. As he began to move through his seals, he was going at a decent speed. And looked like he knew what he was doing, every so often he tried to increase his speed without messing up on his seals. He was getting better, slowly, but he'd still have a lot more to do before he was somewhat fast. 

He guessed for an Student he was fairly good at this point, most of them didn't even know the seals. But he didn't care, he wanted to impress his parents ,the ones which had always neglected him. But he sighed, he was getting bored, but once he had reached a point he was proud of he'd stop. But for now he'd continue. 

Running his hand through his snow-white hair he stared forward. Watching the situation occur next to him. He smiled slightly, but he didn't see anything about it. He kept moving through his seals, with a small smile upon his face showing that he was infact having fun. He continued to stare at his hands, as they weaved through each infividual seal. 

He had already had his goal in mind, he desired to be proficeint. So to do so he'd need to be able to whip out his seals fast, to overwhealm his enemy. This thought seemed to motivate him even further, as he grinned a toothy grin. His hands seemingly increasing in speed as he made the seals. 

Eventually he seemed to slow them, deciding to take it easy because doing stuff fast could usually end up causing injuries. He knew if he took it easy he'd eventually gradually improve in speed, so he closed his eyes visualizing each seal individual.* - Sun Aug 30 17:07:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly sighed, deciding he'd practice his jutsu as he raised his hands to chest level. Beginning to weave a series of handseals, upon finishing the series of handseals. As he sighed, beginning to channel his chakra. As he inhaled followed by a large exhale, upon exhaling three balls of fire escaped his lips. Heading towards the sky, he wanted to make sure he set nothing on fire, he also wanted to master this jutsu before he went onto another one. As he cracked his knuckles. Deciding to try this again. 

Running his hand through his hair, he casually stared upwards into the sky, as he cracked his knuckles once again. Yawning, as he quickly began weaving through a series of handseals, concentrating his chakra as he inhaled and exhaled three times. 

With each exhale, a ball of fire was shot towards the sky. After he had done that, he yawned slightly. Wondering if there was a more proficient way to do this. Deciding he'd give it another try, he cracked his knuckles. Looking towards his brother briefly, as he raised his hands to chest level. As he quickly move through a series of handseals, grinning slightly. As he finished the handseals, he began concentrating his chakra sending it towards it's stomach. 

As he felt a boiling, sensation drawing it upwards. He inhaled and exhaled. Releasing the fire from his lips, as he sighed. He had decided this would be his final try for now, as he raised his hands to chest level. Remembering the seals, as he whispered them to himself. Upon finishing his recollection of the handseals, he began to channel his chakra. Sending it outwards, as three fireballs were released from his lips. Shooting towards the sky as he sighed. Sitting down, he was ready to take a break.* - Sun Aug 30 17:08:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) moves his hand to the hilt of his Chokuto, he sighed it wasn't his intention to unveil it right here, but he didn't actually mind. His foot planted firmly on the ground as he locked eyes with Ikaro for a moment, before his blade was pulled from his sheath. He smiled briefly, before he kicked off his hind leg...And with an astonishing show of speed, he was in front of Ikaro, blade being sent Horizontally, But he was noticably holding back in terms of speed, he desired to give him a chance to draw his blade and counter.

He inhaled through his nose, his snow-white hair gently fluttered in the breeze, he desired to have some fun...He did have some pent up aggression he needed to get off of his chest afterall, he yawned briefly, but that was fun, he had some stuff he needed to do. This would be a warmup afterall.* - Mon Aug 31 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) eyes stayed focused on Ikaro's feint, as he followed the actual attack his blade moved Diagnolly, aiming to parry Ikaro's strike as it came towards him. "And you aren't to slow with a rebound." He stated, referring to Ikaro's attack speed, as he smiled a bit, his tongue traced the edge of his lips, as he attempted to move in had he succeeded in parrying Ikaro's attack. His right foot was sent towards His chest, aiming to kick him, and knock him to the ground, he knew it was a spar so he held back with his attacks.

Just in case one connected he didn't wish for it to maim, or hurt his opponent to much, Ikaro seemed pretty chill afterall. He had never fought a battle without chakra so this was a challenge on his own part, but he figured it'd be fun in the long run.* - Mon Aug 31 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly withdrew hios foot only to see Ikaro's Katana comming vertically, only for it to move Horizontally. And immediately he kicked off his leading leg aiming to avoid the strike, but he wasn't quite fast enough and it went across his Abdomen, making a light cut across it which bled but it wasn't major, or life threatening,  but it caused him to wince a bit ignoring the pain for a moment as he spoke:

"Your skills with a blade are nothing to actually scuff' at." He stated as he moved forward, making a vertical slash, which obviously would miss Ikaro even if he didn't move, but it was just a ploy as he stuck the tip of his Katana into the ground, before balancing himself perfectly. As a kick was sent towards the Male's neck, it was swift, and powerful.* - Mon Aug 31 12:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) smiled as his foot connected, but immediately he saw his opponent ready a counter and bit his bottom lip, as he felt the blade connect with his thigh he gasped in surprise. He noticed a tingling in his abdomen before the pain virtually faded away...Oddly it felt numb, he didn't pay it much mind. Since he was just hit again, which caused him to stumble to the ground. But despite his pain he wasted no time in getting back to his feet a bit wobbily.

But luckily it was his thigh, and not somewhere else which would've completely inhibited his movement, but he decided to take a different approach and held up his blade defensively in preparation for Ikaro's next attack, he inhaled before exhaling. Giving Ikaro a chance to attack once again while he gathered his bearings.* - Mon Aug 31 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) smiled warmly as he saw Ikaro's tactic, following the feint, until he saw it comming across Horizontally. His blade was swiftly, shot upwards veritically, aiming to once again parry the strike. Before hopping back in order to get some distance from Ikaro, whi was obviously a skilled swordsman, very formiddable to say the least as he heard Ikaro speak he couldn't help but laugh a bit, finding his words humurous as he spoke:

"Not so bad yourself." 

He felt the tingling sensation in his thigh, as he felt his leg going numb he wasn't an idiot so he thought to himself "Poison?"* - Mon Aug 31 13:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) laughed lightly as Ikaro's sword was swung towards his arm. Attempting to initiate a sword clash, by swinging his blade against Ikaro's own, and holding it there. As he spoke "Who knows, But that's an interesting blade you have there." He stated, smiling sheepishly, as he attempted to apply pressure to Ikaro's sword had he managed to hold it there, but he felt the numbness of his leg taking full effect as he spoke:

"I wish there were more like you, Very few can interest me in a spar." He commented, he seemed to be having a lot of fun.* - Mon Aug 31 13:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) smiled a bit as he spoke "Very Fitting.." He stated as he slowly moved to resheathe his blade as Ikaro withdrew, Orakuru was probably going to lose. But next time he'd be prepared,  as he stated "My Blade is called..Chokuto." He didn't really have the knack for descriptions, but he shrugged, as he moved to take a seat. As he bowed his head: 

"Good Spar."* - Mon Aug 31 13:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) followed her, something in his eyes, was a bit darker, maybe a part of himself was lost as he spoke "My cover was blown."* - Mon Aug 31 17:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) looked up to the sky, as he sighed  "I rolled a Die."* - Mon Aug 31 17:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) approached the gate, hands in his pockets, as his eyes shifted to look at Mukade. His coal-black eyes examined her from head to toe, as he took a deep breath, "Mukade-san.." He stated, in a terribly dull voice, he didn't say much, but his entire body seemed like it was gearing for a battle his gaze raised until he was looking into her eyes. There was something cold in his gaze, almost pitying Mukade for some scenario which was previously unknown.* - Mon Aug 31 21:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) raised his hands to his mouth breathing into his palms, as he looked up towards the sky, almost ignoring what she stated "It's pretty chilly this time of year isn't it?" He stated, his gaze lowering til he looked back at her, he heard his name stated, "Neal, huh?" He mumbled under his breath, for whatever reason, Mukade was one of the few people he genuinely felt something towards, some comradery of sorts. But he knew what was going to happen was inevitable. 

"I've come, to give you a way out....Walk out of the Village and don't look back. Forget about Zetsumo...Start over. Mukade-san." He stated, he knew she wouldn't take this chance. But he felt the need to offer it.* - Mon Aug 31 21:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly dropped his hands to his side, as he spoke "I see, that attitude...Is Commendable...Or do I pity it?" He paused as he looked over to the side for a bit, before focusing back on her as he began walking forward. "I can't tell." Much like her his eyes had shown him one of the many possible futures, one which disgusted him, as he sat beside her corpse, after all was said and done. He felt regret creeping into his senses "Is this really the path that must be taken?" He thought to himself.

As he stopped quite a bit closer, as he looked at her, "You...Gave me my name, Mukade-san, And for that I will never forget you...And I can never truly hate you."* - Mon Aug 31 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) in this moment, his eyes showed sadness as he heard Mukade's words he simply spoke "Thank you, Mukade. I wish I could've met you long ago, I feel like we could've been friends." He stated, as he looked into his eyes, his eyes slowly beginning to change the blackness in his eyes beginning to slowly deterriate like a virus, as a blood-red color took over his eyes. He focused on her, and the bugs she had sent out. 

"It saddens me...This day had to come." 

He stated, as his hands were raised, his chakra flooding the area, as he aimed to make a arena around them, made of flames. Which trapped them both within a confined Area. "No matter what happens, I won't think differently of you. You will always be the one who gave me a name, Someone I think of as a comrade. Someone....I respect."* - Mon Aug 31 21:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) his eyes seemed to focus on all the current Chakra signatures appearing around Mukade, and immediately his hand reached for the hilt of his Katana, with a single motion his fingers were curled around the hilt of his Katana and flames started to bleed from the sheath as the blade was removed, with a swift motion his blade, was swung Horizontally, the flames seemed to envelope his blade, spiraling what seemed to be out of control, as they were expelled in a large arc towards the bugs, and clones which were sent at him.

His intent was obviously to incinerate the obstacles before him, the flames were hot, almost too hot as they were sent towards the targets. In the chance that the Clone wasn't eliminated by such a strike the male would attempt to Pivot to the side, hoping to avoid the initial kick by turning his body sideways. Which subsequently would hopefully allow him to dodge the foot aimed at his groin. He took a deep breath and inhaled

"This isn't my ally...This isn't my friend...It's an enemy.." He thought to himself, as he tried to get his head in the game he couldn't play any longer he had to focus on the fight, Mukade wasn't holding back...She wasn't playing games so neither could he.* - Mon Aug 31 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) went wide-eyed as he was kicked in the nuts, after being knocked back by the bugs, he would've fell forward if he didn't see the kick comming for his neck. And immediately his hands were raised over his face and neck region, aiming to block the kick. But he was knocked back, hitting the gorund, with a thud. "S-Shit..."He mumbled, he shouldn't have underestimated Mukade...That'd be bad, definately. Man did his junk hurt...

He couldn't focus on that, or he'd die, he was definately off balance, and would be for a bit longer. "Focus..." He told himself, as he aimed to quickly get to his feet. A bit wobbily though, as his left hand was raised to his side, chakra beginning to flourish in his palm, before it was sent forward, first at the clone which had kicked him.

It's intent was to cause an explosion which would iginite the clone in flames,  he had to focus...He'd die if he didn't his Scarlet Cursed eyes focused on those before him..."I won't...Die.....I can't."* - Mon Aug 31 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath, as he felt the bugs attempting to latch onto his flesh and noticed something appear beneath him. He felt pain radiate through his ankle, as he screamed out, and had he not been losing this fight by a lot, he would've never tried this, but he stumbled backwards into his own flames. Aiming to ignite the bugs on his body, and hopefully deal damage to the summoning which latched onto his leg. 

Had he succeeded, he'd attempt to roll out of the fire, as his hands were bought together in a series of handseals, before he inhaled followed by a Deep exhale, as a giant ball of flames was released from his mouth aiming to engulf the remainder of the bugs which were currently at him, and continue onto it's path onto Mukade.

He had suffered minor burns, which stung, but not crippling and he was in a difficult position here, he had to get his head in the game, or he would die. He couldn't allow himself to have his mind clouded by his emotions...He needed to setup an adequate strategy to take care of Mukade. * - Mon Aug 31 23:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) was regretting his decision more and more now, which kind of annoyed him, this was getting problematic, as he reached for his tanto once again. Before attempting to drive it down into the body of the Summoning which latched onto his ankle, which had without a doubt become a a hindrance, and he felt the venom making it's way through his body. he definately had a problem here.  He was taking a lot of damage and dishing out none, But regardless, had he suceeded.

His Chokuto had been swung Horizontally expelling a wave of fire aimed at enveloping the  bugs which had swarmed behind him and to the south. After making the swing, he began to run south, albeit a bit slower,  he was lacking definately (-2 tiles) as he aimed to create a bit of distance between him and Mukade, noticing she came out from the wall, at least he thought she did...He was getting screwed royally.* - Mon Aug 31 23:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) decided he needed to stop wasting chakra when it wasn't neccessary...He had ninja Tools for a reason, as he reached for his holster quickly he gathered four Kunai laced with tags. As he stayed on the move not hesitating for a moment, before launching each of the Kunai towards a determined Target,   Mukade's Clone,  And the spindles in the three Cardinal directions, before making a single seal, aiming to cause an explosion which would engulf the targets in flames hopefully burning some of the bugs.

He didn't slow down at all he couldn't it'd definately be stupid if he did but imemdiately as he did this his hands were raised together in a quick succession of handseals, before he bit his thumb, drawing blood, before slamming it to the ground allowing his chakra to spiral outwards into that of a seal as a large bulky Golem began to emerge from the ground where he last stood. Immediately the boy took cover behind the Golem.

"My leg..." 

He stated, he knew this wasn't the best idea, but taking his tanto, he ran it along his ankle, aiming to draw blood attempting to bleed himself, and draw some of the venom out to reduce swelling.* - Mon Aug 31 23:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) decided to back off, he wasn't playing this smart, he was being clumsy, and fumbling around since he didn't actually desire to kill her...But she'd definately be an obstacle he had to overcome, but for now his hands were raised to chest level, making a single seal he attempted to flee the area, through the usage of Shunshin had he succeeded he'd learn from his failure and work towards doing better the next time around.* - Mon Aug 31 23:56:22 2015

Immediately afterwards, he pulled back, and his punch was sent towards Kitora's Stomach aiming to cause her to double over.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) moves to take a seat beside Osamu "Tell me about yourself."* - Tue Sep 01 13:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) nodded his head as he listened to Osamu's words, looking up towards the sky as he relaxed on the bench a single hand was ushered through his hair, as he moved to crack his knuckles. He sighed briefly such a sad story, had he been stronger he would've tried to Save Smith since he was there, he would've tried to help him or free him...But he wasn't strong he still wasn't and that was the price he paid for weakness, he nodded his head ever so slightly.

Before a single hand moved across his cheek, as he finally spoke "That's truly sad...I wish someone would've helped him.." He stated with a gentle sigh, as he moved to rub his own leg. He needed to get it healed soon or risk infection, but for now he had it cleverly hidden away.* - Tue Sep 01 14:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly sighed as he heard Osamu's words, he had definately anticipated his knowledge at least minorly so. But it didn't exactly change the fact it was annoying he had to wait for Dravae to get healed anyway. So he yawned, cracking his knuckles,  as he continued rubbing his leg.* - Tue Sep 01 14:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: You got some burns and were bit, weren't you? - Tue Sep 01 14:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) nods his head "Thanks Dravae." He stated as he was healed testing his leg with a few hops.* - Tue Sep 01 17:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly sighed as he made a series of five handseals, before raising his thumb to his lips biting it and drawing blood before slamming it to the ground in which case, a large Golem made of Rock, would begin to emerge from the ground, into a Humanoid form which began heading towards the Gate.* - Wed Sep 02 20:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Before we begin are you -sure- you don't want to talk to Zeno?) - Wed Sep 02 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: He just stated you guys only have 1k troops total.) - Wed Sep 02 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (He said we had 2k - Wed Sep 02 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (I can screenie too - Wed Sep 02 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) watched as Zetsumo prepared his attack, and instinctively he lept to the side, onto the lower platform, as he decided to take his perch there alongside his summoning. Which had begun the process of forming boulders out of the parts that composed the rock, immediately it lifted a single arm. Before launching it forward aimed at some of the troops which were located around the ground more specifically towards Roki's section. Meanwhile, Orakuru, simply sighed, this would be a difficult battle.

Slowly he opened his eyes as he looked down at those before him, his eyes slowly lit up a Scarlet hue, as he watched the battle before him, he had to pick off, some of the fodder, at least so they wouldn't be a hassle when they were needed. But he sighed, reaching for the hilt of his Katana as he prepared to get into action, and dive into the heat of the battle.* - Wed Sep 02 21:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) simply sighed, as the  Grudges attacked the Golem, he saw it begin breaking apart but it began reforming after losing one of it's arms, immediately a boulder was shot towards the Lightning Grudge's face. As Neal lept off of the wall, using the Suimen technique as he slid down the side, at a somewhat fast speed before touching the ground before shin, he stared at the male and simply stated:

"Run away...I don't want to kill you. But if you take a step forward, your life is forfeit."

The male warned, his scarlet iris stared at the male, as his hand moved for the hilt of his Katana.* - Wed Sep 02 22:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) surprisingly seemed exceptionally calm as the Genjutsu took root as he simply spoke "I admire your efforts...But, If you continue....I'll take your left arm." As he kicked off his hind leg, despite understanding this was a Genjutsu, or a clone technique, he seemed virtually uncaring of his surrounding opponents. He kicked off his hind leg, and simply darted towards, Shin. Appearing before the male, as he weaved through the clones, a balled fist being sent towards Shin's stomach.

Immediately afterword had, he kicked, with a slight pivot of his body, and a leap off of his feet, his leg was bought around aimed at sending a kick towards the male who'd probably be doubled over by the initial attack had it hit. Aiming to knock him off to the side and render him unconcious, despite being obviously pissed he had no actual need to kill this boy. He had no problems for someone loyal to Zetsumo in fact he admired such qualities.* - Wed Sep 02 23:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) wonders if the Grudges drank Sake and offered them a bottle.* - Thu Sep 03 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly looked towards the Grudges and without hesitation, he kicked off his back foot, and began sprinting South he was not about to get caught out there. Hell to the no, He knew that would be a pointless battle, to fight them all alone, he valued his life at least somewhat, at least enough not to throw it away over some stupid problem. He wasn't fleeing the battle only this specific area.* - Thu Sep 03 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath as he noticed Katsune resurfacing, and immediately was unflowing with mixed emotions he didn't know how to respond...It was far beyond his current capacity. His fist balled, but immediately his gaze Shifted to Kitora, and the Grudges keeping Katsune in his sights, he was wondering who was his enemy and who was his allies...Maybe he was ultimately his biggest enemy...He wasn't sure.* - Thu Sep 03 01:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) examined Katsune's face, with his Scarlet eyes for but a moment, as he closed his eyes looked towards the ground for a moment as he noticed Kronos on the ground...Practically pinned up by spears. He went wide eyed, His fists clenched so hard his nails speared into his hands "....Kronos..." He stated, as he looked towards thise around him, "This is the world, we've bought into existence....This is the Game we play....The risks we take.." He mumbled to himself. 

His fingers curled around the hilt of his Chokuto as he looked to Katsune "This game, I refuse...To play it any longer...Friendships? Love? Comradery? Hah, Bullshit." He stated, as he removed his Chokuto from it's sheath, he didn't know what was comming over him, he felt his blood boiling, his heart felt like it would crush under some unseen pressure "This is pitiful...." He thought to himself.

He thought himself to be resolved, even in his own words, he found doubt, why was he being so emotional? He found it hard to think of killing anyone he knew, Was his own words true? Was Katsune's? Was he the fool? Or was he human? He didn't know, but the more he dipped into the darkness, he found out just how much he hated this world. It pitted friend against friend, this world was dark...In this moment.

He realised to achieve true peace, would be to wipe out every living thing on this planet, but deep down..."Do I really want peace?..." He enjoyed this darkness, it added excitement, a twist, a deep pleasure, he desired to be hurt and to hurt...Instinctual? No....Primal. He couldn't tell, did he care for anyone truly? He wasn't sure...Love? He didn't care any longer. Or maybe that was just what he told himself to cling onto what little sanity...Self-worth he had as a Human.

He was Fragile, unbelievably so, that he had to lie to himself to keep himself from breaking away.* - Thu Sep 03 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) shook his head  "I'm stupid." He realised he was letting his emotions cloud his judgement, he understand what she said, and for that reason he had to play this smart...He couldn't die, at least not if he wanted a proper answer, he slapped himself back to proper sense, and sheathe his blade, his mind seemed...Less clouded. He was an idiot that was for sure, he wasn't about to get worked by two Grudges Either. So he made it his bussiness to get some room between them.

Shifting his gaze to Zetsumo briefly followed by back to Katsune.* - Thu Sep 03 01:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) watched Katsune leave, somewhat happy she survived the battle. So had he...Surprisingly...But he looked towards, the currently mutated boy, "This is going to be a pain in the ass.." He felt fear surging through his veins, his entire body told him to run "I'm going to die here.." He told himself, as he raced to Tethys' and Chiyari "What the hell?" He asked, his hand reaching for his blade as he look at the monster before him.

"We're dead." He thought to himself.* - Thu Sep 03 02:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Don't put yourself out there though. - Thu Sep 03 14:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Yeah, it's dangerous for me to be close to him.... - Thu Sep 03 14:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: But he keeps talking about... - Thu Sep 03 14:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Protecting his family, and its an ironic concept but he has enough manpower to take down Zetsumo's entire army. - Thu Sep 03 14:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: We have to make sure he doesn't survive this war. - Thu Sep 03 14:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Or next time Sunagakure won't have a leg to stand on. - Thu Sep 03 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Possibly. - Thu Sep 03 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I'm going to work on a few things for a bit.. Don't worry I don't plan to spek to Kumogakure until we need to. - Thu Sep 03 14:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) nods his head, offering his arm to her. "Let's go."* - Thu Sep 03 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) leads her to a Non-existent restaurant.* - Thu Sep 03 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly smiled, as he attempted to mess with her, by gently grabbing her hand attempting to interlock his fingers with her own. And lead her to a Restuarant where they could get some grub.* - Thu Sep 03 16:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) pouted a bit seems he wouldn't get to mess with her as he intended but regardless, he decided to take a seat across from her, as he smiled warmly before asking "Are you originally from Sunagakure, Ishizu-san?"* - Thu Sep 03 16:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly yawned, as they sat he was a bit drained from yesterday afterall as he spoke "I suppose it doe---" He was cut off by her speaking, at least he had initiated a conversation, as he listened to her words, he slowly spoke "I'm not, I'm from a small Settlement in the Land of Iron." He stated lightly, as Ishizu ordered for him he didn't quite mind, he probably would've gotten the same anyway.* - Thu Sep 03 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) scratched his cheek, as he spoke "Most people haven't heard of it, Hana no Mura.." He stated, as he explained "Yeah it's North East, It's a Village of Botanist, A small population of roughly thirty." He stated with a light sigh, as the waiter returned with their drinks, he took a sip of his water.* - Thu Sep 03 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) contemplated what she asked, "I'm the leader more or less, Or was til I stepped down." He stated,  attempting to look into the woman's eyes and study her facial expression momentarily, before looking down at his water.* - Thu Sep 03 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) thought about what she asked, as he simply spoke "Sevent---Er..Eighteen... And of Sunagakure. It was kind of a funny story how I ended up there." He admitted, with a light laugh, drinking a bit more of his water, before swirling it around in the glass.* - Thu Sep 03 17:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) shrug, "I find it hard to believe as well, but I was in Kumogakure one day. The Raikage used to control Sunagakure as you'd know, he governed over it, and litterally he told me 'You're the new Kazekage, I refuse to deal with that shit village'. Sent a bird to Sunagakure, and Wah-la, I'm the New Kazekage. I didn't want to be a Kage, so I stepped down almost immediately." Definately sounded far-fetched, but if she cared to inquire it was true.* - Thu Sep 03 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) shook his head, "Not at all, Before I stepped down, I bought about Two Thousand Troops with me, and gave the title to someone more competent...A 'Private Project..' if you want to think of it like that."* - Thu Sep 03 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) yawns a bit "Maybe I'm just a little bit of Both." He stated, finishing his glass of water. As he spoke "Ultimately, I probably should be, But like you said. I'm -way- to lazy. And a Hot-shot deserves some breaks am, I right?"* - Thu Sep 03 17:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) smiles a bit as he contemplated "Desert, sounds tempting, why don't we skip?" He stated, before taking this moment to consider Ishizu's first statement "I did fight yesterday." He stated nodding his head, and he noticed Yan approaching the table in the restaurant as he spoke "Eh...Konoha, I'll explain more later."* - Thu Sep 03 17:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly shifted a curious gaze towards Ishizu as he spoke "I haven't, I've heard they're very good though." He stated, taking a knife he cut his cake into fourths, before using his chopsticks to break off a piece of the corner, before popping the treat into his mouth, he began chewing tasting the sweet paste-like substance which filled it as he spoke "Wow...It's pretty good."* - Thu Sep 03 18:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a another piece of the Moon Cake as he spoke "Pretty upfront about admitting you're going to stalk me aren't you~?" He toyed with her, lughing gently, as he spoke "But so be it, I can't garuntee you'll like what you see." He added in as a warning.* - Thu Sep 03 18:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) smiles a bit, as he relaxed in his chair "Then, I hope you don't regret your decision later." He stated, balancing himself on the leg of the chair as he looked at her "What do you want to do now?" He asked her gently, he seemed to be oddly calm despite having fought in his first war, honestly he was surprised but he didn't kill anybody, he rendered his opponents unconcious since they weren't directly his targets. But that was a conversation for another day.* - Thu Sep 03 18:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) looked towards Ishizu as she spoke "Hm...Medical Shinobi? Training with me?" He stated, weighing his options as he spoke "I'll take you up on that offer." He figured she had something planned so that was good, as he slowly dusted himself off, before cracking his knuckles that was definately good and he could use a work out.* - Thu Sep 03 18:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: We will talk about that when we can. - Thu Sep 03 20:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath and sighed as he carefully watched Ishizu, cracking his knuckles, as he watched her arm. He had briefly noticed the technique she was using or rather the device it was pretty peculiar, he found it interesting to say the least. So he was prepared, as he saw her Senbon flying at him, the male immediately darted to the side, exceptionally fast, one of the senbon managed to scratch his shoulder but didn't deal any serious damage so he was fine. But once he had dodged the first set, he took a deep breath looking towards Ishizu as he asked "You make that device yourself?"* - Thu Sep 03 21:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) was beginning to find Ishizu fairly interesting, he smiled subtly as he was a little taken back by her sudden sitting of Senbon, one finding itself lodged in his arm, but he immediately dove out of the way of the rest with a wince in pain, as he reached for the senbon and quickly tugged it out of his arm, tossing it off to the side, as another barrage came his way, he darted north, hoping to avoid the barrage of Senbon. "You're really something else, I don't know if I could've invented something like that. I'm pretty stupid."* - Thu Sep 03 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) ran a single hand through his hair as he spoke "Eh...Would you like to maybe learn another technique?" He asked, since it seemed like she was definately a one-trick charlie, of course he aimed to dodge, her attack by moving out of the way of it, but he thought learning another trick could greatly benefit her.* - Thu Sep 03 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) smiled a bit as he did in fact ease up, only to see her firing more senbon. He quickly moved, but still received several grazes. "Mean trick." He stated, rubbing his arms, as he noticed the small cuts and scratches that had developed. * - Thu Sep 03 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath as he contemplated what she was asking "Eh....Do you want to learn an elemental Ninjutsu by any chance?" He asked her, he had very limited things to teach her afterall. "And I'd appreciate that~" He stated in reference to her healing him.* - Thu Sep 03 22:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) looked at her as he asked "You sure know how to make a guy feel special." He stated, as he scratched his cheek nervously "What elemental affinity do you possess?"* - Thu Sep 03 22:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) seemingly vanished from his seat, appearing in front of Yan almost instantly. "I'd prefer someone who can keep up with my speed."* - Sat Sep 05 00:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whistles "Wait Fujitora the Husband of Kastya? I knew I knew that name." * - Sat Sep 05 00:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: How does a barrier around the village sound? - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: That sounds like an outstanding idea. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: After Zetsumo's last attack, everything is needed. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: But I wiill need someone else who is a fuuinjutsu specialist.. Aside myself, due to the effects of this barrier I will create.. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I will also need a unit of trap specilist. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) walks off and changes.* - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Because I have a lot of scrolls with many of my jutsu sealed off within them.. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) looked to the woman as he spoke "Oh he was here as far as I know." He stated, nodding his head to the woman.* - Sat Sep 05 00:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) walks over to Ushinawa, attempting to tap him on the shoulder to grab his attention.* - Sat Sep 05 01:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) waves casually he was not digging the Jounin uniform too much.* - Sat Sep 05 15:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) decided to crouch down, probably escorted by one or more Kumogakurian Shinobi he decided to simply watch and wait, not wishing to distrurb what was going on.* - Sat Sep 05 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took off like the flash, making a single handseal he aimed to utilize the shunshin technique to get as far away from the hazardous Zone as possible.* - Sat Sep 05 16:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Wha- I see... - Sat Sep 05 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: It's true, and since Konoha isn't backed by the Gezo. - Sat Sep 05 16:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Well, Zetsumo is smart... We can't le-.. I see.... - Sat Sep 05 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) blinked a bit, genuinely surprised by this Revelation "Oh, I see...It's a pleasure to make your aquantince." He stated, with a gentle bow of his head "The Mizukage told me to seek you out."* - Sun Sep 06 11:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Ushi. - Sun Sep 06 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Hm? - Sun Sep 06 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Care to do a bit of training? - Sun Sep 06 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I'm game. - Sun Sep 06 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) scoops up a bottle of Sake as he poured himself a glass, and slid Hiru a cup of water. "There's something important I wished to speak about...Especially since you have someone you care about."* - Sun Sep 06 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) takes a sip of a glass of Sake as he took a deep breath and sighed "This world...These comming days...Will be tough on us all...Some of us may not survive. But I've observed something....There's a driving force that is stronger, than Physical Strength, chakra, or Ninjutsu...And that is -Family-." He stated, gently setting his cup down, as his gaze moved to the ceiling.* - Sun Sep 06 13:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) looked down towards the murky liquid known as Sake as he swirled it in his cup as he simply state "Family is a weakness, but it is also a strength which is unmatched. " He slowly proceeded to raise his glass to his lips, before tilting it back, as he stated "Ushinawa---No Hiru, You are my family. The people we've met along the way, are our family as well."* - Sun Sep 06 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) looked at him as he walked away as he simply stated "I'm not trying to Trim loose ends, I'm trying to embrace them...Hiru on this day, I wish to form a Clan, A family based not on blood but on bonds." He stated, standing finally as he took a deep breath and sighed, it was something that he wanted to do for a while now, and finally he had the strength and motivation to do so,he had something he wanted to fight for, and at this time more than ever, he wanted a family that would back him up.* - Sun Sep 06 13:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) yawns a bit as he slowly approached Nigen giving him a look "Are you one of Ushi's men?" He steaded, beginning to walk past him.* - Sun Sep 06 16:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) simply listened to Niklaus for a while, not saying much as he heard his story his facial expression remained forever unchanged. As he simply stated, "I see...a sad story.." He stated, simply sighing, as he was beginning to pity the man known as Nikluas a man who once called himself a Kage, he felt like the man himself was simply broken. The story he heard, sent chills down his spine, how could one so easily turn against family? 

He wasn't sure, but either way, he shook his head, as he looked at each of the coffin as he spoke "I wonder if you'll be burried here as well." He simply stated, looking Niklaus in his eyes, his expression was cold but not judgemental, he looked like a man on a mission, he had a purpose for being here, he was like a man resolved to kill.

But honestly, he seemed extremely lax in this moment, as he simply stated "You remember, when we first met? You told me to come at you. I told you next time, but I figured, If I'm to die on this battlefield this very day, I'll give you peace as well Niklaus. I'll give you the battle you requested, but unlike before, I don't have the leisure of time." He warned in advance.* - Sun Sep 06 17:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) simply sighed as he raised a hand and caught the Kunai beautifully in his hand, as his eyes began to glow a subtle scarlet color developing a single tomoe, as his gaze settled on Niklaus as he simply said "Three minutes, is all the time I can give you." He warned in advance, as he sheathed the Kunai momentarily, before his hands were raised to chest level, he considered Niklaus to be a worthy opponent, that he'd unveil his newest technique to him, and as such.

He completed the series of handseals, before his thumb was raised to his mouth, biting down, he pricked his thumb, as he lept backwards, his finger slamming upon the ground as a seal appeared, within a moment the ground exploded, and a large Earth Golem appeared from the ground, within seconds Flames exploded from around his person, he gave himself a time limit both on his life and on Niklaus.

He purposefully blew through almost Fifty percent of his chakra in one go.* - Sun Sep 06 17:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath as he saw Niklaus approaching him, immediately he kicked off his hind leg, as Niklaus aimed to approach him, and moved to propel himself North, as the Golem took aim at Niklaus and began sending balls of fire towards the male as he chased Orakuru, he had aimed to avoid Niklaus Tsuga or cause him to veer off course to avoid the flames... If he was able to, meanwhile, his hand shifted for the hilt of his blade. As his Scarlet eyes took focus on Niklaus.

"This should be fun."

He stated aloud, pulling the Katana from it's hilt, as he held it up. Bearing the tip towards Niklaus,  he'd have to use the Dagger after the fight was over now, he couldn't risk dying here by using an unfamiliar weapon against a lethal enemy.* - Sun Sep 06 18:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) surprisingly enough he was -extremely- fast, probably nearing if not surpasing Niklaus speed by a bit, since he was sporting that beautiful 19.4 speed.  But as he ran, he began gathering chakra into his hand, before he extended his palm behind him while keeping pace, as he released a ball of fire aimed at the quickly approaching Niklaus, if it connected it'd explode, and potentially light the man ablaze. But the speedster, was simply toying around currently. This would be all kinds of fun, but the golem found itself moving forward opening it's mouth, it released a steady torrent of flames aimed at Niklaus.

Aimed at either engulfing him or the forest around the both of them, Orakuru didn't seem remotely alarmed by this revelation, as the golem began running towards Niklaus' position, though due to it's size it was moving at only about twelve feet every thirty seconds. Orakuru tightened his grip on his blade, these thirty seconds seemed like they'd be hell. But he was a man of his words, if Niklaus couldn't kill him in thirty seconds, he'd do the same onto Niklaus.* - Sun Sep 06 18:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) smiled a bit as he noticed Niklaus approaching him, and immediately he tossed his Katana into the air, his hands swiftly shot together in a single handseal, the young boy vanished...Expertly from his position, dissappearing, less than a second later, he appeared above Niklaus. His hand reached for the hilt of his blade, and within that same second, his fingers curled around it, before being thrusted downwards. Aimed at the center of Niklaus' back, he aimed to drive his blade through his spine.

A blade of Kusangi, combined with Orakuru's downwards force and momentum, aimed to catch Niklaus out of his spin with astonishing physical force and piercing damage, he tried to pin him down to the ground beneath the two of them. Had he succeeded, the attack itself wasn't immediately life threatening but was aimed at removing Niklaus' ability to walk by severing his spine at the base, within minutes he would die unless given some motivation beforehand.

He hoped his strike had succeeded, three minutes had passed, and he was a man of his word, he'd aim to finish this with a single attack, his first offensive strike of this fight. "It has...Been a great pleasure." He stated lightly. His scarlet eyes resting upon Niklaus, as he took a deep breath.* - Sun Sep 06 18:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) withdrew his bloody blade from Niklaus' back, as he simply stated, "I see, but I haven't fulfilled my end of the bargin." He stated, as he reached for Niklaus' dagger, he held it in his hand, as he moved to flip the now incapaciated near-death male, onto his back, as he simply stated "Niklaus Mikaelson, I give you mercy." He stated, as he held the blade up over Niklaus' chest, staring him in his eyes, he held the eyes of the Devil. He took a deep breath, before the dagger was driven into the man's chest.

Aiming at piercing his heart with a final motion, as he simply stated "But I can't lay you to rest, It isn't your time to rest peacefully....Even in your Death you will work into my hands." He simply stated, leaving the dagger where it was, as he simply did a quick run through of Niklaus' Pockets, taking any cash, or any valuables, in case he was discovered before he was finished, at the very least it'd look like a mugging gone wrong.

Mugging a Kage--Amiright?  Regardless, after he did so, the male slowly began to head into town, buying a lot of ice, before he placed Niklaus' body on ice preserving it in the coffin. He'd keep this place in his mind...He'd need Niklaus' body once again, he figured this would be fun in the near future.* - Sun Sep 06 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly arrived back into  Sunagakure with a slight sigh, he looked to see there was a ruckus going on centered around  Ushinawa he opened his mouth, as he stared forward "What is going on?" The irritation began to rise in his voice, as he saw Ushinawa in an apparent fight with who? He wasn't sure exactly, but he felt his irritation mounting by the moment. He wanted answers and he wanted them yesterday, or someone was about to lose a head.* - Sun Sep 06 19:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) felt his anger and annoyance visibly rising as he took a step forward , pushing past the herd of Genin as he approached Chiyari "What is going on?" He demanded to know, his eyes shifting to Chiyari and to the Tethys and Ushinawa duo. He seemed to be extra ticked off currently, as he stepped forward.* - Sun Sep 06 19:40:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) slowly appeared beside Niza atop the wall, as he simply took a brief assessment of the area before him, his eyes turned a blood red color as he surveyed the fighting below him blade against blade, dead bodies scattered around, the five elements clashed men and women screamed. They were fighting for their lives "This is war..." He thought to himself, taking a deep breath, as he raised his hands to chest level, beginning to weave a series of handseals, as his finger was raised to his mouth.

He bit down upon his finger, before slamming it against the base of the gate, and immediately a gigantic golem composed of rock appeared atop of the wall, releasing a blood curdling roar, as the male simply stated "Jinga, lay down suppressive fire." He stated, as the golem began to conjure large Basketball sized rocks, before launching them at the Amegakure Shinobi. The force simply stunning.

Meanwhile, Neal slowly began straightening the straps of his new armor. "This should be...A good work out.." He stated, licking his lips. His Scarlet gaze scanning the forces below for any familiar faces. "This won't be the end...It is only the beginning." He stated lightly.* - Sun Sep 06 21:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath as his Golem took notice of a flying Zetsumo, and immediately sent a large boulder shooting towards the male at an accelerated pace. Aiming to drop him from the sky, but we all know that wasn't exactly plausible, regardless, the young male took a deep breath having noticed a few officers appear on the field, his Scarlet eyes shot to each person, scanning their individual chakra slowly his hands were raised together, as he began to weave a set of handseals.

Before raising two fingers to the side of his mouth, as he took aim at the Beth and Yumiko combo, exhaling a massive ball of fire, which aimed at enveloping the two of them unless stopped, he didn't hold back a bit, he was obviously aiming to kill them both,  slowly he reached for his Katana, cracking his neck, as he prepared to take off and engage them up close had his initial attack failed.* - Sun Sep 06 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) || Honestly wasn't about that noise, so he immediately began to move, deciding it best not to stay in one spot, he moved across the battlefield with ease, leaping over bodies and anything which may've impede his progress while not slowing down, as he then aimed to use  Suimen to walk along the walls in which case, he set his eyes on the battlefield assuming he dodged all incomming attacks that's.* - Sun Sep 06 22:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) abandons the fight why am I fighting with sandy niggas?* - Sun Sep 06 23:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath as he spoke "This is a war, This is a battle for my way of life. I don't care for the future, I don't care for peace. This is a game, and if I'm playing it. I'm going to go big or go home."He stated, as his hands contorted together in a series of handseals, as he spoke "Let it burn." As he bit his thumb slamming it against the ground, as the ground erupted in flames around his point of contact. The ground began to bulge before a large Earthern Creature covered in flames appeared "Jing V2, Give them hell." He stated, as the Golem conjured up, balls of earth in either hands, covered in flames.

The balls were immeduately launched at Zetsumo's bird, with an astonishing amount of force, aiming to take out the bird where it stood. Shaking his head, he looked to Niza, Orakuru himself wasn't scot free and had taken minor burns as he stood before the Kazekage "Carry him to the Medic Division, I'll defend you guys." He stated, as Troops began to run to Niza's aid, aiming to carry gim off.* - Sun Sep 06 23:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) ||Katsune's lightningball does some damage to the Golem but it doesn't seem like it'd be easily destroyed by such an attack, and as the water hit it it's flames begin to die down before being dispersed, and the lightning sparks around it's person. And slowly it begins breaking down, and Orakuru got an idea, if he was going to die, he was taking as many of Zetsumo's followers with him. And that was simple. This war originally started over him, and if it did why should he flee?

He didn't know why, but deep down he found himself resisting the urge to flee, and he charged forward, with an astonishing pace, approaching the Trio of Kitora, Yumiko, And Katsune, as his hand moved to draw his Katana from it's sheath as he approached the women quickly.* - Mon Sep 07 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) took a deep breath as he noticed everyone beginning to move into his line of sight as he spoke "I'm tired of this." Simultaneously his blade was bought around in an arc, aimed at Catching Yumiko along the center of her back, and Kitora's face as they moved respectfully. His slash was almost blinding, and as it moved, the blade ignited with flames, before expelling a extremely hot blast of fire towards them, aiming to take both of the women out. He held absolutely no bars, and he didn't stop with that initial movement.

Not once did he actually stop his momentum, his Scarlet eyes scanned those around him, and had he finished those two, or at least left them injured and unable to battle, he'd run forward once more his eyes setting upon Katsune for a momentum his hand seemed to grasp the hilt of his Blade tighter. Regardless of the Mask sending out it's torent of water, in combination with the flames, and the overhead shadow caused by the water.

Would most likely obscure the shadows made around him, even if it didn't the fire which was expelled if to slow to hit Kitora before being released would most likely collide with that of the water creating a steam which would obscure both of their sights, leaving Orakuru's movements to be conducted in 'secrecy'.* - Mon Sep 07 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) blinked as he noticed Katsune's attack towards him, and immediately he moved to raise his arms to block, the lightning. He was expecting it, but part of him didn't want to move, part of him wanted to, and that hesitation in his mind, allowed him to simply get hit, the lightning striked him, without a doubt, had he not been wearing armor, he'd been killed by that attack but he suffered a few broken ribs, only to be tackled by the Mask, pinning him to the ground beneath it's weight. Forcing him to lay upon his already broken ribs, he screamed out in agonizing pain. Unable to focus, but he wasn't dead, probably captured.* - Mon Sep 07 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) felt Zetsumo's threads wrapping around his neck, and slowly sighed, as he closed his eyes, he looked up to Katsune for the briefest of moments before closing his eyes once again and relaxing he was dead, there was no if ands or buts, he had messed up and unfortunately he wouldn't be allowed a redo, he died. This was his game over, and he didn't resist, in this battle he was simply another casuality someone who did something wrong...Strayed to close to the sun and got burned.

That was fine, as he drew his final breath, he didn't think of those he'd left behind, but those he'd finally be reunited with, his family that had died, the friends he had begun to think of the stories he'd tell them, and the stories he'd be able to hear from those who didn't have the time to tell them before. He just hoped, that no one would miss him, in an odd way not being mourned would comfort him.

And finally his body relaxed, his mind drifted off to a better place, he was no longer among the living, but collaborated with the Dead.* - Mon Sep 07 02:18:52 2015
