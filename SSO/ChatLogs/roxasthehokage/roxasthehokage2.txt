<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) started in a downward motion floating off her fan and biteing into her tumb and spreading a line of blood across her fan! She would swing it in a sudden and brutal fashion. What would be produced would be nothing short of a savage burst of tornado based wind! A weasle weilding a sickle could be seen within! 

"Wind Style! Quick Beheading Sickle weasle Technique!"

A tornado of bladed wind would shoot down, expanding at an alarming rate to target Rymei! The fan she had swung would be glowing as it empowered the jutsu! Her blazeing red eyes hidden behind the tinted goggles she wore! The blast would interupt the incoming strike, and since it was contorled by the sickle weasle within, would not do any damage to Ryomen past sending him flying away! 

(37.1 Con + 41.66 Nin = 78.76 (rounded up 79) +5 from the boost from the fan +15 from the summoning included in the jutsu for a totoal of 99 Damage )* - Wed Nov 25 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) blinked as her body was seemingly instantly surrounded in a cage that was closeing in on her in a heir's breath. She growled in anger as her eyes blared to life red behind the tiinted goggles she wore! She would swing her fan once more! The blood still upon the fan causeing it to once more react as a catlyst upon the fan! If not, it would be a simple matter of applying more with a quick swipe of her hand! She would swing her fan once more!  This time the sickle weasle would produce a chaotic vortex of wind aimed to try and destory the object called bloody mary she was now within! Should this work out, the wind would also propell her out of the wreackage toward her home village of Sunagalure, should it be possible!

The wind from earlier no longer desginated Ryomon's body as an ally, as the sickle weasle within the storm could clearly see his head was nothing more then pulp now. The jutsu, whice would usually be used to take down whole forests, was pin pointed on the area around Rymei. It would cleave through the dead boys body, her sword and her armor, leaveing her with minor damage to the area's defended, but her legs would remain mostly undefended! * - Thu Nov 26 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) whispers: (HEY Tethys, Can you grant me My Quick beheading dance? If I give you the jutsu descrip and it's rank and jutsu cost Via Skype? ) - Thu Nov 26 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) was flung away from the bloody mary, but quickly recovered, Landing upon her fan and shiftting her direction to get a better look at the battler field. She would fly back towards Rymei and Edge. Once within range she would flip off her fan, taking advantage of the fact Edge was now holding onto Rymei. She would once more swing her fan, slathering another run of blood along the fan's surface as the swinging took place. She would, once more produce a great malestrom of wind from her weapon, the sickle weasle within once more apperent. The result would be to try and keep edge on the defensive! Her body remained tense, as after the swing she would attempt to return to her fan and shoot back farther into the air!* - Thu Nov 26 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) watched as Sanoke rushed by, man that dude could run! She would fill him in on the loss of Aza and Ryomen as she flew to keep up with him avoiding the rashomon summoning in the air! She would offer support in the form of earth style from upon her fan! 

If she was able to keep up with him and the escaping ninja's, she would put her plan into action. Forming a series of handsigns intended to erect a wall of earth up and around edge and Rhymie without hindering Sanoke's intended attack! If she was unable to do so, she would not cast any jutsu, not wanting to hinder Sanoke's line of attak! * - Thu Nov 26 01:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) landed upon the ground next to Sanoke, but she kept her hand on the fan she always wore. She would nod back to Sanoke. She was not a hero anymore, she had been to slow to save Ryomen. This had caused her a fair amount of internal strife, but it was as always pushed away for later. She would let Sanoke have his words with the man called edge, but she was going to risk her life on making sure he did not escape. She would show no mercy, her heart beating with the anger usually reserved exclusivly for Index and Katsune.* - Thu Nov 26 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You cannot build without a foundation. To build, one must destroy. - Thu Nov 26 02:08:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Callous, rough, and yearning they will be. - Thu Nov 26 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) inhaled deeeply and then exhaled softly. She would form a series of handsigns then inhaled deeply once more. She had once stood where Sanoke had stood, but being with the Gezo had changed her, seemingly without her even noticing she had changed. She had to complete her mission, acomplish her goals. The anger in her heart raged agasint the old her, and eventually won out. Edge would be another stone on her path toward her goal of Katsune and index. 

She would then throw her head forward and unleash a series of small marble sized spheres! The power behind the jutsu on a higher level of leathality then most of her jutsu. The amount of marble sized bullets was six All aimed for the man's chest in a tight pattern. She would hope to end him quickly, and give Sanoke the oppertunity to decide for himself weather or not he needed to be a god.* - Thu Nov 26 02:38:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marrisa(Roxas The Hokage) advanced upon the body, pulling free a solid green scroll that Trilliam had given her a long time ago. She would throw it open and Focus her chakra into it's surface. Her target? The body of edge she had just created. Should the containment seal allow it, she would seal up the body in it's confines. She would turn to look upon Sanoke, who had been looking where she had been. 

"I need the body, but if they eyes are what you want, I will give them to you freely."

this was of course off the assumption no one stopped her from her plan. She had a bounty to claim.* - Thu Nov 26 03:06:52 2015

"Good Bye"

Weather or not she managed to speak, she accepted her death. In a flash of motion she saw her family, friends, and others before her. All glareing at her. In death, she would meet with the shame of failing everyone she had made promises to. Her soul shattering upon entry to the next world. * - Thu Nov 26 04:01:29 2015
