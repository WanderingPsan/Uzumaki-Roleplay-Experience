<br><br><font color=yellow>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) took up the katana, pulling it from it's sheath, anyone with an eye for detail when it came to weapons would RAPIDLY notice that, though the sword was in fact quality, it was or avrage quility. Made to look much nicer in it's sheath then outside of it. 

The smith would hold the weapon weakly, it was clear he did not know how to handle the blade he had made.* - Fri Oct  9 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) laughed nervously, holding the blade before him in a cocky, one handed manner. 

"COME! FACE THE MIGHTY MAX! HOLD NOTHING BACK AS YOU TURN YOUR BLADE UPON MINE! SHOW ME YOUR TRUE POWER!"

He held the blade horozantaly now, outstreacthed and above his head, a clear inviation to strike the sword with all he had.* - Fri Oct  9 09:35:08 2015

The smith tried to react in time, swinging his sword to try and defelect the hat, of course, he litterally had no training in anyway shape or form with blade in his hands. He would likely miss completley, and likely take the hate like a professional bitch.* - Fri Oct  9 09:47:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Max(Roxas The Hokage) watched as the man moved like ninja's did, by that he meant faster then him by alot. He felt the clash resonate through his body. He could do nothing as hairline fractures rushed through the blade, the problom with making swords look better then they were visually, is the blade usually sacrificed in durability and practicality. The smith tried to utter a word, but was unable, as the already weakened blade was easily shattered by the rival swordsmith, cleaving through it easily, and likely the smith who held it. He had no training, and so what seemed to be a move most ninja with reflexive training could dodge, turned into a death sentance for the smith. The flameing sword cleaveing through the smith's body and clothing like the the lies he had been spun. The smith didn't even have time to utter a cry of pain before his life was over, crumpleing to the ground before fujitora, the smell of burnt cloth and skin lingering in the air.* - Fri Oct  9 09:59:02 2015
