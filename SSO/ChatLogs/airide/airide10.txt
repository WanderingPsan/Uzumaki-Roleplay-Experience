<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny too because he was right about that. - Thu Oct 22 18:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But no. He "had to do everything himself." Because we were incompetent. - Thu Oct 22 18:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He had no faith in us though. - Thu Oct 22 18:46:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. Good lies have as much truth as possible in them. I learned that when I was forced to learn....to keep Mukade and Zetsumo from punishing me all of the time. - Thu Oct 22 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lying is for amateurs. - Thu Oct 22 18:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) casually walked through one of the smaller puddles of blood before stepping in a slightly larger one before he eventually sat down next to her as instructed. "An example?"* - Thu Oct 22 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) crosses his arms as he witnessed the techique. "So their used for slicing tendons, which can probably be used in combat." He rubbed his chin a bit. "There's also something else I read up about while I was in Kumogakure."* - Thu Oct 22 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) scratches the back of his head. "My friend Misa showed me, but you expell a poison mist from your mouth."* - Thu Oct 22 21:18:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) cursed as he holds his hand over his mouth before letting out a muffled scream. He could feel the blood from within his body stream out before attempting to apply basic healing to his leg to at least stop the blood, of course he honestly couldn't complain since had some slight feeling as to how Zenaki operated ever since their trip down to the basement. "Shit."* - Thu Oct 22 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Dammit,. - Thu Oct 22 21:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) leers over at the girl before picking himself up after applying some sightly healing to his leg. He sighed after standing back up and sitting back down a bit further. 

"I'm a person, a medic, a student, you want more dumb answers, because I'm willing to provide."* - Thu Oct 22 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh you are a rude person. - Thu Oct 22 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) winced a bit at the pain in his side. "It's Reguel."* - Thu Oct 22 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I want the scrollback. - Thu Oct 22 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) takes the scroll in his hand. "Yeah, I will, it hsouldn't be this hard to master this one."* - Thu Oct 22 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) started down at the scroll he recieved from Zenaki before calmly placing it into his pockets. With a sigh he scratched the back of his head knowing how much time it was going to be in order for him to effectively learn such a skill in the short amount of time needed before the next Chuunin Exams arised. After returning towards the square he realized that Koji was also within the area. "Perfect." He stated as he tapped his foot against the ground before taking a running start.

Running the basics of the technique in his head he began to launch himself towards Koji, who was hopefully not expecting him to come flying from the side with a jump kick.* - Fri Oct 23 00:17:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hello, Koji. - Fri Oct 23 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) didn't notice the booger on his shirt at the time, but still. After stopping in his tracks a few feet away from Koji only made the genin more excited as he immidately attempted to follow up the attack by pulling back his sleeve to fire a total of three senbons towards Koji's direction from the mounted launcher on his wrist.

In the back of his mind he had another plan for if and when this attack would be evaded by Koji, of course this was only a slight sparring match.* - Fri Oct 23 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Yo. - Fri Oct 23 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Hrm. - Fri Oct 23 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) had taken the full blow of Koji's attack once again before getting sent a few meters back just like last time, only he wasn't immidately hit with iron sand clones, so this was a bit more tolarable than when he fought both Jiki and Koji, however it was still painful to endure. Landing on his back he cursed to himself as he slowly himself up to recall the hand seals he learned recently. "Tiger, Horse, Rabbit, Rat, Dog." He muttered to himself as he watched Koji's rotation start to slow down.  After witnessing this he excuted the jutsu after kneading the charka with handseals before a set of charka blades formed at the base of his hands.

Breathing heavily he gritted his teeth as he prepared for Koji to come at him, of course he was a bit tired after successfully excuting a jutsu he just learned, he just didn't know how long it would take for it to be sustained. "I'm ready!" He exclaimed as he waited for Koji to continue his assult.* - Fri Oct 23 01:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) grins as Koji came in close to him which was his intention to begen with. Now with his current strength he knew he couldn't best Koji in hand-to-hand combat, at least not yet as he wasn't well skilled in it yet. Once Koji was close enough he could attempt to fire a few senbon from his mouth, a tatic which he could not show off before because he was defeated rather easily.  

Now knowing Koji had a good sense of reflexes he knew he could easily deflect the senbon cming at him which was his plan. Next he would attempt to attack that Koji taught him. First he twisted his body so that it would appear like he was doing a high kick, which was merely a feint seeing that he had moved his leg towards the ground to create a Brazilian styled kick, next he used the momentum from the kick to launch his body into the air with the real kick aiming for Koji's chest, however this was alsoa feint, even if this landed he would still continue his actual attack he had planned. 

Moving in closer he would swipe his hands towards Koji's arm attempting to cut the tendon from within using his Charka Scaple, a feint within a feint is what he attempted to do.* - Fri Oct 23 01:30:27 2015

Now knowing Koji had a good sense of reflexes he knew he could easily deflect the senbon coming at him which was his plan. Almost immidately his plan fell apart as he took the full force of Koji's 64-palmed attack. At first his limbs only went numb then he felt his charka flow slow down before he was stricken in the chest by the final blow before being sent back. "Gaaah!" He roared as he landed on the ground before skitting across the sand once more. All of his limbs shook as he slowly stood himself up only to immidately fall back down to a single knee. "Dammit." He cursed as he struggled to stand up, which he was able to do, but he couldn't really perform the charka scapel technique as 'fluently' as he possibly good at the moment.

"Fine, then I'll just use taijutsu!" He roared as he charged in pursuit of Koji. Launching himself into the air he twisted his body to perform a high kick towards Koji's face before it immidately dipped towards his abdomen. Keeping his momentum he twisted his body once more to attempt to strike Koji's face with his other leg.* - Fri Oct 23 01:50:56 2015
