<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So you're that Fujitora fellow Ai-Kun mentioned.. - Wed Nov  4 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Greetings Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) arches an eyebrow as he walks forward. "Should I be somewhere else?" He stated while crossing his arms while tossing a quick glance over towardes Ketsuki, the other female between them before nodding towards her. "I have no where else to do that has...passible medics."* - Wed Nov  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'd figured you'd have went to go on a journey of some sorts. - Wed Nov  4 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighed as he watches the girl do rather reckless stuns before turning towards Kuro. "I want to leave, but I have stuff here I still need to do, I still need to study, My Taijutsu is lacking of course, my medical ninjutsu is lacking to me." He sighed before scratching the back of his head, of course he looke rather tired at this point. "I've been pulling all nighters trying to study."* - Wed Nov  4 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sorry about that, Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So, sup? - Wed Nov  4 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nothing much, and it's alright. - Wed Nov  4 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I thought you were a shinobi from Konoha, what brings you here? - Wed Nov  4 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Ah.. well.. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess you could say I fell in love, and well... I came by here to visit Ai-Kun for a while. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Thenn he proposed.. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So I guess I'll be here for a while before I head back to Konoha. - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) places his hand on the girl's chest before applying healing ninjutsu on her body. "Shut up and relax." He ordered as he leered at the girl before sighing. "You're awfully reckless, I assume I'll see you here soon once again." He stated as he removed his hands before looking down. "Hmph."* - Wed Nov  4 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We're not actually sure yet.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: He proposed, and I said yes, but we don't have a date.. as for being too young.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Well, I'm pretty much an adult- and.. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Shinobi have a habit of dying young. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess we're both sure enough about our feelings that we want to live while we can. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're one dumb adult. - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Eh? - Wed Nov  4 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Good for you. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I knew people like you. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Besides, it was good training. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Their dead now. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Huh? - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Eh? - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: People like me? What's that supposed to mean..?! - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It means what it means. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I think he's trying to say, take better care of yourself. - Wed Nov  4 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's better if a real battle never comes.. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Agreed. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmph. - Wed Nov  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Peace is always preferable- but it's not always possible. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's possible. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: People just don't believe it is. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It gives me more of a chance to operate on people. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sometimes, other people will just not let you live peacefully, or avoid battle. Even if you want to- sometimes, you can't. Because if you do..? - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: If you stand aside- often times, it can just let bad people do what they want, without contest. - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Because sadly, there are people in this world who wish others ill- who want to hurt others, for their own benefit. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And if you just stand aside and /let/ those people do what they want, you're just as guilty as they are. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That's what I believe, anyway. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I don't care. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And I wasn't talking to you. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're talking around me. - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yare Yare Daze.. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm sure Kuro wouldn't mind if I slice open your muscles. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: That a threat, then? - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: If you want to take it as a threat sure. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I mean, I'm not sure why else you would bring up slicing open my muscles. - Wed Nov  4 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Can we please stop arguing? - Wed Nov  4 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Who knows? - Wed Nov  4 06:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sounds good to me, Kuro. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) thinks: What an idiot. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And in this world, if you don't have power to back up your words, nothing will be done. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: If only Koeki didn't die. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Agreed... sadly. - Wed Nov  4 06:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's why, when I become the leader of the temple, I'm going to use my strength to spread peace. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Then again I was in Kumogakure so by then I probably couldn't get the training I needed. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Right now, I don't have enough strength. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Use strength.. to spread peace. - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're going to bring peace while beating someone's skull in? - Wed Nov  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: And how do yo uintend to do something like that..? - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's not the strength I'm referring to. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: He's a pacifist, if you haven't noticed. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I want the strength to protect. I want to be just like Yukio. He has the strength to protect his views. - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If I have enough strength, I can solve conflict without taking another's life. - Wed Nov  4 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Strength isn't only in physical prowess. Strength comes in different forms, courage, words, resolve.    - Wed Nov  4 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Will, spirit. Mhrm. - Wed Nov  4 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) rolls his eyes at the statement. "You know when I kicked you in the shin I thought you were going to at least be less of a pacifist." He muttered to himself before sighing. "At least fight a bit so you don't end up like Hideki." * - Wed Nov  4 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can only hope. - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In the case that words won't reach him, then I'll just stop him with my two hands.  - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Kuro, when I finish my training I might as well come with you. - Wed Nov  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Of course, I dont' mean taking his life. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That would be helpful. - Wed Nov  4 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: By the way, what do you two know about Edge so far? - Wed Nov  4 06:18:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What did he seem like? - Wed Nov  4 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: He's pretty odd. - Wed Nov  4 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How so? - Wed Nov  4 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well we had a breif conversation so I can't really tell you. - Wed Nov  4 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What made him feel odd? - Wed Nov  4 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Don't worry about it. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides it's been a while I'm surprised I still remember it. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh..Alright then. - Wed Nov  4 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) scratches the back of his head while he thought of the answer.

"Yes and no, we did exchange questions, he questioned me and I questioned him then he left, it was pretty much a boring conversation."* - Wed Nov  4 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: However looks can be decieving. - Wed Nov  4 06:31:40 2015

He stated as he rested himself with a quick breath. <"I need to master this in order to be useful."> He thought to himself as he reeled his fist back before channeling his charka into his right fish.

"Here it goes."

He stated as he placed his foot back and struck the air while feeling the weight of his fist traveling through the air. "Dammit." He rubbed his wrist before waving it around in circles.

He could tell that he was at least getting the hang of it, but he knew he couldn't really keep this up for so long, especially against someone like Mizora and Koji, so he would have to think of a way to forcibly place charka into his arms with a thin layer of charka circulating through his body.* - Sat Nov  7 03:02:11 2015

He closed his eyes as he centered his charka into a single point in his fist before striking the stone wall. He clenched his fist as he felt the wall shake under his fist before feeling the back of his hand shred in pain before he crumpled back holding his fist. "Dammit.."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) tapped his foot agains the sands before scratching the back of his head."Okay first off, what the hell is going on start from there." He stated before tapping his finger against his forearm, he was pretty demanding at this point, but why wouldn't he be he was getting shoved away from another situtation. Of course the answer was visible on his face and eyes.* - Sat Nov  7 03:35:28 2015

But, to be honest this is beyond a lot of humans. Koji would begin to say, "Reguel we have a dilemma and you seem to be well verse in the practice of peace I would rather not have Ai and Trilliam kill each other. Do you have suggestions on future actions? Also, we're going to need that sword for evidence of the Gezo attack, and research we want to prepare our Sunagakure troops for such an event should it occur again.
