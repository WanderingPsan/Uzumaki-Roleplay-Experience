<br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) scratches his head as he nonchalantly watched the the two shinobis on the ground. "Well this is troublesome, what should a Green horn genin like myself do?" He asked as he wondered over towards one of the shinobis before poking him. "Oi, you okay?"* - Wed Sep 30 04:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You know, if I wanted to I could crush your head in right now, but why would I do that? - Wed Sep 30 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides, I might as well be a medic, I don't know anyone else in Kumo who'd do it. - Wed Sep 30 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Considering our only medic got fucked up too.. - Wed Sep 30 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Wed Sep 30 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs a bit before dragging Hideki's arm over his neck. With a grunt he attempted to lift up the more broken person. If he was successful in picking the person up he would arm his hand around the person's waist to drag him towards a the upper part of the mansion.* - Wed Sep 30 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) beamed towards Hideki before walking over towards the other male. "You okay?" He asked before lightly tapping the other figure with his boot against the male's head. "Can you at least summon enough strength to move?" He questioned before slightly bending his knees to look down at the one who was from his village.* - Wed Sep 30 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) still held Hideki rather roughly. With a slight nod towards Mamoru's viger to stand. "Good good, now let's do something about this guy." He stated before he pushed himself up toward in a rather fast motion causing Hideki's limp body to jump up. "Whoops sorry." He started before tilting his head towards the weapon that laid at the scene of battle. "Do you want me to get your weapon as well?" * - Wed Sep 30 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So what are your names? - Wed Sep 30 05:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh. - Wed Sep 30 05:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well this is one way to wake up. - Wed Sep 30 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs as he sets the other male down ebfore he started to review the scrolls that were scattered around the area. Unrolling the scroll he started to study under his own merics he didn't really notice the other person in the area.* - Wed Sep 30 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) placed a finger near the scroll before shifting his eyes towards the male in the room. "Greetings." He stated before tapping his finger on the scroll. "And you are?"* - Wed Sep 30 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Kuro, and you? - Wed Sep 30 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Reguel. - Wed Sep 30 05:41:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I live here. - Wed Sep 30 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I suppose it's easy to miss people from time to time.  - Wed Sep 30 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Do you know someone named Misa? - Wed Sep 30 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Nope. - Wed Sep 30 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. What about Hideki? - Wed Sep 30 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I just met him and Mamoru. - Wed Sep 30 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How long was that? - Wed Sep 30 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Their both injured, Hideki more than Mamoru, but Mamoru has a rather bad jaw injury. - Wed Sep 30 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Also not that long. - Wed Sep 30 05:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I don't know. - Wed Sep 30 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: What did their injuries look like? - Wed Sep 30 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Mamoru had a jaw injury and Hideki felt like he had a few broken bones. - Wed Sep 30 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, he also had bruises all over his body. - Wed Sep 30 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I hope they didn't get themselves into any serious trouble. - Wed Sep 30 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Especially after the way Hideki has been lately. - Wed Sep 30 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: And that means? - Wed Sep 30 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He's in a dark place right now. - Wed Sep 30 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Explain. - Wed Sep 30 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A few days ago, we lost an individual who was close with a few of our shinobi. Some have taken a dark turn, others are still trying to find a way to cope. - Wed Sep 30 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I see. - Wed Sep 30 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hideki is one such who I fear may get himself harmed by losing his sense of rationality. - Wed Sep 30 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 30 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I just hope he sees how dangerous this path is that he's taking. - Wed Sep 30 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Why don't you tell him this? - Wed Sep 30 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I have, yet he's too deep. -repost- - Wed Sep 30 06:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ? - Wed Sep 30 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Nothing, it's just my opinion. - Wed Sep 30 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh. So, what do you do? - Wed Sep 30 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're a shinobi right? - Wed Sep 30 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm aiming to become a medic. - Wed Sep 30 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Sadly I never got to learn the basics so all I can really do is use senbons. - Wed Sep 30 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I know someone who is similar to you. - Wed Sep 30 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Do you? - Wed Sep 30 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yep. Well I know of two medics. Marianna and Misa. Not Ushinawa's sister Misa, the blonde haired Misa. - Wed Sep 30 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Marianna would be your best bet to learn from, since Misa is learning from her. - Wed Sep 30 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm alright. - Wed Sep 30 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm are the girls cute? - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess. They both are attractive. - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well that's good. - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Marianna is taken for. As for Misa, I'm not sure. - Wed Sep 30 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Eh, I'm not looking. - Wed Sep 30 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, I thought you were. - Wed Sep 30 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well not now. - Wed Sep 30 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So here's my question, Kuro. - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes? - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Was this the cute blonde you were talkin' bout? - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Misa? Yes, this is her. - Wed Sep 30 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Wed Sep 30 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, well now I'm bored. - Wed Sep 30 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) just starts to configure the mounted senbon launcher on his arm.* - Wed Sep 30 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm guessing you've been with Marianna? - Wed Sep 30 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Or have you been with Hideki and Ushiwara? - Wed Sep 30 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. Well, have you met Reguel? He too is a medic. - Wed Sep 30 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well Hideki is injured, like I stated already. - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . .. .  He is? - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Where is he... - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Laying down. - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Where. - Wed Sep 30 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm the one who carried him here. - Wed Sep 30 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: In the other room, it's best to let him get some rest. - Wed Sep 30 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Mamoru is also injured, not as sever as Hideki. - Wed Sep 30 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't know, and Reguel doesn't seem to know either.  I just found out not too long ago about their conditions. - Wed Sep 30 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . . - Wed Sep 30 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're asking a lot of questions, but you've yet to introduce yourself. - Wed Sep 30 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: The edge, it hurts. - Wed Sep 30 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) tilts his head towards the girl. "Are you really his friend or are you just putting up a front?" He crossed his arms as he leaned back to look at the girl.* - Wed Sep 30 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I mean, if I was there before this stuff happened, or much much later I probably wouldn't let my friend all this far into depravity. - Wed Sep 30 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's a difficult situation. - Wed Sep 30 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You can't force someone to listen and change. They need to do it themselves. All we can do is try to get him to realize what he's doing. - Wed Sep 30 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: My point still stands. - Wed Sep 30 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: As his friends it's just as much your fault for him getting injured than his own. - Wed Sep 30 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Are you to say the same to a mother when her child is out? - Wed Sep 30 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Me? Probably. - Wed Sep 30 06:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see..So you believe the fault lies on the mother rather than unforseen circumstances. - Wed Sep 30 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: It depends. Is it the mother's fault that she didn't protect her child or reach out for them when they needed it most? Or is it the unforseen circumstances? - Wed Sep 30 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It can be either or.  Sure, a mother should watch for their child at all times, but there's a time where the child must grow and experience things on their own. - Wed Sep 30 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: True. - Wed Sep 30 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: In our situation, Hideki must realize it himself that the path he's walking is a dark one. No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.  - Wed Sep 30 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Or just beat him, but maybe taking this beating is worth it. - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Violence only breeds more violence. - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's how we got into this situation in the first place. - Wed Sep 30 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well I'm just an outsider lookin' in. - Wed Sep 30 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That is true. - Wed Sep 30 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You'll eventually see. - Wed Sep 30 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Yeah whenever I start makin' friends. - Wed Sep 30 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You've already made a friend. - Wed Sep 30 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Have I? - Wed Sep 30 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yes. I consider us friends now. - Wed Sep 30 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) shrugs. "Alright."* - Wed Sep 30 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 30 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: I am looking for Ushinawa. - Wed Sep 30 13:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Who? - Wed Sep 30 13:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Ushinawa, a shinobi of Kumogakure. - Wed Sep 30 13:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're asking the wrong Medic, however both Mamoru and Hideki are injured.  - Wed Sep 30 13:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: How so? - Wed Sep 30 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) leans back as he takes his eyes off the scroll to recall the events. "I don't know what happen, but Mamoru has a broken jaw so he can't really talk all too well, but Hideki has it the worse. Bruises all over his body, broken ribs, basically he'll be on bed rest for a while, and from what I hear that's the best medicine for someone like him, but what do I know? I just met the guy along with Kuro and Misa." He shrugged before leaning forward to get a better look at the person before him.

"And you are?"* - Wed Sep 30 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 30 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm Reguel, I'm studying to become a Medic as well. - Wed Sep 30 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: A pleasure to meet you, I suppose. - Wed Sep 30 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I guess. - Wed Sep 30 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: Hi! - Wed Sep 30 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: -- Anyhow, anyone seen Niza or Ushinawa?~ - Wed Sep 30 22:38:04 2015

Admittingly he was taken back by the girl using a weapon changing ninjutsu since it was his first time seeing it. "It is interesting." He stated before he drew back his sleeve to reveal a senbon needler which he did aim towards Mamoru at close ranged. With ease he yanked back the string to ready the mounted weapon.* - Thu Oct  1 04:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs as he watches Hideki rolling around, sadly he couldn't really accelerate the healing process due to his inexperience with medicial ninjutsu. With a sigh he continued to tinker with the mounted senbon launcher, he was able to attach a pully system in order to control how many senbons he could fire at once. With a sigh he scratched the back of his head as he placed his tools down to wonder towards Hideki.

Placing his hands behind his head he wonderd over towards the patience to at least cause some ideal conversation. "Yo Hide--" He was cut short after catching a glimpse of the doujutsu, the sharingan. Beeing taken back by the sudden change only caused him to sigh as he talked towards the injured male before clocking the male over the head lightly.

He forgot about the little demonstration of his doujutsu since at least to him didn't really matter, at least for now. "How are you feeling?" He asked with a tilted head and his arms folded across his chest.* - Thu Oct  1 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) yawns as he watched the the wheel chair bounded shinobi aim a sword towards his neck. He didn't much pay mention to the snake constricting his movements at the time. Still he kept that uncaring deadpan look in his eyes as he loomed down at Hideki. "Mind releasing me?" He stated as he waited for the snake. "Besides, you need to loosen up, especially to medics trying to on it's patience." From his mouth he spat out a senbon before biting down on the needle before he launched it towards the snake. "Now are you done? Because you're suppose to be using this time to reflect on your actions, according to Kuro, you're walking a dark path."* - Thu Oct  1 23:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mamoru got injured because of me, Mariana got injured because of me, fucking Hanabi died because I wasn't strong enough to grab her and run. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're holding a kunai at the person because it's your faut? - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015

He studied the contents in it before opening it and dipping a senbon into the vail before removing it, he didn't have his senbon launcher since he was still working on it, but the paralysis numbing solution was just enough to help him.* - Thu Oct  1 23:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs as he motions Chiharu to place Mamoru on a custom.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) he sighed as he started to work on creating a new potent poison just for combat situtations. The first bach was set aside and labeled as Protoype: First Generation Poison, while the other which he was working on was made from the venom of a snake and combined with the prototype paralysis poison in order to make it more lethal. "Hmm now I need to test it." He started before he dipped a senbon into the less effective numbbing poison before stabbing himself in the vains for it to immidately take effect by numbing the arm the senbon was in. 

"Alright, so this works." He stated before taking the senbon out and popping an antidote to relieve himself from the numbing sensation, although he could've waited for the numbness to wear off after an hour, but he wanted to get his work over and done with. "Hmm, creating poison is difficult without a test dummy." He said a loud before snatching up the numbing solution before walking towards the unconscious Mamoru. "Now you said he passed out from exhaustion?" He said with an arched eyebrow while examining the shinobi's body.

The medic stroked his chin as he twirled the numbing solution in hi hand before placing it down and drawing a senbon from his pouch * - Fri Oct  2 01:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) twirled the senbon in his hands before jutting it towards Mamoru's face. With his eyes narrowed towards his patient he slowly motioned down towards the bed. "No wonder your jaw was broken. Rest. Now." He said in with a less than monotoned voice as he waited for Mamoru to perform said action. "If this happens again you won't be training until all your injuries are healed, pain killers or not you're still a human."* - Fri Oct  2 02:00:44 2015

Of course at this point his head band was off and tucked away into his pouch.  "Oh? How intesting." He stated after placing himself next to one of the supposed villagers of Konohagakure. With a simple head tilt he turned to watch someone strangle someone with what seemed like the intent to kill, but he wasn't about to get involved in something so trivial. * - Fri Oct  2 22:14:11 2015

Upon watching the gate from the distance made him sigh as he took note of the guards surrounding the gate. "High Alert?" He questioned before shrugging his shoulders to proceed going back the way he came. He didn't really want to get involved in a mess that he couldn't escape from. 

"Too troubesome, besides odds of me dying is 99.99%." He stated as he made his way back towards the village, luckly he wasn't that far from the makeshift path he forged for himself.* - Fri Oct  2 22:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs before tilting his head up towards Hideki with a calm smile. "Respect is earned, not given. Just because we're of the same village doesn't mean I have to respect you as a shinobi, I respect you as a doctor respects his patiences, and nothing more." He stated before he pointed his senbon towards Hideki. "Now if you don't mind you still need to tend to your wounds, I'd hate for you to get into a broken state again where I have to carry you on my shoulders." With that he sighed before scratching the back of his head.

"You're really emotional."* - Sun Oct  4 05:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He's done nothing to you. - Sun Oct  4 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Before I slap you slap my dick against your jaw region with so much strength you develop a fucking over-bite! - Sun Oct  4 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: He needs to show some damn respect. - Sun Oct  4 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Respect is not given, but earned. - Sun Oct  4 05:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Act like a respectable individual and then respect will come. You're too emotional right now, and treading down a dark path. - Sun Oct  4 05:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You've changed a lot since the death of Hanabi.  - Sun Oct  4 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Thats not what changed me. - Sun Oct  4 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're digging a hole for yourself. - Sun Oct  4 06:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Cause your a puss. - Sun Oct  4 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) placed a hand on his cheek as he lazily looked down at Bernadotte while offering a hand towards the male. "Are you sure? You just puked up your lunch and part of your breakfast." At this point he was ignoring Hideki and tending to a potental patiet.  He only sighed again before removing his hand and walking up towards Hideki.

"I won't tolerate that tone towards one of my friends, but if you'd like then strike me, will that make an emotional, aggrogant, and self absorbed shinobi like you calm down?"* - Sun Oct  4 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No, because there's no reason to fight. - Sun Oct  4 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: You're acting like a child right now, longing for attention. - Sun Oct  4 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Think not of yourself, but of those that remain. You still have family on this world. - Sun Oct  4 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Think of Heiwa. - Sun Oct  4 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) thinks: Sigh, I can't really calm down Hideki so I'll just stand back then. - Sun Oct  4 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You had a chance to strike me. - Sun Oct  4 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) yawned before scratching the back of hishead again. "I need to relieve some bordem." He stated before walking back towards Bernadotte while offering his hand towards the child again. "Stand, you don't like the taste of dirt do you?"* - Sun Oct  4 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: Today.. Has been an interesting day. - Sun Oct  4 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) thinks: Well, I should let Hideki relax and I am on my way.  - Sun Oct  4 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: . . . . - Sun Oct  4 06:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: Hng. Too fast. - Sun Oct  4 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) turned his attention over towards the crying Misa before he sighed once more to himself once more after she collasped to the ground. "Just what is this?" He stated after walking towards Misa who was sobbing against the stone, he honest'y didn't have much to say since it was a crying female. Kneeling down he watched Misa cry fo a set amount of time whle offering any thing to be of help since he was just a simple medicial ninja. "We're falling apart."* - Sun Oct  4 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: Are you. - Sun Oct  4 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: Staring at me? - Sun Oct  4 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) thinks: Guess not - Sun Oct  4 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) allowed himself to be pushed as he watched Misa only shout at him, of course he was taken back by this since it was the first time she did so since they met not to long ago, however he didn't budge he merely stared at Misa's now puffed yp red eyes before he scratched his head again after getting a rather uneasy feeling. "See this is why I'm not in a relationship now." He said in a snarky tone before flicking Misa on the head in retaliation for shoving him. 

"I don't much care about your past relationships, or the one you have with Hideki, he's just another shinobi in my eyes, however you are a fellow medicial ninja, so my only advice is that time heals all wounds, some more than others." He shrugged after said statement. 

"Death is also a factor." He stated before sighing. "I need to go train." * - Sun Oct  4 06:30:24 2015
