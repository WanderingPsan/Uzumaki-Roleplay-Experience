<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) only yawned since he didn't really feel like replying to something that for the most didn't really involve him in the slightest. "Smooth." He stated towards Kuro as he made his way towards his friend. "On a side note, I think I should leave the village."* - Sun Oct  4 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: How come? - Sun Oct  4 06:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Is there anyone else who can teach me I wonder, I should probably ask Raikage. - Sun Oct  4 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighed as he watched the male pummel the stone to the point where his skin started to tear.

"I can't heal stupidity."* - Sun Oct  4 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: They don't have the capability to calm down, those who hit people under the belt. - Sun Oct  4 07:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You two are having an interesting conversation, let me se your hands. - Sun Oct  4 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) grasp Kojrio's hands before he sent his chakra towards the male's hands before a blue charka envoloped the shinobi's hands as he started to heal the self-inflicted injuries. 

"You were talking about us, weren't you?"* - Sun Oct  4 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'll let you keep the scars, but that's all. - Sun Oct  4 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: What's that supposed to mean man? - Sun Oct  4 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) leers up towards Kojiro before sighing. "It means what I said." He stated before healing enough of the shiobi's wounds just enough for the skin to naturally heal themselves before removing his hands from Kojiro's. "Next."* - Sun Oct  4 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Nah, I want to know what you meant... What did you mean? - Sun Oct  4 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: ...Are you an idiot? - Sun Oct  4 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) takes Amon's hands before he started to heal them in the same mannor as he did withb Kojiro. Still he kept a calm composure the same way he did when he dealt with Hideki earlier.* - Sun Oct  4 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Listen, I'm not going to understand unless you tell me what you meant. Be a damn man about what you said. - Sun Oct  4 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs before glaring over at Kojiro. "Please shut up." He said in his usual monotoned way before tilting his head over towards Kojiro while he still continued to heal Amon's injuried hands. "You said you wanted to keep the scars, so I healed you enough to were your skin will heal itself and I stopped the blood flow, you'll still keep the scars you're so proud of." After he finished his sentence he released Amon's hands since he had given him the same treatment as he did with Kojiro assuming he wanted it as well.* - Sun Oct  4 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) only tilted his head on the other side before blinking. "You're confusing me for Hideki, the one who has the doujutsu."* - Sun Oct  4 08:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides, I plan on leaving this village soon and going out to study since the most skilled Medicial shinobi is dead. - Sun Oct  4 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: If you understood it, then you just wasted your time. Which in turn, is wasting even more time because of this. You could have been training during all this time, but no. You're still sitting there, listening. - Sun Oct  4 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) had stopped listening halfway to tinker with the mounted needle shot on his arm. "Did you say something?"* - Sun Oct  4 09:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Misa is emotionally unstable at the time, you saw how Hideki is, Raikage can't really help me much as he's always busy, we've lost most of our skillled shinobis. So yes, I do think my answers resides somewhere else. - Sun Oct  4 09:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: She's also a medic. - Sun Oct  4 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: A medic who can't perform is nothing more than fodder. And right now she's fodder. - Sun Oct  4 09:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) removes his headband to show the fact he was a shinobi of Kumogakure. "I am." He stated before placing the headband back into his pocket. "I'm leaving because as a genin I'm not as good, hence why I want to gain more, I want to be more useful to the Raikage and my fellow shinobis, however I'm wasting my time." He stated before he attached another layer of components against his senbon launcher before he clicked a button to fire off a round of senbon towards a wall to pierce the stone. "Hmm, not fast enough." He stated before he spat out a few senbon towards the floor. "Hmm."* - Sun Oct  4 09:26:11 2015

He slowly followed the faint voices while he slowly approached the central area while holding his hand against what seemed like a wall. As he grew closer he seemed to have ran out of wall which caused him to lose his footing entirely and land on his knees at the enterance of the noodle bar. "Shit." He cursed to himself as he slowly picked himself up from the floor.* - Wed Oct  7 01:35:34 2015

Upon taking a closer look Reguel took a few steps back given his rather immidate surprise.

"I see." He stated before folding his arms. "And what honor do we have looming over us this time?"* - Wed Oct  7 01:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs as he dips his head back and sighed. "Look he's no longer in a critical condition, and I've done enough." He slouched over and placed his head onto the table to rest himself. "I can't heal him fully due to how much of my charka reserves I have, but he'll no longer be in danger of bleeding out." He stated before he lazily inclided his head back and allowed himself to rest. "This is why I wanted to go to Kirigakure." He complained before allowing himself to gain some rest.* - Wed Oct  7 02:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) shakes his head towards Kuro as he removes the last shuriken. "I've recovered enough, I can fully heal him right now." He stated before leaning over the unconious body of Amon once more to behind healing his remaining wounds again, he knew full well how much of a critical state he was putting himself in by allowing to use up the rest of his charka reserves for healing such a reckless indivisual. Sweat started to build up as he spreaded his charka throughout Amon's body attempting to heal his other wounds before he eventually stopped.

"Ah damn, I'm out." He stated before he leaned back and collasped after using up the last of his charka for healing. Luckily for him he was still breathing, but he had to remain rested for his charka to slowly come back.* - Wed Oct  7 03:13:42 2015

Of course given his looks he was a bit dirted and tattered, but luckly he had enough equipment to at least get him to another village. "So this is Suna?" He stated after entering the village only to discover a rather large crowd of people. "What is going on?" The medic asked after taking his positon next to one of the villagers with his hands inside his sleeves.

He sighed after watching the interaction with the others while yawning to himself. He didn't have much to say since he was really just here to gain some scrolls not really form a conntection with the other villagers.* - Wed Oct  7 07:29:42 2015
