<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) calmy kept to himself as he watched the bodies scream in pain and agony, it doesn't really concern him, at least that's what he was trying to tell himself as the bodies were splitted open before him. His hand flexed a bit of a twitching motion as he watched the skin get rips apart and spreaded open for them to examine.

He inhaled as he walked over towards the body as commanded before he examined one of the bodies before he immidately plunged his hand inside the body of the male bandit. He could feel it, the organs squirmed as he placed another one inside the body at first he moved his hand from inbetween the lungs and the ribcage. "I found it, his heart." He stated before giving it a light squeeze.

Almost immdately he heard the guy scream out in agony while Reguel slowly released his grip from the heart as he started to point out the different organs before bit down on his tongue in order to calm himself down from his gag reflex he was feeling when crawling his hand within the body of the bandit.

"I can actually kill him now if I wanted to."* - Mon Oct 12 10:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) continued to study the organs of the bandit while feeling on both the small and large intenstanes before ripping his hand out rahter foricibly. He only just turned his eyes towards the red headed girl before sighing. "You need to desensitize yourself, besides you're a medic, you should get used to seeing the blood of your fellow shinobi among other things." He stated before he crossed his arms to look down at the bandit who was still alive mind you.

He looked down at his hand before it twitched. Of course he wasn't too desensitize from the stuff he was doing, for the most part he was fighitng to keep the calm composure since he would most likely start twitching wildly making his hand become less steady. "Right.."* - Mon Oct 12 11:29:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) watches as the girl crumpled to her knees and started weeping.At first he only akwardly listened to her cry before walking over towards her and placing a hand on her shoulder for comfort. He didn't really say anything at the moment because of the rather tense atmosphere that was in the air.

He sighed as he kneeled down to get eye level to her. "Look, this is something as a medic has to deal with, touching organs, touching blood, getting use to seeing death, and hell even refusing to not heal certain people because people are like that." He scratched his head before inhaling sligthly.

He then grapped the dam towel as he placed it in her hands.without any words. With an exhale he started to clean off the blood on her hands while trying not to make eye contact with her.* - Mon Oct 12 12:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) talked towards the red-headed girl with his arms crossed. Honestly the last time he seen her was when they had to experiement on live subjects which seemed pretty traumitzing towards the girl, as for him he sorta soaked it up like a sponge due to his pass experience within Kumogakure, he was pretty desenzitize by death which is pretty dangerous for a medic.

At first he stated to approach the girl to see if she was okay, but he only stopped in his tracks before he looked down at his hands. He'd only began twitching when he thought of the red head crying over the 'horrible' things she did to the female bandit. "Dammit STOP!" He exclaimed before his hand started to become more unstable as he fell sick to his stomach before he began to have rather intense stomach cramps. Sweat started to build up on his brow as he recalled the things he did within the time of Zenaki's home.

"Hehe, why should this even bother me? They were bandits" He muttered under his breath as he looked up in his hand to see it covered in a rather bloodly mess. Just then he could feel a heart pulsing before he eventually squeezed the life out of the muscle. 

A flat line sounded from the medic's hallucenations before he finally puked up on the floor beneath him thus ending his hallucenations completely. "It...was just bandit." He hissed as he placed his head on the ground "I don't care anymore." He stated before bashing his head against the ground until he drew blood before lurching backwards on his back. 

"I need to train more." He stated before holding his now bleeding skull. "I also need to heal this.."* - Wed Oct 14 01:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) stayed silent for the most part as he placed senbon marking alone the path as they traveled to the next arena along the paths. Of course he did make sure to leave mental notes as they traveled through the not so cleverly named 'Desert of Death' given the fact he hasn't seen anything remotely dangerous since they've been on this little trip towards an increasingly dangerous place. 

During their time they were here he carefully calcuated Koji's movements of course it wouldn't do much since it would take some combat pratice among other things in order to insure that victory was in his grasp the next time he would make a challenge in order to become a Chuunin. <"Geh, there's no point in worrying about it if I have't trained for it ye--"> His thought processed was haulted as a rather long slitherly figure wrapped along his leg before yanking him deep into the sands beneath. "Dammit!" He exclaimed as he was immidately pulled into the quick sand, well at least his lower body was.

At first he kept calm as he had a mini-panic attack as he tried to move himself out of the sand was quickly as possible before he realized that this would only add to his struggling and eventual death by sufffication. <"Keep calm."> He thought to himself as he slowly started to do a series of small movements before he eventually made his way out fo the quicksand, but he wasn't done yet as danger was still approaching him from within the sand.

"What the hell?" He cursed as he stood face-to-face with a rather giant desert snake. Reguel started to hyperventilate as he stood his ground, he couldn't really draw his weapons, and one wrong move could land him back into the quick sand, with a more fatal chance of dying due to fatiuge from the last one and the snear amount of panic from both threats loaming on top of him. <"So what now?" He thought as he attempted to make careful movements only to be intercepted by the snake.

From the corner of his eye he noticed his group walking further behind, he could possibly make a run for it and try to outlast the snake in entirely, or he could just stand his ground, either or had a possiblity  death given how he would approach it. "I have no choice." He stated as he leered towards the snake before gunning it. 

As stated he knew he'd get caught within the grasp of the snake's leathery scales. Still he tried to keep a calm demenor even if he was screaming on the inside. "I wasn't suppose to kill." He stated towards the snake as it tasted the air around him with it's tongue while pulling it's head closer to him in the process. Just then Reguel spat out three senbon needles form his mouth to cause the snake to loosen it's grip around him and give him enough of a window to escape and return back to the others.

"Son of a bitch." He stated as he ran at full speed away from the threat at hand.* - Wed Oct 14 03:38:01 2015
