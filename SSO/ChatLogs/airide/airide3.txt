<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs as he sets his things against the rather large cave area that was their make-shift home. "Well now 'Yoshi' we need to at least make home here."* - Fri Oct  9 23:50:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) nodded towars Takeda's worry before inhaling and sighing slightly. At this time his arms were crossed as he thought about the certain outcomes of coming here. At the time he uncrossed his arms and placed his hand against his chin while thinking about the Kazekage in Sunagakure. "I don't know if they'll accept us." He stated before taking out a senbon and stabbing a wondering lizard that crossed their path. "I might as well train."

After that he crossed his hands around the now bleeding lizard before a pume of charka surrounded his hands and the lizard as he started to heal the lizard. At the time he kept a rather stern focus on the lizard before the reptile sprung towards its feet before it ran away from them. At the time Reguel had a rather tired look on his face after performing the healing jutsu. "Shit."* - Sat Oct 10 00:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) crossed his arms as the bird flew out of their 'warm' stone caved home towards the other direction. "That was towards Hideki?" He asked with an arched eyebrow before taking out a few vails of poison he kept with him before he started to do another mixture.
