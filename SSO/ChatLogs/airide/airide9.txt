<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) tossed Fujitora a look as he listened to the male's judgement before rolling his eyes in a rather uninterested manner. He sighed as he placed the blade back in its sheath. "I assume you have this taken care of?" He stated as he removed another sealing scroll from his back pouch. "Ah, right, if you have time think you can upgrade this?" He asked as he removed the mounted wrist launcher from his left arm before presenting it towards Fujitora's free hand.

"I would like it to be more automatic, at least while I work on my physical build and medical ninjutsu." He took a quick glance over at the kid before turning his attention over towards Fujitora.* - Wed Oct 21 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) unravels the scroll as he began to read through the techniques at the time. Even though he wasn't much of a prodigy at these things he was at least pretty confident in his ability to pick up certain things in his grasp like the Dynamic Entry taijutsu. "Done." He stated as he set the scroll to his side before picking up the other one. It was another taijutsu scroll he was gifted to by Koji.

Licking his lips he started to read the scroll once more. Just like the other scroll he quickly picked up the basic movements he needed to do, the easy part was already done, he just needed the stamina in order to imitate the taijutsu as well as the required stamina in order to not shatter his bones in the process. He only sighed as he stood himself up to present the scrolls to Koji after only a short time having them in his possession.

At first he didn't feel any reaction from the troat, that was until a few more seconds simply passed as the fish's tail started to twitch in reaction to his charka healing. "Good." He stated as the trout began to move about effectively striking him in the fact a few times due to the fact he was in such close proximity of the fish. Honestly this took longer than he had expected, four seconds was enough to bring now splashing trout to life. "And now I smell like fish." He stated as his sniffed his hands. He merely tossed a quick glance at the strange girl who looked rather uninterested before shrugging. "How dull."* - Thu Oct 22 01:00:09 2015
