Hmm either I can cut the tendons and fix them like that or I could apply some minor healing along with a healing pill which should accelerate the healing process, either way it's going to be some time before he could be completely healed." He mummbled to himself as he did a series of hand seals before one of his hands was surrounded by a sharp looking charka blade.

"Phew, it's still not mastered, but it's pretty damn effective." He stated as he motioned for Susumu to attempt to open his jaw. "Well before I do this, choose your poison. Susu."* - Fri Oct 23 22:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs as he dissolves the charka scaple as he pondered this. What he wanted to do was slice Susumu's muscles to give him free control over his jaw for a temporary effect while he healed the rest of it, but he could really do much about the bruises or the bone injuries until later or unless he had learned an advanced verison of the healing jutsu in a short amount of time. Once again he sighed as he placed his hand around Susumu's face. Muttering something other his breath he started to apply healing to his face.

Keeping calm he sighed while the bruises were the frist to go. "Susumu didn't rape that girl, I don't know what her problem was, but for some reason she was stark naked and she landed on his face, I guess everyone just went with her 'innocent' girl story and well this happened." He reasurred jiki while turning his attention towards the other minor injuries, since he couldn't deal wiith the major ones.

"Susumu, I think I need to leave here to find a more advance verison of the healing jutsu...well that's if I can do so. I don't know where, the ruins of Kirigakure? Maybe?" He questioned as he sighed while removing his hands away from the genin's face. The most he could do about his jaw was lessen the pain, but that's about all he could muster, he wanted to do more, but sadly he wasn't as skilled as the former Mizukage, or Misa, or the medic he never met in Kumogakure.

He bit his thumb as he walked away. "I'm already done here, let's go."* - Fri Oct 23 23:08:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) whips his hands as he watches this occur. Deep in his mind he thought aboutt he doubt he was feeling from when he was healing Susumu, of course he knew there was nothing he could do for his lack of skill, he was a late bloomer when it came to things like this, but he also knew that he wanted to do more when it came to be a combat-specialized medical shinobi. For one he wanted to be more involved in battle which ic why he took the time to learn more taijutsu skilll as well as high leveled medical skills, then it hit him.

Doing the five required hand seals before he summoned a pair of charka scaples into his hands. He waited for Jiki to charge in as he would follow behind as well. Making sure to avoid the tempation of slicing the muscles within everyone he passed. Of course he wanted to disable them, by makign them feel the rather intense pain of having their muscles sliced open by a charka scaple, of course this also caused internal bleeding if he wasn't careful.

He couldn't wait any longer as he dashes towards Mizora since he assumed at this point that Jiki was going ater Madelyn, considering what he saw on the bench not too long ago. Cursing under his breath "I hate annoying women." He muttered hunder his breath as he dipped down to attempt to slice Mizora's legs, at least after she finally stopped spinning around like a damn beyblade. Also if this didn't work at first he'd probably aim for her arms.* - Fri Oct 23 23:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) slowly opened his jaw before bting down on a healing pill. Enduring the pain he felt in his jaw was worth it as he started to apply healing jutsu to restore his jaw, thanks to the pill he took earlier it did provide a much better healing effect to his jaw and other facial injuries like his nose for starters. "Shit." He stated as he used Koji as a cruch to stand himself up. Feeling a bit dazed he made his way over towards Bryson for extra healing.* - Sat Oct 24 00:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) sighs as he places his hand against his heart at least where he thought his charka nebula was., he tossed a look towards the blood spatter where Susumu once was while turning towards the others. Did a single hand seal as he started to naturally knead the charka within his body. He didn't say anything as he slowly allowed the charka to slowly change into a special chemical within his body. At the moment he wanted to produce a poison suited for murder, but he merely held off on it as he slowly opened his mouth before a sweet smelling aroma from his mouh which when combined with the air became a pink pume of smoke. What he made was highly non-lethal as his aim was just to numb those around hi plus his jutsu wasn't ready, he needed to test out how lethal he could make it on live animals or possibly some unspecting shinbois, he didnt really care as long as they were slain, but that would have to be another day whenever he fully grasped this new jutsu he learned.* - Sat Oct 24 00:43:05 2015

"Look I know what not to do, besides it's non-lethal, or better yet, shall I go test it out on some other live animals to test the waters on how lethal this jutsu can be." He covered his smile with his hand as he pondered this for sometime now. Of course before doing so he tourched the scroll the jutsu came from with a match before tossing it in the sands while watching the flames engulf the scroll entirely.

He tossed Bryson a glare before looking over towards Ai. "That technique..another paper user? Hmph. You'll end up dead like her." He referred to the last paper user in the area. He merely leered before rolling his eyes towards them.* - Sat Oct 24 01:03:34 2015
