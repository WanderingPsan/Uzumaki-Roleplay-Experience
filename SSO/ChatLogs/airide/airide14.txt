Shin requested that I retell what I knew of the man, and I did just that. Ya'know, I take fond of people like you. The type to think that they can jump in any conversation and add their little opinion in an attempt to ease down whatever imaginary tension they saw. This was a merely a casual conversation. You come off as someone that had some form of anger toward Hideki, rather than, as you say, being his friend."*)

I wanted to be like Bryson, a priest and heal whomever I could, while he wanted to find a peaceful method to resolve all this chaos, however, when our medics fell at the hands of some unknown ninja then the former Mizukage, well If igured I might as well start specializing in combat as well was medical ninjutsu I figured the two would go hand-and-hand and for the most part I was right." He stated while peering over at Ortho this time. "The worst feeling a medic could have is being useless, and I refuse to feel that away again."* - Tue Oct 27 05:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) nodded towards the two as he pointed towards the east. "We'll get the most tedious of them out the way." He stated while leading them over towards the eastern region of Sunagakure's desert where they were greeted with a multied of wild beast ranging from scorpions to wildcats of plenty. "Hmm, this looks pretty even." He stated as he did five hand seals to summon two charka scapels to his hands. "It's time to play." He stated as he lunged towards a provoked wild cat that attempted to pounce on him. Dipping down he quickly raised his hand to cut the cat's neck with the right scapel.* - Wed Oct 28 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) inhaled as he proceeded to cut towards the more vulnerable vital organs within the felines, it was only a matter of time before everyone had killed their own share of felines before they eventually backed off. He could see the fact his charka was slowly being drained after extending the time he needed to properly control the flow. Cursing to himself he dashed towards the next wave of animals which were the giant scorpions. 

Through clentched teeth he smashed his fist into the skull of one of the scorpions while using his other hand which he still kept the scalpel active to pierce the vital organ before he moved on to the next one which nicked his abdomen and chest with it's stinger. <"Shit."> He thought as he jumped back to see how far his cut was. He sighed as he slowly healed the effected wound before making a quick glance to notice that Triliam and Mizora were doing just fine.

<"Of course, there more skilled at this then I am."> He thought as he performed a jumping kick towards a nearby scorpion followed by a leaf whirlwind to flip it on it's back. Drawing his tanto he quickly drove the weapon deep into it's underside while using all his might to cut through the belly of the bug until it stopped moving entirely. * - Wed Oct 28 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) grits his teeth after ripping out of the scorpian with his free hand. "Right." He stated as he leered towards the next target. He knew he wasn't proficienat with a blade, he wasn't from Kirigakure, he also didn't harbor the lighting element most would have within Kumogakure something that they were famous for. Reguel only continued to think these things through as he sliced off one of the scorpian's tails before bringing his scalpel down on it's head killing the beast. "Fuck it."

With a swift kick off the carcause he hacked and slashed his way through thw beast that only continued to come. It seemed pretty endless actually since neither of them had scouted for the leader, however if he could be any sure of himself he felt like he was the closest.

"Cover your mouths!" He exclaimed while kneading the charka in his body. He didn't have time to think as he quickly formed the chemicals he needed in order to produce a rather deadly poison within his mouth. With an inhale he fully exhaled a dark purple mist that filled the air around the beast around him causing either most to become paralyzed or succumb to death. * - Wed Oct 28 02:33:10 2015

Had no intentions of killing the rahter ignorant boy with the dumb accent, however he also didn't have any time to fool around either since they were on high alert, plus he had things he needed to do for his research. Inhaling through his nose he then made a funnel like shape with his hand before breathing out a small stream of light purple mist behind the barrier towards the boy, it wasn't anything deadly, just a less than average dose of numbing toxicen.* - Fri Oct 30 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) inhales as he ignores Erin for a momemt. He wanted to at least obtain that jutsu before he could mvoe on to bigger and better things when it came to pumping up is body for combat, not everyone was born the same, hence clans. He only sighed once a she attempted to try something simple like channeling his charka into a single finger at tirst and given the constant voices aroud him made this increasingly difficiult since his concerntration was constantly being broken time and time again by the loud noises.

Finally he let out a rther loud sigh as he struck the ground hard. "Damn it all!" He exclaimed as his twisted his fist in the dirt several times before he started to strike the  dirt until dust clouds formed around him. <"Something like this is too simple. why am I not getting it?"> He cursed to himseflf as he sighed once more to think of a differenlt method.

He sighed as he imagined himself performing an inner charka blade only it was charka being poured inot a limn to increase it's over all destructive force. "I'm close." He muttered as he successfully was able to channel his charka into his finger, at least that's what it felt like. "Tch, I'll have to train it more." He stated before leering over in Izutora's direction.
