<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) only twitched at the mere sight of Trilliam. Of course that wasn't the only issue he was dealing with, it was that name, that really really retarded name that he hated a lot. Still holding back how much the 'codename' bothered him he merely stepped towards Trilliam with a stern look on his face. "What is it?"* - Mon Oct 12 00:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) would normally use this opporunity to stab Trilliam in the back at this point. He had the required tools to do so, poison-laced senbon, a tanto, poison bombs. etc. but clearly doing so would go against his hyprocratic oath as a medic, besides he wasn't that petty enough to kill someone over a name, at least he didn't think he was. Gritting his teeth he merely flipped his hair out of his eye before tapping Trilliam's shoulders with a senbon, just a simple prick. "Right." He stated before placing one hand onto Trilliam's shoulder and the other on the next with a soft exhale he channeled his charka into both of his arms to begin healing the rather dumb shinobi's wounds, even though he knew it was just the right shoulder that was in pain he didn't feel like taking any chances. "Why didn't you get this healed sooner?" He questioned.* - Mon Oct 12 00:23:28 2015

Honestly he didn't like what was going on, and due to Susumu's facial expression clearly something was up and it had to deal with the contents inside the mystery box. "You're starting to annoy me." The medic stated after he pulled out a small senbon with a rather clear liquid dripping from the tip. "What did you do?" He ordered as he took another step towards the shinobi. He knew he clearly asked an obivous question, but he wanted answers.* - Mon Oct 12 01:52:12 2015

"I'm not going to take empty threats from some shinobi, besides, I refuse to fight with someone from the same village, it's childish and I've already dealt with enought childish stuff." He stated before unscrolling a simple sealing scroll before a fresh out of water fish appeared before him. Ignoring the two kunoichi he encountered he begain to heal the fish with healing ninjutsu.

In the back of his mind he wondered about the gambeling prize among other things that happened since eh joined with Sunagakure. "Greetings, Jiki." He said as he turned his attention back to the fish. "How are the others?"* - Mon Oct 12 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) only leered at the girl before scoffing a bit. He knew Jiki was going to have some questions about the situtation at hand, but he figured it wasn't really all that important now that it was virtuallly over and done with.

"It's nothing, just a simple argument about a false sexual harassment charge, from someone unimportant to me." He stated before he felt the fish's body beginning to flap about for water which was a clear indication that his training as a success, Slowly the charka in his hands dispelled completely before he stood up and patted his body down. 

"Jokes are meant to be funny, comedy is deprived from misery, you aren't funny." The Medic stated before sighing to himself once more.* - Mon Oct 12 04:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) knew full well what was coming to him when Katsune made a clone of herself would rush towards him with every attempt to attack. Of course his eyes couldn't really follow her movements as the clone immidately closed in the gaps between the three. Right in front of him was the clone then next thing he saw was a roundhouse kick colliding with his face causing him to fall back and strike the ground beneth.

At first he had a rather shocked expression on his face before he felt a trickle of blood ooze down from his nose. The crimson water flowed at a rather face pace before it formed a miniture puddle around his neck staining his headband slightly.

Placing his hand over his face he didn't allow himself to yell or streak out in pain due to the fact he faced worse pains than a somewhat broken nose which was easy to heal, it would just take some time unless he had help from either Bryson or Zenaki assuming he was their student. 

At this moment he sucked in a deep breath before pulling at his nose before a rather gross hoping sound was heard after he straightened his nose back into place. Cursing under his breath he allowed himself to sit up while holding his nose even though the blood was still coming out.

"Hard." He stated as he reached back in his backpouch before pulling out a green pill. 

With a soft inhale he popped the pill inside his mouth before crunching down on the pill while also performing medical ninjutsu to first stop the bleeding.* - Mon Oct 12 05:13:36 2015

Ignoring Katsune's presense he bowed towards the Kazekage before slowly exhaling. "I want to be made a chuunin." He boldly stated after it's been nearly a few hours at least since he offically joined the village. "I'll do every mission possible if that's the case, I don't care for the challenge."

Gritted his teeth as the pain surged from his body after taking the blunt of the attack from Koji. "Dammit." He cringed as he felt Kojiw withdraw his fistt from where his kiney was.

Of course his body was screaming in pain from the two combined simultaneous attacks from the two Sunagakure shinobi, while he was on the ground he did attempt to heal himself which wasn't as effective as it normally was due to the blockage in charka flow. "Damn." He cursed as he staggered up before popping the last of his healing pill into his mouth to ease himself of the pain 

Taking hold of his tanto only cause Reguel to stand firm and wait for the next strike. He didn't have much of a choice in this matter since he was up against two highly skilled people.* - Mon Oct 12 07:01:07 2015

He stated before he weakly pulled back his sleeve to reveal a mounted senbon launcher. "It's the same with this one, however I can be a bit less precise, it's still not automatic unforunately."

He frowned a bit before placing his hand against the ground. "Besides, my stills are still lacking, I need more missions in order to take on higher ranked ones(still rank D) my jutsus need practicing, I need to start studying with Zenaki, I need to do taijutsu training so I'm not useless on the battle field, and so much more."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) blinked as he noticed the body hanging within the statue. "I know this person." He said upon walking into Zenaki's house, he probably should've kept to himself seeing as this sort of information wasn't really needed at the time.* - Mon Oct 12 08:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You do? From what? - Mon Oct 12 08:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) only sighed as he listened in on Zenaki's story as they descended towards the basement. Honestly when she was telling him about her nephew's death he couldn't help but not feel the least bit sorry for her even if it was a bit. "Well I'm sorry to hear that." He stated after the story ended and they reached the basement where they saw the large snake-like creature. Reguel paused a moment to consider what he was looking at before shaking his head free from fear. 

"Ah right, to answer your question, why do I study up on medical ninjutsu is rather simple, for one it takes a steady mind in order to do what we need to do, and another is because medics are always needed whether I had a choice in the matter or not, we always put our lives on the line to heal someone else, but I don't want that." He stopped a bit before crossing his arms.

"I also want to fight along side fellow shinobis, it's silly, yes, but I want to prove that a Medical shinobi like myself can still defend themselves outside of healing others, I know it's possible, I just need to know how to do it."* - Mon Oct 12 09:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Reguel(Airide) merely flicked his wrist as he brought fourth his charka from his hand. "Only the basics, unforunately, I didn't have a teacher, and whatever scrolls the former left were destroyed."* - Mon Oct 12 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Good.  - Mon Oct 12 10:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Surgery's? anatomy? - Mon Oct 12 10:08:00 2015
