Lightning Seals: This character is capable of completing strings of handseals within a few seconds so long as it doesn't extend beyond ten handseals. Anything more can completed in half a minute. 

Lightning Reflexes: This character's reaction speed is impeccable. They can contend with a gate user within the first four gates and dodge a number of their strikes. They can dodge large projectiles at close range, though they are incapable of dodging consecutive weapons; and fighting a gate user of the fifth gate forces them to block a number of strikes, as dodging becomes harder consecutively. 

Strength: This Character has a great deal of body power. Their physical power is more than just impressive. Their strikes are capable of rattling bones, and an unguarded strike can break bones. This character has enough strength to take on medium sized beasts such as those who are summoned via contract on equal grounds. Note: This perk is not compatible with Oukashou or any other strength replacing techniques.

Tailed Chakra: This character's chakra pools are so immense, that it can match that of a tailed beast once matured. An untrained student easily has the reserves to match an untrained jounin. The character with this perk's reserves appear endless, at times, and once they've hit the rank of jounin, their chakra levels easily tops that of the average kage. The chakra pool pushes the character four untrained ranks upward when they are untrained, and five untrained ranks when they are indeed trained.

<br><font color=yellow>*Hozuki, Sirozan(XxkasukuxX) Sirozan begins wondering the outskirts of The Hidden Mist at dusk, Which his superiors tells him that it's dangerous, Blowing them off and begins looking for a massive water source, Since his village is running low on A hydratation liquid. He begins walking and thinking about the lectures he'll hear from his superiors when they hear he returns from outside the village, Before he can remember, he looks up and it;'ss very dark out thinking, "Well, I need to hurry before wild animals start thinking they can attack me..." after this statement he is very cautious walking about. Looking back and uses his peripheral vision to his advantage. After walking several minutes he gettings very bored and even considering returning home. But, this actually made him want to travel faster, he then crouches down and begins to scout a tree branch and locks on and releases his stance and goes soar towards the branch, then begins to get a rhythm taking one foot at a time on branch consecutively. He then hears something like someone following him, lashing out his kunai and attaches a wire on it and fires it's behind him as a trap wire. He then feels this same wire move and stops and gulps thinking, "As my predictions was right." and says in a calm voice, "Come out, I can tell your there...". He then gets into a basic fighting stance cleching his fists and yells, "COME ON NOW, YOU CAN'T HIDE!" then he hears a tree branch breaks close to him and his heart begins to beat very fast. The figure begins to appear from what of the dark with Sirozan's kunai stating, "This trap was successful, Your senses are redefined, But You Should have stayed home, Boy." Sirozan's teeth begins to clamp hearing, "Boy." He begins to walk from the darkness smirking, touching his headband and swinging Sirozan's kunai on a finger. He looks like clan from the Hidden Mist called "Hoshigaki" with a rogue headband and with rags on his back. Sirozan then comments on his headband, "I see your -where- from The Hidden Mist...?" with his guard on even more alert. The Hoshigaki then asks, "That trash of a village? Psshh, Anywhere is better then there..." Sirozan then jumps down from the tree on to the ground with the Hoshigaki following him. Sirozan then thinks, "He's following me so he must be a lethal threat...I have to attack off-guard so i can continue searching." The Hoshigaki then pulls out a jar from his kunai holster and begins to consume the contents of it saying, "Ahh...That's goood water...Now, This is what's going to happen. Your going to give me all your suppiles or Die...or, i can rob you AND kill you." with a maniacally laugh. Sirozan says, "You won't do either you punk!" and picks up a giant stick the size of a 4x4 and perpares to attack the Hoshigaki. The Hoshigaki then throws the jar to the ground and shatters it perpares a defense. Sirozan then begins swinging the stick violently with relatively ease matching the Hoshigaki's stolen kunai. Sirozan then props up the stick on the ground and throws his body weight into a kick towards the Hoshigaki's gut. The Hoshigaki then wipes the blood from his mouth and leans up and perfroms some handseals and shouts, "Water Style : Water Clone Technique!" then punches the clones expelling all of the water onto the ground. Sirozan suprised kneels down and uses his finger to lick up some water and he starts to sulp it up saying, ' AHHHH! Water taste so good...This is going to be clockwork now!" then his muscles begin to pump alittle with every sip. The Hoshigaki then tells Sirozan that he better look up and Sirozan sweepkicks The Hoskigaki, The Hoshigaki is suprise by his speed and elbows his jaw and begins to start flying backwards. Sirozan then grabs his stick and begins to walk and stops to zooms into the place he elbowed The Hoshigaki, barely hereing the Hoshigaki annouce his Water Style : Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave trying to outrun it then getting hit dead on to the back,"W-What..NOOOOooo..."when the blast settled he found him self inside a bubble of water. The Hoshigaki then pops up with a ripped shirt and taking deep breaths looking fatigue saying, "I underestimated you, Now it's time to see the real power of the Hoshigaki Clan!" rushing into the floating injured Sirozan perform and landing harsh connecting chains of combos with very loud grunts then Hoshigaki says, "See you are weak, Hidden Mist trash..Should have stayed home child, Heh.." Sirozan then begins to wake softly saying, "Well....I told you wasn't going to kill me...or rob me......NOW TO KEEP MY PROMISE!" with a electric voice. With Sirozan's rage on a new peak his body begin to liquify and he comments on his teeth saying, "My Teeth...I'll Rip You Apart!!!!" The Hoshigaki then is stunned by his transformation. Sirozan races towards the Hoshigaki and throws everything at him with bashing combos connecting and breaking every move the hit touches. Sirozan then picks up the nearly dead Hoshigaki and states, "You gave me a fight i thought i wasa going to lose...Thank you, For this Great Fight, But you have to die...But, Before that. I'll tell you my name, I am Sirozan from the Hozuki clan, Hozuki, Sirozan!" he then tosses the almost lifeless body of the Hoshigaki then, soaks up the water like a sponge. Then, swims up towards the sky and goes shuffling into his pockets and hosters thinking, "It's -gotta- be in here..." and then opens a pocket wide and finds a underwater lighter saying, "Yes, Now I can finish this." after he flickers the lighter and surrounds it in a small water bubble putting one hand on the bubble performs couple of handseals and shouting, "Water Style : Water Dragon Bullet!!!!!" a large amount of water formed into a giant, powerful dragon with the underwater lighter infused into the water is rushed at the almost-lifeless Hoshigaki the size of a large oak tree is expelled into the  Body of the Hoshigaki causing a large devasting wave of water covering alot of the forest with a small explosion of the underwater lighter inploding. After the water settles, He slowly floats down reverting from his Water Hydration Technique, Looking at the now officially lifeless corpse, with complete white eyes with -no- iris. of The Hoshigaki. Sirozan didn't waste no time giving the Hoshigaki pity and limped and buckled towards the Hidden Mist Village with required water inside his body.*

Mom: You haveing a good time?

Kid playing game: Yeah!

Mom: No video games for a week.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Zaku(Zaku49) was having an everyday day. Nothing special. He had just recenetely graduated from the Academy, and had a fresh new headband on his head. He smiled to himself in the Academy Mirror, and walked off. After a few minutes, he was home. He didn't really know what to do, so, he choose to sit down and chill. Chillin, two weird figures began to slither into his room.

As he heard the slithering noises he looked down at the  Briground, and noticed two slithering snakes. "Oh hell nah'. Ain't no mothafucking Snake gonna come up in MY place, fuck up MY house." As he said that, he grabbed ahold of a kunai in his holister, and instantly, threw one at the snake. It impaled one right in his chest, and he started at the other snake.

"Hsss..."

"Oh hell nah. You dyin' too." Zaku said. The snake then instantly attempted to slither off, but Zaku had ran at it, and grabbed ahold of the motherfucker. Picking him up, he picked the kunai up off the ground and said "Say your prayers." As he said that, he pointed the kunai at the snakes neck and it said "Wait!" As it said that, he looked at that mothafucking son of a bitch and said "Hmm?" He asked with curiousity.

"Please don't kill me! You just killed my wife! We just came here to the village to try and find someone help us!" The snake hissed. "Help you with what?" Zaku asked, with a puzzled look. "Help us leave our world, and find someone else!" The snake hissed on. "We need someone to work with us, so to speak!" As the snake said that, he looked at Zaku and said "I think you're the one we've been looking for." As the snake said that, he bit down on Zaku's lower thumb, and blood began to trinkle.

Looking at the blood, he threw the snake down onto the ground and said "The fuck was that for?!" As he asked that, he felt the blood continue to drop onto the ground. The snake smiled and said "Perrrffeeccctttt." As he said that, a piece of paper appeared from underneath the snake and he slitthered. "Sign your name.". Being cautious, Zaku did as he was told. Looking over at the paper the snake closed the paper, and ate it. "Perfect. Now boy. Do exactly as I say." As he said that, he explained the ability on how to summon snakes, and what not.

"Alright, this shit better work." Zaku said. Looking downwards, he began to execute a various number of handseals, and sent waves of chakra through his body. "Kuhsyise no Jutsu!" He yelled from the top of his lungs. Screaming that, he placed his arm face down, hand on the ground, and chakra emersed from his arm into his hand, onto the floor. A cloud of smoke appeared around Zaku, and as it disperessed, there stood bsedi him, a perfect snake. Smiling, he said "Thanks, Old Snake. What's your name again?" The snake looked at ihm and hissed "MananaManta."*

<br><font color=yellow>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) Tachi Tachi sighed as he sat infront of the large snake. This guy was seriously annoying. He talked about how his previous master was horribely untrained, and that I better be a better pupil. I told the giant snake to shut up about it as I bit my thumb. The snake raged more saying when I summoned it, it would demand a few sacrifices. He wrote his name on the scroll in blood as it poofed away. Next Tachi was sitting infront of his master, ready to learn how to summon.
 His teacher would demonstrate the many forms of summoning, Tachi and that giant snake known as Manda had a quick glareing contest. Tachi would sigh as he bit his thumb. He would get used to that. He placed his hands on the ground after a quick few handseals. As the smoke traveled through out the area, a little garden snake sized snake would be there. Tachi facepalmed as he had not the right amount of chakra to summon something bigger. His teacher simply pat him on the back, telling him to try again next time.
 As the two travelers went back to find a village to rest at, Tachi knew this was going to be the start of a grand adventure.**

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( It does Evan )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Wiki doesn't say Will can break it.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It's a Ninjutsu not a Gen.)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (No it doesn't)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Its strategy)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( eh urite )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( kay. One second )
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (did u guys rp?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) reached into her holster and pulled out three shuriken to throw at the Raikage while Evan was using his jutsu. It was only to throw her off while Evan did his jutsu and possibly aid with it working.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I used Temp Paralysis Technique on Wynny.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (So can I PR?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Or wait for Wynny.)'
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Hmmmm)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Waiting)
<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) smirks as she makes another ram seal. This time instead of dissappearing, her body is covered in a aura of lightning chakra. She literally dashes at Kurina as she does so. The jutsu catches her as she is a mere four inches away from her. "Heh, got me." She says smirking.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) looked quickly between the targets infront of himself. "They attacked you?"he whispered curiously as he looked upon the girl wearing the diplomatic uniform. "She's obviously the strongest...the other two seems like servants..."he'd think as he proccessed the thoughts quickly before raising his right hand upwards slowly infront of himself. "Heh where do you think your going?!"He shouted them truly curious, though a hint of cockiness could be heard within his voice. "You can't start a fight and then just leave!" Once saying so a river of blackened sand was released from the top of his gord quickly flowing infront of himself suspended.

Once the sand was out of its container Sotokon smirked as a collection of 5 rods shot foreward from the river of suspended sand infront of Sotokon twoard Cheren at an immense speed.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (LOL)

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (lul)
<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) is totally unharmed by the bitch sand. She grunts and spits up a bit of blood as the shuriken stab her through the gut. "Heh, such a welcome.." She says smiling.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Get that Super Genin shit outta here.)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Are you stupid..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Now then.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: If she dies...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Unseal me.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Than your chakra will be sealed forever.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (Would that require Shape Manip training?)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I'm not killing her.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Obviously.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: At this rate. She'll die.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (IT would require chakra control which the ngr has never been trained in.)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No she won't....
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: You just peirced her chest wide open.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (I have been trained)

<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: *gut
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: The shuriken are in her stomach.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Its the second level of Elemental training)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Why don't you look instead of speaking.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Lol Malcolm, you don't auto-master Chakra Control.)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Yes..I know.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: But still.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: It's not that fatal.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: The stomach is worst.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Manipulator means I can control my Iron sand well)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: It could be fatal.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Anyway.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Which is a certain chakra req.)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: If not treated.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Unseal me.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Dude no matter how much you bitch)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Your not gonna nerf me)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: How the hell did his shuriken cut through.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It doesn't mean you can sustain the shape and be able to pierce Lightning Armor.)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: My my iron sand didn't.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (WTF)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Shuriken breaks though?)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (But my Iron sand doesn't)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (This is BS)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (lul)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( Iron sand = Sand + Chakra. The chakra holds it together )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( shuriken = Real Steel )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (No)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (IRon sand is real iron)

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( smfh )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: Then why can't it break through?)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (>.>)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (If a fuckin weaker shruiken can)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( It splatters as the chakra is disrupted )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( sand doesnt lolpierce )
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: If you can't unseal me... Then you will stay here until you find a way too..
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Disrupted by what?)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( The fucking Raiton no yoroi )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (CHeren)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( -_- )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Distracted by sand causing opening in armor.)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (It pierces)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (GG)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Have you seen Naruto Shippuden?)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [This is stupid.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( ^ )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (I'm not saying it could break through Raiton No Yoroi)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( Then stfu )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Have you seen Lightning armor never being fully explained?)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (But it makes no sense)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (For shuriken to make it through)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) walks over towards Cheren, staring at her for a quick second, the samehada casually rested upon her right shoulder as she held its hilt firmly in hand. ".....Unseal her chakra...." she said calmly, staring her directly in the eyes, her crimson daggers all but soothing. *
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [Why are you arguing, when you already lost and you can't take it back.]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Do I have to?

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Sigh...I really would perfer to end this quickly...
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: <3]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Well...That'll take time...
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: No Love for you)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: First I have to -learn- how to do that.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Then I have to prepare the jutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Ugh! So much work..
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........

<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: It also takes time to increase chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: Oh well.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: Can we go now?
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: It takes time to make new jutsu...
