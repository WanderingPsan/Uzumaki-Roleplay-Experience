<br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) slowed his breath. His body quickly loosened as he fell to the earth, forcing himself into a meditative stance. Little by little his chakra flow slowed before finally comming to an abrupt halt. A swell of chakra gathered in Chiyari's deepest core, locked in a single place by the halted flow. It bubbled forth like rushign water attempting to burst through floodgates. Suddenly it was all released and sent rampaging through Chiyari's entire system. New chakra flushed out old and quickly removed any impurities in his system.

"Genjutsu: Kai!"* - Sun Aug 30 15:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) begins rythmically tapping his foot and hums to himself.* - Sun Aug 30 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) gives a thin smile.

"Of course. Such times are what I've been wishing for. Not just for myself, but everyone."

Chiyari straightened out his kimono as he thought.

"I believe there are ways to preserve said peace. At the very least, in the event of dreadful times, a way to restore said peace faster."* - Sun Aug 30 20:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) sends a messenger bird to whever it was suppose to go. Fly on little bird, fly.* - Sun Aug 30 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) felt Tetsumi's movements as he levitated into the air and left in order to scout the village. Having experienced events similiar before, the glissening man decided it best to do the same. He withdrew a single hand from his kimono befoore sliding his thumb across his canine's in one fluid motion. Red ichor poured from the wound and fell to the earth as he strug together his signature handseals. He quickly dropped low and smacked the ground with his dominant hand. Ominous black writing eminated from the origin that was his hand, spreading out into a circle. Suddenly a large puff of smoke followed suite.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu. . .>

As the smoke cleared, eight distinct four-legged creatures emerged from the conjuring. They were all unique Ninken of varying breed and form; a white mix between dog and wolf with red markings across his side and face, a hound sporting sunglasses, a confident husky, a peaceful border collie, a hyena-like bandaged mutt, a airheaded beagle and a large bulldog wearing a smaller black dog for a hat.

Chiyari extended his hand out, signaling them to scout the village and send an alert message to everyone unaware. The pack let out a howl in unision before taking off to perform their duties.* - Sun Aug 30 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) isolates himself from public of Sunagakure. It was time for him to begin advancing himself alongside his techniques. His mind quickly set itself upon mastering the Kai technique,h aving already made leaps and bounds of progress with it before. The man's hands quickly clasped together to form the seal required. He focused on his entire body, using his upmost concentrationg to halt his chakra flow. He then introduced a new, powerful burst of chakra that'd surge through his entire system. It pushed out old chakra and cleansed his system.

"Genjutsu: Kai!"* - Mon Aug 31 18:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) didn't let up as he immediaetly went for another attempt at the technique. His hands did the same gestures as ebfore, albeit slightly faster. His mind also narrowed and focused itself upon a single action much sooner. Chakra gathered inside his system before bursting forth, starting its flow once more His lips parted in the same instance as he called out the techniques name.

"Kai!"* - Mon Aug 31 18:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) cotninued dishing out the technique left and right. With each use came greater understanding and overall improvement. His speed at executing the technique was becoming faster bit by bit, even if the increments were in miliseconds. The faster the better he thought, while also wishing to keep the same effect he had on using the technique before. Another important factor was how much chakra he'd use in performing the Kai technique. He was aiming to achieve the same results with less chakra used.

"Kai!"* - Mon Aug 31 18:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) just repeated the same dull process. There wasn't much to say about it as it was just performing the technique to the best of his ability while improving little by little. He did keep in mind the exact execution times of each one he did, comparing it to the last using muscle memory and such. The silver man went about doing the technique a few more times, clenching his hand in the designatet seal. His chakra halted and soon a new surge bursted forth to purify his sytem.

"Genjutsu: Kai!"* - Mon Aug 31 18:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) throws Yan a scroll.* - Tue Sep 01 16:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tsukino, Chiyari(Guujin) shuffles through a few scrolls before throwing one towards Izanami's direction.* - Tue Sep 01 16:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) gives a nod in acknowledgement of Izanami. He threw the young girl her reward.

"Good work."* - Tue Sep 01 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Don't Participate in Kumogakure's Hunt for Hiru. - Tue Sep 01 18:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Orakuru(Sawada-Tsu) whispers: Good. - Tue Sep 01 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) knew it was Dravae.* - Tue Sep 01 18:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) takes a moment to calm himself. It was clear he did not approve of Edge and his ways. His senses reached out, taking note of Orakuru. The silver man made a graceful stride beside him before handing him a scroll.

"I think you should read this. . ."* - Tue Sep 01 23:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) throws a scroll Ai's way.

"There you go."* - Wed Sep 02 00:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) twitches his ears as Krono's words vibrated across his ear drum. A familiar presence entered his senses. The silver man gave a small frown, as if recalling something.

"Who is it?"* - Wed Sep 02 00:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) gives a brief sigh before  excusing himself from Orakuru and Osamu. He'd take up a position directly across Kronos. A silence followed suite as Chiyari took a moment to gather his thoughts. However, after a few emotional memories, Chiyari's face contorted into a more serious manner than usual. His hand dug deep into the confines of his kimono before withdrawing an old mask. Dry, caked blood still covered the mask.

"I recognize you for more than any newspaper. Why are you here? Surely you don't wish to cause more trouble. . ."

Chiyari threw the mask towards Kronos's direction. On closer inspection, it was clear it belonged to Tategama.* - Wed Sep 02 00:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) twitches his ears as Kronos flutters the remainder of Tategama's outfit towards him. Chiyari hoists it up and sniffs at the air, catching the familiar scent. It was old, yet still gave off the hint of Death. This was something those in Sunagakure were much too acustomed to.

The glissening man put the items away for later as he turned towards Kronos's direction. His porcelain lips parted and wise words seemed to spill out.

"Had to die? Surely this was only to quell your own rage. When Tategama died, Sunagakure lost a great deal. It was dealt a poor hand, merely for your revenge or hate."

Chiyari narrowed his useless eyes.

"You say you wish to return and make it whole, but how do you plan to acomplish that? You only know of Death and Destruction. Such a path is what we're trying to stray from as it is now. We are seeking a more just future. . ."

He let out a sigh.

"I do not share in the same weakness as you. I won't seek revenge for Tategama's death. Rather, I'll seek peace for everyone else and honor those that have perished. Should you truely wish to return to Sunagakure, then you must prove you have changed."* - Wed Sep 02 00:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) raises a brow as the sack of yen hits his hand. He was not one to excuse a person of their past through a bribe.

"I'll only accept this as a means to further improve our village. . .you still have things to prove before all can be forgiven."

Chiyari places the sack of yen deep into the confines of his kimono before facing towards Kronos. A heavenly voice followed suite, laced with serious value.

"Kronos, what has transpired in the past can never be undone. The deaths of many will forever weigh upon your shoulder. However, redemption is not impossible. You must move forward and work in memory of their souls. If you have truly changed, then devote yourself to the betterment of not only Sunagakure, but also a better future."

Chiyari repositioned his kimono before gesturing a hand out towards Kronos. A heavy aura shrouded the silver man's visage, marked by his benevolence.

"Kronos, here and now, I wish for you to make an Oath. An Oath demonstrating your loyalty to both Sunagakure and all its inhabitants. Your power will not be used to Destroy. .  No, it must be reformed to Protect. Only through such means can you seriously pave the way towards a better Suna."* - Wed Sep 02 20:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) listens curiously. The fact that Kronos would be taking the gezo exam was a bit of a surprise, but it was also an adequate step should he truly wish to help the village.

"Is that so? Should you succeed then Suna's position will escalate considerably."* - Wed Sep 02 20:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) quickly enters a more serious mood. It seems war was once again upon them. However, they had made preparations for such. Chiyari's hands quickly withdrew from his kimono as he slid a thumb across his canines. Blood mixed with his hand as familiar handseals were strung. Suddenly he smacked down hard upon the ground.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu. . .>

Eight distinct Ninken were conjured forth. The silver man gave them orders and quickly waved his hand, sending them out on their mission. The Ninken qould quickly form a long, complicated information network in order to alert all personel in the village as well as those in the outpost just outside Suna. The heat was on.

"Yes, everyone prepare for what's to come."* - Wed Sep 02 20:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Glissening silver suddenly appeared upon the mountainous walls that enclosed the village of Sunagakure. There stood a single man, his porcelain skin shimmering unnaturally under the sun's rays. A thin frown was seen upon his face, his hand gesturing out towards the distance. His ears twitched in response to the booming presence of a foreign army in the distance.

"Again our village is the target of those akin to Darkness. . . "

A single Ninken appeared beside Chiyari, feeding him information. The man nodded before sending out the single. His shinobi gathered in various places around the gate to fight what was to come.

"We will not let them do as they wish. . . Let us be the light that cleanses the treachery that attack us today!"

Suddenly heavy movement could be heard from the North, an entirely seperate force from any other announced.
//

Towering Demonic masses of energy raored through his senses. The kimono-clad man quickly put up his defences as his body pushed itself instinctively. His aim was downwards in an attempt to traverse the mountain and slide down alongside his trusted companion.* - Wed Sep 02 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) turns his senses on full blast. As he slides down the mountain, his sensory field expands out, picking up nearby nuiances in chakra. The chakra signature belonging to the enemy's leader was pinpointed, his movements quickly diverting away from the gate and closer towards Chiyari during his descent. His target's movements, sudden chakra manipulation and overall actions sends his body on alert. The silver man twitches his ears as the earth rumbles and emits chakra. His mind races as he acts with precision, twisting his body along the mountain as the pillars finally make their move. They converge from four angles, all in an attempt to impale Chiyari at a single point. This would prove in their disadvantage as the reflexive man quickly rolls in a manner away from radius before leaping off the wall and propelling himself through the already stuck pillars. He'd land with a thud upon the soil's surface, his head cocked towards Zetsumo's general direction

"So this is the Darkness Edge has flocked too. . ."

Chiyari wasted no time as he withdrew a hand, sliding his thumb across his canines. The blood smeared across his hands as he strung together his signature handseals in rapid succession.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu. . .>

A single Ninken was conjured forth, hyena-like in nature. Bandages wrapped all around the creature, except for the dog's ears, muzzel and eyes. It gave a cackling howl before darting down further South.

"Now!"

At his command, a group of Chiyari's most loyal Shinobi sprung from the lower end of the mountain, around 100. They'd leap off the mountain before confronting Zetsumo and the lot near him. A large spew of wind and fire would head their direction.

Chiyari himself would observe the battle while keeping his distance from Zetsumo, taking in valuable information, enemy locations and key points in this battle. He seemed to be more of the thinking type.
//

One of the massive forces at Sunagakure's forces had finally arrived. A massive wall of roaring bandits lined the North, fully prepared to engage the forces Zetsumo had brought with him. They seemed fearless, ready to give their best. There seemed to be at least a couple thousand of them. (Not the force Orakuru was talking about)

* - Wed Sep 02 22:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) dojs. Fuck your speed.* - Wed Sep 02 22:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) omit* - Wed Sep 02 22:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Agile movements aided him in the escape of Zetsumo's pillars, but during his evasion black-tendrils threatened to invade his personal space. His senses reared up as did the hair on the back of his neck. Quick, spontaneous thinking occured as Chiyari deduced his next course of action. His useless eyes snapped open as his body performed minute tasks in response to a destined plan. His hand had reached into the confines of his kimono, pulled out a single kunai and launched it towards the tentacles location. Without time to spare, the tag attached to it would explode, providing both concusive force and a double-edged defense against Zetsumo's tentacles.

The force behind the explosion propelled Chiyari away, no doubt crashing towards the ground in a violent matter. He'd be left momentarily stunned from such a reckless manevure, but not without aide. 50 sum troops responded to  Chiyari's threat and made their way towards their leader. They were loyal to his cause and prepared to stop the evil at hand.

"Protect him with your life!"

// Meanwhile, the one hundred troops already down the mountain continued to engage Zetsumo's forces. They clashed with the Amegakure shinobi, pelting them with a combined effort of fire and wind, while keeping a keen eye on any suspicious threats. (South)

Two thousand invigorated bandits shouted cries of war as they engaged the forces from the North. Many of them charged with sword and spear in hand, their eyes demanding blood, yet their hearts wishing peace. This reformed lot seemed passionate about having a new place in society; the portection of Sunagakure. (North)* - Wed Sep 02 23:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) forced himself off the ground as a small 50 man force surrounded him. He shook his head and quickly extended his senses out, pinpointing locations of various individuals. Boths allies and enemies appeared before his mind's eye, two in particular comming in full force. Suddenly they descended upon them, accompanied by a group set to counteract the forces surrounding Chiyari. They played smart, preparing their assault in groups. 30 of them met face to face with the Amegakure shinobi. Another 10 provided them with backup and cover fire, mainly with Wind jutsu.

10 others set their goal on protecting their leader as Paine whirled about and forced her way towards Chiyari's location. No doubt she'd be met with much opposition, hindering her first bee-line assault towards the silver man. Chiyari on the other hand observed her movements and acted accordingly. He'd quickly back up and draw three shuriken, before throwing them towards her direction while she combated her way through the mob. With his free hand he withdrew a kunai and flipped it, prepared to use it as a countermeasure.

"Tssk. . .this isn't my strong suite."


//
The hundred sum shinobi would be joined by Teyth's and his own men. Their morale swiftly bolstered at the sight of reinforcements. They continued to do their job and keep Konoha's forces at bay. (South)

//
In the North, the bandits cotninued to clash, sword and spear standing strong. Their formation was organized, a set frontline forcing to strongarm any in their path while not allowing any to pass beyond them. Further back stood archers, preparing to descend a hellish valley upon those unsuspecting. Their way of warefare was much different, but both their experience and numbers proved great.

Note: Movement along the walls and further North could be heard.
* - Thu Sep 03 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) kept his ever observant concentration upon the one known as Paine. He took careful note of her movements as she seemed to twirl about the group of men safeguarding Chiyari. There was a great deal of concern for their wellfare, but he had faith in his Shinobi. During the entire ordeal, Chiyari would no doubt learn a great bit about the opponent he currently faces. He reflexively dodged the tumbling shinobi sent his way, drawing the kunai back. He was prepared.

Suddenly Paine hoisted off the ground, aimed to knock Chiyari on his ass. However her intent was given away after careful observation and Chiyari acted accordingly. Due to her aerial nature, it was as simple as out maneuvering her. Chiyari quickly dropped low to the ground and applied peassure to his legs. This sent him flying back and out Paine's way, although abrely. In the same fluid motion, he'd take his drawn kunai and slice it across his hand. He swiped his hand across the air, spraying the red ichor towards Paine's location while also disposing of the kunai by chucking it at her.

With the added distance, his hands went about in a flurry to perform very familiar handseals. Sacrifice was made and in turn, power given. A rumble could be heard as his hand smashed the ground before much else could be done.

Play time was over.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu!>

Black sprawling extended from his hand as an origina, covering up the area. Suddenly, a large puff of smoke was conjured forth and in its wake was a massive, 17 meter four-legged shadow. As it cleared, a large Ninken could be seen and Chiyari atop its head. The Saint Bernard gave a howl before narrowing its sights upon Paine.

"Protection?"

Chiyari patted it and nodded.

"They seek to cast a veil of Darkness upon our village."* - Thu Sep 03 01:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) calls forth Sand Turtle from Konoha. . . in Sunagakure.* - Thu Sep 03 01:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) omit* - Thu Sep 03 01:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) managed to free himself from the cavern thing, still sitting atop Mamoru's head. The giant dog scaled the wall and scanned the general vicinity. The scene was merely death and destruction, the same stuff he had wanted to avoid. Perhaps it would of been wiser to hand Orakuru over, but even then their village wouldn't of been safe. It was only a matter of time, something he wish they had more of----

Suddenly his senses went on full alert. A familiar dread washed over him as a monstrou ammount of chakra was detected in the distance. Chiyari turned his head towards the masses direction. It was Tetsumi.

"Tssk. . "

Chiyari gestured towards Mamoru. In turn, the giant Ninken turned its sights on Tetsumi. Its paw smacked hard against the ground, causing a small rumble. In the same process, a giant keg began sculpting itself around Tetsumi. If succesful, it'd take the form of a beer keg with a paw print imprinted on it. It was  an attempt to contain Tetsumi before he caused further damage. The keg itself was as durable as steel. (18)* - Thu Sep 03 02:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) is busy trying to contain Tetsumi.* - Thu Sep 03 02:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) wore an ever present frown upon his face. He could sense Tetsumi's built up rage, the beast's chakra sprawling forth and assaulting his senses. Without a single thought, Chiyari motioned for Mamoru to leap off the cliff and recover Tetsumi.

The giant Ninken quickly swept up the Paw Keg Prison, detaching it from the earth. It held it firmly inside its mouth before sprinting off into the desert. Chiyari was trying to distance the crazed Tetsumi before their village was outright destroyed.

"Why. . Why is this happening again? We can't move forward like this. . ."

Thoughts continued to plague the silver man's mind as he performed his duty.* - Thu Sep 03 02:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Chiyari and Mamoru kept on their path, forcing themselves beyond their limits to continue distancing themselves. The sound of Tetsumi's drill could be heard scraping against the keg; a sign of the inevitable. Chiyari loweres his head as he continued recalling the events that just transpired. Not only did their village suffer yet another debilitating blow, but Kronos was slain. He had swore a new path only moments before the war went down, but yet he still perished. Perhaps this was true atonement for his sins, for the innocents he killed as well as Tategama.

"Gah. . . what can we do?"

Chiyari felt the full weight of the village upon his shoulders. It was nearly crushing him. . .* - Thu Sep 03 03:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || The keg gave way to Tetsumi's might, the drill penetrating it's exterior. Chiyari gave a single order to Mamoru as one final call. Before Tetsumi could completely escape, Mamoru would throw the keg. In turn Chiyari and the giant Ninken started turning back towards the village. They had done what they could and managed to at least distance Tetsumi from the village.

Chiyari kept his senses sharp, clearly keeping track of Tetsumi's chakra signature. He was assuring he wouldn't head back towards the village and turn on it. This wasn't the case however, as he floated further into the desert.

"This is for the best. . I don't have the power to stop him nor does Suna have a force worth risking. . "

The silver man bit his lip as he turned his back and left the scene. There was much more to be done.* - Thu Sep 03 03:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: We will talk about that when we can. - Thu Sep 03 20:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) draws both arms into the confines of his kimono, resting them in a crossed fashion. He nodded towards Yan before getting off the bench. The silver man seemed to effortlessly lead the way towards a further location in the village.

"Lets go."* - Thu Sep 03 22:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) stops in his tracks just before the North wall of their village. The area seemed secluded enough, void of any other inhabitants aside from a single stout tree. He gave a nod before gracefuly spinning around to face Yan. His dominant hand withdrew from his kimono and beckoned it towards the boy.

"First thing you must do is sign a contract with your animal. You said you had your brother's scroll, correct? In that case, bring it out. Unravel it and find a suitable place to place your name. It must be done in blood, accompanied by a single stamp using the tips of all your fingers."

Chiyari slit a gash into his thumb. He quickly dabbed each finger in the red liquid before presenting it to Yan.

"Like this."* - Thu Sep 03 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) twitched his ears as Yan went about his business. He could hear the unravelling of papyrus followed by Yan's words. He could only assume Yan had managed to perform the trivial task of signing his name utilizing his own blood.

"Yes, that's probably good."

The silver man nodded before parting his porcelain lips once more.

"Now, on to the actual technique. The process itself is quite simple, but its innerworkings are complicated and require both precision, knowledge and chakra prowess. Adequate chakra control must be kneaded through your core accompanied by a sizeable amount of chakra. Your own pools are vast however, so I have high hopes for you."

Chiyari withdrew his hand in preparation before continuing.

"Here's the process. First, take your thumb or any other digit and draw blood from it. Swiftly wipe said blood across your hand as part of the contract's payment. Next, begin kneading your chakra in preparaton. From there you quickly perform these designated handseals in order;Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Ram."

Chiyari mimicked the movements as he spoke of them. His thumb quickly swiped across his canines, drawing blood. He then performed the handseals slowly so Yan could study his movements.

"Finally, you smack your hand upon a hard surface and allow the summoning circle to form. Call out to your bonded contract with your heart during this process. If all went well, a creature should respond to your plea."

He smacked his hand hard upon the earth and allowed black markings to sprawl forth upon the ground. A puff of smoke followed after as one of Chiyari's loyal Ninken appeared in its place. It was Ioshi, a complete white, wolf-like Ninken with red decorative marking lined across its sides and face.

* - Thu Sep 03 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) observed Yan's progress. It seemed his student was indeed making progress, however flaws were apparent. Aside from just performing the ritual, a few key factors weren't being considered. As such the regal man spoke up and conveyed his words of wisdom.

"Hmm. . .I can feel your chakra building, but perhaps too much so. Remember, for this technique it isn't just about putting as much as you can into it, but rather finding a fine line between too little and too much. Keep that in mind. Your body should get the hang of it soon enough."* - Thu Sep 03 23:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) gave a thin smile as Yan continued to improve. His progress was making leaps and bounds in such a way that impressed Chiyari. No doubt he'd prove a valuable addition to Sunagakures forces in the future. Chiyari was still clinging in hope that their village could make it past their current barrier.

His senses continued to analyze Yan's performance. Chakra flared up as the youngling smacked the ground, pouring into the earth. His ears twitched as it seemed something was actually summoned. He was doing it.

"Oho. . "

The conjured creature was poor however, its size and chakra exceptionally small in nature. He couldn't see it, but he assumed it was a tad pole.

"Keep it up."

It still was a mystery why people asked him to look at things. Hue.* - Thu Sep 03 23:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) curiously raised a brow as Yan executed his final movements. A heap of chakra bloomed from with in the young boy before expanding out towards the ground. The technique gave a loud puff in lieu of anything else. Suddenly another chakra signature was conjured forth from the boy's succeful summoning attempt; a small Toad. His thin smile remained as he nodded in acknowledgement of Yan's accomplishment. Chiyari placed a gentle hand upon his companion, Ioshi's, head as they both observed the interaction between Yan and the newly summoned Toad.

"Mmm. . .you did it, Yan. You've met my expectations and then some. Keep it up, because the future of Suna will need those like you."

Chiyari gave a respectful head bow towards the Toad.

"Greetings. I am Chiyari, current guardian of Sunagakure. I taught Yan the basics of Summoning."* - Thu Sep 03 23:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) felt that his work was done. With that, he'd wave to the boy and make his exit. It was time he did some training and learning himself.* - Fri Sep 04 00:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) stopped in his tracks as he came upon his desired location. He scanned over the great walls that surrounded Suna, detecting no life. With his conscious clear, he'd begin his work. Instantly his hand formed together to perform handseals he had completely mastered over the years. They were the seals designated to the Kuchiyose no Jutsu. He quickly smacked the ground and called out.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"

A great deal of chakra was spent as a very large summoning circle expanded out from the impact. Suddenly Chiyari would find himself high up in the air, overlooking his surroundings with nothing to see. He was now atop a large Saint Bernard's head.

"Mamoru, lets make our bond stronger. I'll need you aid in the future."

The large Ninken gave a booming bark.

"Of course!"* - Fri Sep 04 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Mamoru kneeled down closer to the ground. This allowed Chiyari to leap off at a safe distance. Soon after he gave Mamoru's fur a pat before allowing him to poof back. This allowed Chiyari to set-up a second summon attempt.

Chiyari formed the designated handseals and dropped low to the ground. His hand impacted the earth and out came the hefty summoning circle. Suddenly he felt mildly nautious as a large consumption of chakra left his body, already forcing him at his limits. It was clear he had to work on manipulating his chakra in such a way that'd allow a better fit.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Fri Sep 04 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) was forced to take a break every few attempts due to the draining nature of the technique. Summoning such a large creature through space and time was no easy task, requiring both a great deal of effort, chakra and precision. However, bit by bit he'd improve through both studying and actual experience. His body would make minute adjustments each time, although the progress was minimal.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"

He heaved.

"This is difficult. . ."* - Fri Sep 04 00:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) continued to perform the technique bit by bit. He'd be forced to rest, as mentioned before, very often due to how taxing it was. During this time his mind would wander, recalling past events. Each moment flashed in his mind as a slew of auditory information and sensory memory. It was definetly different than how a person with vision recalls things, but such was his cirumstance. It was very surreal.

Emotions welled up, mostly depressing. Their village had been through so much and knowed little of happiness. He wished to change this, but to do so he had to further improve himself so he could better safeguard both his beloved village and irreplaceable citizens.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Fri Sep 04 01:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) cotninued to replicate the process. It was interesting just how similiar the process was across a wide range of techniques. Although each hade different variables about them, making it also very different. However, the current method he was using was really universal. By simply using the technique a wide range of times and fine tuning the basics, one could improve vastly. Although complete mastery was a different story.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu>

Handseals, Chakra Molding, Execution and other factors would be greatly looked at and fine tuned depending on how poorly he was doing them.* - Fri Sep 04 01:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Took a moment to rest. His body arched back before falling in the sand. His blank eyes stared upwards towards the heavens, taking in the Sun's rays. Sensations bombarded the silver man as his mind continued pikcing apart every  action he performed pertaining Mamoru's summon. He nitpicked specific details and rules others out. It was clear that he was performing the handseals and summoning ritual perfectly, living little for improvement on that end. He had, of course, trained in Summoning for years so such was to be expected.

"Hmmm. . ."* - Fri Sep 04 01:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) forced himself back up and wiped sweat from his brow.Chiyari's right thumb slid across his canines, pushing forth the required blood. His hands contorted as they performed Boar, Dog, BIrd, Money and Ram in order. The execution was both accurate and speedy. His legs fell to the earth as his hand made contact with the terra-form. Sand kicked up in response to a large summoning circle calling forth Mamoru, a 17 meter Ninken.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu>* - Fri Sep 04 01:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) smashed his hand against the earth. It shook in response to his execution. An enormous summoning circle enveloped the area around the silver man and smoke plumed skywards. Suddenly a massive shadow seemed to loom over the area. The smoke cleared and in its passing stood a large seventeen meter Saint Bernard. It's fur was sand colored and seemed to sport a brown jacket labeled with a paw print.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu>

During the process, Chiyari's ears had twitched in response to Yan's voice. He now looked down from atop the large Ninken's head. His hand reached inside the confines of his kimono and withdrew a scroll. He then chucked it towards his location.* - Fri Sep 04 01:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) watched as Yan set off to complete the task Chiyari had assigned him. He patted Mamoru's fur beneath him as he took time to think. Simply having the large summon out was taxing in its own way, slowly draining chakra from its summoner. Perhaps he could work on improving that, but for now it was best to just perfect the ritual and deplenish the initial chakra used to summon Mamoru.

"Mmm. . ."

Chiyari tapped Mamoru on the head as he poofed in a cloud of smoke.* - Fri Sep 04 01:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) decided to dual train a bit since he had both the time and chakra. With that, he quickly put both hands together. Chakra welled up inside his body in response to his chakra flow abruptly stopping. He'd briefly concentrate before allowing the built up chakra to explode inside his body. It rushed through his system and quickly expunged the 'dirt' from his chakra flow.

"Kai!"

After, he began executing the ritual for the Kuchiyose no Jutsu. His hand withdrew from his kimono and slit across his canines, drawing blood. It smeared across his hand as he performed the four seals required for the technique. He smacked the ground and conjured up the giant Ninken known as Mamoru.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Fri Sep 04 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) stood tall atop Mamoru's head. In continuation with his training, his hands stuck together once more. He did the same process as before as he gathered chakra inside his system while also halting the flow of his chakra. It was strange to do both tasks at once, but such was necessary in making the jutsu more efficient. He concentrated a great deal before finally refreshing his system with a new burst of chakra.

"Kai!"

He wiped the sweat from his forehead as he looked down over the barren landscape. He motioned for Mamoru to kneel down in order from Chiyari to jump off. The massive dog nodded in response and fell to the earth, shaking the ground with a small rumble. After all was well, Chiyari leaped off and patted Mamoru. This forced Mamoru to return to his own realm, so that Chiyari can practice once more in calling him.* - Fri Sep 04 13:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Chakra flourished through his system. Chiyari was altering the way he manipulated his chakra as well as how much. It was a very intricate process, full of eliminating one strain and trying another. He found that certain amounts worked better than others and how they were executed also mattered. So many combinations were present before him, but he had to find the perfect one for his own body. As such he cotninued to use his techniques, putting his keen intelligence and scholarly nature to work. Suddenly his system was expunged of impurities as a burst of chakra enveloped him.

"Kai!"

He'd continue this same process, following up with a more taxing use of the Kuchiyose no Jutsu. He'd focus his very being as his blood fell to the earth. Handseals were strung and chakra molded in a new way different from the last. Suddenly chakra left his hand and entered the Earth to form a black circle.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Fri Sep 04 13:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) continued with the repeated process. It wasn't anything special in reality, since most of the progress he was making was through muscle memory and learning. His mind and body were both being strained in order to improve on each technique. By using both the Kai technique and Summoning technique in conjection, was able to form a better grasp on just how important chakra count and manipulation was. The latter required a great deal more chakra, but Chiyari also felt that he could lessen it with enough pinpoint control. The task was very difficult though as seen by how many attempts it was taking him to actually make notable progress.* - Fri Sep 04 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) smacked his hands together. The Kai technique was a valuable tool in regaining control over one's chakra system and eliminating the threat of Genjutsu. With it mastered, one could find considerable use down the road. That's exactly why Chiyari was further developing the technique in conjunction with his more serious summoning move. Both were an asset. As such his body surged with chakra, overwhelming his system. It pushed out the old chakra by force while altering his overall chakra flow. It was sort of like a 'reset' button.

Chiyari worked on his next technique right after, Summoning. His blood was already drawn as it seeped from the wound, covered his hands and fell to the earth. Such a sacrifice was necessary in order to call upon a creature from another plane. His hands did the usual seals before impacting the ground and forming the magically summoning circle.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu. . >* - Fri Sep 04 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) felt a surge of accomplishment. He could tell that his progress was paying off and in regards to the Kai ability, all that was needed was one final push to improve his general mastery. There was innovation set as a new idea popped in his mind. Surely through this he'd be able to save on its chakra drain while upping its actual dissipation effect. Without further notice he put his plan in action. His hands formed a single seal as the rest of his body entered a temporary meditative stance. His chakra flow quickly halted in prepartion for the well of chakra that swirled inside his very core. All it once it exploded in an organized fashion, surging through his system in vital chakra points. This was what he was referring to, by accurately targeting specific points instead of just overwhelming his entire system. His body was soon refreshed.

"Kai!"

Chiyari gave a small grin before doing the summoning ritual. His mind became even more focused as his heart called to the one known as Mamoru. Blood was offered as payment and his bond deep. Handseals were done and his hand smashed the ground perfectly. A large black circle appeared from the impact point and swiftly conjured the large Ninken.* - Fri Sep 04 13:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) totally gave Orakuru his fancy clothes.* - Sat Sep 05 00:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: How does a barrier around the village sound? - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: That sounds like an outstanding idea. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: After Zetsumo's last attack, everything is needed. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: But I wiill need someone else who is a fuuinjutsu specialist.. Aside myself, due to the effects of this barrier I will create.. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I will also need a unit of trap specilist. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Because I have a lot of scrolls with many of my jutsu sealed off within them.. - Sat Sep 05 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) was being bombarded with stuff. He took care of them one at a time.* - Sat Sep 05 00:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) sighs.

"Don't be surprised when Teyths comes looking for whoever was involved."* - Sat Sep 05 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) is deep in thought as he weighs his and the village's options. He wished to find an answer that would be for the sake of not only his citizens and shinobi, but also the World. The opportunity laid before him was laced with potential, but also carried risk. Was it really worth it?

Chiyari debated in his mind, recalling past incidents and looking over the current state they were in. He had remembered just how foolish he had been in the past in regards to Edge. Chiyari's own lack of action and indecisiveness was already to blame for Tatsumi's death and any future casualties caused by Edge. His useless eyes snapped open and he nodded.

He would be indecisive no longer. He had to make up his mind or else leading the world towards Peace would always remain a dream. Only with action could one make dream become reality, so that was what he would do.

"Very well, Orakuru. You are right, Zetsumo must be brought down. For the sake of our village and the world. Sunagakure will join in this joint expedition between villages. No doubt this will lay the groundwork for Peace between us three."

He repositioned his kimono as he stood their, miind filled with new-found wisdom.

"Are any notable parties personally participating? Tetyhs? Niklaus?"* - Sun Sep 06 16:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) twitches his ears towards Yan's voice. He took note of the foreign signature as it entered his range of 'vision.' Chiyari's head turned to face towards their general direction. His porcelain lips soon parted and well-taught, heavenly words followed.

"Who is our guest?"* - Sun Sep 06 16:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) turns his head towards the arrival's general direction.

"As should be expected of one still recovering from war and other misfortunes."* - Sun Sep 06 17:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) sighs.* - Sun Sep 06 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) blinks a few times as he listens to Teyths. The whole scene was rather uncalled for. Now it seems a six year old was to be the deciding factor in whether their so-called ally attacked them or not. A headache threatened his being, but such was his responsibility. It was rather odd when you think about, since Orakuru was just here speaking of such.

The glissening man repositioned his kimono as he prepared to take a more formal deamnor. Whether Teyths was playing them for fools or not, things needed to be conveyed and wise words spoken. His lips parted as his heavenly voice followed suit.

"Teyths, please pay the girl no mind. She is merely a child and knows not what she speaks."

Chiyari took a step beside Izanami to place a firm hand on her head.

"Be good, ok?"

After his brief reprimand he'd look back towards Teyth's sensed position. A thin smile formed on his face.

"Your aid over the years is appreciated, I assure you. Even now you and your village has proven themselves an ally and a friend to Sunagakure. Please, don't take my lack of response as me being distant. It's just we are struggling as I'm sure you're aware of. The weight can be a little heavy. . . "

He takes a breath before closing the gap between himself and Teyths.

"I wish Peace between us all. As such, should your deal still stand, I'll graciously accept it. Let us take this new-found bond between our villages and levy it to greater heights. And, one day, I hope you'll take it upon yourself to call me a friend."

Chiyari extends a hand towards the man, his smile pronounced and his aura heavy. Heavy with warmth, positivity and benevolence.* - Sun Sep 06 17:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) discerned Teyth's current attitude and temperment from the sound of his voice and bodily actions, rather than his face. His hand withdrew back into the confines of his kimono as the regal man gave head nod. He wasn't fond of Teyths roughness, but appreciated that he was a man of character. It seems Lady Kastya was laying the groundwork for their Peace from beyond the grave. This made him genuinely happy.

"Of course. Suna welcomes both the military aid and peace renewal as much as Kiri does. Peace between our villages should be considered sacred."

Chiyari motions for some random attendent to fetch their village's finest liquor. No doubt it would be the last of its kind presently, due to the harsh times they were dealt.* - Sun Sep 06 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) glances over towards Izanami and then back at Teyths.* - Sun Sep 06 17:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Chiyari-sama, we can't let Tethys die here.. - Sun Sep 06 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: Of course not. . . - Sun Sep 06 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: It seems we have to intervene. - Sun Sep 06 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Say the word. - Sun Sep 06 19:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chiyari(Guujin) whispers: Assist Teyths. - Sun Sep 06 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) narrows his lifeless eyes as a range of information floods his person. Auditory, sensory and a range of other senses. His hands withdraw from his kimono and a small frown forms on his face.

"These people come to our village and start conflict. . . where are there manners?"

Without haste his thumb slides across his canine, drawing fresh blood. The red liquid smears between his hands as he performs his signature handseals with precision. Chakra welled up inside his core in response to his next action. His hand firmly smashed against the ground, calling forth a large black circle that envelops the ground around his person. Suddenly the ground shakes and a fountain of smoke pours forth. . . A loud howl breaks through the smoke, revealing a seventeen meter Ninken sporting a Suna inspired jacket with a Paw print symbol. Ontop of its massive head stood Chiyari, who called out to everyone in the area.

"You lot will stop this at once. This ordeal is to be done between Teyths and Hirusho. Any further intervention will be an act of ill will towards the village of Sunagakure. If you truly believe you can afford to make the entire village your enemy, then so be it."

Chiyari lets out a sigh. This sucked.* - Sun Sep 06 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) remained atop the large Ninken's head. He kept an observant 'eye' upon the situation as certain people stepped down. He knew he had to allow Teyths and Hirusho to work it out themselves or nothing would be solved. However, should one's life become endangered he'd be sure to be there as a barrier. Until then he waited.* - Sun Sep 06 19:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) turned towards Orakuru's appearance. They both would have to be atop the seventeen meter Ninken's head.

"Mmm. . you made it back. It seems Teyths and Hirusho are fighting in a rather dangerous manner. I'm not sure what it's about, but they need to be stopped."* - Sun Sep 06 19:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) had someone get said liquor. He still wanted that two million though. Suna needs that MULAH.* - Sun Sep 06 20:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Pssst.. - Sun Sep 06 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: What are you guys...doing? - Sun Sep 06 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Somone's going to die? - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Isn't..killing...bad? - Sun Sep 06 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Mmm... - Sun Sep 06 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) scruffed his hands together before smashing the Earth, Ninken sporting sand-colored jackets were conjured forth. They'd howl in unision before taking off in various directions, searching out villagers and giving information for them to take refuge in the manner. Like wise, troops would be notified of the impending expedition.* - Sun Sep 06 20:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Tre sanders) whispers: Stay in the mansion or hidden tunnel witht the REAL me.. - Sun Sep 06 20:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) appeared beside the rest, his elegance shining below as he sensed the battlefield below. The clash of metal and smell of blood overwhelmed his senses, chakra signatures flickering away by the moment. A small frown formed on the regal man's face as he observed the scene. Old memories remerged from the back of his mind. A single tear trickles down the man's right cheek.

"How sad. .  Once again we've cast ourselves into the flames of war. I pray for our safety and lay rest the souls that have already fallen from both sides. .  We bring Justice here in order to lay down the foundations necessary for a lasting Peace."

He gave a passionate breath before signaling towards the force around him.

"Spare any civilians you encounter today! Their is no Justice is murdering the innocent! Let us display just how honorable we truly are. The Bright Jewel that is Sunagakure!"* - Sun Sep 06 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) tapped his foot against the ground, his ears twitching and senses tingling. An Illusionary map outlined itself in the back of his mind as he kept an observant 'eye' upon the conflict. Very familiar, dark signatures sprouted towards the South. His head cocked towards its vicinity. He knew them, having sensed such similiar feelings before. It was Zetsumo and his gang. This sent his body on end, forcing his reflexes into gear. His keen mind switched gears, preparing to expect the unexpected. Suddenly he caught whiff of enormous chakra flare ups, forcing him to react.

"Come with me!"

In that moment Chiyari bursted forth, taking a group of shinobi with him. They'd force their way through the fray and away from the massive storm of attacks. It seems they were acting on their own agenda. Mid break he'd draw blood from his thumb and perform a familiar ritual. Suddenly his hand smacked the ground, forming a circle. In turn eight distinct Ninken were summoned forth, all wearing Suna inspired jackets with Paw prints on them. They growled as they followed thei master, aiding in the sudden rush.* - Sun Sep 06 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Flames plumed across the area, its searing heat radiating across the battlefield. Chiyari bit his lips as he pushed his body to its limit, however such was not enough to completely avoid the destructive might the Demonic entities spewed from their cavernous mouths. The flames trickled across various parts of the man's body, lighting scarf and pieces of kimono. The burns dug away at the male, but his actions were decisive. he quickly ditched the scarf and cut away at pieces of his kimono, leaving his upper torso bare of clothe and littered with burns. He'd push through the pain and continue his plans.

Blood trickled from his self-inflicted wound, quelling his contract's thirst. Hands contorted together to form shapes given meaning by man, each with a purpose. His hand smashed against the ground, creating a giant ominous summoning circle. From its design shot up a massive plume of smoke. It quickly divided as Chiyari, along with some troops, darted off into the distance with great ferocity. Five hundred sum bodies attempted to follow Chiyari in his lead.

"The Sun is setting. . ."* - Sun Sep 06 23:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Pushed onwards, his senses expanding out. He had pinpointed Zetsumo's location as he closed the gap between Chiyari and the seventeen meter Ninken. (~55 feet). He tapped the Saint Bernard's head, signalling him to act.

"Now!"

The Ninken whipped around to swat the threads with sheer might and size. Two hundred of the troops accompanying Chiyari's advance acted in unison to surround the threaded monster known as Zetsumo. They attacked from four angles, each squad having fifty bodies. Two groups performed Gokakyu in unision. The next set spewed forth large gusts of Wind, Great Breakthrough, to amplify the attack.

As one final act, Mamoru's foot stomped the earth in fury. It tremored as a massive pirson of earth threatened to enclose Zetsumo in place, right after the joint attack had finished. It sculpted itself into a durable steel-like key, imprinted with a Paw print label. If done correctly, this would create a fire oven of sorts for the God of War.

Meanwhile, Chiyari would attempt to make his advance further in the village.* - Sun Sep 06 23:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Mamoru braced itself as Zetsumo's massive summon responded in kind for their sudden assault. Chiyari ducked low and took guard behind his companion's massive body. The fierce winds tore every which way, cutting a few patches of hair here and there. However it wouldn't be enough to do any considerable damage, backed by Mamoru's sudden countermeasure. He opened his toothed mouth and let out a booming howl. This acted as a small tradeoff.

"Hmmph. . ."

He continued honing in on his senses, scanning his surroundings in great detail. Zetsumo's retreat became apparent, leaving Chiyari and his five hundred man force to act as they please. As such they'd continue infiltrating further into the village. Chiyari's loyal pack of eight Ninken appeared from the woodworks, surrounding Mamoru as they all took off. They barked out orders, speaking of orders and what not.

"Good. Go back on patrol. .  I wish to know the location of any straggling Konoha forces as well as their citizens. Our main goal is to reach them by any means."

Chiyai placed a hand inside his mouth and gave a whistle. The eight Ninken quickly dispersed in order to scout deeper in the village. Their target? The location of a majority of Konoha's citizens.* - Mon Sep 07 00:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin)  finally makes his way into Konoha's interior. His Ninken come back one at a time, giving way the location of those designated as the village's citizens. Their reports are anything, but happy. They speak of their condition. From the sound of it, they are even more impoverished and suffering than those of Suna. His heart cringed in response. His mind set itself upon a new task; the extraction of this village's citizens.

Before he took action, his mind raced back. His own mental suffering had increased ten-fold. Unbeknowest to the rest, Chiyari had caught word of Edge's raid and perhaps capture of his beloved village. As it stood, he had lost. Tears streamed from the man's lifeless eyes as his heart cried out in pain. All his effort and beliefs were being put down, one by one. What else cout he do? Even now, they fought a dangerous war. What. . .could he possibly due to recover that which he had lost?

After great thought, he nodded to himself. First things first was the coheresion of this village's inhabitants  and their protection. He knew he couldn't save those outside his reach, but as long as he still lived, he'd at least save those in his grasp. So that's what he would do, here and now.

Mamoru edged deep into the village as Chiyari guided him to the locations of known citizen clusters. Once there, the glissening, regal man would stand tall atop his massive beast. The five hundred sum soldiers accompanied him, but they kept their distance as they remained as lookouts in case any more of Konoha's armed forces came.

The sun's rays hit his regal form, giving off supernatural moonlight. Tears still streamed down his face as he imagined the events that unfolded in the past, in his village and here in Konohagakure. He truly felt for the people here and such heartwarming care could be heard even in his heavenly, well-taught force.

"Citizens of Konoha! Hear me out! My name is Chiyari, safeguard of Justice and Peace. I stand before you today, distraught and truly saddened by what I've witnessed today. I've heard your suffering, your pain and your anguish. .  Today, here and now, I wish to rid you of it all. For those who wish for a better future and a kinder worl then come with me now. I shall take you all far away, to a place where we all can finally call home. A home akin to Sanctuary. . ."

His tears still acted as the glissening man radiated in benevolence. He seemed to truly care for these people. Depending on their response, he'd begin acting by guiding those he could atop Mamoru, and then assigning another large sum to huddle together. From there, Mamoru would stomp his paw and erect a safe Paw Keg Imprisonment around them. The large Ninken would detach the keg from the earth and carry it nicely upon his neck.

Meanwhile, he left a few of the more healthy ones to spread word to the rest of the citizens, in hope of gathering another batch. His Ninken would also keep searching to search out the suffering denizens of Konoha. The five hundred sum force split up to guard the people and those accompanying Chiyari.* - Mon Sep 07 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || Mamoru scaled Konoha's wall, taking careful note of the twenty sum citizens they had managed to carry with them. Once at the top, he'd leap a great distance before firmly landing on the grassy terrain below. The earth shook briefly in response. Then, Mamoru sat the Keg down and forced it to come undone. The earth expanded out before falling back to the earth as mere dirt. All the citizens were asked to remain there, alongside two hundred troops that'd guard them with their lives while also rationing meals.

Meanwhile, Chiyari, Mamoru and the remaining three hundred soldiers forced their way back inside Konoha. Their zero resistance, due to the conflict going on at the West side. It was round two for Project Citizen Rescue.* - Mon Sep 07 01:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) sighed greatly as he stood at the Northern outskirts of the village. Today, they had managed to win this battle, but not the war. Word of Sunagakure's fall still left Chiyari speechless, his own morale greatly hindered. He had made a grave mistake coming in this assault and practially abandoning the village. He wasn't suited for leadership, if such was to be the outcome. He couldn't even imagine what atrocities Edge commited while there. His heart cringed everytime he thought about it. . .

"I. . . have been so foolish. All this time, I've only talked, too afraid to take real action. Had I allowed Edge's life to be ended there, at that moment years back, perhaps today we'd be standing greater and even closer to peace."

His hands smashed against the mountainside as his frustration built up. Time and time again he'd hit the wall, his hands bruising and blood spurting forth. Suddenly he'd stop, falling against the wall.

"I was so weak. . . I couldn't even make up for the sacrifices Tategama, Lady Katsya, Tatsumi, Kronos and Orakuru gave their upmost for! Perhaps I should of taken their place. . . If only Tategama had lived instead of me. . . "

The distraught man slumped against the wall, his lifeless eyes casting a glance skywards. Silence enveloped him as he sat there feeling useless and defeated.* - Mon Sep 07 13:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) || The chirps of life interupted Chiyari's solitude, their peaceful song signaling the Sun's awakening. Warmth enveloped the man even as he laid there in anguish. He found it strange how peaceful the enviroment surrounding this village was compared to the actual state of the village and the poor treatment of the people. The disparity between the two was great. How he wished Man could share in the same tranquility, unknown to conflict and only of balance. A genuine wish. . .

"Hmmmm. . ."

Chiyari allowed himself to wash in nature's unbiased trance. It served to ease his wounded heart and worried mind. If only he could stay like this forever. . .* - Mon Sep 07 13:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) gives a distraught look as Yan mentions their village.* - Wed Sep 09 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) gives a firm, regretful nod. The ton in his voice was both serious and sincered, clearly indicating the tuth behind his words. "Yes, I am."* - Wed Sep 09 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) narrows his dull eyes as he examines the boy before him. His hand shot up, holding up a single finger. "Should you come across the slightest bit of danger, flee. The preservation of your life will be your main priority." The silver man's voice was stern as he gave his condition, one he valued greatly.

"If word is true of Edge's take over, then no doubt you and all those that follow me are all on some sort of list with Edge's loyalists. Whether it be imprisonment or death."* - Wed Sep 09 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) turns his attention to the new presence. He scanned the boy Yan introduced, taking note of Zetsumo's name being mentioned.

"Tell me about yourself and why you want to join us."* - Wed Sep 09 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chiyari(Guujin) took another look at the boy. It was clear he was going through anguish of his own. However, Chiyari was not fond of Revenge as a motive or driving force. It created Darkness in one's heart and gave way to weakness.

"Mmmm. . That is unfortunate. I hear your pain. .  You may join us, however with time I hope to curve that hate you have into justice instead of revenge. Zetsumo has commited crimes against humanity and his fall should be for the betterment of mankind instead of one's selfish desire."* - Wed Sep 09 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A single man stands atop the mountain's edge, looking down dully. His features seem pronounced and slightly feminine, aside from a few rough edges. He lets out a sigh before casting a glance skywards as if deep in thought. No doubt he had been burdened with much in the past, but here, in this instance he felt nothing except for a tranquil peace. Nature's call eased the man's mind as he took pleasure in the present.

"I suppose it's time to get started. .  I didn't cast away everything on a whim. . "

His dangling feet pushed up as he stood upright. A thin smile outlined his face, hands contorting similiar to the White Fang. Blood oozed from his thumb as he performed the necessary ritual. A firm hand smashed the ground and from it came a large plume of smoke.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu!>* - Fri Sep 18 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A loud howl resonated through the smoke and down the mountain. Suddenly, the massive silhouette of a four-legged creature could be seen. Its foot stomped firmly on the ground, clearing away the residual smoke. In its passing came a clearer image of its form, a large sand-colored Ninken wearing a jacket. Atop its massive head sat the silver man from before, one hand gently rubbing against the massive canine's fur.

"Mamoru. . .it has been awhile. I have lost much these past months, but in compensation for a clearer mind. We have much to work on. .  I hope I can count on you once more, my friend."

The large Saint Bernard gave a loud bark in response, slightly curious of his master's changed appearance and attitude.

"Mmm. . very well, Chi-"

Suddenly the man threw a hand up, as if to stop the canine from speaking further.

"It's Byakuren, friend."

The Ninken seemed slightly confused, but accepted it.

"Of course, Byakuren."* - Fri Sep 18 00:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slowly regains conciousness as his eyes open, cast dully towards the azure sky. The white haired male forced himself upwards as his senses extended outward. Various bits of information made their way into the man's body which were promptly analyzed by his brain.

"Mmmm. . ."

His hand flicked outwards as a shuriken swiftly spun on the male's finger tips. Byakuren brought the spinning shuriken closer to his mouth, before suddenly blowing a breath of air into its vicinity. Through proper chakra control and manipulation, the wind gathered around the shuriken and increased its spinning velocity tenfold. Suddenly he released the shuriken and allowed it to dig into a nearby rock, cleaving it in two.* - Sat Oct 17 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) sighed gently as his body instinctively moved around the area. Vague thoughts and memories festered inside the strange man's head, times of old and confusing ideals. He seemed lost as he continued to simply train, perhaps wishing to seek answer through such menial methods.

With that said, two more shuriken were removed from his arsenal as Byakuren extended both hands. The shuriken danced upon his fingertip, spinning although a bit lopsided. Either way, Byakuren regathered his efforts and began blowing on each rotating shuriken. Wind chakra enveloped the shuriken before the man finally released them from his grasp. They flew through the air, cutting blades of grass with ease. Each one seared through rock, before stopping.* - Sat Oct 17 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) hummed a gentle, nostalgic tune as he cast a dull glance over the mountain. His hand instinctively reached into the confines of his kimono as he withdrew shuriken. Training every now and then helped to ease is worried mind. It had been so long since he had done anything really. However the winds of change were on the way, or so he felt.

"My young self was so ignorant. . .And to think I was once called a leader."

The self-scarred, wild man began spinning a single shuriken upon the tip of his right index finger. He brought it up to his porcelain lips, gathering chakra inside the pit of his lungs. Suddenly he bursted forth, breathing life into the spinning projectile. It spun vigorously as chakra infused wind enveloped its being. Swiftly, Byakuren threw the shuriken towards a nearby chunk of rock. It whizzed threw the air, sending out an invisible wind circle around it. The shuriken quickly made impact and cleaved the rock in two.* - Fri Oct 30 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gave no reaction to his previous attempts success. Instead he continued to weave together wind-infused shuriken one after the other. A sense of empowerment seemed to cling to his regal aura as his body effortlessly went about the motions. Invisible, deadly winds continued to infuse the spinning shurikens as Byakuren brought them close and breathed his essence into them. Without hesitation, the shuriken would be sent along their way, threw the air, and into unsuspecting terrain. They seemed to cleave anything that came before them.* - Fri Oct 30 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) didn't let up as his body simply drew more shuriken from his kimono. He seemed deep in thought during his spontaneous training session. It almost seemed as if some foreign force gripped his conciousness and brought about such rigorous training. Shuriken came and went one by one, their spinning speed, velocity and degree of danger amped with every breath. As it stood now, each attempt took a great deal of chakra. However, little by little, improvement could be seen.* - Fri Oct 30 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) sighed, out of necessity rather than want. His body and mind expressed their need for a short break through this action, however his 'heart' ignored these warnings. As if it knew he had the ability to keep going, it just continued pushing on. More forged projectiles appeared out of the abyss that was his kimono, finding their place upon the tips of his finger. Spinning, breathing, throwing and cleaving was the general ordeal. One after the other they'd just skid across the grassy terrain, tearing apart blades of grass and finding their way towards stray chunks of rock.* - Fri Oct 30 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) was undoubtedly possessed, not by an unknown force, but rather by his own passion. It wrapped him like thorns as his body simply completed the same action over and over again. What he wished to accomplish exactly with this excessive training was unknown, even to him. However it was clear that he wanted it to go somewhere. Perhaps the act of simply moving forward, breaking the dull stagnant flow he was in for perhaps years. This all occured as he was infusing projectiles with weird wind voodoo magic of course. His breath created arsenals of destruction as the projectiles soared around him with every flick.* - Fri Oct 30 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A storm was brewing, figuratively. With every succeful attempt came improval and increased muscle function. Muscle memory was working its magic at this point as his body hastily went with the routine. Projectile after projectile appeared from his kimono, before reaching the terrain in the form of a deadly wind infused shuriken. They were flying stars of death, only increasing in number as his body pushed itself.* - Fri Oct 30 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) huffed and puffed, like that one wolf from folklore. His 'fang' came in the form of condensed wind, imbued inside every projectile he threw. Glimpsed of his former self could be seen every now and then, but for the most part he was a changed man. The soft features he had once possessed, under a different name no less, were mostly gone. Slightly unkempt hair, a chisseled self-scarred chest and an eye-patch now marked his physique. His ferocity seemed slightly more hone than before, as seen through his training. Wind infused metal continued to soar through the air as he trained.* - Fri Oct 30 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || Spinning monstrocities, on a small scale anyways, continued to be formed from a single breath by Byakuren. It was surreal in a way, as chakra molded itself inside the man's lungs before escaping in a pinpointed breath. Once it left his porcelain lip, the chakra infused wind became one with the spinning shuriken. This created the deadly monstrocities spoken of earlier, a spinning circle of death. Its radius was difficult to see, aiding in its lethality. Not only that, but the shurikens hit radius was extended considerably. Scary was but one word to describe it.* - Fri Oct 30 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) kept his streak going. Hours had passed by over this long session, but his mind was only honed on the actual actions and improving them. Due to this, they seemed to pass by like nothing. However, his body was displaying visual instances of fatigue. This was clear from the sweat that rolled down Byakuren's face and chest, alongside his panting. It was a mystery how he hadn't passed out from all the excessive air he was exhaling. Even in this state, he continued to create the wind powered death stars.* - Fri Oct 30 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) reapplied the same technique to yet another shuriken. Chakra and wind bellowed inside his lungs, before being forced out with a single exhale. This molded wind left Byakuren's lips and attached itself to a single spinning shuriken placed before him. It seemed almost alive at first, testing the waters for a moment before forcing itself to become one with the common-day projectile. Now formed, the wind shuriken was released without precision towards a nearby rock. Even without the due time to aim, the deadly shuriken cleaved the walk like nothing due to its overly expanded reach. Imagine what type of kill potential pinpointed accuracy would create?* - Fri Oct 30 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) just repeated the process over and over. While the routine seemed the same every time, there were actually minute changes being made from every attempt. A lot of trial and error was being done at the finest level as Byakuren's mind processed the varying effects. Such information included the exact execution of the technique, how to make the process more efficient, the best way to act according to his own body structure and feel etc. Basically a lot of effort was being placed behind the scenes and not just a mindless repeat of the same action over and over. After all, insanity is repeating the same thing over and over while expecting a different outcome.* - Fri Oct 30 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continues to lay the foundation of the Vacuum Blade technique. One by one shurikens come and go, being released with vigor and wind-infused heft. The grassy terrain was mowed all around him, evidence of his abundant practice. No doubt Byakuren had been using the technique in a variety of ways over an extended period of time at this point.* - Fri Oct 30 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) sensed an inevitable breakthrough aheah, his mind and body comming closer towards a definitive answer in terms of improving the Vacuum Blade technique after so much time and effort. He continued his pursuit, slaving away as he infused and threw shuriken after shuriken. The small storm he formed from this persistent onslaught was quite clear, should anyone actually be in the vicinity. His efforts might pay off soon enough.* - Fri Oct 30 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || Air exhaled deep from within Byakuren's lungs as he drew up more shuriken. The air was already mixed with Byakuren's own chakra, forming an almost living wind of sorts. As it had done countless times before, it wrapped itself around each shuriken and gave it a deadly circle. It was a worthy spectactle, as the technique itself was rather unique and held deadly potential. Byakuren had yet to see another being use it besides himself. Perhaps it really was the first of its kind.* - Fri Oct 30 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) bent low as he kicked up a few shuriken from his holster. He was expending a great deal of weaponry in order to keep a constant stream of endless training. As such he was running low, but still had enough for a few more rounds of use. The shuriken he had used during the whole ordeal were scattered all around, some farther than others. Their condition was unaffected, due to the deadly layer of wind that did all the work. No doubt a long collection process would be needed after everything was said and done. For now, he had to finish off the last shuriken he possessed.* - Fri Oct 30 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gave a steady flow of wind towards the two shuriken presented before him. The process was much more detailed and time consuming this time. Byakuren was giving the last of his breath and chakra for the last bit of weaponyr he had. Expectations were high as the white haired male used all he had developed in these last hours of training and poured it into shuriken. The wind melded with each shuriken, giving it enhanced properties of which only he has seen so far. The expanding circle of death was present, alongside a spinning ferocity. Byakuren played with them a bit, elegantly spinning each upon the tips of his finger. He drew one to the side before flinging it across the landscape. The second soon followed before tearing again rock, cleaving it with little effort.* - Fri Oct 30 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) was utterly exhausted after all his efforts. There was clear success, however not exactly how he imagine. Perhaps there were a few more things he had to accomplish before he could make the breakthrough he was looking for. With that said, he went ahead and spent a great deal of time collecting all the shuriken he has used in his training. This was a daunting process in itself, seeing as how he had expended a great deal of shuriken which numbered. . .well a lot. Byakuren completed the task before slumping upon the grass. He needed a small break. He'd begin anew after clearing his mind and a slight rest.* - Fri Oct 30 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) recollected himself as he forced his body upwards. He was still tired, but had regained enough energy to continue finish the training he had been doing. He was able to reflect during his time of rest, which aided him greatly. His mind was clearer and new insight came with it. That short break might of done him more good then relentless expending his energy to use the technique in question. Now that he was ready, his hands reached for the shuriken he had gathered and he begun the process again. Just a few more times now. . . He was almost there.* - Fri Oct 30 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) throws one last wind infused shuriken before nodding to himself. He was satisfied with the results of his training. Although far from perfect, he knew that the success alone was enough to sate him in regards to the Vacuum Blade. However something else was on his mind, something far more difficult than the technique he had been displaying before. It pertained to the Summoning Technique in particular. It was about time he called upon his age old companions, of which he had not seen for quite some time.* - Fri Oct 30 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) began the ritual he was overly familiar with. His hands quickly contorted into his signature handseals as chakra swirled inside his pit, kneading itself extensively. The red sacrifice required for the technique was offered forth as Byakuren finally knelt before the earth, his plam slapping hard against the grassy terrain. Suddenly a dark mass brewed forth, forming a rather large summoning circle. Suddenly smoke plumed skywards, well above 17 meters. In its wake was a shadowy four-legged creature.* - Fri Oct 30 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A booming howl broke through the remaining smoke as a large abundance of sand colored fur visually plastered itself for everyon to see. As images cleared, it was clear the fur belonged to a massive 56 foot Saint Bernard. It sported a tattered jacket with a clear Paw Print label plastered on it. The massive canine lowered its head as it set its gaze upon Byakuren.

"Long time no see, old friend."

Dog breath followed suit, however the white haired male seemed quite use to it. He rose a single hand up to meet the large creatures head, showing their familiarity with each other.

"Indeed it has. . ."

* - Fri Oct 30 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) flings himself atop the behemoths head. Mamoru quickly rose his head as he looked about. Byakuren did his best to maintain his balance, merely extending his senses around his body in order to grasp his general surroundings.

"Mamoru. . .I apologize for my absense. However, I am back. New winds are blowing. .  Change is upon us."

The canine curiously turned his head as he spoke aloud.

"Is that so? Sorry isn't necessary. I'm merely satisfied that you didn't go off and die somewhere without letting us know."

Byakuren gives a thin smile.

"Thank you. . Anyways, it's time for me to get back to training."

* - Fri Oct 30 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A puff of smoke signals Mamoru's temporary departure. Byakuren lands upon the ground, at a much lower height than before. His body instinctively prepares itself for the summoning ritual once more. Thumbs were wounded, blood flowed and hands flourished. With the necessary sacrifice, Byakuren quickly smashed his palm against the ground once more in order to conjure up Mamoru a second time. The summoning circle was of adequate size, displaying just how large the beast that was being conjured was.* - Fri Oct 30 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) repeated this process multiple times. The process was routine. His body performed the ritual and provided the necessary chakra, while Mamoru responded to his efforts and allowed himself to be summoned. Both were in unspoken agreement as the ordeal went down. As part of the training, Mamoru knew he'd be summoned and desummoned countless times. There was of course breaks after a few attempts, due to how taxing the technique was. Little by little Byakuren made progress.* - Fri Oct 30 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) still had a ways to go as he continued to onslaught of summons. His body worked and his mind analyzed. As usual, he'd pick apart every attempt on the fly. Information flowed throughout his mind like a computer, being processed, analyzed and then given solutions. What came next was putting these solutions or temporary fixes in action on the following attempt. Their success was then recorded and revaluated depending on the outcome. Trial and error was the name of the game. His training technique was pretty uniform when it came to techniques in general, but each had different variables.* - Fri Oct 30 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A light hum enveloped the area as Byakuren stood in a field of trampled, sheered grass. It was all signs of his training, from Vacuum Blade to summoning the massive Mamoru. Even now, his hands moved to demonstrate his willpower. A single swipe of thumb against canine drew forth a much needed sacrifice. Red ichor smeared across his hand as predetermined handseals were strung together. A single smack created an ink-like circle, which expanded outwards and summoned forth the massive Mamoru.* - Fri Oct 30 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) abruptly sighed, evidence of his mind releasing stress. Such stress came from the extensive training he forced upon his mind, body and spirit. However, Byakuren pushed forward as he continued to summon forth Mamoru. He was establishing a stronger spiritual connection to his large companion. As such, should things go as planned, a more efficient link would be established. His main goal was to lessen the taxing drain of handling Mamoru in their realm. For that same goal he had to continue his attempts.* - Fri Oct 30 06:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) forced his bloodcaked hands together, resting upon the final seal of the technique. His eyes closed as he meditated briefly, calling forth his bond with Mamoru with all his might. Mentally grasping hold of it, Byakuren placed his hand upon the earthy terrain before calling out.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"

The circle expanded out and a plume of smoke followed. As usual, the 55 foot Mamoru was called forth. He gave a large nod towards Byakuren before quickly returning to his own realm.* - Fri Oct 30 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply repeated what he had been doing for hours. Breaks were a regular ordeal due to the complexity of the technique and it's strain on the body, but even then Byakuren made sure to push his body to the limits before succumbing to said break. His efforts could be seen on his bloodied hands, skin torn and hand rough due to the blood sacrifice required with each attempt.* - Fri Oct 30 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slid his thumb against his canines. Blood trickled down his wounded hand, further smeared with Byakuren's forced application. Chakra welled inside his body as he strung together the necessary handseals. His hand met the ground and called forth the summoning circle.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu. . .>* - Fri Oct 30 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) swiftly slides his thumb against his canines. Blood gushes forth and smears across his hand, a necessary sacrifice. Byakuren quickly begins to mold chakra inside himself in tangem with handseal use. He smashes his hand against the earthy terrain and begins the summoning. A massive black scrawl spews forth from the original impact. Smoke follows, covering a massive shadowed creature.* - Fri Oct 30 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A colossal figure emerges from the smoke, sand colored blurs entering the vision first. Then came the legs and the rest of its massive body. It was clear the beast conjured was a massive Ninken named Mamoru. He gave a nod towards Byakuren before releasing himself from the summon, waiting for the next attempt. This would be done multiple times in order to improve himself and their summoning bond.* - Fri Oct 30 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continues at a steady pace, repeating the technique over and over. His hands went about their business as they performed familiar handgestures, followed with blood, chakra and a solid impact to the ground. A large circle expanded under his hand.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu>* - Fri Oct 30 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) clasps his hands together and concentrates. His spiritual body stirs, chakra flourishing and following his command. He inhaled deeply, effectively slowing his chakra flow. Then it came to an abrupt halt before he finally exahled. In this moment, a rush of newly formed chakra bursted forth from his core and cleansed his system in its entirety.

<Kai!>* - Fri Oct 30 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) motioned his hands forward as he drew blood for his technique. Byakuren flourished his hands as the performed the necessary handseals: Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Ram. Meanwhile, chakra was swiftly molded deep inside his core which all came forth in unision alongside the male's next action. A firm hand smashes against the ground and a large summoning circle sprawls across the ground and taints it mometarily.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu>* - Sat Oct 31 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A small tremor came from behind the smoke veil, slightly sending Byakuren off balance despite his anticipation. It continued as a massive, shadowy creature breaks through the smoke. As it cleared, sand colored fur could be seen clearly upon the beast. On further inspection, the shape of a large Ninken, specifically a Saint Bernard, could be seen looming 17 meters over Byakuren and everything in its general surroundings. A small bark followed after.* - Sat Oct 31 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) beckoned towards the large beast as its covered eyes found their way towards the white haired male. Byakuren gave a brief smile as he spoke loud enough for the colossal canine to hear.

"Hey, Mamoru. It's time for some more training. Hopefully we can get it right this time. . ."

Mamoru gave an affirmative howl before glancing around the area. Satisfied with its findings, it quickly dispersed and awaited for further summons as part of the training the two had been doing as of late.* - Sat Oct 31 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) quickly followed with another attempt at the technique. His hands did the same exact motions as before, laced with speed and muscle memory. His overall efficiency was something to behold, but nothing was perfect. Byakuren was well aware of this, noting the slightest of nuiances for later. Despite this he would finish the technique in question. A well of chakra bubbled forth from Byakuren's right hand. A large circle was conjured forth, fueled by the blood and chakra used during the ritual.* - Sat Oct 31 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) watched as Mamoru appeared from the smoke as before. Their meeting was brief, marked with a simple of acknowledgement of each other through various senses. A wordless bond was forming between them as Mamoru dispersed himself, having already understood his purpose in the overall training session. They understood the smallest details about each other in terms of body language and feel. With every attempt, came a firmer connection to that bond, similiar to nuerons in a brain.* - Sat Oct 31 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply continued his efforts. There was little to report visually, however, as one might expect from watching his previous training sessions, new ideas and executions were being made from the finest motions and details. Further inspection reveals small changes in body control and overall flow when it game to various gestures.* - Sat Oct 31 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) began tweaking various quantities and qualities. In terms of number and ammount, with every attempt Byakuren would try varying ammount of blood for the sacrifice alongside the time needed for each action. Of course efficiency was still his number one concern, due to the nature of battle. None the less, gathering such valuable information still held importance because a greater understanding could come from both fruitful and unfruitful results. With that said he performed the technique again, albeit much different then before.* - Sat Oct 31 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) was making progress, albeit at a slow pace. Either way, he focused on the quality of his exection this time. He specifically tweaked various nuiances in his form, from handseal speed and positioning, from blood drawal and overall action. It was an amusing spectactle, due to Byakuren's perfectionist nature. As such he'd mimick his attempts and tweak them over and over and over.* - Sat Oct 31 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) performed the technique in a more conventional way this time. There were no extra tricks put into this one. This was because he wished to use this as an example in comparison to his more tweaked executions. As such, he merely slid his thumb against his canines and drew blood. He smeared said blood across his hand before performing the necessary handseals without much rush. Chakra was melded and expunged in tangem with a single impact to the ground.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Sat Oct 31 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) finished his previous use, taking into account its simplicity. Comparing it to his more refined attempts showed considerable improvement. In fact this bolstered Byakuren's own confidence as he went straight back into the training fray. It was a battle of sorts, with his tenacity facing endless struggle and effort. Of course Byakuren found this healthy rather than real battles. As such he continued to perform the summoning technique countless times.* - Sat Oct 31 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) appraoched the mountains edge before beginning his usual routine. For the last few days, his entire attention was focused on training. It was the only thing on his mind at this point, knowing full well he had to improve himself in order to stand against whatever is out there. He hadn't forgotten the power displayed by key figures over the years, of which he had no match.

"Lets begin. . ."* - Sun Nov  1 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) beckoned his hands outwards. His hands joined together and performed 4 distinct handseals. Meanwhile, he allowed his chakra to thoroughly flow throughout his body. Suddenly the flow changed and gushed forth, straight towards his hands. This happened around the same time his hand smashed against the ground. A black circle spread from the origin of the impact, calling forth whatever it was Byakuren had wished to summon.* - Sun Nov  1 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply grinned as the summoning did worked its magic. A thick veil of smoke lingered over the area, but a large presence was undoubtably in the area. A large booming howl reaffirmed this as it broke through the smoke. The cloud cleared, revealing a familiar canine. He sat a hefty 17 meters, scanning the vicinity. It was Mamoru, Byakuren's largest Ninken as of yet. Their eyes locked for but a moment before everything went silent. Mamoru dispersed the next moment, as if answering a silent favor. Training had begun.* - Sun Nov  1 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) repeated this process multiple times. Like usual, Byakuren merely analyzed and took apart every attempt he made at the technique. The information mentally gathered from this would be stored in the back of Byakuren's mind to be processed at a later date. Handseal after handseal were strung together, alongside thumb biting and finally the ending finale. Daunting repetition.* - Sun Nov  1 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) moves his hands in a flurry. Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey and Ram fly by as he finishes the long string. Red ichor drips from each smeared hand and chakra gathers deep inside BYakuren's very core. A single impact is made against the ground, mixing grass, dirt and blood together. In response, a giant summoning circle expands out to encompass a large area all around Byakuren.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Sun Nov  1 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slaves away as his body instinctively moves. Summoning after summoning is performed, hands flourishing and blood fluttering. Dirt and bruises cover Byakuren's hands, evidence of his prolong training. Today was yet another day of this rigorous ordeal, but every bit of it was worth it. As such he called forth his companion Mamoru with the smash of his hand.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Mon Nov  2 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) managed to conjure up his large canine buddy for perhaps the millonth time. Their eyes met for but a moment before a puff of smoke marked the Ninken's return. They were training and words weren't necessary. This made it more efficient honestly, due to the continuous nature of his training. Either way, their bond was growing in a more silent manner than most. Trust and loyalty were abundant.* - Mon Nov  2 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) was nowhere near done as his body continued its routine. Meanwhile, his mind worked in very productive ways behind the scene. As before, he'd analyze every inch of the technique in question, alongside his previous attempts and find ways to tweak it. This was much more progressive than mindless training. Byakuren's mind was one of his strongest features, so it was in his nature to use it to the fullest. Of course, physical execution was still necessary.* - Mon Nov  2 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) hummed a gentle tune despite the exhaustion his body and mind were afflicted by. It added an extra layer of protection, alongside his willpower, that allowed for him to keep going without as many breaks. This didn't bypass his body's need for rest of course, merely pushed it a little further. Due to the taxing nature of the technique, the white haired male was still required to take some sort of break in order to regather both his chakra and stamina.* - Mon Nov  2 14:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) bites a small chunk out of his right index finger, drawing forth a decent pool of blood. This blood would be used as a sacrifice, which here smeared across his hands. Byakuren's hands quickly went to work, performing four distinct handseals. Meanwhile, chakra surged through his body and gathered at a single point. A final hand smash was made against the earth, forcing his built up chakra to flush towards its origin. In response to Byakuren's efforts a large black circle etched itself all around Byakuren's body, large enough to contain a large beast.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu>* - Mon Nov  2 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || The smoke plume lingers over the summoning circle, before finally breaking under sudden movement. A humongous paw seems to tear through the smoke before finally lifting the entire veil. Mamoru, the 17 meter Ninken, was no visible for all to see. His head lowers quickly towards Byakuren, his mouth parting.

"How goes the training?"

Byakuren grins slightly before giving him a thumbs up.

"Excellent. I can already feel the change after so much training. However there's still quite a ways to go. Are you still up to it?"

Mamoru booms.

"Of course."* - Mon Nov  2 15:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || Mamoru dissapears from sight. Byakuren nods to himself, satisfied with their little interaction. There was still much to be done though, so he immediately went back to work. His dirtied hands withdrew from his kimono and performed routine actions. His thumb slid across his canines, drew blood, and went to work on the handseals. Finally, he smashes his hand against the ground and repeats his technique.* - Mon Nov  2 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) motioned his hands forward as he finished the last seal. Suddenly he impacted the earth while calling out.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"

Blood, chakra and dirt all mingled together in unison during the impact. Suddenly a large formulated circle appeared form underneath Byakuren's figure. What followed was a slight tremor as the white haired male was mysteriously hoisted up into a plume of smoke.* - Mon Nov  2 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) is hoisted high into the air. Byakuren sits atop the massive Ninken known as Mamoru. His dull eyes scan the vicinity, to no avail. As such, the white haired male extends his senses outwards in order to confirm their isolation. Byakuren and Mamoru had been out here training for a hefty some of time without any disturbances so far. It was perhaps the perfect place to train. With that said, he prepared to continue.* - Mon Nov  2 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continues sitting atop Mamoru's head. His lips parted as he spoke to is colossal canine companion.

"I'm gonna change things up a bit, Mamoru. I'm in the mood for some deep meditation. Just stay here and keep watch."

Mamoru barked, obeying the white haired male. He trusted there was some importance to his master's decision.* - Mon Nov  2 18:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) calms himself, closing his eyes. The world around him slowly dulled as Byakuren cut out all outside distractions. His mind and body calmed in response to his slowed breathing. He achieved a state of zen, allowing himself to be taken inward of himself. An illusionary image of his own chakra system appeared inside his conciousness. Byakuren tied himself to this connection, controlling his chakra flow as he saw fit. For now, the white haired male was practicing the feat of maintaining Mamoru in this world.* - Mon Nov  2 18:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) maintained this state for a good while. While Byakuren did his meditation, Mamoru calmly stood tall above the mountainous wall. The canine's senses were alert, keeping track of potential dangers while Byakuren was off in his own world. The pair seemed intune to their task, while also maintaining a bond between themselves. It was surreal in nature.* - Mon Nov  2 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) felt a sudden drop in his chakra. Byakuren maintained his meditation, but the drain almost brought him out of it. However, this was part of his goal. He was meditating in order to control the flow and chakra cost required to keep Mamoru summoned. Time after time he felt the drain and with every tax came new found knowledge. He'd store this information in the back of his mind for later. There was still chakra left in him so he continued his efforts.* - Mon Nov  2 19:02:36 2015
