<br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) opened his eyes and regathered his senses. A breakthrough had come to him. With that, he patted Mamoru on the head and signaled him to lower himself. The colossal Ninken did just that, allowing enough space for Byakuren to leap off without killing himself. Mamoru forced himself back up and dissapeared. Byakuren on the other hand began another attempt at conjuring his companion, using his newfound knowledge.* - Mon Nov  2 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) motioned his hands forward. Blood was already smeared across his hands as he performed handseals: Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Ram. Adequate chakra was molded inside the young man's core, before bellowing forth in a single smash against the earth. The usual circle came forth, creating a spiritual connection between this realm and the desire creature's. Smoke soon followed.* - Mon Nov  2 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || From the smoke emerged a massive paw. It swiped at the smoke, showing signs of impatience. Waiting for it to clear was a nuisance at this point and only results mattered. Mamoru appeared from the smoke and gave a dog-like grin towards Byakuren. Each of them had a felt a change in the way the technique was executed. Byakuren in particular didn't felt as drained as before.

"Looks like we're getting there."* - Mon Nov  2 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) inhales a gulp of air. A swirl of wind forms inside the man's lungs as a flicker of action begins. Both of his hands fill with life as they reach inside the folds of his kimono. A heap of shuriken are displayed for all to see, of which two find themselves upon the tips of the man's fingers. Byakuren forces his head forward abruptly, exhaling a living wind from his lungs. The entity surges through each shuriken as they spin upon the tips of his fingers.

<Wind Release: Vacuum Blade!>* - Mon Nov  9 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || Dancing stars of death are formed, seen tearing through the vicinity in front of him. They fly an arced path, skidding across the grasslands for a moment and causing grassy death before lifting up. From there they take a more routine route. An aura of wind seems to encompass these perculiar shuriken as they make their way towards a nearby boulder. Suddenly the boulder begins splitting, even before the metalic projectiles make complete contact. It seems the chakra infused wind surrounding them possessed a lethal sharpness. . .* - Mon Nov  9 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || One by one, these wind infused projectiles are created. The production speed was swift, as each piece of shuriken-shaped metal took on a single breath of wind. From there they would be launched into the unknown, originating from Byakuren's given position. They seemed to practically mow down fields of grass around him, creating odd man-made patches.* - Mon Nov  9 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) produces more unique shurikens of wind. Each shuriken was made with relative ease, added on with graceful skill and extra style points. The application and actual throw style was filled with flare. Spinning said shuriken upon the tips of one's fingers was no obviously an agile feat by itself. With that said, another handfull of shuriken were sent on their way.* - Mon Nov  9 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) flicked his wrist as more shuriken were expended from his arsenal. They flew one by one, encased in a thin, circular disk of wind chakra. This special casing possessed a deadly sharpness to it, as well as a wide reach. Such power allowed for a single shuriken to possess substantial killing potential, being able to hit targets despite the actual metalic projectile missing.* - Mon Nov  9 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) whistled a nostalgic tune as continued producing shuriken. It followed a gentle beat, acting as a catalyst to the jutsu in question. With each whistle, came forth the chakra embedded wind. This wind cascaded over each spinning shuriken. They were then sent free from Byakuren's grasp, tearing through the air like before. They weren't aimed at anything in particular, but rather thrown for the sake of practice.* - Mon Nov  9 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) inhales yet another breath. The outside oxygen enters his lungs and finds its way through Byakuren's bloodstream. A swirl of chakra enters his pit, making its way towards his lungs. The chakra quickly melds with the air inside Byakuren's lungs. Immediately after, Byakuren exhales and allows for said wind to spew forth from his porcelain lips. It, of course, is quickly applied to more shuriken.* - Mon Nov  9 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki Shakaku(Dazzer) says: Hey there. - Mon Nov  9 07:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) breathes life into a handful of shuriken. The wind around him acts as a catalyst, mixing with his own exhale and molded chakra. A new entity is created this way, one which swiftly clings to each shuriken. The chakra infused wind quickly shapes itself, taking on a deadly, circular disk around each shiruken. Byakuren then released each projectile into the field before him. An onslaught of grassy death was left in their wake.* - Mon Nov  9 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) opens his palm, revealing a stationary metal shuriken. Byakuren quickly inhales, before letting out a deep stream of wind towards said shuriken. It pushes the shuriken forward, before forcing it to levitate momentarily. The chakra infused wind wraps around the shuriken, forcing it into a levitating, circular spin. FInally, Byakuren places a finger below the original shuriken before sending it off on its way.* - Mon Nov  9 15:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) tilts his head forward as a stream of wind bellows forth from his mouth. Two spinning shuriken are swiftly encased in the wind, creating his usual spinning stars of death. They were immediately released from his grasp a moment later, cutting across the terrain. After their deadly flight, they'd fall to the earth alongside countless other shuriken brethren.* - Mon Nov  9 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) cotninued his onslaught as shuriken were mass produced, at least by his standards. Chakra, wind and metal molded together to create a deadly concoction. This mix was perhaps the epitome of wind chakra flow.

<Wind Release: Vacuum Blade!>* - Mon Nov  9 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) forces another group of shuriken out of his kimono. An efficient process is executed as a breath is made towards each shuriken. The wind molds with the metalic projectile on contact as Byakuren releases them from his grasp towards the unknown. The aftermath was a forked display of spinning shuriken mercilessly shredidng apart large patches of grass.* - Mon Nov  9 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gulps down an excessive chunk of oxygen, allowing it to fill his lungs. Meanwhile, his body and mind work together in tangem to produce supernatural results. Chakra swirls inside hte pit of his stomache, before gathering near Byakuren's own filled lungs, There the two elements mix and create a new entity.

<Wind Release: Vacuum Blade!>

Suddenly Byakuren exhales, allowing the wind to encase two shuriken.* - Mon Nov  9 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) forms a single Tiger seal as his chakra surges through his body. Byakuren fine tunes himself, gathering a few bit here and there before continuing his previous onslaught. His body falls back into routine, drawing forth shuriken from his kimono and coating them in special chakra infused wind. He then spits them out like money, not caring for their destination as long as they land somewhere reachable.* - Mon Nov  9 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) conjures forth another burst of chakra infused wind. The stream flows from his lips, straight into two spinning shuriken sat atop his fingertips. They were quickly wrapped in this perculiar wind, creating extended wind stars of death. Byakuren's hand then gracefuly motioned forward, sending each shuriken on their designated path. One cut through a field of overgrown grass, while the other cleaved the tip of a boulder.* - Tue Nov 10 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) watched as the mini destruction unfolded. His first shuriken spun rapidly, cleaving tall blades of grass like butter. There was little to no resistance, of course, but what was really noticeable was the radius on each star. This could be seen by the wide cleave made in the field, managing to extend 15 feet in each direction. The other shuriken performed similiar feats, however its target was much different. It just barely flew past a boulder, before cleaving the top clean off. A real display of sharpness.

"Mmmm. . .it's improving. Just a bit more and I'll have this technique figured out completely."* - Tue Nov 10 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) decided to change things up. He quickly goes to gather all the shuriken he had used in his previous training session before storing them away. Suddenly a kunai finds its way in the white haired male's hands. A thin smile formed on his face as he tilted the kunai slightly, bringing it up to his mouth. Suddenly he breathes a stream of living wind into it, of which was more condensed and visible then the wind he had used for the shuriken.* - Tue Nov 10 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || Flickering wind excretes from the end of the kunai, enveloping it and extending outwards. It flows in an unpredictable pattern, its shape slightly skewed. However, despite its constant movement, the wind managed to maintain a sword-like appearance. And that's exactly what was formed, a blade of wind attached to the stem of a kunai.* - Tue Nov 10 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) quickly swipes across the air with wind infused kunai in hand. Suddenly the wind reacts to this sudden change, extending out like a cruved sickle. The wind entity continues to cling against the kunai as the strike is made, however it swiftly extends outwards and cleaves a large chunk of grass directly in front of him, up to 15 feet away.* - Tue Nov 10 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) chains a series of strikes linked to the previous one. As he does, the wind acts as an attachment to the kunai of which it inhabits. It flickers and moves with each strike, lashing out a much more considerable distance away from the user compared to a normal kunai. It resembled a large sword of sorts, oh which seemed very controlled. Perhaps further insight might allow Byakuren to change its length mid strike?* - Tue Nov 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) forces the flickering blade of wind to remain existence. With each session, a chunk of chakra leaves Byakuren's body to feed the blade in question. As he focuses on this balance, Byakuren continues to make lashing strikes out towards the grassy field in front of him. A few simple strikes are made, followed by more intricate manuevures. This was all to get a feel of the kunai/wind sword.* - Tue Nov 10 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || The wind surrounding the kunai suddenly fizzles, it's upkeep ignored. Byakuren quickly flipped the kunai skywards, angling its tip just below his lip. SUddenly a new breath of wind leaves his mouth, reattaching itself to the kunai. As such a new wind sword is formed, one that stretches 15 feet in front of him. It's reach was crazy and was still light enough to be handled with a single hand. Two hands provided better stability and swordsmanship though.* - Tue Nov 10 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) moves on to practice is swordplay while maintaing a stable connection to the wind blade. His chakra wells from his core, flows up through his arms and finally leaves his hands. From there it surges up through the kunai and fuels the wind attachment placed upon the blade of the kunai. Byakuren did this on a constant basis while still focusing on utilizing the blade in question. A quick horizontal slash is made. Mid swing, he flips the blade so that a second continuous attack is chained in. This allows for a sudden upward slash. An onlooker might be amazed at the 15 foot reach each slash possessed.* - Tue Nov 10 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) retracted the blade once more as its fuel was purposely depleted. Byakuren's hand dropped down to his side, as the kunai turned to normal. The white haired male attempted a different application process, as his free hand formed a cup directly in front of his lips. Suddenly he breathed forth the same wind, allowing it to ball up inisde his hand. Quickly, before the wind dispersed, he'd run it along the side of his kunai. This formed the same wind sword as before.* - Tue Nov 10 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) summons forth his kunai. Without a moment's notice, Byakuren was already inhaling a deep breath before expending forth a long stream of condensed chakra infused wind. Much like before, it enveloped the kunai's blade completely. It wiggled with life, morphing into a long sword-like wind blade of which Byakuren desired.* - Wed Nov 11 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) flicked his new blade to the side. The wind atop the kunai beckoned towards its immediate surroundings. It seemed to shimmer with anticipation as Byakuren's body prepared itself. Suddenly, his hand moved forth and body responded in toe. The kunai was ushered forth in a deep horizontal slash. A thick blade of wind slashed forth, extending 15 feet forward. Grassy death was left in its wake.* - Wed Nov 11 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) doesn't let up, forcing his body to dance about, as if he was riding the wind himself. His overall movements expressed great control over his physical body, perhaps in compensation for his lack of slight. Either way, his movements for ideal, but the actual slashes lacked depth. This wasn't that big of a deal however, due to the wind sword attached to the end of the kunai. It created a great deal of killing potential.* - Wed Nov 11 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continued his display of mediocre sword skill. A range of slashes were made utilizing the kunai, the tall field of grass turning to butter around him. With every slash came a great deal of focus, both physically and spiritually. Byakuren had to keep a constant stream of chakra flowing to the blade in order to maintain the technique in question.* - Wed Nov 11 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) stopped at the end of a long execution chain. His breath turned shallow and sweat accumulated at the top of his brow. Byakuren retracted his body as he took a brief moment to rest, the blade suddenly fading before dissapearing completely. Its upkeep wasn't that great of a strain, but stacked use ammounted to a good chunk of chakra. However, Byakuren could feel his body loosening up and becoming more intuned with the technique.* - Wed Nov 11 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) took a moment to recall his past attempts at using the technique. His brain quickly flooded with information, all in the form of muscle, audio and overall sensual memory. Moved his hand real quick in comparison as he analyzed ways to improve both his form and control over the Vacuum Blade technique. Suddenly an idea hit him, of which he executed immediately. A breath of wind was blown across the tip of the kunai, reforming the wind sword he was using previously.* - Wed Nov 11 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) quickly withdraws shuriken from his kimono. He places them atop his fingertip before beginning his usual display of using the Vacuum Blade. A a concentrated beam of wind is exhaled from his mouth towards each shuriken, forcing them to rotate with force. Their rotation speed increases expontentially as the wind envelops them.* - Fri Nov 13 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) casually reaches into his kimono and pulls out a kunai. He brings it up to his lips and swiftly breathes a concentrated stream of wind against it. The wind takes on a condensed form  as it wraps around the kunai, effectively greating a wind sword using the kunai as a base.

<Wind Release: Vacuum Blade>* - Sat Nov 14 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) conjures forth shuriken from the folds of his kimono. He inhales, before giving a firm whistle towards each shuriken. A stream of wind bellowed out and enveloped each shuriken, coating them in a thing, circular disk of sharp, condensed wind chakra. Byakuren quickly flicked each wrist and sent the shuriken on their way.* - Wed Nov 18 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) produces a quantity of shurikens from his kimono. He'd set up an assembly line of sorts, drawing one after the other and spinning it atop his index finger. His body followed as it welcomed in air before releasing a stream of concentrated wind across each shuriken. Like always, the wind would wrap itself around each shuriken and create a thin disc-like shape.* - Thu Nov 19 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) worked with each shuriken as they were made. His body would turn gracefuly, releasing each spinning shuriken from the tip of his finger. They'd churn the air around them, tearing through a large layer of grass and causing a wake of destruction around them.* - Thu Nov 19 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continued his onslaught, producing one shuriken after the other. With each shuriken came minor innovation with how they were released and created. Byakuren was already quite familiar with the technique and at this point he was just working on improving the smallest detail. Results were small, but quantiful. His mind flooded with information.* - Thu Nov 19 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) produces more shuriken from the confines of his garb. He'd smoothly spin one atop his index finger and bring it towards his lips. A long stream of chakra infused wind bellowed forth from his mouth and coated the shuriken in its sweet goo. Byakuren quickly launched them from his stationary position, letting the destruction unfold before him.* - Fri Nov 20 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) switches it up and prepares a kunai in place of his many shuriken. His hand flicks the kunai skywards, placing the tip just before his lips. Like usually, he allows a stream of wind to escape his mouth and encompass the entirety of the metal before him. The wind churned mid-air and clinged to the metal kunai, before extending upwards and flickering with like. A wind sword of sorts was made.

<Wind Release:Vacuum Blade!>* - Fri Nov 20 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) draws forth one of his trusty kunais. He flips it towards his mouth and breathes a jetstream of wind towards it. The wind russhes forth, pelting the kunai and melding with its being. It wiggled and writhed with life, quickly forming a wind-like sword. Now ready, Byakuren pushed his kunai-sword to the side, preparing to use it.* - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) immediately stepped forward, quickly swiping his new sword across the plains with speed. As the blade made its way, the wind atop the kunai awoke with life. The response resulted in a quick extension, creating sudden burst from the wind blade. It seemed to immediately lunge out from its original position lash out 15 feet away from himself.* - Fri Nov 20 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) didn't let up as he pushed his body to perform rather acrobatic feats. He maintained a reflexive stance while performing a variety of strikes with the wind sword in question. With each strike came surprisng power and reach. As such, he wailed at a boulder 15 feet away from himself.* - Fri Nov 20 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continued to dance about the grassy terrain around him, demonstrating his complex control over both his body and his senses. With each step came a timed slash with his wind sword, aimed far away from him in order to confirm its powers. An intricate display of multitasking was being done, if you added in the chakra output Byakuren had to maintain while doing everything else, but by now his body was more than used to it. Overall, it was an impressive display of skill and mastery over his skill.* - Fri Nov 20 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) finally stopped, his wind sword lowering to his side and fading away. The wind finally dispersed, it's fuel running out by Byakuren's choice. A thin smile formed on his face. He was satisfied with his work and felt like there was little more he could due, at least at this moment, to improve the technique's power or control any further. With that in find, it was time for him to move on to the next training sessions. This of course would be his signature summoning technique.* - Fri Nov 20 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply swiped his thumb across his canines, drawing forth an adequate amount of blood for the technique. It acted as both a signature and sacrifice of sorts, allowing himself to allign with that which he was contracted with. After a quick smear, his hands instinctively locked together and performed 4 distinct handseals. Finally came a firm pound to the ground. What followed was a large summoning circle, a plume of smoke and a rumble equivalent to the thud of a large creature.* - Fri Nov 20 15:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || Another rumble follows as a rather large shadow begins to emerge from the giant cloud of smoke. Suddenly, brown fur is seen and four legs become available. Deafening barks follow suit, enough to make one cringe and cover their ears. Byakuren on the other hand seemed unphased, having experienced such before. The smoke veil lifted and revealed a familiar sight; a colossal Ninken by the name of Mamoru.* - Fri Nov 20 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gives a thin smile towards his old friend, who just happened to be a 55 foot Saint Bernard. Mamoru simply nodded as he lowered himself, perhaps trying to get a better view of Byakuren.

"What is it now, Chiyari?"

Byakuren furrows his brows for a moment, before speaking firmly.

"I thought I told you to call me Byakuren? That name no longer has a place here."

Mamoru gave a single bark, seeming nonchalant.

"Right. . . then what is it, Byakuren?"

Byakuren shook his head for a moment.

"Same as usual. Lets get to it."* - Fri Nov 20 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || After their short exchange, Mamoru dispersed. A clear understanding was met between the two as Byakuren began his session. As he has done countless times before, Byakuren drew blood and began performing his signature handseals. A well of chakra swelled inside his core before releasing all at once, with a single hand pound to the ground. The same, humongous summoning appeared as before.

<Kuchiyose no Jutsu!>* - Fri Nov 20 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) repeated this process on countless occasions. His ability to draw forth chakra and produce more results before needed to rest was clearly improving throughout his entire journey. However there was still improvements Byakuren wished to see happen, so here he was doing it all over again. Of course, in comparison to before, he had improved immensely already.* - Fri Nov 20 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continues to produce results. His hands flourish and his blood spills. Chakra is constantly molded deep inside his core in response to all his execution. Everytime, Mamoru answers Byakuren's call and summons himself forth with his master's help. However, his stay is cut short everytime in order to support Byakuren's own training. Words seemed nonexistant in this entire process, showing their bond and understanding of one another.* - Fri Nov 20 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slits open his dumb before locking his hands together. They moved quickly, forming special hand signs. Boar Dog, Bird, Monkey and Ram were all used in the process. He then abruptly stopped. At this point, chakra was already flowing thrroughout his system, moving from his core down to a single right hand. Byakuren quickly dropped down low, smacking his hand upon the ground. A sudden rumble followed suit, followed by a large summoning circle.* - Fri Nov 20 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) manages to finish his summoning as the smoke veil clears. A giant Saint Bernard, by the name of Mamoru, was revealed. His giant head turned as he scanned the general vicinity. Soon, his sight wandered towards Byakuren, who met him with a single nod. With that single gesture, came an understanding between two. Oh which the large Ninken responded, dissapearing.* - Fri Nov 20 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slides his thumb against his canines and begins flourishing his hands.Blood trickled across his hands in the process and chakra kneaded  itself deep with in his core. His hands finally stopped, finding their way towards the grassy terrain. A loud thump was made which forced all his chakra to burst forth from the impacting hand. What followed was the usual, as a large circle was conjured forth.* - Sat Nov 21 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) smoke erupted skywards from Byakuren's original location, pluming up like a mushroom and blanketing a sizeable area. A shadow appeared from with in, followed by a large bark. The smoke quickly cleared, revealing a large sand-colored Ninken named Mamoru. Byakuren and Mamoru made "eye" contact before dismissing each other. Mamoru dissapeared, prepared to be summon again.* - Sat Nov 21 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continues to offer up his blood and chakra with each successful attempt at conjuring forth his large Ninken. Hands flourished, chakra molded and overall summonings were performed. Like always, Byakuren would continue this rigourous training routine in order to improve himself. He had something to accomplish, but without the proper amount of power he wouldn't be able to protect anything.* - Sat Nov 21 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) mentally grasped hold of his intangible bond that he and his summons had. Byakuren continued to reaffirm the connection, improving it with each success and struggle that they went through together. It wasn't just coexistance, but a form of friendship. At this point, Byakuren has spent more time alongside his Ninken than any other living being out there.* - Sat Nov 21 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slits his right middle finger, starting fresh. Some of his other fingers were already over bruised from all the summoning, so he was forced to move onto a different finger. This just reaffirmed the effort Byakuren was putting into the overall process. Either way, his hands went about their business and formed handseals. Finished, he'd smack his hand directly below him, conjuring up a large summoning circle.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Sat Nov 21 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || A familiar smoke cloud shot up from the center of the circle. It spread out like a veil, masking a colossal shadowy figure. The ground shook as what seemed to be large legs broke through the smoke. The sheer bulk of the creature would be enough to knock unsuspecting creatures off their feet. Byakuren however remained his ground, as the identity of the creature was finally revealed. It was Mamoru, his personal Ninken.* - Sat Nov 21 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) beckoned towards his massive companion. Mamoru responded, forcing his body lower to the ground before finally laying himself upon it. Such movement ushered forth yet another rumble. Byakuren took this opportunity to leap, landing atop Mamoru's giant head. With a single tap, Mamoru rose from the ground. Byakuren was hoisted a good 55 feet of the ground. He took a meditative seat atop Mamoru's head.* - Sat Nov 21 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) stilled himself as he sat atop the colossal Ninken's head. His breathing slowed and senses dulled in the process. Byakuren eased himself into a peaceful, meditative state. His conciousness went inward, forcing himself deep with in his own being. Now in his new state, Byakuren would 'swim' and locate his chakra circulatory system. Suddenly, a silver, glowing humanoid iamge of himself appeared. His chakra system was outlined clearly, showing the water like flow it possessed.* - Sat Nov 21 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continues to meditate. While he sat atop Mamoru's head, he'd cotninue to monitor his own vitals and chakra system. This gave him greater control over his inner body, which in turn affected how chakra formed and left his system. WHile in this state, he'd experiment the best he could by altering various measures in terms of actually forming the chakra needed to keeping Mamoru summoned.* - Sat Nov 21 18:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) kept this new method up. While not as physical as mindlessly summoning over and over again, the technique still required a great deal of energy and concentration. Another noticeable difference is how much time passed. It was slow and calm, as time passed by like nothing. Byakuren was in his own world at this point, just fluctuating his chakra back and forth and letting it flow to Mamoru as fuel.* - Sat Nov 21 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || Hours pass as the sun's rays pelt Byakuren and Mamoru's form relentlessly. Heat surrounds Byakuren's visage, sweat dripping every now and then. However, despite these conditions and various distractions, Byakuren maintains perfect composure. Only one thing is on his mind and that's improving both himself and his companion. As such it was vital for him to move past the lame weather and focus on the task at hand.* - Sat Nov 21 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) inhales and then exhales deeply. This was done on a regular basis, which gave his body enough air flow to remain calm and relaxed, which was vital for meditation. This process went on for a considerable amount of time, due to his constant monitoring of his own chakra. He stored various bits of information in the back of his head, including his overall pool of chakra, the shape and forms of which he molded it to, the various speeds of which it flowed etc.* - Sat Nov 21 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) peacefuly maintains his meditation as Mamoru keeps watch around him. The currently self-absorbed Byakuren continues to tamper with his chakra flow in various ways. Part by part, he finds ways to control how much chakra is needed to fuel Mamoru's stay in their current realm. Patience and concentration were key factors here, of which Byakuren was excellent at.* - Sat Nov 21 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slowly eases out of his meditattive state. His dull eyes snap open and the rest of his senses awaken, taking in a sudden flood of sensual information. Byakuren recovered himself and tapped Mamoru atop his head, signaling him to let Byakuren down. Mamoru responsed, lowering himself and allowing Byakuren to jump off. After, Mamoru dissapeared, awaiting further summmons.* - Sat Nov 21 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) worked his calloused hands further, biting wounds in his finger and drawing forth blood. They performed the four handseals he was known for; Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Ram. He then smacked a rough hand against the ground, mixing blood and chakra with grass and dirt. A large circle, filled with complicated writing, suddenly expanded out, Byakuren's hand acting as the origin. Suddenly smoke plumed skywards. He, of course, had summoned his faithful companion Mamoru.* - Sat Nov 21 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) pounded out the technique a plethora of times. Heat rays smacked against Byakuren's frame as various bodily fluids fell to the earth. Blood, sweat and chakra were all expended in the process. Such was the price of vigorous training, but despite this Byakuren continued onwards. He was close, he could feel it.* - Sat Nov 21 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) went back to the standard summoning process. His hands moved to form specific handseals. Chakra swirled deep in his core, comming from every nook and cranny of his circulatory system. Finally, everything exploded as Byakuren released his hand, smacking it against the terrain. Once again, he called out.

"Kuchiyose no Jutsu!"* - Sun Nov 22 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) began performing handseals once again. His work seemed never ending as he shot off each attempt, one after the other. He created a spreadsheet of sorts inside his head, categorizing each attempt and analyzing the steps made during said execution. It was a complicated process, one that only Byakuren himself could understand due to his unique mental mapping.* - Sun Nov 22 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) drew forth dark, red ichor. It smeared across his hand, signaling a greater purpose. Suddenly his hands flourished, performing four distinct handseals. Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey and Ram went by in a flash, following a specific sequence. Suddenly his hands halted, as Byakuren lowered himself. He broke formation and smacked his hand hard against the firm ground. It shook as a large summoning circle sprawled forth from his hand. Smoke followed and in it stood a shadowy, colossal figure.* - Sun Nov 22 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) emerges from the smoke, now a good 55 feet in the air. A large, colossal Ninken was underneath him, having hoisted him up during the short time the smoke concealed them. Byakuren looked downwards, motioning for Mamoru to move forward. The Ninken silently obeyed, suddenly lunging forth. He rushed across the plains, trampling heaps of grass and greating minor tremors.* - Sun Nov 22 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) maintained a firm stance atop Mamoru. He clung against the beast's sand colored fur as they traveled sizeable lengths around the mountain. Meanwhile, Byakuren made sure to keep his chakra in check. He had to accurately gauge his chakra, midrun, in order to provide Mamoru with just the right amount in order for him to stay in this realm.* - Sun Nov 22 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) came to a halt. Mamoru lowered himself, feeling his time comming to an end. Byakuren quickly jumped off, waving good bye as his companion dispersed into a puff of smoke. Byakuren gave a thing smile, satisfied with all his work. He came a long way. Now it was time to move on to a simplier task. As such, he calmed himself and formed a single handseal. He then forced a burst of chakra through his entire body.

<Kai!>* - Sun Nov 22 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gave it another go. His body stilled and his breathing slowed. He focused inward of himself, simultaneously holding up a single seal. His chakra welled deep in his core, building up a sizeable amount. In response, his system halted momentarily. Suddenly everything bursted forth, as if floodgates were just opened. The new chakra ran rampant, completely expunging his system of impurities.* - Sun Nov 22 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) immediately repeated the process. His body was already stilled and prepared, having done the technique a few times earlier. An efficient display of chakra control was displayed as he intuitively held up his seal. Chakra bubbled and accumlated inside his pit, before finally being forced throughout his system. It cleared out any old chakra and provided a new flow.

<Kai!>* - Sun Nov 22 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) forced himself up. His senses expanded outwards, picking up everything in a 50 foot radius. Feeling everything was clear, the male would begin another long training session. For now, he'd practice a simple, but useful technique. His hands interlocked, forming a single handseal. Suddenly he'd smack his hand against the ground, sending a wave of chakra through it. In that brief moment, Byakuren's figure dissapeared. . .* - Thu Nov 26 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) || The earth churned mometarily, rustling the grass above. Byakuren's new location was now apparent, having moved directly under the earth using a perculiar ninjutsu. The white-haired man felt an uneccesary expendature of chakra. Clearly the technique was out of his element and would take some time getting use to. Even then, Byakuren felt there was a restriction on the progress he'd be able to make with the Earth technique.* - Thu Nov 26 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) moved underneath the earth, traveling at a surprisngly slow rate. Byakuren narrowed his brows as he continued to push through the earth, forcing chakra into it on a regular basis. While difficult, Byakuren seemed to be making noticeable progress. He did have a knack for learning in general.* - Thu Nov 26 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) struggled to move his hands through the earth, attempting to clasp them together. After some effort, he finally made contact. This gesture, followed by another burst of chakra, signaled a second effect. Suddenly, Byakuren's hand bursted from the earth. In one fluid movement he found himself atop the grassy terrain once again.

"Mmmm. . ."* - Thu Nov 26 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) brought a hand to his neck, firmly pushing it to the side. A loud crack eminated from with in, signs of discomfort forming on his face. Being underground was bad enough, but not having full control over how your body moved while under was even worse. This was just yet another project for Byakuren to work on. Not only that, but should he master, or at least get as close to mastering as his abilities allow, this technique then he'd be set on training its more advanced cousin. Without a moment's notice, he began executing the technique.* - Thu Nov 26 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) held the same seal as last time. Chakra flowed into his arms, just as he pressed his now free hand against the earth. The built up chakra soiled the ground beneath him, temporarily terraforming it. He was gone without a trace, but not too far. In fact he was just a foot or so from the surface. There were clear limitations on the technique being used and this was one of them.* - Thu Nov 26 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) used his excellent sensory capabilities to keep an 'eye' on the surface. He moved through the earth, albeit at a slowed pace. With every step came a sense of excersie. This, of course, would inevitably make his body more use to using the technique in question. Either way, he continued moving about before comming upon a distinct target. It was a small, flickering aura of chakra in his mind. It had suddenly stopped, just above Byakuren. Taking his chance, he'd shoot up and through the earth.

<Earth Style: Headhunter Jutsu>* - Thu Nov 26 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) made contact with the entity above him, his hand filling with a soft, fleshy texture. As true to the technique, he maintained his grasp and dragged it into the earth. Meanwhile, his body had sprung up and was now atop the surface, His dull eyes turned their gaze towards whatever it was that he managed to drag in. After a brief analysis, Byakuren was able to discern what the entity was. It was a poor, defenseless rabbit.* - Thu Nov 26 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gave a thin frown as he kneeled towards the rabbit. It's head was the only thing not buried beneath the earth. It hadd a frantic look upon its face, struggling to get out. Realizing its sufferinng, Byakuren quickly worked to free the rabbit from the technique. After some effort, he managed to loosen the earth just enough for the poor creature to tear itself free and hop off into the distance.* - Thu Nov 26 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) cast the small incident from his mind, satisfied that the rabbit was not harmed. Instead, he focused his mind upon the Headhunter technique he had been practicing just moments before. His hands locked together once again, gathering the necessary chakra with haste. Before long, he found himself beneath the earth once again. His body was slowly getting used to being under such closed spaces for an extended period of time. There was still much work to be done however.* - Thu Nov 26 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply stood where he was, having adequate oxygen for more than a few minutes. Byakuren kept his calm as he stilled his breath, eliminating unnecessary movements. He entered a pseudo-meditative form of sorts, finidng ways to make his movements more efficient and his senses more aware while utilizing the technique.* - Thu Nov 26 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) allowed his senses to feed him various bits of information. He absorbed it all, forcing his mind to process it in a timely manner. Suddenly he made his move, breaking from the earth. He shot upwards, intuitively using his chakra to force the earth to crumble under his might. He broke free, successful.* - Thu Nov 26 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) had improved a considerable sum. He was close to his limit of mastery. As such, he decided to attempt one last session. Having read his thoughts, his body moved accordingly. Hands formed familiar seals, drawing blood and then hitting the earth gently. Suddenly a single Ninken was summoned forth. His name was Sora, a rather airheaded beagle.

"Hi, master! What are we doing? Fetch?"

Byakuren shook his head, not that accepting of the Ninken's lack of seriousness.

"No. Just go run around for me, alright?"

Sora yelped, before running around in cricles.* - Thu Nov 26 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) shrugged as Sora crazily ran about. It seemed like the Ninken was really enjoying himself. Byakuren on the otherhand took on a more serious expression, his hands locking together. Suddenly he plunged into the earth, much like before. From there, he'd extend his senses. He quickly picked up on Sora's bright aura, as it moved about like a ferret on crack.* - Thu Nov 26 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) stalked Sora's presence. He moved under ground, slowly. Byakuren wasn't able to move as fast as Sora, but he still had a plan in mind. So, he began logging in various bits of data. Byakuren kept detailed tabs on Sora's running pattern, noting his speed and where he might be at any given time. For now, it was a game of patience. .  Of course, oyxgen was still a limited resource.* - Thu Nov 26 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) moved into action. His location turned eastwards because he had deduced Sora's next most likely stop. Having arrived at his spot, Byakuren would simply wait and watch much as he had done before. Suddenly, Sora;s aura seemed to bolt directly towards him. He was comming upon the spot Byakuren believed he would go to. He came fast, but Byakuren was prepared. Suddenly he bursted forth from the earth, just barely catching hold of Sora's leg. Then, it was cake as he dragged Sora into the earth. Byakuren now stood tall over the dog, a thin smile on his face. Sora was covered in earth, his head the only piece sticking out.

"W-what?"

Sora seemed confused, but Byakuren felt it pointless to explain.

"It was just a test."

"H-huh? B-"

Suddenly Byakuren desummed Sora, satisfied with his work.* - Thu Nov 26 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) felt comfortable with his current standing in terms of utilizing the Headhunter technique. Now, it was time to move on to the next step. There was another technique he had come to learn recently by the name of "Hiding like a Mole." As the name implies, it allows the use to, much like a mole, dig underground and move about. It shared similiarities with the Headhunter technique, but was much more versatile and spacious. With that in mind, Byakuren prepared himself for yet another training session.* - Thu Nov 26 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) motioned his hands forward, locking them together to form a single hand sign. Chakra surged through his system, reaching up into his arms. Suddenly, Byakuren placed a firm hand to the earth. This released his built up chakra, which soiled the earth around it. Quickly it terraformed into a finer substance. The next moment, Byakuren dissapeared out of sight, falling into what was assumed to be a hole created by himself.* - Fri Nov 27 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) stilled himself as he fell a considerable distance into the earth. Suddenly he stopped, having reached his limit. The space around him was restricting and suffocating, but such was expected. Perhaps with further use his body would become use to the conditions coupled with a greater mastery over the technique. Either way, he remained there, keeping a barrier of chakra around himself.* - Fri Nov 27 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) took in a breath of cramped air. Oxygen was limited in his current state, so he had to monitor how much he used as well as keeping calm. Byakuren continued this practice up, maintaining a calm deameanor and controlling his breathing rate. It was difficult, but manageable.* - Fri Nov 27 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) expanded his senses. His breathing was calm, as state before. A wave of auditory and other sensual information flooded his body. It seems that, while utilizing the technique, his own sensory prowess was amplified greatly. This was due to the new ability of being able to monitor magnetic forces while hiding under the earth, bundled with his own sensory powers.* - Fri Nov 27 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) pulsed with information. The magnetic forces in question flooded his person as various disturbances above ground acted up. By the wave of the pulse, Byakuren assumed various, small entities were bustling about up on the surface. Byakuren gave a thin smile, impressed by how useful the ability was. It would definetly come in handy in the future.* - Fri Nov 27 20:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) motions his hands forward, taking it upon himself to form a single seal. The sound of success rang out as his body acted as a conduit of chakra, all gathering into Byakuren's core. The man's next movements were simple and firm, a single hand pounding against the ground. All at once, the chakra built up inside his body was funneled out his arm and into the earth. It terraformed the ground on contact, reaching deeper with in. Suddenly, Byakuren was gone.* - Wed Dec  2 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gulped in an adequate amount of oxygen as he took in his new surroundings. Byakuren was now a good 10 feet inside the earth, all thanks to the mole technique. His senses expanded outwards and became one with the earth's. Magnetic pulses resonated all around him and flowed into his body as a type of sensual infromation. The white-haired male kept his wits about him, channeling this new sensory information. He was both practicing and keeping an 'eye' on his surroundings.* - Wed Dec  2 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) closes his eyes out of instinct rather than practicality. Waves of information flooded his mind, some useful some utter nonsense. It was his job to sort through the bits and pieces, perhaps finding what he was looking for. Of course in reality, he didn't really have a particular object in mind. He was merely improving his own capbilities and practicing his skills.* - Wed Dec  2 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) halted his meditative state. His body suddenly stirred as he willed it to move forward. Just as he commanded, his legs and arms pushed through the earth. They, like the rest of his body, seemed to be coated in a sort of protective layer of chakra. This layer terraformed the area around it, making solid earth easily traversible. And so he began moving about under the earth.* - Wed Dec  2 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) pushes forward. By now, his body had turned horizontal, as if he were 'swimming' through the earth itself. His progress was slow, but noticeable. With each movement came the loss of chakra and energy, but such was the necessary price. The overall drain wasn't as bad as when he first started his training session. He was positive in the feats he was about to accomplish in terms of mastering the Mole technique.* - Wed Dec  2 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) started combining all his efforts. He was multitasking a great length at this point as he accepted magnetic impulses, proccessed them, molded his chakra, moved through the earth and more. Such divided work would prove ineffective with a normal person, but luckily Byakuren was a natural when it came to such complicated procedures. Even now he was analyzing his work and looking for ways to improve it down to the smallest detail.* - Wed Dec  2 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) continued to work with what he had. Oxygen was running low at this point, but Byakuren was well aware of the approximate amount of time he had left. He wanted to continue his earthly exploration as a means to train his body and mind to the confines of the underground. An interal clock was ticking by the moment, marking what little time he had left. In response, he began forcing his way up towards the surface.* - Wed Dec  2 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) was nearing the surface. His chakra extended just above him as it created a tear in the earth. Suddenly, Byakuren bursted forth and was branded with sunlight. Byakuren immediately turned his attention back towards the hole he created. Sensing it was still there, he motioned a hand forward and allowed for it to finally close behind him. He then took in a gulp of fresh air, cracking a thin smile.* - Wed Dec  2 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) took a considerable rest above ground in order to gather his thoughts, fresh air and other such things. After awhile, he felt back up to the task and began his work anew. Like before, his hands locked together to form a single handseal. Chakra trickled from various parts of his body, making their way into the center of his abdomen. Satisfied with the amount, Byakuren knelt to the earth fluidly and placed a free hand upon it. The chakra worked its magic and, like before, Byakuren was gone.* - Wed Dec  2 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) immediately began his work under the earth. His hands locked together, as a way to gather various things. This included chakra, sensual information as well as his breath. With the necessary tools, Byakuren went to work. His mind created a perculiar map, brought about by the magnetic forces pulsing around him. From there, he paved a route in this mind map of his and began his work. He began making slow progress, not entirely comfortable with the technique. However he had improved greatly in comparison to when he first performed the technique in question.* - Wed Dec  2 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply followed the predetermined route he had made himself. His body moved through the earth unnaturally, fueled by his constant chakra output. It was awkward, but that was to be expected. Honestly, much of the session was as dull as one might expect. Constant use and understanding was the only way to move forward.* - Wed Dec  2 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) repeated the same process as he had done countless times before. His effort never declined. If one were to mark his willpower and ability output, you would notice a continuous climb. With still a considerable amount of oyxgen left, Byakuren simply utilized the mole technique on a regular basis.* - Wed Dec  2 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) yawned for a moment before placing his hands together. This signaled a quick change in his system, forcing chakra into his pit. It was gathered swiftly and efficiently, before being released moments later. simultaneously, Byakuren's hands fell to the earth and were firmly planted into the grassy terrain. The chakra swelled before being pushed into the earth. The rock directly below Byakuren was carved by the chakra, creating a hole. Byakuren soon dissapeared.* - Wed Dec  2 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) fell into the earth with little resistance, rock loosing its solid shape around him as he passed. After descending a considerable distance Byakuren finally halted himself. His hands parted as he stilled the rest of his body. A relaxing sense of isolation washed over his being and his senses went full gear. He was keeping an 'eye' on the surface above him.* - Wed Dec  2 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) turned his attention skywards. His body did its work, alongside ample chakra control. He ascended at a decent pace, still slowed by the solid rock all around him. He found himself nearing the surface, which made him force a single hand skywards. Suddenly a hole opened up and he bursted through to the surface. Instantly after the hole behind him closed and he himself took a breath of fresh air.* - Wed Dec  2 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) began gathering chakra, wishing to perform the mole jutsu once again. His hands were firmly locked together and his focus inward. Finally, he brought his hand down and unleashed a small torrent of chakra into the earth. In that same instant, Byakuren found himself deep with in the earth.

<Earth Style: Hiding like a Mole Jutsu!>* - Wed Dec  2 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) fell a considerable distance before finally stopping himself. Now lodge deep inside the earth, Byakuren began manipulating his body in ways agreeable to his surrounding landscape; solid rock. His body continued to exert chakra in order to allow him the ability to pass through said rock. His main goal was to return to the surface, despite having gone down just moments before.* - Wed Dec  2 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) made a few turns here and there before finally shooting skyward. His goal was to appear above the surface once again, as fast as possible. Of course, his speed was greatly hindered due to not being entirely comfortable with his current mode of transportation. This was coupled by not having a natural Earth affinity, but such wasn't necessary. To make up for his faults he worked much harder and smarter.* - Wed Dec  2 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) cassualy casts a dull glance down the mountain. A faint breeze washed over him, accompanied by a sense of accomplishment. The existence known as Byakuren, one of which came to be recently, had been atop this mountain for a long time. He couldn't remember the last time he had made contact with another living being aside from his canine companions, but such was to be expected. He had isolated himself for a reason, albeit one he had forgotten long ago. Perhaps he was running away? Perhaps he was just buying time? Such mysteries still remain unknown to him, but one thing was clear. He had changed. He could feel it too. Not just his own metamorphosis, but the wind's as well. He could sense the world had moved on just as he did, but in a more dramatic way. 

The white-haired male took a single step forward. . .
In that moment marked the beginning of a new journey in his life. Just like that, the hermit descended from his mountain.* - Fri Dec  4 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) came upon the gates of a familiar village, one of which he had done battle in long ago; Konohagakure. Glimpses of the past flash mometarily inside his mind. Feelings of old washed over him for a moment, however a quick shake of his head removed them from his mind. He had new concerns to worry about.

Now upon the entrance, the rugged looking traveler drew both hands into the confines of his sleeves and entered. From here, fate guided him.* - Fri Dec  4 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) removed a hand from the confines of his kimono, stifling a yawn as he walked. His attention turned towards a lone individual blocking the path. A smooth smile crossed the slightly rugged individual's face. A strange sense of delight seemed to cling to the man's aura.

"Greetings!"

His voice carried a strange 'light' to it, laced with an older man's tone.* - Fri Dec  4 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) kept his intruding smile up the entire time. He picked up on the girl's lack of interest, a look of dissapointment momentarily plastering itself upon his face. Byakuren awkwardly rubbed the back of his head while talking.

"Ehh, I'm usually doing the helping. Haha."

This man sported an intricate looking, open kimono combined with a few unusual features. Specifically an eyepatch over his left eye and a scar across his exposed chest.

"I'm a wandering priest of sorts. If you want, I could like read your fortune or something. Maybe bless you for any upcoming expeditions?"* - Fri Dec  4 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) thinks: Young girls and guys are interested in that type of stuff, right? Man I'm old. .sorta. - Fri Dec  4 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) slumped over slightly, feeling a bit dejected.

"Oh, is that so?"

Byakuren brought his hand upon his chin and rubbed in thought.

"You don't have to really be religious to want a fortune or two. How about it? I could even give you an insight on your future romance~"* - Fri Dec  4 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply nods. He wasn't one to ignore obvious cues of disinterest and, well, irritation. Byakuren cracked one last smile before placing his free hand back into the confines of his kimono.

"Alright then. Sorry for bothering you Miss. I wish you many blessings in life."

He bowed his head gently before making his way forward. His attention landed upon the newcomer, Ai.

"Mmmm?"* - Fri Dec  4 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) lifts a brow as a wave of familiarity hits him. He brushes it to the side however, shaking his head as Ai's words hit his ears.

"I have not. I have a feeling you'll find them soon though."

Byakuren stepped out of Ai's way and would continue onwards unless interupted.* - Fri Dec  4 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ... - Fri Dec  4 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Y-yes.... do you need anything? - Fri Dec  4 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) stumbles into the mansion, a yawn escaping his porcelain lips. His attention is quickly turned towards the two individuals seated. An unyielding smile suddenly plasters itself upon the man's face.

His attire is marked by an open, intricate kimono and a few distinct markings. These include the eyepatch strapped across his left eye and ominous scar across his exposed chest. A wild mane of white hair flows from the top of his head and his physique and look give off an older feel.

"Greetings!"

The man makes a few strides across the way as he begins to talk. A benevolent aura excretes from his person, laced with 'life' experience.

"How do you do? My name is Byakuren and I'm a wandering priest of sorts~ Want me to read your fortune young miss, or perhaps create a cute little charm for you or a loved one?"

He seemed slightly oblivious to his surroundings.* - Fri Dec  4 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) thinks: Business doesn't seem to be going well here. . . - Fri Dec  4 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) had struck out again. Not only were the responses similiar, but the overall mood was as well. Byakuren rubbed the back of his head awkwardly for a moment, having been rejected twice in a row. It seems his first contacts weren't working out so great so far.

"Is that so? Well then. . ."

Byakuren retracted his hand and placed it back into the confines of his kimono. His smile returned as he gave a bow.

"Thank you for welcoming me to your village. Do not worry, I am a man of Peace and have no talent for trouble. It seems I have caught you at a bad time, so I'll go ahead and excuse myself."

Byakuren prepared to exit the building, unless interupted.* - Fri Dec  4 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) thinks: I wonder if the rest of the villagers are like this. . .  - Fri Dec  4 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Take care... - Fri Dec  4 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) says: You too. I wish you the best of blessings. - Fri Dec  4 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) turns around. His procelain lips part and suddenly. . . .A MASSIVE BEAM OF DARK MATTER SPEWS FROM HIS MOUTH AND DESTROYS EVERYTHING IN A 10 MILE RADIUS.* - Fri Dec  4 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) lets out a brief yawn before turning his attention elsewhere. A radiating mass of chakra swells his senses, of which grabs Byakuren's gaze. The rugged, older male dully stared at the armour clad individual. A wild mane of white hair spews from the top of his head, highlighting his exposed, scarred chest and eyepatch.

"Mmmm. . "

His brow lifts curiously as his ears pick up on heavy clatter and the sound of a man. A smile plasters across the man's face. His own aura seems to excrete a light benevolence and 'life' experience.

"Greetings! Would you like your fortunate read? Or perhaps a lucky charm to take on your travels?"* - Fri Dec  4 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) thinks: That's. . .an interesting mass of chakra. - Fri Dec  4 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) simply maintains his smile.

"I'm more of a wandering priest if anything, but sure you can get both. You are the first one to actually agree to anything in this village. Many possessed rather unhappy moods."

Byakuren extends his hand out towards the armoured individual, beckoning him forwards. His gaze seemed locked on the man.

"Lets do the reading first."* - Fri Dec  4 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) held his hand out.

"All you gotta do is give me your hand. That way, I can connect you with the spiritual forces around us."* - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) thinks: Probably. . . - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) lightly clasps his hand around the armoured variant of the person before him. The coldness of the metal funneled up his arm and through his body.

"Mmmm. . ."

Byakuren furrowed his brow for a moment, seemingly deep in thought. After a brief moment, his eyes opened and his lips parted.

"I see. . There is alot more to you than meets the eye. I sense a vibrant spirit misunderstood by most. Your struggles have numbered many, but never have you been corrupted by them. Yes. . ."

The white-haired male brought out his other hand and placed it upon his chin.

"Ooooh. . this is interesting indeed. There is latent potential in you, young one. A greater calling beckons you. Soon, you will tread a path alongside others longing for a better world. A hero, perhaps?"

Byakuren lets go of the armoured man's hand and grins. His hand reaches into the confines of his kimono and pulls out a cheap pendant of sorts. Attached to a chain was a symbol. A silver pawprint overlaid by a silver fang were carved into it. He handed it over towards him.* - Fri Dec  4 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) repositioned his body after finishing said fortune.

"Well, that's it for the fortune. Go ahead and hold on to that charm though, I'm sure it will aide you on your adventures."

Byakuren paused briefly before speaking again.

"So tell me, are you a resident of this village?"* - Fri Dec  4 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) says: Oh, is that so? Sounds suiting. Do you enjoy protecting others? - Fri Dec  4 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Well... If I could! Ahaha! But. Don't tell anyone...I'm super weak! - Fri Dec  4 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: This armor scares people off, ahaha! - Fri Dec  4 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) says: Perhaps, but there is more than one way of protecting someone. You've found your own way and that's what matters. - Fri Dec  4 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Byakuren(Guujin) says: Besides, strength isn't measure by your physical prowess, but your heart. - Fri Dec  4 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) chuckles a bit.

"Anyways, how do you feel about putting your effort towards a greater good? One of epic, just and pure proportions?"* - Fri Dec  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gently tapped a finger against his forearm.

"Peaceful? I guess you could say that on a smaller scale. Really, though, Darkness plagues beyond what the eye can see. Sure, your immediate surroundings might be at peace and the few you hold dear, but what about those suffering elsewhere, or even those near you that you just don't seem to notice? True peace requires more than lifting a finger. It requires your hand, locked with others, in helping out humanity."* - Fri Dec  4 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Byakuren(Guujin) gave a thin grin at the man's words. It was clear where his true thoughts lay, but a noticeable barrier was preventing something or someone. Byakuren placed both hands into his sleeves, finding a nice resting place.

"Of course. . "

Byakuren tilts his head for a moment, releasing pent up strain.

"I too knew of an individual with similiar ideals in the past. He, however, was weak in mind and body. He was naive to a fault. He wore his heart on his shoulder and went about everything in too direct a manner. I, however, wish not to make the same mistake. That is why I've come up with a new method. Heroes who exist not for their name to be known, but for the betterment of humanity as a whole. Nameless as individuals, yet strong through their ideals. They are, strictly speaking, "Guardians" whose protection goes unoticed by all but humanity itself."* - Fri Dec  4 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm... - Fri Dec  4 07:20:19 2015
