<br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) his eyes began to narrow down slightly, having already taken upon himself to reach into his state of doujutsu quite some time ago, he merely gazed over the crowd that had amassed before him. Realizing rather quickly about the predicament that had suddenly occured, he tensed up slightly. His body heat seeming to rise as he stretched slightly, assuring himself that he was quite ready for a battle situation like this. And with that he'd have pushed himself into the fray with his fellow shinobi that he had learned to grow apart of for the many years in his residence. Once he had realized the massive amount of walls that had been thrown up before the forces, his eyes quickly scanned around. Immediatly looking for anyway to get past or through the obstacle before him. His senses on high alert, and his eyes always prepared to catch anything out of the ordinary coming his way if required. He quickly approached in the direction of Sabo, considering if his slash had infact broken through, that would be the easiest point of entrance.* - Mon Sep 07 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) immediatly would have taken Osamus advice and leapt up in the air, choosing to jump backwards rather than forwards to the wall. Should he have been cleared of any harm he'd allow his vision to get a sense of where everyone currently was, and was going. Shortly after he'd part away from Sabo and dash towards where Osamu and his army had busted through, intent on following close behind him should they run into trouble in the near future.* - Mon Sep 07 00:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) he moved to stand near Osamu, his footing carefully placed for a particular movement should it be required if the other army had begun an assault unto him at any time.* - Mon Sep 07 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) his eyes narrowed slightly, his awareness of everyone nearby seeming to pay off now as he takes notice of the fluctuating chakra that had begun to rise in the ranks of the enemies army. He proceeded to move closer before seeming to lean ever so slightly into Osamus direction, mumbling a few words before awaiting. His body tensed up and prepared should anything happen within the next moments.* - Mon Sep 07 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) whispers: They're not standing down. They're building up their chakra. - Mon Sep 07 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Osamu(Assassin241) whispers: I see, thank you, Keiji. - Mon Sep 07 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: I'm getting tired, I've been fighting for far too long. I've got plenty of chakra, but I don't know if my body can keep up. - Mon Sep 07 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: (I got like 5 turns left of combat as far as the stamina rule goes) - Mon Sep 07 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) his facial expression shifting into that of a grimace, clearly displeased that the units of the opposing army deciding to go against the rather peaceful approach, he took a step further until he was standing beside Osamu. Seeming to await for one of the two to react to the other.* - Mon Sep 07 00:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: I'm ready when you guys are - Mon Sep 07 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: If it comes down two it you two, charge after our main attack, it should distract them. - Mon Sep 07 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) raised a brow slightly at the sound of the other, glancing towards the female that arrived. He pursed his lips slightly, as if he were perplexed by the sudden conversation that had sprung up between two strangers. " Why does it matter? Sometimes they let people out, sometimes they let people in. "* - Sat Oct  3 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Hmmm. - Sat Oct  3 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) the other would have noticed that the male, was rather lean. Hardly seeming to retain much muscle to the males frame, that aside. He was garbed in simple clothing, a sleeveless jacket that remained unzipped and a stark white shirt was worn beneath. His appearance was well taken care of, as if he regularly took care of his hygeine and of the sort. The only thing that may have truly stood out about the male would be his pair of eyes, each lavender in color with a slight bit of coloration to his pupil. * - Sat Oct  3 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You are a white eyes. - Sat Oct  3 22:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) says: And why are they the spot of attention for whom? - Sat Oct  3 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Well you see the village I used to belong to used to hunt you white eyes down. - Sat Oct  3 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I've recently taken interest inthem. - Sat Oct  3 23:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) says: Oh. A person from the water country. - Sat Oct  3 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) says: Are you going to take me out to dinner first, atleast? - Sat Oct  3 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: No. - Sat Oct  3 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I can kill you where you stand though. - Sat Oct  3 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You do not have many options. - Sat Oct  3 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) thinks: This.. isn't an offer to dinner. - Sat Oct  3 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) his eyes narrowed down onto the girl as she weaved a series of handseals. His eyes and unique doujutsu enabling him the capabilities to witness the chakra that was contained into her body flare to life. Shortly after, the area darkened slightly. Surely from the production of the jutsu that the female had created, as the tiny black droplets began to fall he shook his head. A few of them coming into contact with his clothing and hair for the moment, > Oh hell no.. < he muttered lightly to himself, before making a dash towards the female.

He wasn't too keen on becoming a project for another, but all that life held for everyone was just attempts and no promises. The male quickly closed the distance between him and the aggressor, quickly dropping down into a familiar stance, one used by all whom adopted these set of eyes. Afterwards, he would quickly jab his hand outward into a thrust, aiming to cause impact into the females torso with his palm.* - Sat Oct  3 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) the males body suddenly veered back at the sudden sight of the other unsheathing a blade, as the edge of it was slashed out towards his throat he'd quickly attempt to end his progression. He swayed to the side in hopes to avoid major injury from the blade, though a flash of pain jolted through his shoulder. The tip of the blade having not come into contact with his throat as planned, bit it had easily pierced into his skin, leaving a long and ragged cut throughout nearly the entirety of that shoulder. Within moments, dark blood poured from the deep wound. Easily staining the stark white shirt he had worn, the crimson stain deepening in a crimson color before nearly turning black. A sign of how deep the blade had truly cut into, he let out a short shout. Biting back the intense pain that had begun to bombard his system.

He took a deep breath, attempting to regain his composure as quickly as possible before holding up one of his arms back into his stance. The other, which was part of the shoulder that had been gashed open. Remained near his side, though slightly raised. A testament to how much pain he was currently feeling at the moment, granting him nearly unability to raise his arm without even further sparks of pain. He rested his palms outward, into the direction of the aggressor before he quickly shifted his feet, within moments he spun a complete 360. During the process of his spin, however. He'd expel a large amount of chakra from the confines of his body, each emitted from all of his tenketsu at once resulting in a blue dome like appearance, this was utilized in attempts to throw Kirie off her balance considering the proximity they had.* - Sat Oct  3 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiji(Minerman2oo7) having been rather concused from the blow, along with the falling beast of a Bijuu that had collapsed. As he was nabbed by Kirie, dragged away from that area. Throughout the entire movement of being dragged, he was hardly concious. His face had been pale, a show of how much blood had been truly flowing out onto his chest, the stark white shirt he had been wearing having nearly completely taken upon the crimson red color of that of his own blood. The stench of iron would fill the air wherever he had been dragged, his conciousness now nearly dissapated as he attempted to distinguish from reality and his own mind.

> I wonder if Samuru is at home right now?.. He's probably doing the dishes, or making dinner.. < his thoughts began to ramble on, death seeming to slowly embrace him into its arms, until it suddenly clutched him. The tanto would have been pushed through his throat without much resistance, considering most of his strength had been drained by the time he had been brought to this location. Instantly, the sand that he had rested on began to become a deep shade of crimson pouring out onto it, though the color hadn't lingered for long. The waves lapping up at the blood before taking it out into water. He let out a slight gurgle, an attempt to breathe in one last intake of air. But all he had received was just the taste of iron as blood filled his lungs instead. Slowly his conciousness faded away, his connection to his body now severed. Leaving nothing behind but a corpse.* - Sun Oct  4 00:43:56 2015
