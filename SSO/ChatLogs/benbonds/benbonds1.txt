<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) tilts his head towards Anguo.* - Tue Nov  3 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) had his hands in his pockets and looked over to Anguo, noticing the boy gain a grave distance between them. His head tilted once more as the questions was asked, his name and purpose? It made his eyes shift to the ground. 

"I . . Don't have a name . . I don't have a purpose . . Either . . I don't think . " He was only asked two questions so he replied to both, he didn't talk any further.* - Tue Nov  3 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) remained unfazed by Anguo's fast speed movement, he wasn't even here to fight. His eyes remained forward as his head was gripped by his age mate in attempt to extract the information. Once again Ken was forced to repeat himself, his lips parting ways to speak once more.

"I . . Don't have a name . . I don't have a purpose either . ."* - Wed Nov  4 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) sat on the ground, casting his gaze over the ants that walked along the field causing him to smile slightly.

"I woke up here-. Do you know ants work the hardest through their life?"* - Wed Nov  4 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: Ants instead fetch these things. - Wed Nov  4 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: Not all people particularly have shelter and such, but the difference is on foot is it all takes for an ant to die and all their hardwork becomes nothing but a means to help their future generation. - Wed Nov  4 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: But we humans are selfish and self-centered. - Wed Nov  4 00:28:09 2015

"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't even ask for your name . . That's rude of me."* - Wed Nov  4 00:29:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: What? - Wed Nov  4 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: You're not making sense. - Wed Nov  4 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: You don't belong here. - Wed Nov  4 00:31:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Just like the rest. - Wed Nov  4 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: I'm not staying here to make friends. Only till I'm old enough to fend for myself.  - Wed Nov  4 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Doesn't matter. - Wed Nov  4 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) simply stood up and walked to find a resting place within the village. 

"You shouldn't be concerned about my well-being."* - Wed Nov  4 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I'm not. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I just don't want you here. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: In my place. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: My village. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: -Leave-. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: I -can't- I'll die in the wilderness. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I don't care. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: Then don't care I'll stay here. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: You have two options. - Wed Nov  4 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Die here. - Wed Nov  4 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Or die out there. - Wed Nov  4 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: I'll die here. - Wed Nov  4 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) held his breath remaining calm and watching the ants run along, he didn't care whatever technique was being sprug towards him-- for all means, bring death his way. It wasn't like he had anyone to live for either, he had no purpose, no name.* - Wed Nov  4 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) sparks his lighter and dies.* - Wed Nov  4 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: ANIMA! - Wed Nov  4 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken(Benbonds) narrowed his eyes as nothing happened, it seemed as though Anguo wasn't going to kill him anymore-- the tension and demonic aura he felt before was gone. At this point Ken stood to his feet and placed his hands in his pockets, taking a couple of steps over to Anguo. Of course he remained in a distance understanding already about the boy's trust issues, he didn't want to push or force his way in-- if the boy wanted to trust him then it could be at anytime.

"The thing I said was from a book, about ants. In all honesty, I don't know much about anything. I woke up with no memories, I had to read to understand things so . . If anything, I hope you can teach me about the world."

He'd smile, directing himself further into the village and walking away to find a place to stay.* - Wed Nov  4 01:04:51 2015
