<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) Such a dreaded mission he was told to do. It was so bloody painful to be quite honest but oh well he'll have to go along with it. It was better then nothing taken the Mission scrolls from Lady Hokage's hands. Yoshima made his way back out of her building. Once that was done he would then smile to himself and start cleaning up. He's start with the hospital so he headed that way.
<p>
Upon arriving at the Hospital Ward he was approached by the Staff."Good Lady Rias Informed us you were coming. Are you Yoshima." Nodding his head. The Medical ninja quickly gave him the mop and bucket.
<p>
Yoshima Blinked suddenly. They did not just ask a shinobi to start scrubbing. Dear god they did not just do that. How awful of them. He shook his head and sighed to himself. Well time to scrub. He would take the bucket which was filled with water and making his way around the hospital. Two hours passed and he still scrubbed. It was annoying.
<p>
After Seven exhausting hours of cleaning the hospital. he came back to the Staff lady and gave her a warm smile.  He sighed and simply shook his head. He decided to return to the The Kage house. Once he arrived he nodded his head and sighed. "All Done." He said quietly.* - Mon Nov 30 18:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) Looking at the man. "Err." Then he suddenly noticed Five men.. What the bloody hell. He shook his head, and at once begun forming handseals. At once he would his mouth and created A Raging Wave. Hoping to counter act with what they throw at him. He would push back a few steps back.

"What the hell" He asked Zeire. What the hell was his problem. Shit these fuckers are even Crazier then Zetsumi, who put those two in Power. God... That was annoying. He shook his head from side to side. Keeping eyes on the targets.* - Mon Nov 30 19:13:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) Shaking his head back and forth as he had done this he took the mission scroll and made forth for the Ramen shop. So he would be doing repairs it would seem so. How ever annoying this would prove. However it would be a good way for him to express himself. In helping the village however, he did not approve of Ziere's Methods he did not. There was something about him that was certainly evil for some odd reason.
<p>
He ignored it for now. Focused on the task at hand. He would smile to himself and nod his head. Upon arrival the Building seemed to need major repairs. There were tools, boards, wood, and nails. All over the place as people were also helping rebuild the ramen shop.
<P>
Yoshima nodded his little cute head. Then made his way towards the location of the boards, taken a few into his hands he would then smile to himself. And carried as much as his tiny arms could carry towards the location of it the Holes. Once he arrived. He made his way back then grabbed a hammer.
<p>
Grabbing the nails afterwards he would start hammering at the Wood after placing the Boards next to the holes to cover up whatever empty hole. This took about serveral hours just covering holes, about a good six holes. To fix it without any breaks. Yoshima back stained a bit from manual lab-our. However it was all for the good of the village.
<p>
After a good job at the village. Yoshima decided to turn in his mission. This would earn him good stuff in his mission Grades. It would make him very useful. He did need to start practicing his jutsu to improve. But he decided he would do some more missions. To add to his Record List. So far these missions were D rank. Easy missions.* - Mon Nov 30 21:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) <p>1
Shin and Yoshima was tasked to a B rank mission. Yoshima has never been on a B ranked mission before. This this would be a new experience for him. Still he would prefer to work with someone knew new best. Not a stranger. Well isn't that a total shame for him. He walked along side Shin as he turned and switched directions. "We'll meet up back at this spot. Got it. Ta ta." With that said he went to go look for his own angle.
<p>2
With that being said Yoshima made his way towards the next location. Around the corners. He wasn't running or anything. Nothing that would arise Suspicion in fact he was walking. Nothing it seemed to quiet to peaceful. However, What he did notice was little brats moving around inside their houses as Yoshima made his way up the alley. Stopping at the location when a group of bandits made their way towards him. They held wooden Bats.
<p>3
"Is that supposes to phase me? Put your bats down before you get your butts handed to you. By a ten year old." He said carefully. They said absolutely nothing. Until one of them came out from the back. This one same size in structure as the rest. But had a metal bat. "We know why you are here. You see you won't get our deals that were inside." He said quietly. His Tone harsh and rude.
<p>4
Yoshima shook his head. As he looked at them. "You fail to understand that you little fucks can't do jack shit to me with those bats. Why don't you shove it up your asses, you bloody gamik." He said quietly. Shaking his head as Yoshima took a fighting stance.
<p>5
They also got into a ready stance. He simply looked at them glaring at them. How pathological they would meet such a fate. Such an ill fate they would meet. It was simply a shame. He would then make his way towards them and begin charge at them. Their were five guys with wooden weapons and one guy with a metal bat so a total of Six.
<p>6
Yoshima ran through them as if they were nothing he would have killed them. But he instead rendered the five wooden batted bandits unconscious. Making forth for that last one. He took knocked them out.
<p>7
So the fucks were inside the building it would seem how bloody great he would have to personal see to the dealers. It was rather quick how he found them. But Yoshima did not complain at all. He was in fact happy. That this was a Three day thing. After These long hard three days. Yoshima would focus on practicing jutsu.
<p>8
Entering the building he would the location of the Bandits. Quickly moving to them he knocked them out. After that he found out chairs put them on top and wrapped around their wrists. Waiting patiently for them to wake up. Yoshima had tools lined up on up on a small table.
<p>9 
They have finally waken up. Yoshima looked at them an smiled."We will play a little game. You will either a tell any valuable information or I break your Body parts." One of them laughed and spoke. "What can boy like you do to us." He said quietly.
<p> 10
Yoshima smiled. "What can a Boy like me do? Okay I'll make a example out of you." Yoshima grinned evilly. He would take the small pellet. ANd bring it to his fingers before jamming it at the Fingers, Hand, and doing the same to the other one. "Oh by far I am not done." He said laughing Sadistically. As he would then grab a a big razor blade and start chopping each of his fingers off their little sockets, the man cried to death and in pain, and died of physical trauma. "This is what will happen if you do not tell me." He said quietly.
<p>11
They nodded their heads in fear. One of them finally decided to speak. "Drops outs are handled by package and deviliered to a trash can. Which is picked up. Once they are picked up we as dealers, hand out the drugs, in the sewers. With many clients. The Sewers are heavily grounded by swordsman  and Archers, A One Bandit Chef. We Sell High Grade stuff. That will people people addicted and high on for more." He said quietly.
<p>12
"What's it in?" Yoshima said quietly. He would look at them. They nod their heads And would reply to him. "Human Blood, Animal Blood, and Green Sugar Plant." They said in unison. Yoshima nodded his head and sighed. "Very well." He said quietly.
<p>13
WIth that being said he would exit the location of the building and make his way towards the Kage Tower. He needed to collect his thoughts and gather everything for himself in order to report back to the Kage.
<p> 14
It was unfortunate news of events however it was still worth while. How this was handled and all that. However it didn't make it right that these guys could have been selling this to the Children and parents of Children it was simply bad.
<p>15 Sighing slowly to himself he would shake his head. Enter the building of the Kage Building bow to Lady Hokage and smile. "It has been done." He said quietly to himself and gave her a warm smile.* - Mon Nov 30 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) <p>1
Yoshima rushed to the mission quite quickly after what had occurred. He was annoyed at what had transpired. Thinking in his head at how the henchmen looked he would form a single handseal and would then transform into one of those things. There was a meeting that was going to happen. Yoshima needed to be there in order to require further orders.
<p>2
The meeting took place inside a tall warehouse outside the village. The actual destination was the sewers. Which would get to at the end of the deposits. Arriving late due to the little incident. Yoshima braced and prayed his cover was not blown until. He noticed something off. They allowed him in with no problem. His eyes darted examine the place. To easy. No sane individual would allow another one inside the building if they are late and they are criminals.
<p>3
Yoshima approached them as they were given bags. There were five men. Including himself which contained drugs inside. "Deposits have been changed. To Elderly Homes. You are to take the drugs there. After that is all said and done meet us in the location of the sewers. Deep down in the sewers." He said quietly. However enough for everyone to hear. He looked directly at Yoshima the one that was henged to the thug. Yoshima was a boy genius this was easy to tell that they were on to him.
<p>4 Yoshima and the rest nodded and unison and they were then off. To the locations. Yoshima did something else entirely he would follow one from behind. And made sure he was not traced. It did not seem that they were depositing them to the elderly in fact. They or rather him were going directly towards the dumps where the Drug Dealers told Yoshima where they dropped off. Shaking his head back and forth he collected the current drugs then simply placed him in his bag.
<p> 5
That was one of the drugs collected the next location was the other drops. Which Yoshima followed quickly. He would collect the drugs and place it in the bag. His eyes moved quickly. As he took the criminal by the neck, and placed his other hand at his mouth, putting him to sleep before dragging him to the alley. Once that was done, he would try to get any form of ID, or anything in his possessions but he did not have any of that, he took the mask off. Was third eye, and a Tag on his forehead. "What the fuck?" he said leaping back as he did, the tag exploded destroying the man's face.
<p>6
Things just got messy. He did not want to come to consensuses but if he pulled off the masks people will die. Criminal were people. Their lives mattered even if they were in the wrong. Christ, why was Yoshima put on this assignment by himself. What did he deserve to get out of this. Some few ryo. A mission credit in his name. Fuck He could heal his wounds. He could heal people. To a limit amount. He would not allow something like this. Go unfinished. He was unfortunate that he could not do any fuujutsu to undo what was done to the man. But he would prevent this.
<p>7
He sighed to himself. "God damnit you scum bags. Do you not care for people's lives? Do you not care. Damnit." He was taken his sweet time to witness something that could not be undone. When Yoshima could be taken the drugs from the other two men. He shook his head and simply sighed. Best be going before anyone else get's hurt. With that being said he was off to the next location. This one however was tricky, this man was taken short cuts. Yoshima was about to get him, when the man went in public dropped the drugs, and pulled the mask off.
<p>8
What the shit was he about to do. The eye moved and scanned for something. Then it located Yoshima the masked man. "You wouldn't." Yoshima mumbled under his breath as the tag slowly begin to turn. At this point. Yoshima said fuck. He would not alley people to be endangered under the risk of the Mission. He formed handseals. At this point, Yoshima noticed. That that eye too was looking at him. So he was being controlled or possession. So now whoever possession him knew that one of them was a Spy and a ninja.  As he begun to seal the last Seal. The Tag went out and disgusted, The Criminal took a knife, and sliced his own throat.
<p> 9 
Landing on the ground he would then look at him as people gathered to look at the body. Yoshima took the drugs, and placed it in the bag then went to locate the next criminal. Once Yoshima located it. Yoshima begun to ponder over what just happened. <So these fuckers think it's right to kill their own men? This is what the world has come to? Random fucks killing one another off. Well I will have none of that bullshit in my village. I will become the Next Hokage one day. In what ever little fairy tale dream I am living in. I WILL BE HOKAGE.> Naw fuck that Hokage was overrated he disregarded that.
<p>10 The next one just simply looked at him looking at him with that mask off, and tag on his face. Glaring at him. "You want the drugs boy? Well come and get it. I assure you. This body was once a capable genin." Yoshima looked at him. "You jest or are you pulling my leg?" He asked coldly. If he was a ninja. Very well He would have no problem in killing him. The Ninja wasted no time in appeared in front of Yoshima, And grabbing his hands. "Coming with me bitch." Yoshima used his feet to kick off. But it was sadly to late. As the man exploded. Yoshima had enough time to get off, however, Yoshima sustained damaged. As he had burns on his feet and legs. Second degree burns.(*Nyuki, Yoshima starts to shake their dice*
Nyuki, Yoshima has rolled a 3!)
<p> 11 The man had killed himself. And also ruined the drugs. Yoshima blinked. In annoyance, as pain rushed pass him. Like a sudden drug. He had to stay calm if he were to progress through the healing. This was going to be one annoying night as he now not only had to take the drugs to the hokage, but also inflationary the Sewers. To get the finally compound as to where they are hiding all the stuff and how large. Shaking his head, as he held his legs. God even touching the legs was annoying as pain rushed through.
<p> 12 He breathed calmly to himself as he did this, he tried to calm down which was really hard. However, after two hours he calmed himself. He formed handseals as a green glow of energy rushed through his hand. He placed it on his right leg. And disposed enough chakra to remove the dead skin cells, as they slowly cleared off his body. His skin on his legs went from red to light red, to pink. He would do the same thing to other legs. This took a total of six hours to properly Heal. At this point he had to get to the sewers.
<p>13 Getting up from his position. Although he healed some or most of the damage, it was hard to walk. "Fuck. This isn't going to be easy." He shook his head and simply sighed to him, as he walked to the sewers. Once he was inside. He would forth as criminal were letting him into open arms. he placed his right hand over to where his pouch would be located if he wasn't disguised. A Voice would be heard. "No need to run away. Uncloak yourself." Yoshima did not obey to his command and just walked forward.
<p>14 They were Bow and Arrows. And they all pointed at him. They noticed his legs wobbly. Holding breath, they did not seem to shot anything. Until one shot into his leg. However, it only skinned him. As the man who shot the arrow. Was now no longer there as if he was killed off. As a pool of blood would be shown to where he used to be. They had assassins in their payroll and it would now the more reason to be careful if he wanted to get away alive.*Nyuki, Yoshima starts to shake their dice*
Nyuki, Yoshima has rolled a 2!
<p>15 Yoshima would it a hard time to walk now. He shook his head. As he now limped at this point. Not to mention the skinned part of his calf was also glazing out minor bleeding. Yoshima did not care. He wanted to shut these fuckers down. Once and for all. End this madness of terror and drug selling. Because you know what. People should suffer. It simply was not right. To be quite honest and frank. Sighing to himself he would proceed forward.
<p> 16 Once he was inside he would found himself in what appeared a rape fest room, of not only women getting fucked, teenagers, and Elderly woman, but also Little children. At this point Yoshima did everything in his power to not snap someone neck to whom was in charge. Because if he was not on a mission. That fucker would be dropped dead. Like you would have no idea how he would be dropped on his head and beaten. Yoshima hated rape it was simply not right. It was simply wrong.
<p> 17 Moved through the room. Holding his anger until he appeared in front of the bandit chef. But it was not a male. It was a female. A Quick shot was given at his shoulder. by an arrow. But that too skinned him. As he moved quickly out of the way before any damage can be given to him. Behind her. Was a large safe. That would need a code to be broken in. He moved his right hand behind to get a hold of the door. He turned it sadly it was locked. "Going somewhere. Only way out is through that vent. That leads out of the sewers. " She stated firmly.
*Nyuki, Yoshima starts to shake their dice*
Nyuki, Yoshima has rolled a 2!
<p>18 "However, I will give you one option. Allow me to break your arm. I'll let you go. Condition it a treat. As a next time you will be dead if you come here." She said giggly. Without warning she took his arm, She seemed fast them him and attempted to break it. What happened next was painful. She did not break it but came very close to a break as it was severally sprained. He dropped to one knee. She giggled and looked at him. "You are free to go." She said said. *Nyuki, Yoshima starts to shake their dice*
Nyuki, Yoshima has rolled a 4!
<p> 19. "Oh and by the way I am taken the drugs back." With that being said, Yoshima used his good arm, to lunch his elbow into her stomach, given him the short advantage, knocking her back as she clutched him, Yoshima lurched to the vent, and got inside and booked it. Traveling long and hard through those things, with his Sprained right arm, Shoulder bleeding, so is his calf. He was slowly losing his awareness, at this point paranoia was over taken him.
<p> 20 Crawling his way out for some form of air. Or outside world out of this place. Seemed really annoying. As this closed space was really bugging him. He moved as he patted. "Must get to Lord Hokage." he said. However his moment was slowed down as his arm took pain. His motion got slower as he screamed out in pain. However not a sound was heard from the outside of the vents as if this was sound proof.
<p> 21 Finally getting out of the vent he would shake his head and sigh simply. In what seemed forever. He made his way slowly towards the location of the the Hokage's Tower. barely making it out alive, with the evidence of drugs. He will not allow this to go unfinished. He will be the one to go back there On the mission. OR he will do it without the mission reward. He will not have children, teenagers, Women, and elderly people raped. He will have none of that. The idea was disgusting and loathe.
<p>22 Shaking his head back and forth, his right arm close to his stomach, as he slowly approached the building. Once he made he would approach the desk. Given a few moments to think what he was going to say, he removed the drugs over his head the bag that contained the drugs. Placing it on the table.
<p>23 "I will not have none of this. I will not have children, Teenagers, mother, and elderly women raped. I want to go back there when I am all healed up. Finish the Mission fully. I know the location perfectly. It's in my head on where everything is. Two way inside and out of the sewer. Front entrance, and the Vent. I assume their other entrances, to the sewers. But I haven't explored them." He said quietly. "Another thing." He said very slowly.
<p>24." They knew I was a ninja somehow. I suspect. They knew the moment I've arrived late. Also because I didn't have a third eye. And a tag on my face. Not only that but just listen to this. The Person behind this was a Ninja. I do not know who the ninja is. Because when I've arrived at the vault Their was the bandit chef. Oh and get this. She's a female." He said quietly.
<p>25" I ninja is a fuujutsu user. Also very sly and manipulative. The safe contains the rest of the drugs I assume, r the production it requires a code. To get in. My current injuries are. A Sprained Arm, A Skinned cut to my left shoulder, and right calf. Former Injuries are second degree burns both of which I healed on my own." He said firmly.* - Fri Dec  4 21:56:41 2015
