<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) He would be practicing his jutsu today. This was the perfect time to do it. In fact he had to do it. In order to get better Five years ago he took a pause in training. Just helped around with minor chores now it's time to train. He begun to focus his body and chakra around his core. As he begun to release energy into the air. As that was done, the air would become dense and he would summon A thin like fog around him.* - Sun Dec  6 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) That did drain him quite a bit. However he still needed to keep on doing it. He had to practice all of his jutsu. He'll start with his water style ninjutsu first. Forming a single handseal as that was done he would begin t gather energy into the air. Then summon some of his own chakra into that air. Once that was done he would attempt to make the thin fog around him a bit denser then before.* - Sun Dec  6 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) He patted heavily as the drain took over quite a bit more then he'll expect himself to get. Sighing to himself quietly. He would sit down and meditate. Closing his eyes as he attempted to refresh his chakra network. Reopening his eyes. Once that has been done he would smile and would then attempt to get up. ONce he had gotten up he would bring his hands to his body and form a seal. Sending chakra waves into the air from his body he would attempt to re summon that thin layer of mist.* - Sun Dec  6 21:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: We are already agruing.. Over a spar that will never happen. - Mon Dec  7 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) At this he chuckled. However he did not trust her. After what had happened with Zets. Five years back. Yoshima had lost the ability to trust nice people. It will need to be slowly gained. However at the moment, he did not buy her niceness.

"Right. Let's head to the place you would like." He said quietly. He did not find this awkward at all. In fact he was a bit annoyed. Then again, seeing what he has seen and the shit the happened in the past. Who wouldn't be wry. The Ten Year old genius nodded and followed her.* - Mon Dec  7 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) After  following her he would pause slowly. "I see. Do you hold any elements?" he asked her curiously. Noticing her lean against the tree.* - Mon Dec  7 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I do not. - Mon Dec  7 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Listen... - Mon Dec  7 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I will be using medical ninjutsu. - Mon Dec  7 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah..? - Mon Dec  7 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I want you to watch~ - Mon Dec  7 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) 

Yoshima smiled towards himself and looked at his new friend. He would like to call her friend. He would pull out a fish from his jacket, and lay it on the ground after he took off his coat and placed it. "So As I was saying." he said quietly. He formed a tiger seal and his hands begun to glow green. "I will be performing Medical Ninjutsu to help me excel in things. I do hope this will be a great adventure for you. To watch me." He said.

Placing his hands on the fish he would nod his head and smile. "So Watch me bring this fish back to life. I am a bit rusty however. I should be able to do it perfectly at the end non the less.' bringing his hands around the fish he would begin to attempt and send charka down towards the core of the fish. Hoping to allow it bring life.

However, what he found was. That Yoshima was sending far more chakra then it required of him to send. Which quickly exhausted him. "I've not done this in a few years. Give me a bit of time please." He said sheepishly. God damnit this was going to be rather annoying. To process. He himself felt kinda light headed.* - Mon Dec  7 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) 

Taken the moment to breath and relax. Yoshima finally decided to speak. "Incorrect. I should have been more specific." he said quietly. "It is lost an air supple. But it still very much alive. I apologize for the false terminally I used when I said. "Dead" " He said quietly. Shaking his head back and forth he would finally get up. Before crouching down to the Level of the ground.


"Right moving forward. I just have to keep trying you know this? Practice makes perfect." he said quietly. Bring his right hand over which still glowed a faint green color. He would bring it over the fish, then place the right hand over the gills. "It requires Air." he said sending charka towards the gills. "It might not be damaged, However." he said, as he again seemed to exhaust far more chakra then he suspected.

"However, Medical Ninjutsu can bring air to a half dead fish. It's a matter of science I believe." he added. God he just pulled that one out of his ass. Didn't he. He then leaned forward and noticed, the gill being damage. Using his left hand he furiously placed it on the damaged Gill. Sending his chakra over it. It wasn't anything major. Just dead tissue and was looked to be a cut.

"It seemed there dead tissue, and a small cut. I would understand why this fish was struggling once I played it out of the water. I also understand it's suffering. I am going nurse it back to health and bring it back." He said quietly. Before removing his hand from the fish. Goodness that took quite a bit of chakra. Sitting down he closed his eyes and attempted to relax.* - Mon Dec  7 22:02:14 2015

Out as he laughed and groaned at the pain."MORE" He demanded. When she pulled back, he refused to let her go. Instead he would force or attempt a kiss to her, while he attempted the kiss he would use his own tongue to skillfully take take the issue into his mouth and share it with her. Ripping a piece.

"My my it is deliciously. However." he grinned, He drove the Blade into her Thigh, before dragging the blade down her leg. "Pain Inflicting is a art my Dear. It works both ways, embrace it." he said before yelling out as the after effects would be felt. He groaned and gripped his bleeding shoulders.
