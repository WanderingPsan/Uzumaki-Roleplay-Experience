<br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) | | Soujiro acts upon the Gale Palm. He soars from his position and zooms to the side, avoiding the clap of the hands fast enough. Soujiro's reflexes were topnotch and so was his speed. In barely even a millisecond, he had crossed the six feet gap between Marrisa and him and had targetted Marrisa with a blow to the center of her core---the abdomen. He'd strike her powerfully if she could not dodge and had not expected his speed.

"A Ninjutsu Specialist huh?" He thought to himself quietly. * - Sat Oct 31 17:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) | | His will and indomitable prowess were extraordinary. As his blow plunges into Marrisa's epidermis and caves into her muscle and bone, Soujiro still resists the flames that cause singing burns along his frame. Soujiro continues to pummel at her whereas a normal human being might take precautionary measures. With the close distance they were at right now, Soujiro was to take advantage. His right leg erects itself promptly and attempts to slam into Marrisa's side, targetting her lateral collateral ligament, attempting to break her by causing her to fall onto the ground from the close distance. * - Sat Oct 31 17:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) | | Unfortunately, Marrisa was not about to get a that quick burst of handseals in. Soujiro dashes at Marrisa with expertise, his eyes still on her. As soon as she formed the first handseal, Soujiro's right hand jets out to grab hold of her wrist. Should it be successful, Soujiro would stop Marrisa from movement and from even casting a Genjutsu.

He didn't even know it was one.

"You won't be casting any more Ninjutsu." He'd swing at her with a quick fist and a successive roundhouse kick, disabling any chance of a handseal being formed.* - Sat Oct 31 17:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) | | His hand gripped tightly onto Marrisa's wrist, resisting the burns.

"Do you think I fear death? I fear nothing if it means the honor for my village." Marrisa does not succeed in escaping his grip. Instead, his right hand starts to crush Marrisa's wrist violently and brutally. The warrior proceeds to attempt slamming into Marrisa's abdomen once more with a knee. Should it land, he was confident it would knock the wind out of Marrisa.

At this point, second degree burns and even borderline third gathered on his hand, indicating how dangerous the situation was. However, his body was so ridiculously durable that he was withstanding it in the first place, which was something to gape at. * - Sat Oct 31 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) had suddenly been blasted in the eyes. His eyes were seared briefly and Soujiro backs off, so that he doesn't get permanent damage in the eyes. "My eyes..." Soujiro bit his lips. He does back off at this point, moving away from Marrisa in the meantime.* - Sat Oct 31 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) | | He lifts up his hands in preparation for the Sickle Weasel Technique. AS it is enacted and is burst aflame by the fire, Soujiro finds himself being sliced all over the place. Small lateral wounds are laid on his body by the wake of the technique, but are seared shut by the heat of the flames. His internal organs are burned though as a result. Even though the wounds were closed as quickly as they were opened, Soujiro felt weak because of the internal heating of his muscles.

He dashes forward, nonetheless, engaging Marrisa with a quick jump kick to her chest.* - Sat Oct 31 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: Fight...till the very end! - Sat Oct 31 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) | | Marrisa had dodged the kick successfully, swinging at Soujiro. Soujiro is knocked straight through the air while he was in the jump kick, flying around the area for a moment as he is slammed against the wall behind him, damaging his body. Soujiro exits out of the rubble henceforth, trying to get back into action.* - Sat Oct 31 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: Guh. - Sat Oct 31 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: I need to finish her off while she's weakened. - Sat Oct 31 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) thinks: Gah... - Sat Oct 31 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Soujiro(Guest-1424017850) | | He was suddenly struck by the jutsu once again. He is sliced on various regions of his body and starts to bleed even more heavily. Seared sections of his body were damaged already and he took even more damage. He lands on the ground, finally succumbing to the injuries given to him.* - Sat Oct 31 18:11:24 2015
