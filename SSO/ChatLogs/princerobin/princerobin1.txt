<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: I don't want to commit to a village, I know nothing of, besides getting a teacher and me joining a village have nothing to do with each other.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Actually they do, since we only offer our training to villagers of our village.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: You can't just walk in here, and expect free training. Without making any commitment to the village.

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [If your not gonna join the village.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: (the point was never to join the village)

<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Will I have to do anything?
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Nope. Unless instructed too..by a village offical.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Which their are only two...for now. Me and Zakku.
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Well I don't kill people, or injure people thathave done nothing to provoke me. So i'll join if you know that.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Okayh.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Now who is my teacher?

<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Any of you know who my teacher is?
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: I don't know. However, I don't think you can just join a village an ask for a teacher. That just seems so....desperate.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: I only joined for a teacher.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Who is my teacher?
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: Dunno.
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: You only joined for a sensei? That seems like your desperate for power.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: How so?
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: Because you only joined because you want someone to teach you something
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: So....
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: What is wrong with that?
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: So who is he? Or Her?
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: ...
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Tsumkai, Amzuak.
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Who is that.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: He lives, in the mansion, to the north-west of here.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: But the mansion is well hidden, and hard to find.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Does he come here?
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: He comes here for food.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Then leaves back to his mansion.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: I'll wait then.
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: And what if he doesn't come then?
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Why wouldn't he?
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: What if he has a stock of food in his mansion?
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: He came yesterday.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Then I just wait longer?
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: So most likely he won't come for a while.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: I can always find someone else to.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: If he becomes unreliable.
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: Can't learn stuff on your own?
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: There's always Zakku.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: I could.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: But a teacher would be faster.
<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: I guess.
<br><font color=green>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) says: Who is Zakku?
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: .....

<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: Hm. However, you're not the only one who needs a Sensei. I need one o, until the Raikage is able to find me.

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Most likely..
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Zakku will take on you three.
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: That would be nice.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: All I know is, Sealing jutsu which will be way too strong for any of you.

"I hope you all burn in hell." He says as he pulls the trigger. The gun would fire about 500 senbon at the building. They would rip through it and tear through the place, damaging and destroying just about everything inside. 

As Seithin's gun begins to overheat, he stops firing and deactivates the mech. He leaps out and reseals it to its scroll. "Rose...If you have any respect for yourself or your village...You'll leave with me, right now." He says as he begins to run from the village.*

With a confident nod, he smirked as he began to pack his bags and left a note in his room telling hi Sensei and squadmates that he would be in Kohona. He wasn't sure where they were and didn't want to waste any time waiting up for them. Damien was sure they would arrive there eventually so why not get a head start?

With that part finished, he took his map and began to venture onto the wild. He traveled through the trees, took breaks, before finally arriving at the village sign of Kohona a few days later. He smiled as he walked through the gates and began to find his way to the location where the exams were going to take place.*

Although it seemed as if he was improving it just wasn't enough for him, he had to get stronger! Suddenly a shuriken came out of nowhere and Taishi dodged it effortlessly. He was confused at why a stray Shuriken just came flying out of nowhere until suddenly thousands of Shuriken came flying from every direction concievable and Taishi quickly went into a defensive stance and attempted to dodge as many as he could but there was just too many and he was beginning to recieve cuts and bruises all over his body as more and more begun to make contact. Taishi closed his eyes and focused, he knew that if he didn't do something soon, he would die. He began focusing all of his remaining chakra around his body and began to spin as fast as he could until the chakra became visible and formed a powerful barrier that deflected every attack. When the shuriken barrage had ceased, Taishi had stopped spinning and was breathing heavily, barely able to stand up. "What in the world...was that?"*

<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: (and letting me know if it's good enough to learn the Jutsu
<br><font color=yellow>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) Damien Valde went off to the outskirts of the Village to see if he can create a new Jutsu before the Chuunins began. He sighed as he began to inhale and exhale; calming down his body and letting his Chakra run free inside him. Even though his Chakra had the ability to be used for the Water and Earth elements, he wanted to fully master one element before working towards the other. He reached into his bag and pulled out a quick outline of a Jutsu he had been working on for a while now.

He wasn't sure of the name but the basis of the Jutsu is that he goes underground which causes him to disappear from sight. Suddenly, he would travel through the ground to either escaoe from any harm or possibly launch a surprise attack onto the target. Even though this sounded simple, Damien was quite sure it would be tougher to do.

He walked over to where there was a large empty field of dirt and meditated in the center. He was letting his Chakra flow through him easily and build up in power. After a few minutes he got up and quickly went to work. He planted his feet solidly onto the ground and began to let his Chakra escape his body. After preforming some hand signs, his Chakra travelled through his legs and onto the ground below him. The dirt rumbled and Damien focused his Chakra so that it would force the dirt below him to seperate.

The dirt below him began to slowly part causing his body to sink inside the dirt. Just as he began to reach the halfway point, Damien broke his concentration and suddenly stopped moving. Frusterated, he got out of the hole and walked a few feet down to take a break. He took a few breaths again to regain the Chakra he had lost in the failed attempt. After about 15 minutes of break time, it was time to give it another try.

He got up and went near the area he had done his first attempt at the Jutsu. Like before he repeated the handsigns and let his Chakra flow through him and enter the ground. The ground under his feet began to part ways and his body began to sink into the ground slightly faster than before. After a few moments, his entire body was in a hole underground, bringing a smile to his lips. Part one of the jutsu was complete.

He used his Chakra to close the hole on top of him leaving himself in a dark hole 7 feet under the ground. He placed his right hand onto the dirt infront of him and he let his Chakra flow through his arms and into the dirt. Just like in the beginning, the dirt began to open a hole; a hole larg enough for Damien to crawl through. As he crawled through the hole, he made it so that the hole closed behind him.

As he crawled through the dirt, he was able to use his Chakra to sense what was going on above the surface and position himself above his opponent. Damien stopped and placed a hand on the Dirt above him and began to manipulate the dirt like he had been doing multiple amounts of time before. The dirt separated and he launched himself through the hole. Suddenly he bursted from the ground and into the surface above and landed on the grass nearby. Panting, Damien rolled over and smiled to himself. He had just completed the Jutsu. All he needed to do know was master it.*

The shuriken wrapped with an explosive tag would detonate, exploding. If Damio didn't move, then he would be minorly burned at his arms.

Kurina then performed a few handseals, taking in her surroundings and observing everything carefully. She then stood in the same position she was in upon finishing the handseals, staring at Damio.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Waisho, Damio(Prince122) carefuly watched the girl reach for her shuriken. Once thrown, he awaited for the shuriken to get within a few feet of him. Jumping, he would easily spin through the air, dodging the first wave. Although he wasn't so lucky with the second wave. As the single shuriken exploded, it would send him back, sprawling across floor.
