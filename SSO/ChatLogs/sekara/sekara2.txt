<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Mm? About what? - Tue Dec  8 12:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...I get it. Before we even try - we should at least seek Izanami's approval. - Tue Dec  8 13:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: By the way mind helping me with something? I've been working on trying to make my walking quiet. - Tue Dec  8 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Mm? Sure. - Tue Dec  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Close my eyes and try to find you in the darkness? - Tue Dec  8 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: No,I'm going to use the mist. Find me in it. - Tue Dec  8 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Try creating it as well. Make it easier. - Tue Dec  8 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...Hmm. It was the seal of confrontation, right? - Tue Dec  8 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Mhm. - Tue Dec  8 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) brings her hand up forming the seal of confrontation. She channeled her chakra as well to increase the range. She decided to give him a crutch to lean on however she made her mist light. Exhaling for a while she begins setting the stage up.

Once the mist was made she slows her breathing down like before trying to prevent him hearing her breath. She begins walking trying to come up on Heiwa's right side and tap it as if she was saying she got him. Of course that was going to fail due to how good his hearing was.* - Tue Dec  8 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: *Yaawns* - Tue Dec  8 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) breaths out to catch her breath and coses her eyes again. She got a general idea of where he went and followed him. She breaths in again now trying to sneak up on him once more taking her steps slowly due to not being adapt in fighting in the mist.

To try and increase her concentration with her hearing Yumiko closes her eyes. Deciding to rely soley on sight alone made things better for a sight hinderence technique. This time the girl went to try a more direct approch and try poking Heiwa in the head failing to make her foot steps silent.

Mean while she wondered how long she could keep the mist technique up. Thinking about her reserves for the rest of the day as well. Not wanting to waste that much chakra while practicing sneaking. * - Tue Dec  8 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) maintained her flow with her eyes closed. She breathed out again concentrating on the direction he went. A conformation nod was given this time even if he might have not been able to see it. Being on the water made things a lot harder for her since she was now mutitasking being on a liquid surface as well as having to keep her foot steps silent.

Looking down at her feet for a moment she thought about the new stage."Welcome to level two huh?" went through the girl's head since water was easier to hear walking on than land due to one's foot making it splash. Now she really had to walk softly and found out something she could do in her spare time to improve this. 

Yumiko focuses on her breathing now not moving yet. She slows it down gradually to attempt to avoid detection by breath. Eventually it came to a hault where she held her breath completely. She lifted her head up to the direction Heiwa went keeping her eyes closed the entire time while getting use to tracking by hearing.

The girl took her fitst step and it splashed the water which might have given off a signal that she was begining again. It also signal to Yumiko that she was stepping to hard. The girl took another step trying make her feet fall as if they were feathers on the ground. However it was failing for now.

While she approched him some of her steps were not as notable as before but one could still hear them. She was adapting at least but she had a ways to go before she could sneak up on someone with decent hearing.* - Tue Dec  8 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) continued her slow creep towards Heiwa taking each step slow as possible. Like a hunter stalking their pray tensing up before the strike. Her breath remain held and then. Nothing at all! It seem as if she stop completely again this time doing absolutely nothing.

Her head tilts down again looking at her feet. Perhaps she was planning something or was she doing this to make him nervous? Ether way she started and stop again going around him now. She makes her steps quicker then slow alternating repeatly.

Eventually she did a full circle around him and went to for a second round. For a moment she exhaled before begining another circle around him. When she started she held her breath once more some of her foot steps being noticeable on the water while some of them not so much to the normal ear.* - Tue Dec  8 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) suddenly while Heiwa was speaking she approched him trying to cut him off quickly. She was aiming to use his voice as well as her mist to cover up the spashes her foot made with the water. It was a small gap in chance but she took it.

A smile came across her face when he said you. She reached out to tap his head hoping that it was a successful stratagy to sneak up on him. He had did what she wanted after all aiming to tap him before the last word came out.* - Tue Dec  8 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) lets the mist clear up and simply giggled."Had to find a way to catch you off guard.~" she said deciding to get back to a solid surface and take a seat. She pulls out a bottle of milk drinking it and nodding her head.* - Tue Dec  8 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Takes a lot of time getting use to. - Tue Dec  8 19:55:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Ryo is dead? - Wed Dec  9 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) takes a seat and open a with the down time she had for now and a bit of fear going through her she decided to take things a bit more serious especially about Ryo's death.  Yumiko begins to read out the paragraphs in the scroll lowly to herself.

"The technique is known to take a huge amount of chakra for a great output." she said in a low tone voice while reading this wondering how her reserves were going to hold up using what is said to take a huge amount of chakra. The idea seems down right horrifying to her meaning she was going to have to increase her reserves.

The young girl continued to read."One can freely use water jutsu with this technique and damage surroundings." With the idea of that seem great she worried about using it in her own village. It seemed like it could harm civilans which is something she did not really want to happen.

She gets down to the instructions while reading."This technique requires one seal. The snake seal with the rushing of a large amount of chakra. Afterwords bring your head down-" she cuts herself off mid sentence. Clearly she wondered what would happen if she look up until she continued reading. "and form a wave. A massive wave to drown your enemies and supply you with water..." She continued to read. She places the scroll away and decided to try it.

Lifting her hands up she formed a single hand seal. The snake hand seal like said in the scroll. She breathed in and spat out a water fountain worth of water. Her eyes widan shocked at what just happen. It wasn't what she was expecting. She knew she did something wrong. She didn't use enough chakra for the technique using what she normally use for the avarage C rank jutsu.

In a few moment she thought about it. Needing much more chakra for the jutsu. She built up her chakra again getting a small wave. No where near what the jutsu could really do. But enough to make someone nod their head. It wasn't perfect but with enough practice she could get the hang of the technique and maybe even master it.* - Wed Dec  9 08:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) had to really think about what she just did. The feeling of the technique draining her reserves the way it did shocked her. Even for a technique that wasn't mastered it took that much out of her. That made the girl shocked. She breaths out and shook her head left and right."W-Woah." she said experiencing a higher ranking suiton technique for the first time."So this is what they go through when using ninjutsu." she thought to herself picturing people like Kana fight.

She shook her head left and right. She knew this wasn't a technique to simply waste and for now considered it a last resort technique. She pulls out some milk and dumplings and begin to eat. She needed to refil her reserves up after all. However, that wasn't enough. Deciding to get up after her snack she went to her house.

Throwing a few pieces of fish on the stove which she had at her house Yumiko decided to cook them. After going through the process of preparing them and everything needless to say the fish didn't come out that good. She wasn't the best at cooking but she could learn over time. 

She finishes her meal and heads back out side. Her walk to the waterfall being short, but enjoyable to say the least. Making her way up again she stops and looks down forming th hand seal again. She couldn't accept that amount of chakra loss using the jutsu. She still needed decent amount of chakra to fight after all.

Her hands interlocked to form the snake seal once more building up chakra trying to use less chakra than she did previously.She tits her head down trying to create a wave using only a set amount of chakra which still took a huge chunk out of her. 

Once she cut her flow early the girl was winded. She hadn't gotten use to using so much chakra at once. It still was shocking to her making her sit down and really think about what she was doing using the technique.* - Wed Dec  9 09:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We start with the easiest! - Wed Dec  9 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) look towards Lera and studied the seal carefully. She observed the technique seeing the twisting wind and looking out watching it and listening to the explination. The colors was confusing to her at first but she figured to try it out. It couldn't be to hard right?

She sits down and crosses her legs closing her eyes. The girl picture a green color chakra which did not help much on it's own.The mental image of a blade came to her and she imagine the green color chakra running up and down on the blade. She lifted her hand up forming a single hand seal. The same seal Lera had made.

She drew in her breath and surprise. Nothing ended up happening this time while she blew. Rather than waste chakra within two short seconds Yumiko haults her chakra flow for now and decided to go back to the drawing board. She used this time to think a bit.

Lera's way of molding chakra didn't seem to do it for her. She drops her hands and thought how the wind twisted around and tried to mold her chakra differently to match what she saw. She needed a new image. Something that could help her and not copy someone else.

For the next thirty minutes Yumiko remain completely still and silent. Thinking of how to mold her chakra. She breaths in and out being in a state of concentration. To any sensors she was building up chakra at a steady rate. Her mind wondered while she thought. Her mind was calm for the moment."A gentle breeze." went through her mind since fuuton was wind.

Her chakra spikes up a bit increasing her focus. Almost as if she was ready to use the technique. The picture in her mind change a huge amount. What started out as a gentle breeze became a raging storm. The fierce winds in her mind was represented by what she wanted her chakra to do. To blow everything away.

She stands up and stretches out being stiff. The entire time maintaining her chakra levels. She weaved together the hand seal needed for the technique. The mental image of heavy winds being strong she imaging them twisting and turning doing the same for her chakra. She breaths in getting ready to utilize the technique.

Once she exhales the technique was used but on a weaker scale. She had little knowledge of wind considering this was her first lesson. It was no where near the power it could hold but things usually are not completed in a day so she had time.* - Wed Dec  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Not bad for your first go~ - Wed Dec  9 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: More difficult then I thought.  - Wed Dec  9 14:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah, but you'll get the hang of it. - Wed Dec  9 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Wanna learn another one? Or do you want to practice with that for a while first. - Wed Dec  9 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Lets move onto another. I can practice on my own time. - Wed Dec  9 14:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sure - Wed Dec  9 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Then... - Wed Dec  9 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: That seems less complicated then the first. - Wed Dec  9 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It does...but its harder than it looks~ - Wed Dec  9 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Think you can give a more indepth explination? - Wed Dec  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhhgmhmmm... - Wed Dec  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its hard to explain...these things have always sort of...come naturally you know? - Wed Dec  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Let me try... - Wed Dec  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The palm is the key, you need to focus your chakra onto your palm...draw in the air around you and then push it outwards in one go. - Wed Dec  9 14:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The thrust greatly increses its effectiveness. - Wed Dec  9 14:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) shook her head and built up chakra. She still had a fair bit after her previous usage of the other jutsu. This one was a bit harder to get the hang down for her. Yet it wasn't going to take her as long since she had the basics down for fuuton in a sense. By basics I mean she knew the feeling of conversion.

She had a similar mental image since this was a similar technique to the divine wind. One that blows instead of one that cuts. She claps her hands together and tries pushing out of course she ended up messing up on her first attempt. Cancling her chakra flow she closes her eyes and focuses again.

This wasn''t like the divine wind in a sense of spinning but instead it was one that created a gale. Instead of spinning like she thought with that technique she altered her image as if a mental picture of wind blowing forward was drawn out. Her chakra altered with the image and with the hand seal she felt like it was easier to pull off.

She then utilize the technique once more still not getting the full power of it but having a general idea of how it was used. She needed more experience with wind in general which was going to take a while.
