<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: If she were to fall into the waterfall.... - Sun Dec  6 10:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. This water should do. - Sun Dec  6 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) takes a look at the water and then the path leading up to the waterfall. She mentally took note to the advantages and of a fix surface along with a liquid surface. Clearly the fix surface was the better choice to start with in her opinion.

She adjusted her body and interlocked her hands forming a single hand seal.Chakra builds up and like she was instructed she channeled it to her feet.She decided to take things slow lifting her foot up and pressing it against the rocky clift. Yumiko stood there for a while getting use to the feeling of having a constant chakra flow there. 

She bends her knee and begins to move upwards. Naturally she wasn't use to walking like that so the whole thing felt rather odd to her. That and with nothing under her back she couldn't compare it to laying down ether.With both feet there she begins her next step.

The third step was taken and she lost focus.Her flow became to weak and she fell on the grass below. At least the surface wasn't hard. Rubbing her head she got up and stretched. Interlocking her hands once more she begins to build up chakra again while flowing it to her feet.

Yumiko took her fourth step in total and first step back upwards. She tried maintaining her flow which was going well for now until she ended up on her eighth step. Then she ended up flowing to much chakra into her feet causing her to be pushed back forcefully away from where she was walking similar to how Sasuke had been during the tree climbing exercise. Now she was in the air falling. To save herself from a headache she twist her body to the right and lands on the ground with her knee pressed against it and her hand touching the ground as well.

Yumiko decided to take a breather and think things over. She knew what to little chaka felt like and what to much chakra felt like. Also she knew the side effects of both. That being said she went up taking her time this time. She started getting use to walking slowly. Now came the difficult part water.

She made her trip down and took off her shirt to show an undershirt under it. Because of the explination she had gotten and experienced the mess ups with walking on a solid surface she had a strong prediction that she was going to fall in trying this. With her chakra flowing still she walks towards the liquid surface and presses her foot against it.

Two seconds passed and her foot went in the water after being attached to the surface."I'm lucky I didn't try walking. The shifting really does make it harder to adjust the flow."she thought to herself taking her foot out of the water and placing it on the surface. Yumiko presses her weight on the foot and maintained it a bit longer this time but the constant movement of the water made it difficult.

She took her foot out again repeating the process closing her eyes and feeling the water movement with her feet. Practicing changing the chakra to match what she had to Yumiko began to get the hang of it. It was at this point she felt ready to try walking on a liquid surface. 

Her other foot moves and presses on the surface. She decided to take it step by step trying not to fall in. Once she was on the water completely she focused on balencing herself. Her legs were shaking a bit while she was doing this since it was her first time walking on the water itself.

Soon enough her legs stop shaking. She calmed down and started to walk slowly picking up the pace. It was different than climbing a solid surface but she was able to adapt to it since she had the former down. Only a tad bit more stressful to do. Once she finished up she went out of the water and back on the ground sitting down and turns her head to look at the waterfall.* - Sun Dec  6 11:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: ..Be careful. - Sun Dec  6 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) stands up and stretches her arms and legs. She nodded her head and moved near Roman lifting her hand up to form the seal of comfrontation."Yumiko." she said introducing herself before grabbing her bow. Oddly the bow did not have a string attached to it.* - Sun Dec  6 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...You guys should probably take the spar outside of the academy walls. - Sun Dec  6 22:52:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Yumiko, why'd you have to accept this spar? - Sun Dec  6 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) lifts her hand up holding the stringless bow towards Roman. She looked around making sure no one would get caught in the cross fire of her attack. Not one to go for head shots normally she lowered her bow and decided to get a bit closer  to Roman not moving at full speed.

The child built up chakra flowing it into the stringless and an arrow of chakra forms on the bow. The arrow fires aiming to his side but most likely if it hit it wouldn't hurt Roman to badly.* - Sun Dec  6 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) seem a bit shocked that her arrow didn't hurt the man and when he kicked off she kicked back deciding to gain some distance. As an archer in training she knew that close range wasa disadvantage for her. "Hmm." she thought to herself planning a bit.

Mean while backing off she decided to test his armor a bit. Wanted to see what was stronger. His armor or her chakra arrows. Continuing to move backwards now she channeled her chakra into her bow aiming to shoot another arrow on the right of his helment seeing if she could damage it.* - Sun Dec  6 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Tch, Yumiko look what you got yourself into.. - Sun Dec  6 23:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) couldn't really avoid the strike due to his attack speed. The back of his spear slammed into her chest sending her back quite a bit while she staggers up on her feet."Yeah difference between child and adult...bad." she thought to herself placing the bow in her mouth.

Forming a hand seal after that she utilized shunshin to head south hoping to gain some distance and regain her composure in order to shake off what just happen.* - Sun Dec  6 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: A..priestess? - Sun Dec  6 23:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Maybe you're the close minded one. - Sun Dec  6 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) held the hand seal as the man continued to come closer to her. Her eyes widen and she utilized the technique once more. This time the went towards Heiwa's direction leaving a cloud of smoke behind where she once was.Hoping to reach him she took the bow out her mouth and tossed it to him.

"Hold this for me please."she stated after tossing it to him while keeping an eye on Roman.* - Sun Dec  6 23:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) stretches and keeps her eyes on Roman. She makes a come here motion."You made me put down my bow which is good. So ready to start fighting for real?" she said in a bit of a happy tone. Honesty she was glad that someone couldn't be taken down with her bow in a single shot.* - Sun Dec  6 23:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Is it that woman you're killing? - Sun Dec  6 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) while he focused on her feet she went for hand seals while taking off forward not at full speed. Going through a few of them with quite the speed. Her chakra builds up while she does this and with the last seal made she slams her hand on the ground."Now!" she thought to herself hoping to catch Roman off guard.

Chains rises up from the ground aiming to bind him completely hoping to lock down movement. Even if it was only for a moment she hoped to stop him in his tracks and maybe even in the spar they were in.* - Sun Dec  6 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No and I suppose so. - Sun Dec  6 23:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) watch as the man spu and was glad this was getting pretty interesting. However she wasn't finish just yet.She haults her advancement while he was spinning in a circle to try and fight off the chains. She went through another series of hand seals at the same speed. Two traps for the price of one was in her mind.

Since he was so focused she channeled chakra to her core. Disabling advancement was her stratagy after all."Water style Syrup trap." Yumiko throught to herself aiming to cover  Roman's feet in starch syrup while he was spinning.* - Mon Dec  7 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Tch. - Mon Dec  7 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) maintained her chakra flow while spitting out more of the syrup trap. Her head begins turning moving side to side while she continues to create more of it.Eventually her chakra flow haults allowing her to take a breather.

Her eyes remain locked on Roman and she began to back away."Time to work?" she said more so to Heiwa and Sekitsui rather than Roman. While she was set up for another attack after this if it was between a mission and a spar the mission came first.

She wonder what Roman would do with now a decent amount of syrup trap covering the area in front of him and a bit on the side. How to advance towards her in that situation. She didn't know if he knew about the jutsu or not.* - Mon Dec  7 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: Is it over..? - Mon Dec  7 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) holds out the seal of reconciliation towards Roman nodding her head."Do you give up?" she asked him channeling chakra to her feet and walking to him. If he said yes then she leave and walk over to her squad. However if the fight was still on then that was a completely different story.* - Mon Dec  7 00:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) really didn't want to use more chakra than she had but she didn't want to leave Roman stuck there ether. She assumed that they had to wash part of the area away. Nodding her head she fills her mouth with water while looking down.

"Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought to herself pushing away the liquid assuming Heiwa would help with her doing so.* - Mon Dec  7 00:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) traversed along with the squad entering the prison. She passed the checks  and nodded her head. She didn't care much for the ranking of the missio but she did expect something to go to happen. Usually missions never ended smoothly. Yumiko pulled out a bottle of milk drinking it. Considering she tend to drink a lot. Mostly to help restore her chakra a bit since she just got out the spar not to long ago.

"What is the mission." she whispered expecting Heiwa to answer her question and hoping that he do in a low tone voice.* - Mon Dec  7 01:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Just in case something happens. - Mon Dec  7 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) continued traversing near Sekitsui near the cell. She was a lot calmer due to her last mission where she tried reasoning with the target failing which nearly got them all killed. She shakes her head left and right sighing out loud while looking for the cell. She stops for a moment and whispered something to Heiwa and Nori."If anyone has tags let me have two." she said to them having an idea.

If ether of them gave her any explosive tags she moved forward to the cell and await the guards to let her through.* - Mon Dec  7 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) tilts her head to the side. Deep down she didn't want to do this but when she started having second thoughts she flashed back to her last mission. She shook her head at Nori's request remaining calm."I'll do it." she said putting the tags Nori given her on his body and watching his hands closely. Yet the tone of her voice spoke volumes about her true opinion of the task to anyone who could pick it up.

"If it's not done....it'll be like last time." she thought to herself even saying it a single time once lowly almost in a whisper.* - Mon Dec  7 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) follows her out and listens to her question. She coud really only answer in one way."Hope for the best, prepare for the worse." she said in a low tone voice while catching up to Sekitsui yet remaining a bit behind her an the prisoner.* - Mon Dec  7 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ..Yumiko, go gather anyone you can ahead of us. - Mon Dec  7 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) nods deciding to run off trusting her squad to handle the prisoner.* - Mon Dec  7 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) inhales deeply before shouting at the top of her lungs."At the acadamy there will be justice brought to an evil man! Come join us there if you want to see what happens to people who do something very bad!" she shouted while running around to try and gather up civilans, some of the shinobi as well since this was suppose to be a public execution.* - Mon Dec  7 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Heiwa, do me a favor. - Mon Dec  7 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Why does Nori -want- to do it? - Mon Dec  7 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) clears her throat and takes a break for a moment. Eventually she spoke. "We were told to kill this man in public and here we are. For everyone to see."* - Mon Dec  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But who? - Mon Dec  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: .......But why? - Mon Dec  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) whispers: Ask him for his last words..and then afterwards go ahead and do it. - Mon Dec  7 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: They're just going to execute that man as he is? A poor death. - Mon Dec  7 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: If he should die, he should do so on his feet, not grovelling on the floor. - Mon Dec  7 03:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) lifts her hands up forming the seal of confrontation. Also being the seal needed to utilize the jutsu. Building up chakra she spoke softly the name of the technique."Kirigakurue no jutsu." she muttered to herself the water source she had which was all around her lifting up and spinning around forming the mist.

She held the hand seal for a while before backing off jumpping on the water. Once she did so she faded into the mist breathing in. She was thinking of ways to sneak up on Nori who agreed to this training after all. The girl lowers her hand down to her side now before moving softly. Her foot step being heard on the water when it pressed down.

She went back on solid ground at this point. Nodding her head she thought one thing to herself."Let the exercise begin."Was what went through her head wondering how she was going to sneak up on the red head.* - Tue Dec  8 03:41:52 2015
