<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: How have you been? - Fri Dec 11 13:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Fine for the day. Don't have to act like we don't still live together. - Fri Dec 11 13:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah yeah. - Fri Dec 11 13:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And you? - Fri Dec 11 14:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Still working on fighting in the mist. - Fri Dec 11 14:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Ah. Still need help? - Fri Dec 11 14:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Mhm. - Fri Dec 11 14:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright - I'll make the mist this time. - Fri Dec 11 14:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) takes his hand."Alright sounds like a plan.~"* - Fri Dec 11 14:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) stretches her body and nods. She yawned outloud and got ready to began the exercise."The same as before." she said. Compared to how she was before a bit of height was added onto her. Normal for someone who was pushing eleven years old after all.

A smile came across her face while preparing to begin. She even had a few new tricks up her sleeve.* - Fri Dec 11 14:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) clears her throat seeing that the spar was going on. Her eyes look towards Heiwa and Nori. She inhales before shouting out."Excuse me!" she said before returning to her normal tone of voice."Mind if I join in?"* - Fri Dec 11 21:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: How are you holding up? - Fri Dec 11 22:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Good. . . Welp. Finished one mission finally. - Fri Dec 11 22:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I have. . Six more missions to do.  - Fri Dec 11 22:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Ugghh. .  - Fri Dec 11 22:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: And Heiwa told me the council is hounding me to do them too. .  - Fri Dec 11 22:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Well then. Your next opponent is me. - Fri Dec 11 22:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm? Uhh, alright I guess. Guess I can do one that ain't a mission. - Fri Dec 11 22:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Come then. Afterwords we're going on a trip. - Fri Dec 11 22:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) wasn't going to make it easy for Nori to get close to her in such a way. As soon as she started to run Yumiko weaved together a hand seal surging chakra through her entire body. While Nori continued to run Yumiko utilize shunshin moving quite the distance. She wasn't requesting just a taijutsu fight after all.

Once she moved Yumiko formed the seal of confrontation."This is how you begin a spar." Yumiko said while looking to Nori at her new location building up chakra again waiting for Nori to approch her.* - Fri Dec 11 23:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) smirks since she fell for it. She begins breathing out as dense as a mist she could conjure up. "An eye for an eye we both won't see." she thought to herself while exhaling the mist. She decided to fill the area as much as possible using her chakra to expand the mist.

"Why do you think I really made the seal?" she thought to herself aiming to blind herself and Nori. This was practice for the two of them. Getting use to the mist and moving silently for her as well as getting Nori use to fighting in the mist.* - Fri Dec 11 23:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) closes her eyes begining to move closer to Nori. Step by step she moved slowly working on making her feet fall silent rather than running towards her.:"It would be dangerous to use weapons against her. So....." she thought to herself smiling deciding to catch her off guard.

Making the required seals needed Yumiko builds up her chakra. Focusing on Nori's last known location one thought ran through her mind."Fuuton Reppusho no jutsu." Yumiko throught to herself creating a gale aiming to knock Nori over from the surprise attack while maintaining the mist.* - Sat Dec 12 00:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) continued moving closer trying to blend in with the mist. The smirk never leaving her face the entire time.She breaths in not bothering to use the technique again. Nori did make where she was known so she knew where to go.

No attack was made this time. Instead she decided to go around while trying to muffle her foot steps and fight silently in the mist. Also as a scare tactic.* - Sat Dec 12 00:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) lower herself to the ground and continue her path to the side almost even going as far as to try and move on all fours which would have failed. She took off running and then stop to relocate herself hoping that the game of cat and mouse continued. Now it was just find the Nori while in the mist which she was planning on doing. She listen out for any sound that might give them away.

Yumiko went back to trying to stalk Nori in the mist nodding her head hoping to to shake Nori up by trying to keep her guessing.* - Sat Dec 12 01:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) turned around and lifted her hand up. She decided to play a bit more rough against Nori since she was blinded. An idea came to her head now while she spiked up her chakra letting out what she was about to do trying to do her best to control it.

Yumiko was toning down the power a lot now since she didn't want to hurt Nori. That didn't mean she didn't plan on her taking a surprise dip in some water however. She fills her cheeks up with water while the chakra rapidly converts into water."I can't see her but I can use this to strike. She thought to herself grinning.

While she converted the chakra Yumiko begins moving again towards the west trying to keep her foot steps quiet. A few times she slipped up but not to badly. Practice was paying off. She applied chakra coating to the soles of her feet while doing this since she was going to need it.

"Suiton baku suishouha no jutsu!" she thought to herself her head tilting down creating a wave large enough to knock someone over and carry them back a few feet but not enough to seriously injure a person. She didn't want nothing happening to Nori after all. 

With the chakra coating on her feet Yumiko rides the wave. After the wave touched down she cleared the mist due to how much chakra that used. It still took a lot out of her to say the least compared to her other techniques although it was much stronger.* - Sat Dec 12 01:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) breaths out and holds out her hand. She aimed to end the one on one."Can we stop now? That took a lot out of me even while holding back." Yumiko said hoping Nori was willing to stop.* - Sat Dec 12 02:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I'll take you to dry off. Want your help for a few things. - Sat Dec 12 02:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . ..  No, no. Won't be necessary. And with what? I have a few missions to do.. - Sat Dec 12 02:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm? - Sat Dec 12 02:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Like wise. - Sat Dec 12 02:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Two heads are better than one. You help with mines I help with yours. - Sat Dec 12 02:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmm. . I guess. - Sat Dec 12 02:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) lifts her hands up forming the snake hand seal. Her chakra spikes up getting ready to show the true power of the technique. She closes her eyes and her cheeks puffs out. Her chakra rapidly converts into water at this point.

Breathing in she looks down."Suiton Baku suishouha no jutsu." she thought to hersef. A lot of water begins flowing out of her mouth enough to cause the girl to go air born. The water hits the ground and flows next to the waterfall making it look bigger than it actually was.

The water splashes while she maintains her chakra flow. The jutsu was using up quite a bit of chakra and it was stressing her reserves a lot but it was working on her control as well. Yumiko continued to go higher into the air until she felt she created enough water.

Once she used enough chakra Yumiko begins to slow down her flow. This caused the intense pressure of the water to slow down as well. Now lowering herself to the ground due to the water not coming out as intense as before Yumiko lands her right knee on the ground and the sole of her left foot pressing against it. 

She breaths in and out catching her breath. The technique really did stressed her out a lot. She adjusted her body and put herself in a seated position wiping the sweat off her forehead.* - Sat Dec 12 05:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) breaths out and hops up due to the tourist arrival being soon. She decided it was best to take it easy for the time being. "All I have to do is show him around the village? Easy enough." she said to herself enjoying the walk when it was dark. Once she got to the gate she waited for the guy's arrival.

Once he made it the guy looked around."Where's my escort?" he said to himself which caught Yumiko's attention. She walked over to him and bowed."Hello there. I will be your guide here today." she said to the tourist. The man blinked and shook his head. "It seems child labor rumors are not a lie." the villager thought to himself.

After a few minutes of silence she spoke."I'm in your care. Lets have a good time." the villager stated smiling brightly. She decided to begin showing him a few things he should remember. The first being the kage mansion. She didn't show him the insides but she did speak about it."Here is where you go to find the staff to submit request for missions if you ever require one. You talk to the kage and have them set something up for you." she explain.

The villager blinked a bit confused at first."I see..." he thought wondering why he was showned this first where he requested this as a mission. Pushing those thoughts aside he decided to speak in a kind nature."Well that is good to know." remembering she was still a child.

Yumiko then took him to the district where he could shop for clothing as well as the resturant. "Here's your go to for fun and games. For shopping as well." she said which might have been obvious. She then reaches out to take his hand leading him off to the pub."And this is where adults go for drinks." which left the guy confused. Why did she know that? Because she was taken there but didn't drink.

Yumiko then lead him to the acadamy."And this is where you would go to sign up to be a shinobi." this was said in a more serious tone remembering how the villagers treated them when the execution was going on. The man look and turned his head away before speaking."That's for another time huh?" which Yumiko nodded her head in response.

Yumiko then guided him through the different districts of the villages. Near where she lived and showed him the basic lay outs of the island and where to grab a hotel at to spend the night. Even went to take him sight seeing and let him see the waterfall where she spent time at.

Once they were finish she went to take him to the hotel where he could afford. Naturally paying for the hotel wasn't part of her mission.She clearedher throat."Well I guess this concludes the tour. Did you enjoy it?" the client nodded in response. A hand shake was exchanged."I was satafied thanks. I'll send good word to who's in charge." he spoke before they parted with her waving good bye.* - Sat Dec 12 06:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah hello there.~ - Sat Dec 12 06:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Hey, Yumiko. How's today? - Sat Dec 12 06:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Pretty good and you? - Sat Dec 12 06:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Same. Was thinking about delivering a message to Izanami. - Sat Dec 12 06:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Especially considering the upcoming exams. - Sat Dec 12 06:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: You mean the chuunins? - Sat Dec 12 06:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: No. The Gezo's exams. - Sat Dec 12 06:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: You want to take part....in the one coming up? - Sat Dec 12 07:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Actually the opposite. I want to make sure Izanami isn't planning to. - Sat Dec 12 07:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You know how she can get at times.. - Sat Dec 12 07:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah... - Sat Dec 12 07:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ....Besides I also had something else I wanted to ask her. - Sat Dec 12 07:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Like? - Sat Dec 12 07:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Well..about something I've been reading up on. - Sat Dec 12 07:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I've heard there are a few practicioners in Suna. - Sat Dec 12 07:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Oh? - Sat Dec 12 07:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) sits down and opens her scroll. Deciding to skip through the information she saw a few things useful in there."Channeling chakra into water allows you to replicate yourself into a solid clone" she stop right there having had her interest peaked at that.

She continued reading thinking about the possibilities."A solid clone that can use jutsu of the suiton element but can only travel a certain distance and is a lot weaker chakra wise than the original." was what the scroll finish saying along with showing pictures of it.

She look at the picture deciding to test it out. She saw a no face person forming the hand seal and his chakra which was drawn going into the water. She then saw another no face person next to the oringinal seeing what it meant. Looking down at the text after the picture it said that this was a variation technique of the bunshin and apply suiton chakra with shape manipulation immitating the bunshin technique.

She stood up lifting her hands together weaving togeher the hand seal. Flowing the chakra into the water the clone came out a bit distorted and ugly but she did not let that get her down since it was only the bunshin technique with water she had to get use to applying it with a physical substance. 
* - Sat Dec 12 09:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) Once the screwed up bunshin returned to water she tried again forming the clone of herself and seeing it turn to an image of herself. This was a better version of herself. Now it was time to actually try to take it a step further. She tried to control to clones solid at that with her chakra and move around.

A rather difficult task and draining but effective. One that could be used for kawarimi at that. Problem is for now it took way to much of her chakra and she needed more control in general.* - Sat Dec 12 09:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Morning. - Sat Dec 12 09:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Morning. - Sat Dec 12 09:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Mhm. - Sat Dec 12 09:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Same. - Sat Dec 12 09:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Have anymore needed to be cleared? - Sat Dec 12 09:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Hm? - Sat Dec 12 09:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) shrugs her shoulders giggling and forming a hand seal. Waving to Anguo she then shunshin away to go to her usual spot.* - Sat Dec 12 10:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) looks at the note and gives him a thumbs up. Now the real question was what Lera's response was going to be. Although she didn't expect her to go for blood if she was to accept at least.* - Sat Dec 12 10:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah thank you. - Sat Dec 12 10:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Erm. - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Anything taijutsu, really. - Sat Dec 12 14:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Improving strength, my reaction time, anything, really. - Sat Dec 12 15:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: How about your perceptions? - Sat Dec 12 15:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That too. - Sat Dec 12 15:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Then this will be a spar. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: With a caveat. - Sat Dec 12 15:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You will be fighting in the hidden mist. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: No sight. Rely on your other senses. - Sat Dec 12 15:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then I'm immediately down for the count. - Sat Dec 12 15:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Huh? - Sat Dec 12 15:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: As is Nori. Learning how to fight in the mist is important - at least to being able to survive in it. - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: This is a common hiden of this village after all. - Sat Dec 12 15:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) shook her head up and down weaving together a hand seal. Converting chakra into suiton she exhales creating the mist.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Guess you want to learn suiton as well Nori? - Sun Dec 13 01:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Suiton? - Sun Dec 13 01:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec 13 01:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I guess, yeah.  - Sun Dec 13 01:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Alright both of you sit down. - Sun Dec 13 01:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) takes her own seat and crosses her legs. She decided to give a demonstration first rather than explaining it. She claps her hands together and flows her chakra evenly to the palms of her hands. Condensing it and creating the components of water She makes what looks like a faucet running water from between her hands at a constant motion hitting the ground. 

It was as if a sink was barely turned on. Her chakra not rising or falling the entire time. Yumiko open her mouth to speak."The basic of suiton falls in two categories. Make water from chakra and use existing water. Logically you can use preexisting water made by chakra for things." she said taking frequent breaks allowing for questions to be ask.

"Creating water requires more chakra. Nori knows this after I weaken a jutsu to surprise attack her and ended the spar later how stressful large amounts of water can be. Smaller amounts not so much. To create water you use your chakra to form what water is made out of. two hydrogen and one oxygen atom otherwise known as H2O. Chakra creating these two at a rapid rate gets manipulated to shoot out at high speeds from the mouth making a small amount of water, a large amount, or an insane amount. Like so."

At this point her chakra flow cuts off and she went through hand seals. Her head adjusted and she brought her hands to her mouth."Suiton Mizurappa no jutsu." she thought to herself shooting out quite a bit of water from her mouth up in the air.

Cutting her flow she takes a breather before begining speaking again."And using preexisting water is easier. It's applying shape manipulation to the water in order to give it form to use in combat. For jutsu we will go into that later. For now try creating H2O enough to create a stream of water coming from the middle of your hands."* - Sun Dec 13 02:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ah okay. - Sun Dec 13 02:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Try creating water. - Sun Dec 13 02:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: . .. Uhh. . - Sun Dec 13 03:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Take your time building it up. Slowly let it flow out like a river stream. - Sun Dec 13 03:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) turned towards Sekitsui and waved to her. She made a come here motion with her hands."Hey come join us! I'm trying to teach Nori how to use suiton correctly!" she shouted to the girl.* - Sun Dec 13 03:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: For now yes. I figure I teach them how to create small amounts of water. - Sun Dec 13 03:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Progress? - Sun Dec 13 03:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Nori you're doing good. It'll take a while to get use to but you are doing quite well there. - Sun Dec 13 03:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: He's been resting. He was around earlier today with training. - Sun Dec 13 03:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Like Nori said. He's resting right now. Also Nori try condensing your chakra more before flowing it out. - Sun Dec 13 03:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Mn, okay. - Sun Dec 13 03:55:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Well that's good to hear. Curious but what do you know about the Gezo? - Sun Dec 13 04:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Gezo? Nothing really other than what we usually learn from word of mouth or in the academy. - Sun Dec 13 04:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I just kind of try not to think about them you know? - Sun Dec 13 04:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Afraid? - Sun Dec 13 04:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Not really 'afraid' just don't approve of their ways so much... So I'm not all that interested in them. - Sun Dec 13 04:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: So you hate them then? - Sun Dec 13 04:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ...Hate is a really strong word too, Yumiko-chan. - Sun Dec 13 04:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) couldn't help but chuckle."Sometimes if people don't like something they avoid or hate it. Even both.~"* - Sun Dec 13 04:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: I don't hate it but I just you know, don't -understand- them... so I avoid the topic. - Sun Dec 13 04:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I see. - Sun Dec 13 04:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I wouldn't want to go near them if I can avoid it. - Sun Dec 13 04:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: So you don't like them either? - Sun Dec 13 04:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Not at all. - Sun Dec 13 04:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I think they see us as ants ready to step on when they want. - Sun Dec 13 04:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: .... yeah...  - Sun Dec 13 04:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Sounds about right. - Sun Dec 13 04:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Wouldn't you..rather that not happen? - Sun Dec 13 04:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ... of course not. - Sun Dec 13 04:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: But we can't do anything about that. - Sun Dec 13 04:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: We could defend ourselves. - Sun Dec 13 04:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ...Against the Gezo...right. - Sun Dec 13 04:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Would...you rather run? - Sun Dec 13 04:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: No of course not... - Sun Dec 13 04:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: But I don't want to anger them. - Sun Dec 13 04:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Never said provoke. Only defend. - Sun Dec 13 04:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Defend implies a need to defend. - Sun Dec 13 04:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: It's not like Gezo goes attacking us for no reason. - Sun Dec 13 04:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec 13 05:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I wouldn't want to see the reason they go attacking. - Sun Dec 13 05:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yumiko(Sekara) lifts her hands up making the single hand seal. She builds up her chakra gathering huge amounts of it. Converting the bulk of it into water. "Lets make a second waterfall again shall we?" she said taking a deep breath in since she was going to need it. 

Once she finish breathing in she closed her mouth. A huge amount of water rushes up and begins expanding her cheeks. The look in Yumiko changed and the direction of her head changed. She look down and releases the water thinking "Suiton bakusui shouha no jutsu!" she thought to herself unleashing the massive amounts of water.

The very force of the technique pushed her in the air. The water came rushing out creating a wave. The wave flows down creatin a waterfall on the other side of the cliff. She maintained the flow the entire time focusing on improving her control and not wasting as much chakra as before.

Eventually she begins to slow down her chakra flow controlling it decently. The pressure of the water decreased just like before. Her altitude lowered until she was back to her starting point which was on the ground making a safe landing and watching the remainder of the water fall.

She breaths out while her shoes were getting wet due to the water she created. She went to the edge of and look down at the mess she made."Well then." she thought to herself. The remainder of the water was off the cliff now and she went to find some place dry to sit.* - Sun Dec 13 06:21:23 2015
