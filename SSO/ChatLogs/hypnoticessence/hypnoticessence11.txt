<br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: ...Lera's -daughter-. - Sat Nov 14 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: What the -actual- fuck. - Sat Nov 14 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) frowned heavily at this but nodded, "yes of course, Sir. I wouldn't see it any other way, what is her name though so I have it for records. Also, do you know where Lera is so that I can inform her?" She was feeling dizzy mostly because of her stupid attempt at using chakra while recovering still but was putting up with it since it was necessary to save a life.* - Sat Nov 14 08:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) came walking up to the area, searching for Lera and finally spotted her. She didn't think anyone here had actually seen the incident so perhaps that's why none of them had informed her? Panting out as she caught her breath she groaned lightly while being white as a sheet under the face paint, dark circles under her eyes, and some of her stitches were loose with other's broken in places but luckily no blood yet.* - Sat Nov 14 08:43:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) released a sigh out and fluttered her eyes in an attempt to get rid of the dizzy spell. Looking straight over to Lera as she explained, "Your daughter...apparently, she was injured in a spar quite severely. Don't worry I have her stable in the hospital and Mirai is looking after her while I came to find you. We didn't have any records on her and she was too out of it to tell us her name, luckily Lord Kazekage knew who she was."* - Sat Nov 14 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My Dau- Nina?? - Sat Nov 14 08:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I thought she'd followed Ortho...crap. - Sat Nov 14 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In the hospital right?? - Sat Nov 14 08:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: nods* - Sat Nov 14 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Seems the spar is over now. - Sat Nov 14 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Sat Nov 14 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You pushed yourself too hard. - Sat Nov 14 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt herself hovering up lightly and sighed out heavily, then whispering. "She'd be dead if I hadn't, Lera."* - Sat Nov 14 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I know...thank you... - Sat Nov 14 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: To the hospital then - Sat Nov 14 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had gone into the room and came back out, "apparently she is resting now. You can go in and see she is safe but she won't be talking."* - Sat Nov 14 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right... - Sat Nov 14 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) || Lera would see that the child's right arm was completely bandaged up from the middle of her forearm up to her shoulder cuff. "She took a nodachi slash to the arm, she's lucky she didn't lose it."* - Sat Nov 14 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Fuck where is Mirai, I need my stitches patched up. - Sat Nov 14 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Sat Nov 14 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Sigh* Come on. Lets get you to a bed, you need fixing up. I'll go find a medic. - Sat Nov 14 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't need to be in bed, I'm just... ugh... - Sat Nov 14 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) crumpled her face up and gave up argueing, "okay...."* - Sat Nov 14 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good. - Sat Nov 14 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked into the room across the hall and went to sit on the bed, she assumed she was no longer hovering a few inches off of the ground.* - Sat Nov 14 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...right right... - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Like I want to move.... - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll be back in a moment. - Sat Nov 14 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: yeah - Sat Nov 14 09:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was laying on the bed, by the time Lera got back Kiyo was already having her stitches pulled out by one of the head nurses and then restitched up with an IV bag with nutrients to restore her. "Why didn't you tell me that the little girl you spoke of was still around?" She assumed Nina was the one taken by her parents.* - Sat Nov 14 09:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Wait what? - Sat Nov 14 09:15:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes. - Sat Nov 14 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: She knew and was close with Ortho before she even knew me and Violet. - Sat Nov 14 09:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes at this and nodded, "I see... I will need to inform Ortho then so he can come visit her. He said he was coming to Suna soon for something an already arranged to see me like I told you I was going to do."* - Sat Nov 14 09:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Of what he could do to you if he had a change of heart. - Sat Nov 14 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't think he will, he was very genuine.... - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And after what he had to put me through don't you think he would have harmed me more? - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know...but that doesn't stop me from being scared. - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Love, he isn't going to harm me. - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And the fact I might have just saved the life of someone he cares about will only secure that more. - Sat Nov 14 09:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why didn't you tell me about her? - Sat Nov 14 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It kind of was a slap in the face to find out about your daughter from your father.... - Sat Nov 14 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...didn't even of her. - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: After she went with Ortho...I guess I stopped thinking of her as my daughter. - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see. - Sat Nov 14 09:22:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had quickly scanned the room with her eyes and when she saw what there was to see her eyes saddened lightly but she simply walked over after having removed her shoes to respect his home, even as vacant as it was, and took a seat with her legs folded under her at the table on a floor pillow. For a moment, Kiyo actually worried he might not even -have- tea for them to drink.* - Sat Nov 14 10:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched as the tea was being heated and then focused her attention back onto Hassan. She was going to try and not comment on the home but then Lera just came out and said it, Kiyoko dropped her head some with a sigh. Only a few seconds were wasted doing this before Kiyoko rose her head back up to peer over to the older man, "I've been better, wasn't suppose to be using any chakra but at least it kept Nina alive."* - Sat Nov 14 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) squinted at Lera taking the bad cup and would have protested but Lera wouldn't give her the chance and it would make things awkward and informal, not to mention unpolite. "O-oh, yes of course." She paused and stared down at the teap before taking her right hand around the cup and her left under the base of the cup and brought it to her lips. Even as bitter and terrible as the tea was she drank it and held the cup formally, she didn't make a face or compliment the tea since that would also be rude, no instead she just smiled gently over towards Hassan.

Glancing over to Lera as she asked the question, Kiyoko waited but if she had the chance would ask. "Forgive me that I have to ask you this, but what would you like me to call you while off duty? I am not certain what would be appropriate."* - Sat Nov 14 11:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well.. also I would like to know if you are going to like the scars. - Sat Nov 14 13:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your body is beautiful no matter whats added to it, so I think I will yes. - Sat Nov 14 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay, I feel sort of strange...going from having no scars to....this. - Sat Nov 14 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) mumbled against Lera's chest, "it's sort of making me a little self conscious."* - Sat Nov 14 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Ewy. - Sat Nov 14 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wrinkled her nose at Lera and stared up to her.* - Sat Nov 14 13:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped and tried to lick her bottom lip before she could reach her nose. "It's true.~"* - Sat Nov 14 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes as her mouth was invaded and groaned gently as the kiss deepened and she could hardly breath at all from the unexpected kiss.* - Sat Nov 14 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rose a brow as she panted heavily with a gasp after the kiss broke and laid her cheek against Lera's chest and gave a tiny groan from the desire building in her that she wanted to go away. "Having troubles controlling yourself, Lera."* - Sat Nov 14 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you going to be alright? - Sat Nov 14 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Or am I going to find myself restitching myself later? - Sat Nov 14 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can hold on...don't you worry. - Sat Nov 14 14:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) snickered against her chest.* - Sat Nov 14 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Psshh...'yet' doubting my willpower are we? - Sat Nov 14 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I wouldn't mind her fucking me but it sounds like she doesn't think she can be careful. - Sat Nov 14 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yes but I distinctly remember we no longer have a shower door. - Sat Nov 14 14:17:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you're done then? I guess we can just go to bed then. - Sat Nov 14 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stood up and started stripping off clothing revealing more and more of her stitched up and bruised battered body but beneath all that was her shapely curves.* - Sat Nov 14 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....... - Sat Nov 14 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was walking towards the bedroom, "it's bed time isn't it? Nighty night.~" She was playing very innocent all while dropping her dress, stepping out of her shoes, and gently removed her panties as she made her way to the doorframe of the bedroom.* - Sat Nov 14 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: This....is...not fair.. - Sat Nov 14 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think it's very fair. - Sat Nov 14 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Everyone has to go to sleep sometime. - Sat Nov 14 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Even you, superwoman. - Sat Nov 14 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh my, L-lera! What's come over you?!~ - Sat Nov 14 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't play innocent now... - Sat Nov 14 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What are you going to do to little o' me? - Sat Nov 14 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Nov 14 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was easily picked up and taken to the bed. When she was laid down she lay perfectly still, "I know you want me, so I'll behave...let you do what you please... and I'll just hold still for you, Lera. I don't like you torturing yourself."* - Sat Nov 14 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She wants me to please her? - Sat Nov 14 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked some while she was being kissed at what she was feeling. The warmth was exciting and certainly strengthened any bad thoughts Kiyo was having. Swallowing hard, the girl massaged in slow soft circles at first and each circulation caused her fingers to press harder. She alternated between circles and then quick back and forths across her lips through the clothing and then circular motions again.* - Sat Nov 14 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped as soon as the fingers touched her bare sex, her own set of digits stroked in circles as her head leaned off to the side on the pillow. As the girl continued on with the touching of her fiance it wasn't enough, Kiyo tried to get her hand inside of Lera's pants enough so that she could touch directly, feel the hot stickiness, and even go as far as delving between her lips to sink into those inner walls. She wanted to please Lera, and since she was forced to be as still as she could, this was the way it had to go.* - Sat Nov 14 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled gently as she watched her lover and licked over her lips before going into various motions with her fingers that might surprise Lera. Her fingers twisted like when you cross your fingers to break a promise, then untwisted followed by a pulling apart her fingers from each other to make a scissor motion and slowly pressing on her inner walls to stretch them gently before closing again. A scooping motion against her g-spot, then a large and small circle made with her fingers by moving in and out. She worked through this pattern and several others while pleasing Lera all to hopefully give her the best fingering she had ever had. 

Meanwhile as the fingers had sank into Kiyo's own sex, she struggled for a moment for control before getting ahold of herself and realized for a moment or two that she was kind of in charge and was enjoying it. Lera might have been on top but Kiyo was working her like a top.* - Sat Nov 14 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) never said she hadn't done this before, she just doesn't kiss and tell.~ In fact Kiyoko was pretty experienced but of course always safe with the partners she chose in the past. Her fingers kept up the strange patterns and when the stimulation within Kiyo's own cunt became more aggressive the faster Lera's stimulation would become. Panting tiny feminine pants and small moans she squeezed around the fingers inside of her while trying to focus all of her concentration on Lera and refusing to give in knowing that Lera was the one that needed release.* - Sat Nov 14 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was totally in control even as Lera shifted positions. For a short while as her tongue lapped at the soaked outer lips and smaller interior lips she was simply enjoying the flavor and moaning from that alone. When Lera had touched her  pucker though... Kiyo hitched her breath and couldn't think for a moment. Her body went stiff and then shuddered heavily, she had been holding back an orgasm for a while now but she wasn't able to as soon as her cute little ass was touched even as gently as it had been. Her head arched back and she gripped onto Lera's thighs with nails digging in as a loud moan sounded in a girlish cry of pleasure.* - Sat Nov 14 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned as her mouth and face was coveredin Lera's sex, licking rapidly as her hands ran up the girl's thighs and gripped her ass cheeks and hips as tightly as possible while her climax shook through her. She felt dizzy and was barely holding it together since her body was hurting from the orgasm alone even asit had filled her with pleasure.* - Sat Nov 14 15:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) licked over her lips as she panted heavily with eyes closed and head laying to the side facing Lera as she laid beside her. Unable to think for the moment.* - Sat Nov 14 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's breathing slowed and she opened her eyes some to peer over to Lera.* - Sat Nov 14 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Are you...okay..? - Sat Nov 14 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Perfect. - Sat Nov 14 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: My sentaments exactly... - Sat Nov 14 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt very tired, extremely quickly all things considered as she lay there with Lera. Trying her hardest to stay awake was prooving difficult.* - Sat Nov 14 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn... - Sat Nov 14 15:44:38 2015
