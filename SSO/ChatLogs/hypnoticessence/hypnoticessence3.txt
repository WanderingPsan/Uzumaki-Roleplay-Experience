<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes and then rushed over towards Mitsunara. "Okay hun, what seems to be the problem?" She began to scan over her body looking for the injuries present and even focused her chakra to sense if there was anything to heavily depeleting her chakra reserves.* - Mon Nov  9 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: Up! - Mon Nov  9 01:00:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shira(Osmanesanogo) says: And to somewhere! - Mon Nov  9 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) hummed gently at the injuries she managed to find. Many bruises but the ribs were the worst of it. "Do you comply to healing? Or would you only like traditional care?" She was already picking out a thick width bandage made of stretchy cloth to secure around the girl's ribs to hold them in place for healing.* - Mon Nov  9 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then folded her hands into seals and her palms emitted a glow of ethereal chakra. She ran the hands in a gentle stroke over her right side of ribs and then the left. This wouldn't heal the bones but it helped to grow new cell and protiens between the cracks to help increase the healing speed, as well as the bruises surrounding the fractures. 

Next her hands went to the woman's throat to heal it a small amount, she didn't put all that much effort into the other bruises because it was a waste of chakra, and no one ever knew when a crisis might come up. Her hands stopped emitting the glow and Kiyoko reached into her medical kit on her left leg to pull out a small bottle of medication. "How old you are?" Dependant on her age, she would either recieve one anti-inflamitory or two. Peering up to the girl's face with a broad grin, "you should put some ice on the bruises, mainly your ribs. Twenty minutes on, twenty minutes off. Only three rounds per set on that, okay? And don't put any ice on the bruise on your throat unless you want to loose your voice for a day or two."* - Mon Nov  9 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had given the girl two of the pills and pulled out a miniature bottle of water. "Here you go, all set. Is there anything else you need while I'm here?" She stood up and reached a hand out to the girl to help her up.* - Mon Nov  9 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled sweetly towards the girl, "No no.. I don't need anything, only offering my services as needed.~ Plus it's such a wonderful day, isn't it? Go and enjoy it." She peered over her shoulder towards Sanoke for a moment and then back to Mitsunara.* - Mon Nov  9 01:15:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: W-We work at a restaurant, y-you can come w-with us! - Mon Nov  9 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled wide and nodded, "could we go to that new ramen shop near the shops? Koji told me about it, he said it was the best." She turned to look over at Momura, "Is that the shop you work at?"* - Mon Nov  9 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: I-I think soo.. - Mon Nov  9 01:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then peered towards Sanoke, "Do you want to go too?" She was already heading for the exit of the sand pit assuming the injured girl was going to follow.* - Mon Nov  9 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: H-He'll learn to make the ramen. - Mon Nov  9 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Mon Nov  9 01:38:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sat down and had zoned out for a moment, maybe she was just hungry, maybe she needed food? Who knows. Soon enough she snapped back to it and peered around the cafe.* - Mon Nov  9 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: U-Uhm..H-Hi, I'll be your w-waitress f-for today.. - Mon Nov  9 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Huh..n-no.. - Mon Nov  9 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was examining Momura carefully but with kind analytic eyes. "How long have you stuttered your speech?" She then was brought out of her trance of staring at Momura and blinked several times. "O-oh, alright... right! Food," she looked down at the menu and then picked something out. "Can I get miso soup, onigiri, and sauteed sprouts?" Her meal was extremely healthy, "oh and a glass of ice water please.~" She then peered over to Mitsunara as she introduced herself, "I'm Kiyoko, it's a pleasure to meet you Mitsunara."* - Mon Nov  9 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: ..... - Mon Nov  9 01:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: They both stutter. - Mon Nov  9 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: Making the noodles for ramen is too difficult. - Mon Nov  9 02:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was pretty focused on watching the two who were cooking. She had taken note that Hanai doesn't stutter as often as Momura but they clearly both had an issue. "I'm sorry did you say something, Mitsunara? I sort of spaced out for a bit." She peered down at the fact some of her food was already hear, as well as her water. Reaching out to pick up the glass she took a drink.* - Mon Nov  9 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: O-Or does she perhaps enjoy a more hard taste? - Mon Nov  9 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) thinks: I-I'm not sure. - Mon Nov  9 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I was just curious. - Mon Nov  9 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: As to why you decided to become a Medic? - Mon Nov  9 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh right... well see, I actually only recently became a shinobi. Before that I was a nurse, I have been a nurse since the earliest age of being able to attend the classes. - Mon Nov  9 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've wanted to be a nurse since I was a little girl. - Mon Nov  9 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see- can I ask why you wanted to be a nurse, then? - Mon Nov  9 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I had a school trip to the hospital, that made my decision. To help people. - Mon Nov  9 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So you want to help people, huh..? - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: For your own sake, or theirs? - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That is- is this a selfish desire to feel good from their gratitude, or a desire to pursue the good of others? - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked a few times, "I've...never thought about that...."* - Mon Nov  9 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: So, which do you think you are? - Mon Nov  9 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stared down at her food for a moment. "Well... I've always just wanted to help people. I suppose it does feel good when I do it but my family is full of shinobi who are warriors..who take lives. I wanted to make up for that, to save lives. It's what I could provide for the world. If that means that I end up destructive to myself... so be it."* - Mon Nov  9 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shrugged with a heavy sigh, "That's one way to look at it."* - Mon Nov  9 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shrugged again, "I suppose." She took another sip of her water and then picked up some sauteed sprouts with her chopsticks.* - Mon Nov  9 02:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Only a short while...no I don't know how to fight....not at all. - Mon Nov  9 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I see! - Mon Nov  9 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Maybe I could help teach you sometime- out away from the Arena, so no one feels embarassed, yeah? - Mon Nov  9 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....I wouldn't be embarrassed...probably...but I'll think about it, I'm really just a shut in at the hospital. - Mon Nov  9 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It'd be nice to get a good work out. - Mon Nov  9 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Like I said, I'll think on it. - Mon Nov  9 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Of ourse, yeah. - Mon Nov  9 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rose up from her seat. "That meal was perfect, thank you for speaking with me even if I kept....zoning out. I have a lot on my mind." She sat a few bills of cash on the table for her meal and tip and then glanced over at the two cooks. "I hope you two might find me later, I would be willing to help you overcome your speech difficulties, together." A soft smile pulled at her lips as she looked back down towards Mistunara. "I should get back on duty now."* - Mon Nov  9 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ari, Hanai(KenichiMD) says: O-Oh.... - Mon Nov  9 03:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) quietly read from a book revolving around psychological and speech patterns.* - Mon Nov  9 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) lifted her head lightly to peer back at Lera as she looked over her shoulder. "A few people in the village have a problem with stuttering in their speech, I'm going to see if I can help them." She closed the book with a marker in place, "But that is boring."* - Mon Nov  9 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled softly and canted her head towards Lera as she wrapped the arm around her. "Is that so? -Your- Kiyoko?" whispering out to keep things private.* - Mon Nov  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blushed faintly and leaned her head against Lera's shoulder. "Someone made me think quite a lot earlier, about why I help people. Asked me if I do it for them only or a selfish reason to make myself feel good." She paused in thought, "Then she told me that the ones who do it only for others are self destructive." She remained quiet for a while once more, "I still decided I was the one to do it only for others."* - Mon Nov  9 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I think they meant that I will end up throwing my life away to save another. - Mon Nov  9 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...it's believable. - Mon Nov  9 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Not while I'm here you won't. - Mon Nov  9 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Perhaps you will be the one it comes to. - Mon Nov  9 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled a gentle smile and peered up at Lera for a moment and nudged her lightly, "Right."* - Mon Nov  9 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well...if you give me a moment, I need to speak to my father. - Mon Nov  9 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) closed her eyes for a moment and nodded. Soon after Lera started to walk away, Kiyoko pulled the book back out to read.* - Mon Nov  9 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) peered up from the book again, "That's odd. He was in there earlier."* - Mon Nov  9 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm...ah well, he'll turn up. - Mon Nov  9 04:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt her lips tugging up into a wide grin.* - Mon Nov  9 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Does that make someone happy?~ - Mon Nov  9 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) licked over her lips, she wanted to face Lera also but she couldn't due to her wearing a dress and all. "Yes, it really does.~"* - Mon Nov  9 04:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I got some cool ideas for it though. -- Because it can potentially be very powerful. - Mon Nov  9 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: For example. In the body, along side Tenketsu, there are pressure points. - Mon Nov  9 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: With enough precision, if you strike one, you can be pretty lethal to an opponent. - Mon Nov  9 11:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: On the pathway, there are needle-sized nodes or ciruits. - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh... but how would attacking that physically do anything? - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Basically, its what allows you to release your chakra. - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I made the comparison between Tenketsu and pressure points because -- Well. Tenketsu are metaphysical. - Mon Nov  9 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Pressure points are physical. - Mon Nov  9 11:33:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Right. So then you'd know the potential value to being able to target them. But other than Shurikenjutsu. . .Uh. - Mon Nov  9 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: I'd say Genjutsu, but that sucks as a main form of fighting. - Mon Nov  9 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...no I won't use genjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I've....seen the effects it has long term on people. - Mon Nov  9 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Hrm. Well that's all the forms. Genjutsu, Taijutsu, Kenjutsu, and Elemental Ninjutsu. - Mon Nov  9 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Well. . the main common forms. There are a bunch of non-elemental techniques, but not many people know or use them. Things like my hair attacks. - Mon Nov  9 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Long term effects on the -mind-...the worst way to kill a person....without killing them. - Mon Nov  9 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Oh yeah. But those types of genjutsu users are rare. - Mon Nov  9 11:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Hrm, I dunno. I think every shinobi could benefit from being able to use their element properly. Maybe that? - Mon Nov  9 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: The registration for becoming a shinobi had me take a test. They said I could possibly use wind. - Mon Nov  9 11:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: .... Fine then. - Mon Nov  9 13:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: E-eh? oh. - Mon Nov  9 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... sure. - Mon Nov  9 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Damn, blown off for jutsu. - Mon Nov  9 13:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) peered over to Lera, "So I learned something about you earlier."* - Mon Nov  9 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? Whats that? - Mon Nov  9 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Apparently you use fans in battle too? How .... expansive you are.~ - Mon Nov  9 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Eh fans? Who told you that? - Mon Nov  9 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Quite the shinobi. - Mon Nov  9 13:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sanoke. - Mon Nov  9 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...He's just messing with you again. I don't use fans. - Mon Nov  9 13:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Mon Nov  9 13:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Seriously? - Mon Nov  9 13:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He said if I decided to go into fans that I should ask you to teach me and everything. - Mon Nov  9 13:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ehhh. There is a girl called Marrissa who uses fans. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I mean. I can teach you Fuuton jutsu. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah I  know. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But not how to use a fan. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Weird that he said that then. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He is very good at lying. - Mon Nov  9 13:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Makes me wonder what else he has lied about. - Mon Nov  9 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh...Sanoke seems to have this idea that I can do everything. - Mon Nov  9 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its not the first time he's said something like that. - Mon Nov  9 13:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see. - Mon Nov  9 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He must look up to you quite a bit. - Mon Nov  9 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha, nah. I've never beaten him once. - Mon Nov  9 13:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He just has...low self-esteem I guess? - Mon Nov  9 13:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...that I do know about him. - Mon Nov  9 13:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm... - Mon Nov  9 13:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anywho! - Mon Nov  9 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm? - Mon Nov  9 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have been trying to decide if I should learn how to fight, and if so what type of fighting I should learn. - Mon Nov  9 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? And your thoughts so far? - Mon Nov  9 13:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well, you offered to teach me, I think? If I remember right. Marrisa offered to teach me. Sanoke, sort of did? He was trying to help me pick something and suggested small throwing weaponry. It sounded boring. I realized I do not want to do genjutsu for sure. That is the only thing I am certain of. - Mon Nov  9 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No genjutsu? Alright. Has anything piqued your interest at all? - Mon Nov  9 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.... - Mon Nov  9 13:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: A few things. - Mon Nov  9 13:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Which are? - Mon Nov  9 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Firstly, learning from you. Secondly, apparently wind element is very strong? So I guess something doing with that. Thirdly, ....there was something. I forgot. - Mon Nov  9 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) frowned with a scrunched up nose.* - Mon Nov  9 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) squinted at her as her nose wrinkles eased out. "What is it?"* - Mon Nov  9 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: That smile...so curious. - Mon Nov  9 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing~ Whats the third thing? - Mon Nov  9 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I honestly can't recall. - Mon Nov  9 14:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe it was, I would like to do something that is for protection of others also, but I guess considered shinobi? Apparently it's very...weird of me to not know how to fight. - Mon Nov  9 14:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright..uhm... - Mon Nov  9 14:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You say learn from me, but what specifically? I may not know everything but I do know a lot. - Mon Nov  9 14:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well I suppose I'd have to ask what it is you know other than swords. Course swordsmanship doesn't sound all that bad, it's on my list of posibilities. - Mon Nov  9 14:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright uh... - Mon Nov  9 14:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know...elemental ninjutsu of all five elements, genjutsu, taijutsu, some weaponry techniques, large swordsmanship and summoning. - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....all of them?? - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uh huh - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Holy hell woman. - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I like variety. - Mon Nov  9 14:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well then... - Mon Nov  9 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What does summoning do? - Mon Nov  9 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I am so not built for taijutsu. - Mon Nov  9 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: At least I don't think so. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You contract yourself to an animal and you can summon them at will. Theres a huge range, going from rats to dragons. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....dragons... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Those aren't real. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: However, once you've signed a contract... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh they are. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked at her like she was crazy.* - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I once...knew someone who could summon them. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The previous owner of my blade... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...weird... - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The summoning scroll unfortunately...was lost. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're amazing creatures, I got to see a full adult dragon up close. - Mon Nov  9 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What is it you summon? - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I summon wolves. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They make excellent scouts. - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: often sniff out trouble before it hits you - Mon Nov  9 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Saved my ass a few times...gotta admit. - Mon Nov  9 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm...interesting. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you're interested you can sign my scroll. Or you can try and find your own. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've very uncertain about all of this. - Mon Nov  9 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) turned towards Lera as best she could without putting a leg over the bench. "Tell me, what do you see me doing... fighting wise? If at all."* - Mon Nov  9 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm....I'm not sure...I can see two things really. - Mon Nov  9 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can see you using swordsmanship, but not like me. I'd see your style as being more delicate, finer in approach. Unlike mine which is more brute force. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I can also see you fighting from a distance. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Perhaps with ninjutsu, or perhaps with weaponry. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In the end though, the choice falls to you. Nobody can tell you what you want to do. - Mon Nov  9 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) closed her eyes while listening to Lera. "Are there things you can do with weapons with elements other than fans?"* - Mon Nov  9 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. - Mon Nov  9 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, there is chakra flow. - Mon Nov  9 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But other than that...I don't really know of any element specific weapons...or at least...well..actually no thats a lie. There is one...the only one of its kind. - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But can you use the Raiton element? - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no...wind. - Mon Nov  9 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah..hm.. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was mesmerized by what she showed her and continued to stare wide eyed and curious. "I think.... I think I want to do that...with a sword."* - Mon Nov  9 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A sword? - Mon Nov  9 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Is that possible? - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Hm...Just need to find someone who can teach you basic swordsmanship - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And yeah, its tecnically possible with any object. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As long as you have the chakra to do so. - Mon Nov  9 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh. - Mon Nov  9 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Thought she wanted to teach me, seems not. - Mon Nov  9 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shrugged, "I never said I wanted to use a katana. I will have to figure out what type I want to use."* - Mon Nov  9 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And it's related anyhow isn't it? - Mon Nov  9 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Well, i won't stop you if you want to use a large blade. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In some sense I suppose. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's alright that you don't want to teach me though. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The biggest differences is the weight and the range. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe, I'd love any chance to spend more time with you. I just want you to pursue a style thats right for you. - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmm... - Mon Nov  9 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced out of the corner of her eye to Lera, "You can spend as much time as you like with me, you don't need an excuse to."* - Mon Nov  9 14:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt her smile tugging at her lips, "well that's good because that's what it was."* - Mon Nov  9 14:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe....do you want to spend the night at my house? - Mon Nov  9 14:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) hummed lightly and leaned in against Lera's upper chest as she whispered with her cheek against the woman's collarbone. "You just don't know how to take it slow, do you lovely?~" A short chuckle sounding, not that she necessarily wanted to deny her the pleasure of having her over for the night but she certainly was focused on that, even a few days ago when she had been in her home it seemed as if Lera wanted her to stay.* - Mon Nov  9 14:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (Worst part. Bryson over there was Violet XDDD) - Mon Nov  9 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned pleasantly. "I suppose I can come over for the evening, and possibly... stay till morning... but no promises on.... 'activities' between this hour and now?" She peeked up to Lera with one eye and the other closed resting against her shoulder. "All fun and games if I don't give in too quickly.~"* - Mon Nov  9 14:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh yeah? We'll see, I think that you are the one in for more of a challenge. After all, I -did- sort of get you to like me as you were in the middle of telling me that you would -never- be with someone again.~ - Mon Nov  9 14:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suppose you got me there....but I have to have some victories no? - Mon Nov  9 14:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mnnn.... yes. - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The lap incident. - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, you were cute~ - Mon Nov  9 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .....right. - Mon Nov  9 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) grumbled lightly against Lera's chest.* - Mon Nov  9 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled quickly trying to get some air before she was squeezed to much. "Oh dear... hmph, no. No I am not."* - Mon Nov  9 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt warm fuzzies swarm through her body as she was pulled onto Lera's lap. "You aren't going to go flying off again are you?"* - Mon Nov  9 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not if you don't want me to. - Mon Nov  9 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hmph... I suppose it wouldn't hurt... if you enjoy it. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Just gives me a fit of nerves. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, don't worry. As long as you're touching me you won't fall. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-okay. - Mon Nov  9 14:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Fuuuucking shit. - Mon Nov  9 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay? - Mon Nov  9 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Y-yeeeeeep. - Mon Nov  9 14:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) held on tightly with a vice grip.* - Mon Nov  9 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, don't be nervous. Once you get used to it, its rather pleasent actually. - Mon Nov  9 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Greetings. - Mon Nov  9 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....a-are we just... - Mon Nov  9 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are we just going to sit here? - Mon Nov  9 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm. Well, we can fly around a bit if you want. - Mon Nov  9 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I thought you were just going to take me to your house...but... s-sure? - Mon Nov  9 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Mon Nov  9 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You enjoy torturing me. - Mon Nov  9 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nearly screamed but instead ended up squeaking.* - Mon Nov  9 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Oh jeez. - Mon Nov  9 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shhh, don't worry. You won't fall. - Mon Nov  9 15:08:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How am I ever going to fight if I can't even take a bit of heights? - Mon Nov  9 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was pretty freaked out but doing her best to enjoy it. "It's... certainly something, I'm just a little new to, well.... adventure?" She gave a nervous laugh and glanced to Lera.* - Mon Nov  9 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) screamed out, "HOLY FUCK!" Trying her best to scramble to grip Lera more closely. As her eyes moved away from their hands and her grip on her companion she looked into those amber eyes of Lera's with her auburn set. She stopped breathing for a moment before her lungs hitched and she inhaled sharply. Her eyes flicking back and forth as she seemed to calm some just by looking at her.* - Mon Nov  9 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) still held on rather tight to the female as they descended. When they had reached the inside of the house. Kiyoko was panting at quite a steady pace. Sucking at her lower lip she then quickly leaned in with an intent to lock her lips with Lera's own. Sucking and tugging gently at her bottom lip with lust for a good ten seconds before pulling away with a gasp and rubbing her lips together while slowly raising her eye lids to look down to Lera.* - Mon Nov  9 15:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's lips parted as she tried to explain and only moved her lips soundlessly as she panted. Her fingers came up and touched her temple before making some awkward gestures and then she just forced herself to go walk over to Lera's couch and peer over to the woman. "I.... got ahead of myself?"* - Mon Nov  9 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh, me... catching someone like you by surprise. - Mon Nov  9 15:33:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh....I guess I'll have to be on my guard from now huh. - Mon Nov  9 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) leaned in so that her breath was brushing over Lera's bottom lip, whispering out, "And here I thought, you'd be torturing me.~"* - Mon Nov  9 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned gently at the bite as her eyes fluttered shut. Once her eyes had reopened she looked at Lera with foggy vision, "and how do you suggest we do that? Mn?"* - Mon Nov  9 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: ...oh...fuck. - Mon Nov  9 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled sharply and slowly moved back on the couch as if to put some space between her and her temptation, as well as to get a very long good look at Lera. A desperate moan sounded under her breath as she wheezed a breath out.* - Mon Nov  9 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Nngn....why. - Mon Nov  9 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down hard on her bottom lip and after a extended look at Lera she closed her eyes and forced her head to turn away. "O-ouh.... you... y-you are... ngngn..." Gasping out heavily, "I didn't think you would go so far. You -really- did mean torture."* - Mon Nov  9 15:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) kept her eyes shut tight as she shook from the adrenaline and arousal. Panting heavily as she tried to keep them under control. "W-woah woah...no need to ... yeah...just..." She was losing her words. "Fucking hell."* - Mon Nov  9 16:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: This woman is going to be the end of me. - Mon Nov  9 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed heavily and then peeked out to the woman's form, trying to appear as if her eyes were still closed. "Will you not end this until you have had me?"* - Mon Nov  9 16:06:24 2015
