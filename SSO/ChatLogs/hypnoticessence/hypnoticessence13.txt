Sitting down across from Akira but remaining close she poured him some tea but allowed him to get his own sugars and creams. After she had poured tea for both of them she poured a little bit of regular cream into her tea, just a hint, and then one little cube of sugar.* - Mon Nov 16 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) took out a perscription pad and wrote out something in doctor handwriting that was hard to read. "This is for your anxiety, when you start to get the shakes take -one-, and one only. It is xanax to help you calm down, it will work in around ten minutes so that's pretty fast to stop the shakes." She then took a sip of tea and looked the boy over. "Would you like to talk about what upsets you?"* - Mon Nov 16 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shook her head, "I'm a silly little nurse girl who is marrying the Kazekage's daughter, you think I don't have 'petty little things' to talk about too? Everything is important to me."* - Mon Nov 16 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I miss them a lot...walking into a house and having no one greet you is hard. - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just wish I could see them one last time, y'know? - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just to say goodbye. - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The next thing would be...well... - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm a very lonely person...I have no friends...at all. - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just want someone to talk to...like we're talking now... - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded slowly and thought what he said over. "I understand but you know that isn't possible to see them again. As for you being so lonely... you have me to talk to but you should work on making friends. Are you going to be staying here permanently? And Rias is your friend right?"* - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I want to go back to Konoha some day... - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And i'm not sure if Rias wants to be friends with me anymore... - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Things are so hard with her, I don't what to do or say half the time. - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It all changed for us when I told her how I felt about her, now it just confusing to be around her. - Mon Nov 16 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Half the time she's holding hands with me, not really minding my advances. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Other times I just feel like she wants me gone for good. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Its even harder when I feel like this about her and she tells me she doesn't want a relationship of any kind with anyone. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Make new friends. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think it would be wise to move on from Rias. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It seems like she is stringing you along. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But I don't want to hurt her...and without her then I truly have nothing. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If she wants to be your friend then she will come to you. - Mon Nov 16 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just ...don't go to her first. - Mon Nov 16 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think its all my fault really... - Mon Nov 16 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think she wants to be friends...but finds it hard because she knows I want to be more than friends. - Mon Nov 16 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then you need to stay away from her for a bit. - Mon Nov 16 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I've been trying but...its just hard because i've never felt like this about anyone before. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think I might just try a different approach, leave all my feelings to the side for now and just be friends with her. - Mon Nov 16 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't know...I need to do something. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But you really should make new friends. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Now then. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The drinking, have you drank any? - Mon Nov 16 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No...not yet. - Mon Nov 16 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess i've just been too worried about stuff to drink for the moment. - Mon Nov 16 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean...I have some on me right now...but thats just to reassure myself. - Mon Nov 16 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...give it to me. - Mon Nov 16 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And you don't say 'not yet' you say no, not ever. - Mon Nov 16 04:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But what? - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You don't reassure yourself you aren't going to drink by carrying it on you. - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You don't have it around you, at all. - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Didn't I tell you to pour them all out? - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mmmm... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine fine... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked at the scroll and then unsealed whatever alcohol was in there and went to the sink to begin pouring it down the drain.* - Mon Nov 16 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) didn't hate the kid but she was dissapointed in him. After she had poured it out she threw the stuff in the trash but brought his scroll back to him and sat it down in front of him.* - Mon Nov 16 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Do you understand? - Mon Nov 16 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's okay because we are going to fix your problem, right? - Mon Nov 16 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...probably. - Mon Nov 16 04:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You uh...never told me your name by the way... - Mon Nov 16 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I didn't? - Mon Nov 16 04:51:50 2015
