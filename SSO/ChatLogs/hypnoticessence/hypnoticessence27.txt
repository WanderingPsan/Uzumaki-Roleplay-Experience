<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pulled on some gloves and stepped up to the boy, she also flashed on her sensing ability to see if any of his chakra network was in jeopardy and what have you. She was pretty much examining everything to see what was wrong and what needed to be done to him.* - Mon Dec  7 23:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes as she examined him, "HOLY SHI---" slapping a hand over her mouth to stop her curse. She was in utter shock at what was going on with his body, she looked him over and then sighed out. "Okay... well it's good that they didn't put your shoulder back in place. If they had, you'd have an even worse break and be in more pain... It looks like it's been about ten days since whatever did this? Your scapular is broken as well as your collar bone is detached and severed. You are going to need corrective surgery several times to make them work again and then we can pop your arm back in places. This means you are likely going to be drugged for an extended period of time. Because of that, you are going to need severe physical therapy, mental therapy, and you will likely become addicted to the pain  medication so there will be a trial of rehabilitation after the surgeries have finished and you come off the medications." She sighed out and shook her head.

"Overall you are looking at a total of two years recovery and surgeries before you can even think about doing a D rank mission, and after that a few more years of pain and aches occasionally to get used to it. This shoulder and arm are never going to be the same though in terms of fuction and mobility."* - Mon Dec  7 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) called for a nurse and they gave him a heavy sedation to have his body numb to the pain. "I need to get things in order but we can do the surgery in a few hours."* - Mon Dec  7 23:55:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out and looked back towards Mitsunara, "no... I should go alone, I'll see you later Mitsunara, I'll call you back after I have the first treatment ready." She glanced back up to Koji, "alright let's go..."* - Wed Dec  9 00:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pursed her lips some at the words Koji said but followed after the two officers. "Did someone other than Sanoke come to you about this? I figured Sanoke or the Kirigakure people who knew the boy would have reported it after I reported it to Sanoke but this seems a little bit severe? It sounds like rumors are spreading by what you just said..." she was a bit worrisome, this could hurt her private practice professionally.* - Wed Dec  9 00:38:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And I didn't kill this boy, I went to go prepare for the surgery, when I came back he had killed himself. - Wed Dec  9 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Uh? There won't be na genjutsu interrogation test. - Wed Dec  9 00:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I-i just want to say how silly it is I keep getting interrogated when that girl Zenaki would take people off alone to her house to help and they were never seen again. - Wed Dec  9 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No one questioned her. Hmph, I even reported it. - Wed Dec  9 00:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: After permission from Sanoke. - Wed Dec  9 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...His companion did not 'flee'. - Wed Dec  9 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He left to go back to Kirigakure which was what was planned. - Wed Dec  9 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The boy was to stay here for me to treat over several months to years. - Wed Dec  9 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Which Sanoke approved. - Wed Dec  9 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .....it was a lethal wound..what the fuck? - Wed Dec  9 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was starting to get rather upset, this was bullshit.* - Wed Dec  9 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I told him the possible outcomes of the surgeries and then I left. - Wed Dec  9 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: They were? - Wed Dec  9 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: All I can assume is that he got upset and killed himself from the outcome statitics. - Wed Dec  9 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Very bad... - Wed Dec  9 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He would be a hunchback at best. - Wed Dec  9 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: At worst he'd lose his arm, shoulder, and be unable to do hardly anything on his own. - Wed Dec  9 01:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...his injuries SHOW he killed himself. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Someone would have had to force him to do it with his own hands to make it look like suicide. - Wed Dec  9 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Simple. - Wed Dec  9 01:31:44 2015
