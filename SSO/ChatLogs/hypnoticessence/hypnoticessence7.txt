<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had a concussion still so she was getting pretty irritated at the moment at whoever this girl was. Grumbling to herself she started to wheel herself with her stitched up arms, pulling at the stitches and making them almost to the point of snapping open but she didn't care, even as the pain quaked through her she just wanted to get away from this woman before she said something too drastic she couldn't come back from all because of a stupid concussion.* - Thu Nov 12 00:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) couldn't move even with one hand on the wheelchair to stop her. She stopped struggling and grit her teet. "She thought I was trying to say you aren't good enough which isn't at all what I was saying. She assumed that I would rather you be gone but you know me, I'm not like that, I want everyone to have a chance to be healed and helped... to take that away even for a day to prove a point or to test you is a waste of our resources and your abilities." She closed her eyes tightly as her head began to pound, "we do have a lot of medics but just like what happened with me, the medic who was seriously hurt... no other medic from the village was around...that will happen but the more of us there are and actively walking around not off in the desert being a hermit! Then that means that much more assistance and life saving." She huffed heavily as sweat filmed over her skin, she couldn't help how worked up she gotten and Bryson knew this by the things she had told him yesterday... at least she hoped he understood what a concussion was.* - Thu Nov 12 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had already taking all her medications necessary for the day up to this point. She shook her head and wouldn't take the healing pill, "I have everything I need Bryson... after all I am a trained nurse... but apparently that's not enough for -some people-.... " She shot a glare over at Ai. "I'll just have to remember that whenever I might find her hurt and afraid with you not around." This was very unlike Kiyoko, of course Bryson might realize that, Aza -certainly- would realize that. When he pulled her back towards the bench she felt something in her head just snap and she panted heavily a few times trying to calm herself from shouting. This concussion was really breaking her in all honesty... "Let.... Aza...take me..." She paused then added on knowing Bryson probably would protest, "He isn't going to hurt me..."* - Thu Nov 12 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ....? I've never said you're not enough...If you want to take it like that then that's all on you... - Thu Nov 12 01:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out as she began to ignore Bryson and spoke out to Mitsunara, "Mitsunara, if Bryson attempts to stop us, please hold him back." She looked up to Aza and saw the blood on his hands from cutting himself with the wheelchair. "Yeah the hospital, we can have our session after some tea, I need to cool off after this whole thing." She had realized what calmed Aza and it was noted, she would remember that as a tool to help him. Kiyoko would also remember the insult by Bryson claiming he was the doctor and not her.* - Thu Nov 12 02:39:34 2015

She nodded to what Aza said and allowed him to pick her up. She looked back towards Mitsunara was, she didn't know what a necromancer was but apparently that's what the girl was and it meant she was 'evil' in some sense. "Thank you Mitsunara, I will repay you for this."* - Thu Nov 12 03:03:28 2015

"It seems my stitches are doing okay but we can go into a room and I can patch you up."* - Thu Nov 12 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) tensed at each step but made it alright for the most part due to how strong he was and able to hold her as stable as was possible walking up stairs. "Just the first one, I really want to sit down."* - Thu Nov 12 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reached across the bed to the table where a few emergency supplies sat like they did in all the rooms.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wrinkled her nose, "at least let me cover it with a bandage so that you don't get blood everywhere?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then took an alcohol swab that would sting a bit and tried to clean his palm of the blood and bacteria, if he hadn't jerked away from that, she would then move to place a gauze patch over it and then wrap it in stretchy gauze to keep it in place. "All good."* - Thu Nov 12 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked down at herself and then around the room, "I sort of look like a raggedy anne. You know those red headed yarn dolls with face paint exagerated and their silly dresses and stitches to hold them together? I certainly feel like a raggedy anne. Plus you had to carry me and I keep having to get taken around by other people. So I'm a raggedy anne." She chuckled, "at least I find it funny."* - Thu Nov 12 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stuck her tongue out at him, "no fun. I think you should try to have a little more fun and make humor out of the bad things. It might help you out." She leaned back against the hospital pillow for a moment, "it's nice to be hiding out from others for now... lots of quiet except for two voices speaking." She didn't admit she just likes the smell and tiny clicking noises of monitors of the hospital.* - Thu Nov 12 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thought about earlier, "hey what was that thing Bryson  tried to use on us? Do you know? It didn't do anything to me." She wondered if Aza knew, she already had sort of deduced what it was but it hadn't effected her because she was pure, perhaps Aza knowing this might make him happy or even encourage him to trust her more. * - Thu Nov 12 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled deeply and then blinked a few times, "Oh right..yeah...sure we can go find the spa. Does Suna have a spa though? I wasn't sure...

It's not like I can get in the bath's I probably would get something else done... I can't get in the sauna either because my concussion... hm... the only other things are really girly, I don't do those unless I have to. I guess you are right, have you eaten?" She smiled warmly over to him.* - Thu Nov 12 05:08:54 2015

Probably help me get better with everything that is in it and it's heavy enough it's considered an endulgence! At least for me.~" She smiled wide and then sat the menu down, "Maybe some mineral soda for once too."* - Thu Nov 12 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thought on what he might like, "do you like meaty things or light things? Or uhmmmmm sweet things? Or tart things, or bitter things, or or toasty things?" She was feeling silly currently since the middle of the hospital stay so that was likely due to her concussion as well since Kiyoko wasn't all that silly of a person normally.* - Thu Nov 12 06:24:00 2015

She had been able to tell he went from being very goofy and nice to serious and quiet. "I suppose we will just have to start again in a few days then.~ Only got a couple of days left after all." She took up her chopsticks and already was picking up her hot and sour soup to bring the small bowl to her lips as she used the chopsticks to guide the small bits of meat and crunchy fried noodles to her mouth.* - Thu Nov 12 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sat her bowl down with the chopsticks resting within and leaned forward to peer up at him through the base of the hood.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) finished off the bowl of food and then spotted a piece of the steak covered in sauce on his plate and leaned over to steal a piece. "Because I am your friend."

You should eat too, mister. Or at least drink the tea, it's good for you." She looked at his plate of food with wonder in her eyes and dug in, his was much more tasty but a lot more unhealthy. "Nah, I won't stay away."* - Thu Nov 12 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled genuinely, "Because I'm stubborn about people I care for and their safety.~" She continued to eat but soon her belly ached from how much she had consumed. "You could worry a lot less if you just stopped trying to get me to leave you be and just accepted I am your friend and I'm going to help you the best I can."* - Thu Nov 12 07:35:40 2015
