<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's hands were shaking as she reached out to take her tea cup and drink from it. She was getting rather upset by all of this but was trying to be as kind as possible, all things considered she was holding her own pretty well since she had been under such distress lately and hoped that this conversation would ease her mind rather than upset her.

"I am what is referred to as pansexual.... I do not become attracted to a person because of their body... their attractiveness...their voice...their smell... rather I am attracted to their personality. I do not care what gender a person is or if they are ugly, scarred, beautiful, a priest, or anything else that most people take into consideration. I fell in love with Lera's personality and thus she became beautiful to me and I began to see someone I wanted to spend my life with. See with a sexuality such as this I only see people who I feel I might eventually marry, because of this any relationships in my past have been very short because the instant something is seen that I do not want in the person I will marry, I leave them. It is a waste of time to spend my precious love on them if I do not see myself marrying them." * - Fri Nov 20 09:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are saying that you can commit sins just because someone else is evil..... - Fri Nov 20 09:56:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes they do but what you are saying is that its okay for the person who is suppose to be the least sinful of all, a priest, to commit sin. - Fri Nov 20 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: You have to repent for your sins to be saved - Fri Nov 20 09:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And repenting even if you know you are commiting a sin in the process means it's okay? - Fri Nov 20 09:57:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Reguardless if I sin or not I will repent becasue you repent to be saved.  As a human its impossible not to sin as you are born into it therefore the repent... to say that a sinning priest is  bad is to say that  the sun shining is bad - Fri Nov 20 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know it's not possible not to sin but you are saying it's okay to sin and hate because you will just repent later, that in itself corrupts your repentance. - Fri Nov 20 10:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Such as that little girl? - Fri Nov 20 10:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I would like a large amount of fabric made into some...special clothing. While that doesn't sound hard, I want to know if its possible to make this fabric similar to armour. Strong and durable, yet still flexible. - Fri Nov 20 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Obviously. It would probably be impossible to make something so thin as strong as genuine armour. - Fri Nov 20 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But every little bit helps right? - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Durable cloth. . . Do-able I suppose. I'd assume this is your desire so that you can avoid being slowed down, right? - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That and I don't paticularly like armour. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And if you have time then I could put in an order I guess. - Fri Nov 20 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I wanted to make a little more money first. - Fri Nov 20 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stared of course but flushed faintly in silence, nearly choking on her tea.* - Fri Nov 20 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) leaned over towards Lera and whispered, "how are you affording all this and the wedding?"* - Fri Nov 20 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sounds reasonable. - Fri Nov 20 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll give you an extra hundred thousand for spiked knuckles on those gauntlets. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'll see how much more that'll cost me. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure thing. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just on a random note....i'd like it to be red... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The gauntlet I mean. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kind of like a deep crimson. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope thats about it. When i get more money i'll have more of that cloth made though. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'll have Kiyoko's clothes made from it... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: All of that includes the Kukiri set's? - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It seems like so much stuff... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Oh no, the Kuriki Set would probably cost like six-hundred grand per. Lera can afford it, sure enough. - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh.. the big set is the same? - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: After paying that is. - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked a few times at what Lera said and stared down at the table shifting her spoon for her tea.* - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Plenty enough to build a house befitting Kiyoko... - Fri Nov 20 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Most likely. <@Kiyoko> - Fri Nov 20 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, Thats about everything. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just give me a time when you want to examine the weapon. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind when. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. Sure, I'll see you later Marco. - Fri Nov 20 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) finished off her tea and looked over to Lera, she was sort of out of it.* - Fri Nov 20 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Wh-wha I can't take this! - Fri Nov 20 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Oh but you must. - Fri Nov 20 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why? - Fri Nov 20 15:05:23 2015
