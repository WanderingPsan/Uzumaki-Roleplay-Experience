<br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) grumbled a bit and leaned back, "Not this kind of getting used to... it isn't reacting anymore."* - Fri Dec 11 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Ah... so. - Fri Dec 11 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Guess.. come back tommorow, yeah? - Fri Dec 11 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... - Fri Dec 11 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) went to her station and went through the process of washing several sets of gears and sterilizing them. Once she had finished cleaning all the gear she put each item back to it's respective place and pulled on a single set. Once she was geared up she turned to spot Mitsunara and waved her over with a gloved hand. "Heya, just working on the next chemical, Hoseki is over in the play pen if you wanna say hello." 

She turned back around and settled down onto the stool as she pulled out several new hydrogen compounds that were inactive, she also took out a few special chemicals and minerals she had gathered from various plants, roots, rocks, sand, and the mines. She was going to be testing each one to see what she could create to use in this project. Making several vial set ups for the various compounds and went to carefully add the mixtures together as she liquified, heated, melted, and otherwise morphed the various materials to make them turn to liquid form for the compound. A few didn't work so she tossed them out, for instance the sand simply turned to glass... 

She had about five different compounds, which she put all of them into the vortex mixer with stoppers tightly sealing them. Hitting a few buttons it began to whiz about in a circle with a soft hum as she stood up and sighed out. Walking over towards Mitsunara and standing on her tip toes after pulling her face mask down and kissing the woman on the cheek. "How you feeling? Any headaches?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) || The five compounds finished and she brought them over to the table and sat them all out on a tray beside Mitsunara. "So I want to do these five in your right eye... if you are willing to switch eyes? We can work back and forth, it seems like your left eye is doing okay sight wise, yeah?" She pulled the cap off the first compound and waited for Mitsunara's consent. If she agreed to the right eye then she would part the upper and lower lid and drip two drops into a spot that wasn't directly over her pupil.* - Fri Dec 11 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then recorded the reaction but it was a weak one. She took up the next compound and dripped two drops but within a matter of minutes, Mitsunara was going to begin feeling a migraine settling in. The dilation was extreme and was exactly the result that Kiyo wanted but it had a bad side effected added on. For now it would be bad enough that the flouresent lights in the room would feel too bright to handle as Kiyo tried to examine her eye closely to get all the information she needed. "How you feeling?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Shit... - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) went to the cabinets and then shut off the lights so there was only a low light on the counter from a lamp and she brought back a paper cup of water and two pain killers, extra strength.* - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Guess that means you don't want to continue for now huh? - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: I'm game, yeah.... if you are, anyway. - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: That can't really get much worse, neh? - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you okay with me doing the left eye then? I don't want to irritate the right eye. - Fri Dec 11 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Sure. - Fri Dec 11 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then took up the next dropper and lifted and lowered her bottom and upper lid on the left eye and dripped two drops into her eye. This one was from the mining minerals compounds she had found. As it went into her eye she could only see light dilation and sighed out softly at it's reaction. "Okay, no waiting...going to do the next one." She took up the next one and dripped two drops from a vial that was made from a fungi mushroom variety from the wild. When she saw the better reaction from this she noted it down in her notes and ran a few tests on Mitsunara before stepping back and starting to clean up.* - Fri Dec 11 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) did the very last one which was from a variety of herbal plants she had found. Ta da.* - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
