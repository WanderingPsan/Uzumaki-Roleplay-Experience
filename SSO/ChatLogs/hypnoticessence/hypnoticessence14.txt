<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Tetsumi might not mind training me. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Surprised Bryson hasn't said anything to me... after all I'm walking, no bruises, no crazy talk, just stitches.... and we argued last time we saw each other. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hey, that's true. - Mon Nov 16 07:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had glanced from the corner of her eye towards Bryson.* - Mon Nov 16 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) turned her head towards Bryson and looked him over with a soft smile. "it's alright Bryson, you didn't mean any harm only help but it was just a bit much for me. I'm not used to others taking care of me, and you have nothing to worry about from Aza now. He's all fixed up, he just took a test even!"* - Mon Nov 16 07:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thought about it but she never had even gotten to meet Regual or Zephria. "Well actually...it's kind of like I was made head of the hospital but I know that doesn't matter to you since you are a priest... I'm also training Mirai here to become a nurse." She smiled warmly, "I've been doing a lot of psychologist work too, even got my own office in the hospital. It seems like Zenaki keeps to her own agenda but then again she is...Zenaki...and pregnant."* - Mon Nov 16 07:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rose a brow at the fact Byrson was considered the head of a -scientific- hospital. She didn't make a comment though and simply looked him over, "I think you should just let it go, it's not really for you. Are you a rank in the temple or something?" Then she noticed Hassan out of the corner of her eye and a bright smile came over her visage. "Lord Kazekage! Guess what?! I fixed Aza's control! We did a social test and he passed and soon we are going to do the fighting test! You can get rid of the timer!"* - Mon Nov 16 07:30:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I will, I keep in constant contact with the temple about my developments...  They kinda just gave me the title becasue I was the only useful "medic" here... No one  really focused on healing as medic... I was alittle disappointed - Mon Nov 16 07:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right. - Mon Nov 16 07:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her lip and looked through the list, when the lady came over she was still looking and some of the drinks sounded dangerous! Stuff like 'hurricaines' and shit like that. She then pointed at the 'Desert Rose', "Is that good?" She asked in wonder and bit down on her lip again. The lady told her about it and she nodded, "Okay two of those I guess." Sitting the menu down again. Soon after the lady returned with the two dark pink drinks, they were a mix of cactus fruit juice, vodka, light rum, and some sour and sweet sugar around the rim of the glass to make your lips pucker.* - Mon Nov 16 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flushed gently, "Well I am a girl!" Sticking her tongue out at him afterwards. She took a sip from the straw and then widened her eyes and puckered at how sour the salt was that had ended up in some of the drink. "It's so sour, and sweet...gah, what is that other thing...that must be the alcohol." She had a crazy reaction but really it tasted amazing by alcoholic mixed drink standards.* - Mon Nov 16 08:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) didn't even understand what a boubon was but shrugged. When he spoke up about missing Nari she sat her drink down and sighed out, "It's going to be okay Aza-san, I promise."* - Mon Nov 16 08:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reached across the table and placed her hand atop his own, "You will find that again okay?" She smiled warmly in her little motherly way before pulling her hand back. She giggled at his little pun about the rose and then took another sip with a contorted face from the sourness.* - Mon Nov 16 08:38:49 2015
