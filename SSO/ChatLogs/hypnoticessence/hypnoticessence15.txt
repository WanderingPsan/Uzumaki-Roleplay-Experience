She headed out of the room to scrub up and nurses would be coming back to get Nina atop the bed to roll it out to the surgical area.*)* - Tue Nov 17 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was already waiting in the surgical room all cleaned up and covered in surgical paper and robes with a mask, gloves, and such. As Nina was rolled in on the bed before Kiyoko and then the nurse on the other side of the table put Nina to sleep so that they could work without causing her pain. After the girl was put under, Kiyo cut all the stitches up and then opened the girl's arm up with some vices to hold it in place.

Taking up some small tools and focusing the overhead light, Kiyo leaned forward wishing she had Mirai here to assist her honestly. She slowly began to cut the muscle away that covered up the nerve bundle at the base of her shoulder cap and then exposed the nerve bundle at her elbow. These were the two main problem points that needed work. 

Starting at the shoulder cuff she used a scalpel and medical tweezers to seperate the nerve bundles to find the flaw within. Kiyo slowly began to slice away at the nerves until she had cut away the section that needed to be removed. This was an extremely delicate process and she was having to scrape away parts of the nervous system that had died off in the attack. After she had managed to finish the top section she moved to the bottom and did the same. 

Luckily for Nina, Kiyo had fully healed by now and was able to use her healing ability. Forming handseals with her blood soaked gloved hands she started to heal the interior of the area so that it was closed up and forming new strands of nerves to be healthy and retain feeling in the limb. Eventually she closed up the arm with stitches and then healed it over but left the stitches in place so that the arm wouldn't open back up again.* - Tue Nov 17 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wasn't happy with the results... in the end she had tested the arm and it was dead, needing to be amputated but she had to inform the girl first. As the sleepiness would wear off, Nina would be awakened with her arm fully bandaged. "Nina...I...I have some bad news," they wouldn't be back in the room where Nina was to rest but still in the surgical room so that they could amputate immediately.* - Tue Nov 17 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rubbed her lips together and brushed Nina's hair out of her face knowing the girl was groggy, she had removed her gloves of course. Kiyo had asked everyone to leave the room for now so that she could speak with the child alone, "The thing is the surgery didn't go as planned... I tried my best but nothing could be done about the nervous system issues and because of that your arm has lost feeling entirely. For you to leave this hospital we would have to amputate your arm or you could end up dying from infection when the cells begin to eat at the muscle tissue. I'm -very very- sorry, Nina-san."* - Tue Nov 17 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) tried to stop Nina and held onto her shoulders, "listen... if you walk out that door and leave the hospital you will end up dying from infection.. We can get you a protestic to replace your arm, even maybe make it so it can channel chakra eventually. It's not over, okay? You are very young, it would be hard to get you a real arm transplant but maybe when you are an adult, we have to amputate, Nina-san."* - Tue Nov 17 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was far from fast enough to avoid the slash and her chest was cut open making her breath leave her chest for a moment. "Ughh..." blood quickly seeping out of her chest as she tried to grip the small girl's wrist and tried to force her to release the scalpel but all things considered Nina was normally much stronger than Kiyoko so it was going to end up being a struggle back and forth with the scalpel in hand rather than having it released to the floor. "Nina-san please calm down?!"* - Tue Nov 17 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) could see the intent in Nina's eyes. As the girl fell, Kiyo gripped Nina's fist holding the scalpel and forced her hand to twist to that the stabbing motion rotated back towards Nina's own chest in the hard thrust. Kiyo was really only trying to protect herself and Nina was falling while going crazy with a scalpel... It happened in mere seconds as she fell and it ended up lodged in Nina's heart if she didn't have a way to stop it from happening during all the commotion in the few seconds time. Kiyo hadn't even realized what she did at first, staring wide eyed down with tears already cascading down her cheeks.* - Tue Nov 17 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) swallowed hard and then shook her head as she started to whisper, "no no no no no no..." crouching down and holding the girl's body as she started to cry desperately and begged for Nina to come back. She checked all her vitals but it was obvious that Nina was gone. She had just killed someone for the first time and indeed it had been to save her own life...but it still was blood on her hands.* - Tue Nov 17 06:36:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her lip at what Aza said and that only made her cry harder as she held onto his arm while he was wiping her tears like a little girl practically. "It's okay, Lord Kazekage wouldn't have me killed without Lera being aware first... I think. She is just worried about what happened, let her talk... and I need out of these clothes if I'm going to feel normal at all...yeah?" She was shaking some from the shock still being present but she was doing a little better from what Aza said.* - Tue Nov 17 08:08:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled a bit more cheerfully now, "A flower girl takes a basket of flowers and when she's walking down the aisle before the best man and people like that before the bride comes down aisle. You drop flower petals all along the aisle as you walk and then you get to stand up at the front with all the important people for that day. Plus you get to wear a pretty dress.~"* - Wed Nov 18 08:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hm? - Wed Nov 18 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked to be in a better mood as she stood but of course things like killing your would be flower girl didn't settle well in your psychy.* - Wed Nov 18 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked into the office and turned on the flute musice before sitting at the desk, she only had one guard outside since Aza had control over his anger now for the most part. "Alright this will be a free speaking session so you can just go ahead and talk about whatever it is you need to speak about."* - Wed Nov 18 08:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why do you think I was talking to Izanami and Kuro. - Wed Nov 18 08:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Eh. . .I dunno. . .I'm having a hard time keeping up with everything. - Wed Nov 18 08:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: What are the odds you guys have some magic medicine that stops dreaming. . .? - Wed Nov 18 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I can stop dreams with normal medicine but it makes it so your sleep is drug induced. Won't feel all that great. - Wed Nov 18 08:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah she has to pick her own, I don't know who she will have but I think she is going to wear a white suite so we are going to be very opposite with me in a dress and men for groomsmen and her with bridesmaids and a tux. - Wed Nov 18 08:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked Marrisa over but the signs she was exhibiting were not that of a common cold but that of something else entirely. Kiyo frowned gently and started to check Marrisa's vitals and it seemed her immune system was down. "Marrisa, I'm going to just run a test real quick for a few things." She tested a few of the more common scientifist tests by touching different parts of Marrisa's neck, chest, back, and then belly but found nothing that sent off alarm. Then she flashed on her sensing ability and frowned heavily. Pulling Marrisa off to the side and whispered to the woman.* - Wed Nov 18 10:06:43 2015
