<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Soooooo. - Mon Nov 23 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: What should I teach you this time... - Mon Nov 23 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Whatever you'd like.~ - Mon Nov 23 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hrmmmmm. - Mon Nov 23 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright...I'll show you how to make a bigger gust of wind. - Mon Nov 23 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Wooo. - Mon Nov 23 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Bigger wind. - Mon Nov 23 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched the display but hadn't seen the handseals since Lera turned away. When the woman came behind her she looked down at where her hands were located and inhaled slightly. "So... can you show me those handseals again? I don't think I caught them." She already was breathing in deeply and exhaling out heavily as she got her lungs stretching and practicing taking large inhales.* - Mon Nov 23 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched the handseals and mimicked them two seconds after Lera's each movement. Once her chakra was beginning to develop she inhaled deeply with her breast expanding outwards towards Lera's wrists and then she breathed out a gust of wind. There was chakra but most of it seemed to come out in nothing big and wasn't formed all that well for pushing away from her position but rather simply blowing some sand over the surface of the land.* - Mon Nov 23 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's heart was speeding up as Lera placed her hands beneath her breasts. She formed the handseals again and then inhaled deeply as she took in air until her lungs ached. Chakra channeled through the air in her lungs and then she began to blow it out in a way that just kept going. The wind being blown out was much bigger this time but swished like a blade than it did a gust. 

Grumbling she formed the handseals again and inhaled deeply to the point she felt dizzy. "Erg..." she inhaled deeply again and then exhaled out a large gust, this time the top few layers of sand was picked up and thrown across the desert towards the housing district below.* - Mon Nov 23 17:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Much better~ - Mon Nov 23 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped in shock and groaned lightly as Lera pulled away. "Ngng... s-sure, if that's what you want."* - Mon Nov 23 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pursed her lips some, at least it was a defensive move that she needed to learn. She held up her hands in a defensive manner and whent he punch came her way she tried to palm strike it. She missed and nearly tripped over herself but then had to try again. She practiced this several times and soon enough she was striking the wrist away and avoiding the hit every time as the training continued. By this point she had built up a sweat from the heat outside and her movements.* - Mon Nov 23 17:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright...and when you redirect a strike....you counter it like this! - Mon Nov 23 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked a few times at what she just did. She didn't think she could ever do this to a real person but nodded once. She shifted accordingly and then did the misdirect first and then the throat strike. She tried it a few times to get the hang of it and then shook her head out in pain. "Nngn... I don't think taijutsu is really my thing," regardless she had gotten it down.* - Mon Nov 23 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its good to know a little bit of everything...just in case~ - Mon Nov 23 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyways, you're looking pretty sweaty there hun~ - Mon Nov 23 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) grumbled and pulled back, "don't do thaaat." She flushed a deep red, "it's because you are making me jump around and everything."* - Mon Nov 23 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped and jumped as she rubbed her cheek where it was pinched. "H-hey, we are suppose to be training!" Her voice cracking lightly in distress.* - Mon Nov 23 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) kissed her deeply with a light scream. "Mngngng?!" She groaned gently and then gasped for air after she was released. "Y-yeah, training."* - Mon Nov 23 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked a few times as she watched the shuriken. "Isn't that chakra flow making that happen? I probably should learn chakra flow first."* - Mon Nov 23 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sort of Yeah, but this is more...hnn...guiding the shuriken with wind rather than strengthening it. - Mon Nov 23 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But Chakra flow first. Okay~ - Mon Nov 23 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked a few times as she was handed the tanto. It felt heavier than she thought for it's size and she held it carefully by the hilt.* - Mon Nov 23 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out as she watched. she was not all that comfortable with the tanto but it wasn't so bad. She needed to get used to using weapons and this was the only way how. She began to flow her chakra through her body and into her arms and then up into the blade. Wind swished but nothing that was forming a flow over the blade. She hissed gently and then felt a slicing at the back of her hand as she didn't control her chakra correctly and blood began to spill. "I'm fine..." muttered out knowing Lera would probably panic.

She closed her eyes and flowed more chakra out, taking power over her control and the wind element within her body. It circled about the blade and she recieved a few more cuts with groans of anquish as she continued to try and flow her chakra out and over the blade. The spinning about the blade like a tornado began to take form and instead of flowing in a circle it channeled up the blade and away into a point. She could feel it beginning to take form...

Swallowing hard as her hands shook from the cuts, Kiyoko found herself taking a deep breath and then flowed more control over the blade as it eventually was humming the metal from how quickly the wind was going over the edge and face of the weapon. "O-oh myyy..."* - Mon Nov 23 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) released the chakra and dropped the blades as her fingers spread out and she looked at her bleeding hands. "Nng... no... I can't heal myself, I doubt Bryson will want to help me."* - Mon Nov 23 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: .... - Mon Nov 23 18:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) is carried while holding her hands out away from the two of them. Several cuts were over her hands and they were dripping blood pretty regularly.* - Mon Nov 23 18:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out as he healed her and then she turned on the sink and started to rinse and then wash her hands before drying them. "Thank you, Bryson."* - Mon Nov 23 18:41:42 2015

As soon as she got close to the group, she slowed down and kept to a semi safe distance, closer than Aza probably wanted her to be...but far enough she wasn't going to be a target.* - Mon Nov 23 21:31:31 2015

"That's kind of you to say... but if I hadn't messed up the surgery... she would have an arm and she wouldn't have attacked me. I failed in the surgery and it had to be amputated...course you couldn't fix that either, it was damage beyond repair probably... it wasn't just about healing, I had to do things I've never had to do before."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: Its unsettling but she is not a necromancer so I really dont care for her actions. I honestly dont care aboiut alot of things as long as you dont hurt my villiagers and  you arent a necromancer - Tue Nov 24 16:51:12 2015
