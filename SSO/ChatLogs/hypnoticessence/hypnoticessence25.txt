<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) mumbled and pouted her lips out while drawing a circle with her finger on the surface of the table. "I mean... if you think I deserve it... sure... you think I deserve to be chuunin?  You want me to be chuunin? What would that mean for my responsbilities?"* - Thu Dec  3 02:54:30 2015

When the attendant walked up she gave her name, "Nakano-san." Bowing her head some and then walking off to where she was directed. She was wondering how a yukata worked with this sand treatement but she knew how to use them well enough and walked into the dressing room and changed promptly before walking back out into the room barefoot and peering about looking for Sanoke.* - Thu Dec  3 06:06:30 2015

Closing her eyes and waiting for him to finally speak as she nearly fell asleep just from laying in the hot wet sand. "Mngng.. " She then looked up towards Sanoke and smiled faintly. "Yeah this is freakin' amazing..."

She shifted down lower till the sand was touching the base of her chin and groaned out again. "Yeah I cook, Lera said it tastes like 'home'. Heh." * - Thu Dec  3 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had zoned out for a bit and then came back to reality with a jolt. "Eh?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wrapped the towel around her body and peeked out to see him standing out there in the open room in a towel and flushed lightly.

She stepped out holding the towel tightly to her chest and wrapped around her body as tight as she could get it. "Yeah that was amazing, we totally have to come again, my skin feels so soft... I think it actually made my scars hurt less." She looked over one of her arms and because she was in the towel, Sanoke would be able to see just how extensive her scaring was from when Aza hurt her...they were -bad-. * - Thu Dec  3 08:01:42 2015

As he ran his fingers along the scars it sent shivers down her spine in reaction. "I got them all from when Aza hurt me... I didn't have any before..." sighing out and looking up to him with a weak gaze, "no..they don't hurt anymore. I already went through hell for them."* - Thu Dec  3 08:11:56 2015

"What I want to ask you is really important to me... because it's something that me and Lera have wanted for a long time. It's not something we are asking for now but in a few years but we want everything set up. I'm sure you heard us talking about me trying to find a donor and Sanoke was our first choice since he's my best friend and we look at him as family. When he told me that it was a bad idea because how you might feel I gave up for a while... thought that it was hopeless to even talk to you because he's your fiance. I'm just tryin' to lay it out why we want him to donate so me and Lera and have babies... and... all that."
