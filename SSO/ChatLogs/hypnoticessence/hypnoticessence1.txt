<br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Come.. - Sat Nov  7 10:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: . - Sat Nov  7 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stood against the wooden frame, her full weight upon her back with ankles crossed and the rest of her weight on her heels. She had a tiny notebook she was reading through and occasionally forming little ticks or scribbling a note here and there as she flipped through the thin tiny pages.* - Sat Nov  7 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *yawn* - Sat Nov  7 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) paused her scribble scrabble and peered over at the hooded woman. The fact she was talking to a rather large club, yes that's what it looked like to Kiyoko, made her look rather insane. A single brow slowly rose as she wiggled her nose for a moment in a sniff of the desert air and watched the woman for a short while. No harm in people watching right? Especially if they were crazy people.* - Sat Nov  7 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Whats she been doing now...? - Sat Nov  7 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) squinted sightly at the fact she just ....squeaked. Now she was an insane...mouse? Taking a few steps closer trying to get a better look but hoping that because she was walking upon sand she wouldn't be heard very easily she tried to peer at whatever the woman was doing. She couldn't possibly be seriously speaking with a 'club'. Then the girl froze when she heard some other voices in the distance and saw yet another person speaking to an inanimate object! What was wrong with these people?!* - Sat Nov  7 11:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Sat Nov  7 11:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Uh..... - Sat Nov  7 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Maybe... I should just.....go back to what I was doing. - Sat Nov  7 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) siked herself up and then mosied over to sit down on the bench beside the trash can and tried her best to peer out of the corner of her eye at the wiggling blade. She wanted to see what that was all about, course she knew this was dangerous. It wasn't like Lera wasn't known after all... Anyone of real power was known by name and certain features, features being that 'club' she had on her.* - Sat Nov  7 11:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) slowly craned her head and then gulped down looking from the blade up to Lera's face. "U-uhhh....." she blinked several times with widening dilated eyes. "Uhm..... thought.... you know.... I wanted to sit down...and the bench, er.... I thought the bench was bigger." She tried to scoot closer to the trashcan but hit the edge of the bench, wobbling slightly as she stared towards Lera with eyes that looked like they were some type of crazed raccoon with the facial make up she sported.* - Sat Nov  7 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) full on jumped nearly half a mile on the bench when she started giggling at her. The fact she referred to her blade as a he and then on top of that thought he might bite made her a bit more nervous despite Lera's attempt to console her. "Why would a ...club...bite me?" she was keeping her voice to a whisper as to not sound as crazed as the other girl to those passing buy in the meager crowds of traders and shinobi.* - Sat Nov  7 11:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) scrunched up her brow, "a blade? Like a sword? But it's....---HE is so fat." Again, whispering away as to not be seen as crazy like Lera was.* - Sat Nov  7 11:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) jerked back nearly slamming into the trashcan but barely missing it. "I-it fuckin' moved."* - Sat Nov  7 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Of course he did, He is alive you know. - Sat Nov  7 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: But...how is that possible? - Sat Nov  7 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* - Sat Nov  7 12:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Between me and you, he's quite a special blade. There are only a few others like him, though he's the only living blade. - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh....I... I don't really know a whole lot about swords. - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhmmmm. Thats fine. - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stared at the binded spikey blade.* - Sat Nov  7 12:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But yeah. Really don't touch him, he might take a little more from you than you'd like. He's taking chakra from me even now. - Sat Nov  7 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: If he bites, why doesn't he eat yo--e-erg.. - Sat Nov  7 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well, he doesn't eat people. He eats chakra. - Sat Nov  7 12:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...Isn't that... sort of the same thing? Chakra is part of us. - Sat Nov  7 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I suppose, you can look at it that way. - Sat Nov  7 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken(Benbonds) says: . . . - Sat Nov  7 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) tried to stop staring at the blade, but some part of her was wary that if she looked away it might try to get a nibble of her. Peeking up to the female she examined her for a moment before glancing out towards the other people in the square.* - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You sound different. - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I sound different? How so? - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You aren't from this region are you? - Sat Nov  7 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Oh no. I'm from Kirigakure. - Sat Nov  7 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh, the wet place. - Sat Nov  7 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Pfft, yeah. The 'wet place' - Sat Nov  7 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned lightly, "I... sorry that was rude. I meant... That sounds like a nice place to grow up."* - Sat Nov  7 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Its fine. I'm more of a wanderer now. - Sat Nov  7 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You don't --if you don't mind me asking, don't like your home anymore? - Sat Nov  7 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Its not that no. I still send money and help out when I can., - Sat Nov  7 12:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But theres only two things I have left that I care for. Both are here. - Sat Nov  7 12:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thought on this and nodded before leaning forward slightly to lean her elbows on her lower thighs and brought her hands together in a clasp. Her hair fell over her shoulder and rustled in the breeze lightly from the stale winds of the arid lands. "People?"* - Sat Nov  7 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhm. People. My father and brother to be specific. - Sat Nov  7 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Huh... still got your family, that's rare. - Sat Nov  7 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ah well. They're quite resiliant. - Sat Nov  7 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled faintly, "Thats nice." <Okay, maybe she isn't crazy.>* - Sat Nov  7 12:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: What about you? hm? Do you have anyone you care for? - Sat Nov  7 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked two times slowly and then lowered her head a half tick. "Uh... hah, I guess you can say that."* - Sat Nov  7 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Fairly demanding family. - Sat Nov  7 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I see.... - Sat Nov  7 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Demanding  is the nice word. - Sat Nov  7 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Truth be told, I'm actually adopted. My biological father is dead, dunno where my mother is. - Sat Nov  7 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: So...I suggest, you hold onto what you can get. - Sat Nov  7 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It isn't blood that makes a person family. - Sat Nov  7 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...blood just holds on ...with more resiliance. - Sat Nov  7 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I suppose. You do have a point, I hated my biological family as well. - Sat Nov  7 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) peered over to Lera, "Then why tell me to hold onto mine?"* - Sat Nov  7 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Because as someone who's lost almost everything...even the smallest things are worth holding onto. - Sat Nov  7 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hm... - Sat Nov  7 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You don't look...very old to have lost so much. - Sat Nov  7 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Thats just the way of the shinobi world I suppose. - Sat Nov  7 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Makes me feel like I've wasted my life so far... we look similar in age. - Sat Nov  7 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I was just unlucky enough to be in the wrong places at the wrong times. - Sat Nov  7 12:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...but haven't you done more things you are proud of? - Sat Nov  7 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: ....No..not really. Like I said...I've never been where I was needed...things always seem to happen while I'm away... - Sat Nov  7 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) frowned slightly while watching her, "Then...why do you continue on the same path?"* - Sat Nov  7 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Because as most paths tend to be...its one way. - Sat Nov  7 12:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Then...find another? - Sat Nov  7 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well. Quite simply I'm just not going to love anyone again, then i don't have to go through losing them again. - Sat Nov  7 12:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) heavily frowned now and looked at her quite seriously.* - Sat Nov  7 12:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That's what this is about? - Sat Nov  7 12:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhm well. I suppose so. I'm just going to keep living I guess, I wouldn't say i'm better off alone...more like...people are better off without me. - Sat Nov  7 12:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...that's....just a -horrible- mentality. - Sat Nov  7 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: -Horrible-. - Sat Nov  7 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Yes it is, I don't want anyone to end up like me.  - Sat Nov  7 12:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Just because they are with you doesn't mean that he will end up like you. - Sat Nov  7 12:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: No I mean. Uh. I've been in two serious relationships. The first was the owner of this sword, he died while I was not there to help him. - Sat Nov  7 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: The second died while I was in the same village, I was asleep. Its not a nice feeling...to be so close while so useless. - Sat Nov  7 12:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Both of those cases sound like they -were not- your fault at all. - Sat Nov  7 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Maybe so, but it doesn't change the fact that I couldn't do anything. - Sat Nov  7 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Hell I even failed to kill the man responsible. - Sat Nov  7 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Maybe you shoul learn that, bad things happen in life. You won't always be there to help but that doesn't make it your fault. Plus, if it did happen... maybe it was meant to happen. I know that sounds shitty but...I mean some people believe in that stuff. Destiny and what have you. - Sat Nov  7 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ah well...destiny or not. This is the path i've chosen. I'm hoping to become strong enough to stop these sorts of things from happening again. - Sat Nov  7 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You gave me the advice not to let go of that which I have. So you are saying if someone came along that potentially would mean something greater to you...you would avoid them? Is that not hypocritical? - Sat Nov  7 12:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I told you that because you shouldn't end up like me. - Sat Nov  7 12:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Soooooooo hypocritical?~ - Sat Nov  7 12:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smirked wryly at the woman.* - Sat Nov  7 12:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Pretty much. - Sat Nov  7 12:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I think you should get over this feeling that you shouldn't be happy and with someone. Things might look grim, may have been grim your entire life... but that doesn't mean it can't change. - Sat Nov  7 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well, you might be right. But it doesn't matter, Whatever happens happens I guess. Right now though...I have no intentions of doing anything like that. - Sat Nov  7 12:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded while in sollumn thought and then sat up straight and held her hand out towards Lera. "I'm Kiyoko."* - Sat Nov  7 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Kiyoko Nakano. - Sat Nov  7 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had a slightly stronger handshake than Lera. "Nice to meet you, Lera." A sunny smile pulled up at her lips. "And... I assume... -he- has a name?" She peered down to the blade.* - Sat Nov  7 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh yes. - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: His name is Samehada. - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Samehada....what does that mean? - Sat Nov  7 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It means Shark Skin - Sat Nov  7 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: .....heh... I get it. - Sat Nov  7 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Cute. - Sat Nov  7 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhmmm. - Sat Nov  7 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I must be pestering you, I'll head off. - Sat Nov  7 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Its fine. I don't mind at all. - Sat Nov  7 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had been about to stand but as Lera responded she sat herself back down. "Oh."* - Sat Nov  7 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Honestly... I came over here because I thought you were crazy...talking to your 'club'...  - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced up towars Sanoke as he approached.* - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey Sanoke. - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't seen you in a while... - Sat Nov  7 12:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ortho...no he is alive... - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh. . THen why did Kana tell me he wasn't. - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Do you know where he is? - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No idea and no...he attacked me yesterday. - Sat Nov  7 13:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I survived it seems...because he had a change of heart... - Sat Nov  7 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . A change of heart? So there's good in him. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) remained silent and just watched the two for now.* - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: They were my friends. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Yes I know. - Sat Nov  7 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How are things back in Kiri now? - Sat Nov  7 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I intend to finish him as well. Though...not quite yet. - Sat Nov  7 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He's much more powerful than I thought. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) thinks:  . . Wow she is scary. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And things are...okay I think. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. Good, no more attacks? - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Theres a new Mizukage. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: --New? What. . . - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And besides Ortho's attempt on my life, no. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Do you know him? - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No. I have no idea. - Sat Nov  7 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uhm. . . Well that's weird. Hrm. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He seems sincere enough, he's been putting his own money into rebuilding. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: he also holds similar abilities to Zetsumo... - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Those threads... - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Something to investigate. I'll do something about it. I get the feeling if I go to Kiri bluntly, I'll be  attacked. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, I don't think so. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Things are quite stable now. - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zole(-The Creepy SoulHunter-) says: Say guys . . Have any of you seen Trill this day ? - Sat Nov  7 13:05:29 2015

It almost made her like her just a bit more for it, "Chikyu, that's an interesting name. Is it a local name?" She peered over towards the golden haired boy just as he was walking away again and she wondered why he had only greeted them in passing. Cocking her head faintly at him and glancing him over.* - Sat Nov  7 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) listened in on the girl's voice and how she changed it.

"Well if your handshake is a testament, you certainly got the strong part down."* - Sat Nov  7 23:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you know where she usually is? - Sun Nov  8 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sorry to interrupt, I want to speak with her. - Sun Nov  8 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I don't know her at all. I just see her walking around often. - Sun Nov  8 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Sun Nov  8 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced over towards Yan.* - Sun Nov  8 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... well worth a shot... She really should keep her clothing clean of blood though, being pregnant and all. - Sun Nov  8 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled up towards Yan and then stood to take a few steps towards him while extending her hand for a shake. "No I don't believe so, I am Kiyoko. A nurse recently made a shinobi medic... for technicalities." Her smile grew broader then she looked back to Chikyu, "honestly either that baby is giant or it's a set of twins."* - Sun Nov  8 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Two of those suckers in her. Well no wonder she looks...*pausing herself* Uh...uh big in that area. - Sun Nov  8 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shook his hand with a feminine hold, course there were parts of her hand that were calloused due to work in the hospital but for the most part, very gentle small hands. "Really? perhaps we will study together soon?" She smiled up at him, honestly looking forward to that possibility.* - Sun Nov  8 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yes..Others.. - Sun Nov  8 00:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: Bored - Sun Nov  8 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) chuckled at the both of them speaking about medical techniques being over their heads. "It's really not all that difficult, well... I say that but I have been a nurse since I was old enough to take my exam." When the mention of a party came up she tilted her head to the side, "I don't think I know a Koji, what type of party?"* - Sun Nov  8 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Aren't they a little young for sake? - Sun Nov  8 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled genuinely and nodded, not letting her thought phase her appearance or words. "That sounds great, where at?"* - Sun Nov  8 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, north-east district. Bottom-right house. I mean, you have to be fifteen to come with the alcohol and all. Koji will kill me if someone's underage and drinks..He's the commander of the desert owls. - Sun Nov  8 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ... fifteen is the drinking age? ... that change recently or something? - Sun Nov  8 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I don't know. It's been that way since Hassan's been in charge. - Sun Nov  8 01:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: They are old enough to enjoy themselves in their off time. But I mean, to each their own. - Sun Nov  8 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....that makes sense, but terrible for the growth in the brai--...I'm going to just stop myself there. - Sun Nov  8 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and flashed a smile before sitting back down on the bench. "Count me in."* - Sun Nov  8 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Ehh... I don't know. - Sun Nov  8 01:14:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah, I guess I do. How bout tomorrow, I'll keep my schedule free just for you. - Sun Nov  8 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh, sure. - Sun Nov  8 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm busy everyday, but I always find time to spar my fellow suna-nin. - Sun Nov  8 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Oh, that's Koji. - Sun Nov  8 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked him up and down.* - Sun Nov  8 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I thought he was talking about a female. - Sun Nov  8 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Oh thats Koji. *cricket noises* - Sun Nov  8 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah...I remember you had alot on your plate.  - Sun Nov  8 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Are you satisfied with the Trilliam situation? - Sun Nov  8 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Meh, It's better than putting him in a medical insitution... Better than death as well. The people of Sunagakure seems to appreciate it. - Sun Nov  8 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Koji..... could you show me a thing or two sometime around..? - Sun Nov  8 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair...Uh, this is Kiyoko and Chikyu...I invited them to our party this friday. - Sun Nov  8 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hi there! - Sun Nov  8 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled brightly up towards Koji, "Nice to meet you." She held out her hand for a shake but he was a bit aways so perhaps he wouldn't take it.* - Sun Nov  8 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Like I said, Koji is an accomplished ninja..Head of the Desert Owl police force. - Sun Nov  8 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And he's my roommate. He's a good guy. - Sun Nov  8 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: It was worth a try. - Sun Nov  8 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) tilted her head to the side as she took his hand with her small feminine grip. Releasing his, likely very large hand due to his height, she looked him from mid leg to face in one swoop, he was freaking huge. "Have harmful ones been ... that common lately?" She practically lived in the hospital, so to her it was really just a matter of being busier or not rather than actually knowing what happened outside the hospital walls.* - Sun Nov  8 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ... - Sun Nov  8 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Hassan.. - Sun Nov  8 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded shortly, "understandable then. Had me worried I might be pulling extra shifts for a while in the hospital."* - Sun Nov  8 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Well we try to make sure you guys work as little as possible. I dont know how well that's going. - Sun Nov  8 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled faintly, "I don't really mind, but the less work for me, means the less pain for otheres."* - Sun Nov  8 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) whispers: Later Ai, lets catch up soon. - Sun Nov  8 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 02:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Pretty peaceful. - Sun Nov  8 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wish I could find someone to spar though. - Sun Nov  8 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Thats a relief - Sun Nov  8 02:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Your pretty strong... I dont think many can keep up with you - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Um... I could spar you.... but that's if you want.. - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Then again... - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You are not a trustworthy ninja to me. - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I know... - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Bryson, I'm nothing special. - Sun Nov  8 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Not in my opinion - Sun Nov  8 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Funny Yan... I told you the same thing when I first met you - Sun Nov  8 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh? Well, seems to make sense. - Sun Nov  8 02:17:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Cool, cool. - Sun Nov  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled slowly wider and wider as he spoke of a teacher who was a doctor. "School? Aren't you a bit old to be in school still?" She assumed he was much older than he was due to his sudden burst of puberty early in life. She was about to ask who his wise doctor of a teacher was but then she heard Bryson's statement about being a doctor and priest and she realized which one of the medics had been mentioned to her by Lera. 

Peering back up to Koji her smile persisted, "your teacher sounds like a wise mentor, I would love to meet them sometime soon."* - Sun Nov  8 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I need a medical ninja to teach me this damned medical technique. - Sun Nov  8 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can't get the time of day with Zenaki. - Sun Nov  8 02:20:48 2015

"Y-your eyes...." she stared straight down the center of them and flicked her auburn gaze back and forth, perhaps she was rude to stare when she herself looked rather funky what with her type of clothing, strangely styled hair, and facial paint.

She didn't understand why someone would choose the ground over a seat upright. "Yes yes... course I work so much I hardly see more than my home and the market place. Now that I'm a shinobi I've been going out a lot more, they split my duty hours because of shinobi responsibilities."* - Sun Nov  8 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled gently down to him, "that is very considerate of you. I think you and I will be friends, Koji."
