I've only met her once. I... will just have to hope to see her again." She felt heat going up into her cheeks and lowered her head some as she hoped her face paint would help hide her embarressmment. Clearing her throat she started to try and quickly walk past Koji towards the courtyard, arms coming up and wrapping around her torso in a hug.* - Sun Nov  8 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) paused and peered back at him over her shoulder, "Y-yeah.... you can, I just... ugh...  you are probably too young to understand.

"I have officially embarrassed myself past redemption."* - Sun Nov  8 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes both from reaction of what Koji said and then at the fact Sanoke was now there. WITNESSES! Her face was bright red by this point and she was starting to pick up on her breathing. "W-well how about we just don't say anything to her about me mentioning this y-yeah? Heh...heheh..." She started to try and slowly back away from the two of them to try and leave the area. She felt like she was being targeted for some terrible punking that would end up with her looking like the lamest girl in the world.* - Sun Nov  8 08:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) protested, "nah-na-na-naooooth-thin---" She cut off as Koji spoke about what was going on and squinted her eyes at him eviliciously! (yes i made up that word :3) She continued to back away. "Nothing to worry about here! Just a silly girl! Worrying about trifle things!" Her voice cracked in a squeak and she was looking like a trapped animal in a corner between the two of them.* - Sun Nov  8 08:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) skidded so hard in the sand she managed to fall over on her behind. She was not at all a dexterious one, certainly not the running time at all... She gulped heavily. "Y-yeah...t-that's it!"* - Sun Nov  8 08:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I had a....'feeling' when I met Lera....that's it. I asked about her...but apparently she's gone home. Then he offered to get me a passport, but that's crazy, to go across the regions just for a 'feeling'. - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed heavily and reached up to tug on the tails at the front of her hair that were banded. "Ughhhhhh."* - Sun Nov  8 08:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: You can't expect someone to jump into another relation, you get me? While they're still mourning. - Sun Nov  8 08:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...it...it was that short ago? - Sun Nov  8 08:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced at his hand on her tiny shoulder and then up to him. "Well.... he asked me to come along, and I will be visiting Trilliam while he's in jail. To be his nurse, yeah... and like to bring books and stuff to him." She was happy just to have the topic change.* - Sun Nov  8 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Sounds good. Jail can be pretty lonely. - Sun Nov  8 09:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes as she looked up at him from where she was sitting. That was crazy, but also at the same time she didn't find it ALL THAT impressive. It just was some ninjutsu. "....Woo?"* - Sun Nov  8 09:33:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Eh... like I said... not that interested in the jutsu. - Sun Nov  8 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. Then yeah, Trilliam is useless. But enough shinobi talk. What's on your agenda? - Sun Nov  8 09:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flashed a bit of energy through her for a moment and scanned him over trying to know what she might see with her sensing. She was curious about him because mainly...that hair was fucking weird.* - Sun Nov  8 09:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) frowned slightly, "you are a strange one."* - Sun Nov  8 09:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: U-uhm... y-yeah... - Sun Nov  8 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Mhmmhmmm... - Sun Nov  8 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You're nice and warm. - Sun Nov  8 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flicked her eyes about as this was getting...rather friendly for what she would prefer in public.* - Sun Nov  8 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Are...uh... is this okay for people to see you like...this in public? - Sun Nov  8 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I feel like I'm going to pass out...shit. - Sun Nov  8 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: To see me? Whatever do you mean? We're just two close friends sharing an intimate moment no? But...if it bothers you, we can go talk in more...privacy. - Sun Nov  8 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...U-uhm... i-its up to you...really...  - Sun Nov  8 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Well...I leave the choice to you, I stopped caring about peoples view of me a long time ago. - Sun Nov  8 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I found that more often than not, you should just do whatever you want to do. - Sun Nov  8 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) turned her head lightly to look back at Lera, who was considerably close.* - Sun Nov  8 11:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It seems you just want to know what I would decide. - Sun Nov  8 11:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Not at all~ - Sun Nov  8 11:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...you aren't bluffing huh? - Sun Nov  8 11:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Nope. - Sun Nov  8 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I... suppose...if you ...in the off chance wanted to keep...holding me this way... I am not all that public of a person.... - Sun Nov  8 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked several times and cleared her throat.* - Sun Nov  8 11:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: The most I would show in public normally would be a handshake...or maybe a hug... - Sun Nov  8 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I see, so you want to go into private. Well alright then, just sit tight and we'll go somewhere quieter. - Sun Nov  8 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes and tried to grip onto Lera. "H-holy fuck....you weren't lying about the flying."* - Sun Nov  8 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Why is she still carrying m--not that I'm complaining... - Sun Nov  8 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's auburn eyes flicked over Lera and then the front of her house. "Is this your... owned house in Suna? Or are you renting it out while you're here?" She was feeling rather dorky for asking that but the question had popped into her mind. * - Sun Nov  8 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I bought this a while ago. - Sun Nov  8 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I have a house here and in Kirigakure. - Sun Nov  8 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out slowly as she tried to get her cool. "Thank you... for um, yeah... leaving the courtyard."* - Sun Nov  8 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well its quite alright. - Sun Nov  8 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No need to whisper now hm? - Sun Nov  8 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn, no I suppose not. - Sun Nov  8 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Course... what was the need for 'two close friends sharing an inimate moment' to whisper? - Sun Nov  8 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Very true. - Sun Nov  8 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) peered back at her with a querky grin.* - Sun Nov  8 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...it strikes me...that I don't really know a whole lot about you. - Sun Nov  8 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I suppose you don't... how dangerous of you to invite me into your home.~ - Sun Nov  8 11:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well...I'm sure I can handle myself...heh. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What if ...hm... I could have been an assassin or something, yeah? - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Entirely possible. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I don't think so. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That happens... *wrinkles nose* I think. - Sun Nov  8 11:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Eh...only once so far. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: To me at least. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) squinted some, "Sorry."* - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Shit. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? No need to apologise, I made it out okay. - Sun Nov  8 11:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right right...  - Sun Nov  8 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So...Kiyoko, What sort've things do you like to do? - Sun Nov  8 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What do you want to know about me the--heh... uhm... I... honestly am a workaholic. I am practically living in the hospital most of the time... but uh, I guess I like stuff like... Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I like the market place... during the busiest time of the day. - Sun Nov  8 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It feels alive at that time. - Sun Nov  8 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Ooh, and lemon poppy seed muffins. The homemade kind. - Sun Nov  8 12:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I was wrong...you're not cute. You're beautiful. - Sun Nov  8 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes as she stopped breathing for a moment while staring wide eyed at Lera. "I..."* - Sun Nov  8 12:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Speak! - Sun Nov  8 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah...apologies, I'm getting ahead of myself. - Sun Nov  8 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: N-no no...  - Sun Nov  8 12:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thank you... - Sun Nov  8 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just speaking my mind as I see it... - Sun Nov  8 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's... very kind of you. - Sun Nov  8 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I have to...thank you. For proving me wrong again. - Sun Nov  8 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I... uh... I've thought you were rather stunny for... a whil- - Sun Nov  8 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) swallowed hard.* - Sun Nov  8 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  8 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I said i wouldn't ever...feel...well I said love but still. - Sun Nov  8 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, I guess I was wrong again. - Sun Nov  8 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I said that the first time as well...guess I really can't help myself.. - Sun Nov  8 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If... I'm pushing too much, I can... back off... I know you have had reasons not to persue... erg... we had that conversation... and that didn't stop me. - Sun Nov  8 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No no. I want you to be as forward as you want... - Sun Nov  8 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...I'm not so sure about that. - Sun Nov  8 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't lie to myself all the time. - Sun Nov  8 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was trying her best to control her breathing as she looked Lera's visage over. "And...what are you lying to yourself about now?"* - Sun Nov  8 12:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I generally tell myself that I can't love anyone again, to save myself from the pain you see? - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But, someone told me once that the pain is worth is. - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And they're right. - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have to agree with them. - Sun Nov  8 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Course... - Sun Nov  8 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm fairly motivated...hah. - Sun Nov  8 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Are you now... - Sun Nov  8 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled rather slow and long as her eyes closed while her hair was being brushed away. Her eyes soon after opened to peer into Lera's own.* - Sun Nov  8 12:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You sure know how to make a girl... feel tormented. - Sun Nov  8 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I guess I really am a fool huh. - Sun Nov  8 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tormented...? - Sun Nov  8 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  8 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then... - Sun Nov  8 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt her heart skip a beat as Lera began to lean in. All Kiyoko could think was <finally> which was rather absurd for the short amount of time these two knew each other. She leaned in to meet the girl half way, much more eager than Lera it seemed by how quickly she tried to connect the kiss. Her lips pressed against the other's, upper lip between Lera's own set, and her bottom lip below. A quick inhale through her nostrils flared them as she tried to keep control over her endorphine's urging her to move faster.* - Sun Nov  8 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whined lightly as her tongue tried to press between Lera's lips to invade her mouth. She felt like her heart was going to beat out of her chest and Lera's moan hadn't helped that pounding in the slightest. Attempting to twist in the woman's grip on her waist so that she would be facing her head on, Kiyoko placed a knee on either side of Lera's hips on the cushion of the couch and reached a hand up to her left jaw and cheek with her thumb grazing over the underside of Lera's chin. Deepening the passion of the kiss while occassionally trying to catch some air and keep things as slow as the two could manage in the heat of the moment.* - Sun Nov  8 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped as the kiss was broken and resorted to long heavy breathes through her nostrils as she tried to get ahold of herself. The hand on Lera's jaw ran along her cheek and then side of neck gently as she flicked her eyes open and peered down at her new found companion. "Now...more than ever, but... I'm glad you pulled away. I was having trouble managing to do so."* - Sun Nov  8 12:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her bottom lip as she wavered back and forth trying to stop herself from going in for more. "I swear I don't normally behave this way.."* - Sun Nov  8 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nuzzled in against her, soon after a light chuckle sounded. "So much for getting to know me before kissing me huh?"* - Sun Nov  8 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey...I tried... - Sun Nov  8 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: you're too hard to resist... - Sun Nov  8 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mnn... I like the sound of that.~ - Sun Nov  8 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good~ - Sun Nov  8 12:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We could... try and get to know one another... questions back and forth? ...other types of games...granted... we probably will just end up where we just were with those games. - Sun Nov  8 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure, do you want to start? - Sun Nov  8 12:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you -really- believe yourself when you told me you weren't going to pursue anyone else... that first conversation? - Sun Nov  8 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes I did. - Sun Nov  8 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm...my turn. Why do you enjoy being a nurse? - Sun Nov  8 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I really want to help people... help them in ways no one else can. Not just medically either for their bodies, but mentally too... and to make sure that whatever they have gone through to lead them to the hospital... they will leave feeling no burden....to body or mind. - Sun Nov  8 12:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well you're already down on the mental side, you've helped me. - Sun Nov  8 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled meekly, "I'm glad."* - Sun Nov  8 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your turn. - Sun Nov  8 12:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why did you become a shinobi? - Sun Nov  8 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I....hm. At first it was because I...had nothing else to do, my family had left me in Kirigakure and..I was alone. Well, I suppose I just didn't want to be alone anymore. - Sun Nov  8 12:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you were lying to yourself more than you knew. - Sun Nov  8 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suppose I was. - Sun Nov  8 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I think i would have made you laugh back then. I was so shy I could hardly mutter a word to anyone. - Sun Nov  8 12:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sounds adorable. - Sun Nov  8 12:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. Glad you think so. - Sun Nov  8 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  8 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm. Do you enjoy music? - Sun Nov  8 12:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...weeeeeeeell, yeah... but I usually try and only listen to music at parties or when I'm alone. I'm not very confident in my choices being 'cool'. - Sun Nov  8 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Do you know how to dance? - Sun Nov  8 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...can't say I've tried. - Sun Nov  8 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't be that hard can it? - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Whaaaa? - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You've never even TRIED? - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope. - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are not living.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Never had a reason I suppose. - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, I prefer to play the music people dance to. - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And here I thought you would be the only one to have things to show me. - Sun Nov  8 13:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well now. Thats something to look forward to. - Sun Nov  8 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I have to admit I'm looking forward to all of it.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flushed a light red from the poke. Then made a small biting motion towards the finger but narrowly missing.* - Sun Nov  8 13:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: My favorite is sushi...but it's so hard to get good sushi in Suna.  - Sun Nov  8 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, when things calm down I'll have to take you to Kirigakure. I know an excellent Sushi bar there... - Sun Nov  8 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Besides that, I pretty much will eat anythin--th-that sounds really nice. - Sun Nov  8 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anything huh....hehe, I doubt you would eat my cooking. - Sun Nov  8 13:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I would certainly try it at least once.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: When you get the chance to indulge... what do you enjoy? - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you survived the experience... - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And uh...hmm. I don't paticularly have a favourite. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: My stomach is iron resistant! - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...love food. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: One of my many vices I suppose. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And well, we'll have to see about that won't we. My cooking is beyond terrible. - Sun Nov  8 13:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Getting ahead of myself. - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Christ...you wouldn't believe how bad it was surviving in the wild on my own cooking. - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...hehe. - Sun Nov  8 13:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I've eaten some...odd things I can tell you. - Sun Nov  8 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh REALLY now? - Sun Nov  8 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yep... - Sun Nov  8 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tiger actually has a smoky taste to it you know. Its not that bad. - Sun Nov  8 13:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyways....my turn again... - Sun Nov  8 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm curious, the makeup around your eyes? don't get me wrong, its rather beautiful but...what does it symbolise? - Sun Nov  8 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's smile faded some and she twitched her lips to the side. "It's a family thing, they are fairly strict about tradition. All the women in my family wear the facepaint.. the men have a tattoo on the right side of their necks."* - Sun Nov  8 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see, You don't like it? - Sun Nov  8 13:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mentioned it before. - Sun Nov  8 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  8 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh...anyway.. - Sun Nov  8 13:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: hehehe, i'll give you a moment to remember. - Sun Nov  8 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: This is more of... just wanting something confirmed, but is what we are doing right now the most relaxation you ever get? Your indulgence was food. - Sun Nov  8 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well....I do have another little...hobby I guess. - Sun Nov  8 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't done it in a while though. - Sun Nov  8 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Go oooooon?~ - Sun Nov  8 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm a musician - Sun Nov  8 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sat up more and peered down at her with her hair fallling over her shoulders to rest the very tips of her strands against Lera's chest. "No way, what do you play?"* - Sun Nov  8 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anything I can get my hands on...so far; piano, harp, guitar, flute...and I sing. - Sun Nov  8 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm, that is quite impressive.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It makes up for my lack of cooking skills for sure. - Sun Nov  8 13:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. My turn I think? - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm.~ - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Have you ever...been in a relationship before? - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.... a serious one? - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well any really. - Sun Nov  8 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I've gone on dates, but nothing more serious than a few weeks. I guess...that's a bad omen huh? - Sun Nov  8 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, not at all. - Sun Nov  8 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It just meant the right person hadn't come along yet. - Sun Nov  8 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smirked, "that is the way I like to think of it."* - Sun Nov  8 13:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Interesting. - Sun Nov  8 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm eighteen. - Sun Nov  8 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wow. - Sun Nov  8 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That was unexpected. - Sun Nov  8 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Sun Nov  8 13:28:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Wow, I must act really mature huh. - Sun Nov  8 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe because you've been through so much? And yes... you are very mature...not to mention, powerful. - Sun Nov  8 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah, I wouldn't call myself powerful. I still have a very long way to go. - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you kidding? - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I am nothing to you. - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You are a nurse though. A healer. - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah but how long do you think it will last as a shinobi that they will allow me to be 'just a healer' - Sun Nov  8 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm. I'm not sure. As far as I know, Zenaki is a healer as well; not suited to combtat. - Sun Nov  8 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) swallowed heavily, "Uh.. yeah... that's true." Kiyoko looked uneasy.* - Sun Nov  8 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Don't worry. I'll do my best to protect you. Being my fathers daughter does have some benefits. - Sun Nov  8 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...heh...that's so generous of you. - Sun Nov  8 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright.. Well. Its my turn I believe. - Sun Nov  8 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Why don't you just leave your family? if you hate them so much. - Sun Nov  8 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) closed her eyes, "well I thought about it... many times in fact... and when I became a shinobi I finally had the money to do so, but then this lovely woman came along from another land. She told me I should hold on to what I've got."* - Sun Nov  8 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, yes I did. - Sun Nov  8 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... - Sun Nov  8 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What is your best childhood memory? - Sun Nov  8 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My best childhood memory...? Oh man.. - Sun Nov  8 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's eyes softened a bit as she stroked her fingers over the dark locks of Lera's hair. "That sounds lovely," whispered out.* - Sun Nov  8 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) poked the girl's belly, "That's cheating. You didn't pick a new question, but I will answer.~" She thought for a short time and then nodded, "funnily enough... it was the first time I ever went to the hospital. It was a class trip and ... being the geeky girl I am, I asked if I could help with some of the stuff. I got to help with putting on bandages and handing out lollipops. Stupid kid shit you know? And when I was about to leave with the rest of the class, the head nurse told me that she hoped to see me one day back in the hospital working alongside her."* - Sun Nov  8 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And there you are~ You followed your dream right? - Sun Nov  8 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... cheesy huh? - Sun Nov  8 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not at all, I quite like it. - Sun Nov  8 13:48:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not sure if I should ask this. - Sun Nov  8 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ask whatever you want. - Sun Nov  8 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If... you have done this before, what does it feel like when you take a life? - Sun Nov  8 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Its...well. - Sun Nov  8 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its difficult to explain. - Sun Nov  8 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its like....you take away a little piece of yourself. - Sun Nov  8 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The first time I had to...you know...well I threw up. - Sun Nov  8 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's...common though right? - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You'd...be surprised... - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: There are some seriously sick people out there. - Sun Nov  8 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay for normal people like you. - Sun Nov  8 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Does it get easier? - Sun Nov  8 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: yes...yes it does. I wish it didn't but it does. - Sun Nov  8 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn.. - Sun Nov  8 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I hope you never have to do it. - Sun Nov  8 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...me...too... - Sun Nov  8 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled weakly, "as nice as that sounds? We both know that isn't possible."* - Sun Nov  8 14:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its good to have a dream...and a hope. - Sun Nov  8 14:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats my ultimate goal. Peace. - Sun Nov  8 14:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Good to know.~ - Sun Nov  8 14:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You know...I can't think of anything else... - Sun Nov  8 14:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You don't have to ask anything else. - Sun Nov  8 14:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm.. - Sun Nov  8 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) simply laid on top of her smiling faintly, "have I overstayed my welcome?"* - Sun Nov  8 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? Of course not. Kinda hope you might stay here for a while actually~ - Sun Nov  8 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Though of course, you don't have to. - Sun Nov  8 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'd really like that, I can stay as long as you'd like. Up until kidnap status, then we might run into some issues.~ - Sun Nov  8 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha...well well...I might just have to kidnap you anyway - Sun Nov  8 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) squirmed atop her, "okay why did that manage to sound enjoyable?"* - Sun Nov  8 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was smiling for a bit but then she caught on and flushed a deep red. "I...I didn't mean THAT!"* - Sun Nov  8 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) scrunched up her nose, "and you are just the perfect mixture of tender and stunning."* - Sun Nov  8 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She likes squeezing me. - Sun Nov  8 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmmmm, in case you didn't notice I'm really enjoying this. - Sun Nov  8 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh really? I don't think I can tell enough.~ - Sun Nov  8 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? Well then. - Sun Nov  8 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her gaze as she was flipped to laying on the couch cushions. Letting out a tiny sensual groan at the words said she ran a hand down Lera's side and paused on her hip. "We...were trying to take it slow weren't we? Nng..."* - Sun Nov  8 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) couldn't help running her hands up and down the woman's body. "Nngn...as tempting as that is.... I should get some rest, and you too... plus... and I'm probably going to feel like a dork for saying this, but I want to make sure this gets past a couple of nights together..." Kiyoko gave her a look of sincere romance before lifting her head to kiss Lera gently for a nice promising goodbye kiss.* - Sun Nov  8 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'll see you tomorrow then?~ - Sun Nov  8 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her lip as she proped herself up on her elbow and palm.* - Sun Nov  8 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tomorrow and every day after it if you want. - Sun Nov  8 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled sharply and hummed softly as her eyes fluttered closed and then opened again. "You just.... really know how to make me crazy."* - Sun Nov  8 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) jumped up and nearly spun as she tried to keep herself from doing a happy dance. A giggle spilled out, "Until tomorrow, Beautiful." She then headed for the door and the last step before she reached it, you might have sworn she skipped a step.* - Sun Nov  8 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: So how far along are you? - Sun Nov  8 18:33:36 2015
