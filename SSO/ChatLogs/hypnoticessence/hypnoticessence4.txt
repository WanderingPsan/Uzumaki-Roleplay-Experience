<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out a long breath as she looked over Lera with a bit more focus rather than lust filled fogginess. "Stunning," whispered out with her sigh.* - Mon Nov  9 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's hand extended to Lera's hand and then ran up her wrist, arm, and then shoulder over the tattoo's. Her eyes following her hand as she went. "I just...can't help speaking my mind in your presence." She then flicked her gaze up to Lera. "That doesn't mean I am going to give in. But... I ..." Swallowing hard, "I will join you in the shower if you wish it."* - Mon Nov  9 16:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: God help me... - Mon Nov  9 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was quite interested in Lera's body but when she saw all the books she slowed her steps and nearly was being drug behind the much stronger girl. <So many...> When the books were out of sight her vision came back to the woman's tiny body. "You are such an intellect, you didn't tell me you like books?"* - Mon Nov  9 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Devil...save me? - Mon Nov  9 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gulped heavily and tried to think straight but or a moment she actually couldn't see straight except for the sight being beheld to her. She then gradually reached up and began to unbutton and untie different sections of her dress while keeping her eyes locked on Lera all the while. Her small feminine curves with the sharp contours of a strong body. "I'm almost tempted to feel your strength... do you think it might frighten me?" Her voice was low as she finally managed to undo her dress completely and let it slip off backwards to the ground.

Her lacy sun yellow bra and matching panties revealed as she reached up to the right strap and plucked it to hang loose against her upper arm, and then the left, reaching back to undo the claspe and gently allowing the bra to fall away to the bathroom floor with a tiny clink of the hook hitting the tile. Her breathing was more controlled now as her heart felt like it was going to jump out of her chest. Her ample chest to match her size seemed to be a full C and quite shapely compared to her slim hips and shoulders. The coloring of her nipples and aerola just the faintest olive tone in contrast to her slightly lighter olive skin tone.

As her panties were slid just off the hip bones they had little trouble slipping the rest of the way down on their own to the floor. Stepping out of them carefully to show her fully nude form before the other woman. A neatly shaven cleft with only the thinest of dark hair to give her pale skin contrast, the hair so thin of a line it was hardly recognizable as hair at first glance but more like decoration. Biting down on the corner of her lip, Kiyoko reached up to tug out the rings holding the two bunches of of hair in place framing her face and let them drop onto her pile of clothing. The only thing left upon the girl's body was the face paint, the rest of her completely unscarred.* - Mon Nov  9 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) couldn't resist trying to play back a bit in the game of temptation with Lera. She waited for her to be leaning in to turn on the shower and then stepped up behind her with her right hand placing on the woman's right hip and then brushed around to the front side of her and against her lower belly to run in a delicate oval pattern up and then back down to tease Lera. Just as she was doing so, Kiyoko's hips pressed forward slowly to test the waters until her hips were against the other woman's backside and her breasts brushing teasingly against her spine.* - Mon Nov  9 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped out faintly but she was in control for the moment all due to her determination to turn the tables. Leaning down some so she could whisper into the smaller woman's ear, Kiyoko spoke with her words tickling the girl's earlobe. "You can show me your strength all you like, but it seems that at the moment... I am the one showing strength, Lovely." A sly grin pulled at her lips for a brisk moment before teeth had clamped lightly on Lera's ear to tug ever so lightly and sucked faintly before pulling away.* - Mon Nov  9 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) jerked back away from Lera as soon as she had done such an...aggressive act. Her jaw literally dropped in surprise at the raw strength, "Shi--" gasping suddenly as she was gripped by the much smaller girl. Whispering out with a husky breath from the room getting steamier. "I...have to admit...-that-... has me nervous in a whole new kind of way." As the finger trailed up her body her voice had gotten more and more high pitched and she ended up on her tip toes before lowering back down but hovering up and down off her heels in utter pleasure of the stimulation. "In... mnn.. all honesty, you have me a little frightened, what if you just get sooooo worked up you end up breaking me into little bits and pieces?" A subtle sensual groan slipped up her throat.* - Mon Nov  9 17:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) moaned almost a growl out at the fact Lera was flicking her hardening nipple now. She squirmed against the smaller, yet much stronger, female, when the hand trailed down her body and began to rub in slow circles, Kiyoko leaned her head back to press against the side of Lera's own and let out a seductive whine clearly struggling to hold back her want but leaving herself available for whatever Lera wanted to do to her. Kiyoko hadn't wanted to respond to the question but it was oooh so tempting. 

"Pleeease, mnng... everything about how small you are.. your age.. just makes how much stronger you are irresistable." Her hips rolled back against the much smaller ones in want while Kiyoko tried to contain her actions but was failing terrible. An agrivated growl sounded followed by a helpless whiney moan.* - Mon Nov  9 17:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) caught her breath as she was jerked about and spun. Her eyes widely dialated and feeling the cold hard wall with sweat upon it from the steam against her back made a chill go up her spine that forced her to tremble all over till a liberal amount of goose flesh covered her body. With arms tugged up over her head there was a moment of alarm from her fight or flight system and it was obvious in her gaze towards Lera before it turned back into excited thrill for the game once more. The lips against her earlobe only served to force Kiyoko into a much louder feminine moan of pleasure, -clearly- that was a hot button for her. "I-i-i-i have a confession I need to make." Swallowing hard and trying to see clearly for a moment through the steam towards her partner, "I'm a bit out of sorts, seeing as I'm normally the one in control.. heh?" She tried to flash a grin but knew it was unlikely that Lera would believe her.* - Mon Nov  9 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt a pulsation bursting through her body resonating from her pelvis with the gestures that Lera was taking. Her entire body was on fire now with hormones and desire. It was obvious by how she kept squirming that she was having difficulty keeping her cool in this very moment. Those words rung out through her mind like an echo, squirming further just from the proposition alone and in response she couldn't resist testing the waters with a simple tug of her arms and wrists against the hold against the wall. <No good, nngnngngn..> Her mind was going crazy and all she could do was whine an let out another moan louder than the last.

She was busy collecting herself from her meager attempt at escape, when she felt the teeth and kisses against her throat. "Oh...fucking.... -hell-," each word dripping with sensuality as she couldn't help but pant heavily after each word. Everything about Lera was heightening this experience, all granted to Kiyoko's emotions growing stronger due to their time together (the games helped to excite her too). "L-lera... mnng... I c-can't, it's pointless to fight you... s-so strong."* - Mon Nov  9 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) || Lera probably was about to recieve quite the surprising response from Kiyoko. As her hands were released and the pressure on her body eased off, the girl's eyes opened and a pout jutted out on her bottom lip, followed by a whine of disappointment in the fact she had released her. Peering down at Lera lowered herself ever slightly to cling to her breast with those petite and delicate lips, Kiyoko was about to lose it. "Holy....hell... please... oh fuck..." Her head leaned off to the side against the wall and her lips parted in a faint pant that sped up. "I-i can't take it, please.... L-lera, I don't care if I'm not in control." 

She lifted her head again to stare down at the girl with a thin veil of sweat upon her skin all over her body from the heat of the shower close by. "Y-you can have me, I'm your's Lera," her voice husky with want and lack of breath.* - Mon Nov  9 18:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: :P are you comfortable? - Mon Nov  9 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) screamed out lightly in pleasure as soon as Lera's tongue had grazed her outer lips, it wasn't until she had reached the smaller inner lips that Kiyoko felt her legs buckle slightly. Parting her legs more if the resistance from Lera's grip didn't stop her, she wanted to stablize herself from falling if at all possible. It only took a few seconds of the teasing for Kiyoko to catch on to what was happening. "Oh come on?!" She shrieked nearly, "I gave in what more do you want?! Nngngn... Take me, damn it. I said I'm your's, love!" She couldn't help but press her hips out desperately trying to get more of the tongue action while her hands went through Lera's hair trying to grip rather tightly to pull her forward against her cunt. Kiyoko was not at all shy once things got really going it seemed, but all the same Lera could easily manipulate her body to control the situation.* - Mon Nov  9 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) arched her neck back and pulled harder on the girl's hair as she went to work. Struggling to keep calm as the obvious want was shown between her legs as heated juices coated her lips and inner thighs. Sweet, warm, tangy flavor danced across Lera's tongue as she taste tested and then finally delved in for the full meal. "Sweet heavens," fingers removed from Lera's head and dug nails in against the wall as her back arched fully and a low growl began and continued as it peaked into a loud joyous moan of ecstasy. "Y-yes, y-yes," panting out gentle whispers of want and acceptance of her situation. Head ground against the wall and face paint smudged from rubbing against the tile and her hair. Red streaks began to drip down her jawline and neck as Lera had her way with the young nurse.* - Mon Nov  9 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whined softly as she went into a calm excited state. So focused on what was happening that she was quieted excluding occasional small moans or whines and heavy breathing. Her nails ached and finger tips white from how they were pressed against the tile wall. Each time Lera did something new it earned a stronger reaction, a hip roll there, a moan here, and finally when she had found that tiniest of places within her tight walls, Kiyoko squeezed hard with her kegal muscle around the finger inside. "O-oh fuuuuuuck," groaned out as she felt herself sliding down the wall and was quavering as she felt a climax coming on so easily and so soon. It felt wrong that she was the only one recieving pleasure, but nothing could be done. Kiyoko was captivated by every touch Lera bestowed upon her.* - Mon Nov  9 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had just been about to reach her point of release when Lera DARED to pull away. A dramatic whine of protest sounded and Kiyoko lost the strength to stand as everything she was hoping for and dreamed of was crushed by Lera's torment. "W-whyyyyyy, please n-no....nngng.. I need it," she looked to the woman with anguish and utter surrender. "Lera please, please I ...can't...nngng.." She couldn't take it and already her hands were drifting to her own sex to try and continue the pleasure while her bright auburn eyes looked on at the woman beside her.* - Mon Nov  9 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) just needed that last little push, and Lera had managed to gain Kiyoko's complete pleasurable release. "Ooooouuuhhh..~" howling out a moan as her head tilted back so far her forehead was practically against the wall behind her. Eyes shut and mouth formed into a perfect circle as her body shook and writhed against Lera's lips and fingers. One hand stricken through the woman's hair to grip tight where as the other ran up and down Kiyoko's body to feel her own total heat over the situation. With that, her climax had passed and Kiyoko was worn out. Her breathing slowly becoming more controlled as she sat against the wall with hands palms up on the sweaty tiled flooring. "Never... go.... away.... -pleeease-."* - Mon Nov  9 19:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) calmed her breathing, "I'm getting you, next time... promise.~" She smiled wide like a goon as the high from her orgasm still lingered. She wasn't used to only having one orgasm but this one had been worth it, Lera was worth it... the embarrassment she had gone through in the past to get the nerve up to go after Lera was worth it. She was right where she needed to be.* - Mon Nov  9 19:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stepped closer with concern in her gaze towards Mitsunara and Aza. She was desperate to get closer in fear of those two about to kill each other. In the last instant she could see what was happening with the sword of Mitsunara's and Kiyoko felt her eyes burn with emotion in upset at the fact she was about to see two shinobi possibly die when they were only sparring! "Please stop them!" She was rushing forward now, trying to get close enough that when the fighting ceased she could aid the both of them, while also distant enough she wasn't in danger.* - Tue Nov 10 06:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt Koji's words echo through her with a resonation, she was trying to not tremble but the fact that if one of these people die, the other one also will die was terrible to Kiyoko. Was one life not enough?

Regardless during all this she had flashed chakra through her system and was scanning Aza and Mitsunara with her sensing abilities trying to see how much chakra they had depleted, not to mention trying to figure out what the fuck Aza was.* - Tue Nov 10 06:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) kind of sort of...froze up? Yeah that's what we are going to call it, due to the fact she had just seen two scary as fuck chakra signatures coming from the two she wasn't sure she even wanted to get near them. When Yan spoke up she nodded after snapping back to reality and rushed towards Aza's side. Regardless of Mitsunara's injuries, Aza had a cut to his throat and she wasn't sure how deep it had gone, no need for people to bleed out! 

Once she had reached Aza's side there were already handseals being formed and eerie green aura channeled out of the palms of her hands towards his throat as she began to heal the area. Kiyoko didn't look anywhere else, blood was all she focused on. She was scanning his body for anymore injuries but she had shut off her sensing ability and was trying not to focus on any chakra at all. Not wanting to see that again for a long time, her attention was fully on what other injuries he had.* - Tue Nov 10 07:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped out as she saw the chakra levels drop so quickly, "Something's wrong... I've never seen someone's chakra drop so fast. I-is this a shinobi thing because if not he might be going into arrest of some type." She started to check all his vitals but he seemed fine other than an elavated heart rate. When the boy started to wake up she jerked back from him, afraid of what he might do but then his voice sounded sort of kind and she went back to patching up his bruises and truly baffled by the self healing burns. "The fight had to be stopped, neither of you won." She then widened her eyes as they dialated, "What....are you?" She was in shock at everything that was going on with his body.* - Tue Nov 10 07:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was finishing up what she was doing to the boy to patch him up but she lowered her gaze when he asked the question, it sounded like he was...regretful. "U-uhm.." whispering as she brushed some of the hair out of her face to show more of her facial paint around her eyes. "You just sort of ...got a little crazy with the punches but she almost killed you in self defense, it all worked out though...okay? Just stay calm for me. What's your name, then? Eh?" She smiled sweetly down towards Aza trying to be her normal gracious self when Koji walked up as she was packing up her medical supplies. * - Tue Nov 10 07:29:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her inner cheek as she assumed what he was about to say. She stood and headed over toward Mitsunara and Yan, "You realize what you have done right? Now I can't use healing jutsu on her because you've made her higher than a kite."* - Tue Nov 10 07:39:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was sort of biased considering Aza was crying and Mitsunara was just...chillin' smoking a blunt when she had almost killed the guy.* - Tue Nov 10 07:41:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) saw the blood being spat up and narrowed her gaze, "She has internal bleeding...or her throat is simply fissured some how. Did he strike your throat at all? Choke you?" She started to pull Mitsunara's shirt up or open to look at her belly to look for signs of internal bleeding bruises, they were very specific in how they look. Seeing that the internal bleeding wasn't severe and wouldn't need a hospital ICU care, she sighed out in relief. It was extremely light and would pass. "I want you to stay a night in the hospital just so they can watch that your internal bleeding doesn't advance but instead receeds." 

She applied some more bandages but it seemed that her ribs were only minorly broken to add on to the previous fracture and wasn't all that severe. "Remember the ice thing I told you, have you been doing it? She also made sure the bandages were extra tight this time to keep the ribs from aching too much when she breathed. All the other bruises were looked at but nothing was done since she was smoking weed. "If you want to take pain killers later, pick up some over the counter ones at the pharmacy but don't take them while smoking."  

Standing up once more she peered back towards Koji and smiled weakly, "Yeah no problem it's my job." She was still out of sorts due to the fact both Mitsunara and Aza had chakra that frightened her. When she heard Aza say this was the -second- time today she squinted a bit and turned her head towards him. "I know you don't want to see a specialist...but perhaps we can do some exercises that might help you control...whatever it is that makes you empowered. I know it's a long shot but I'm really just trying to help you and keep you and everyone else safe." A warm smile tugged at her lips as she held the trash in her left hand from all the medical care, she also was still wearing a set of non-rubber anti-alergen gloves.* - Tue Nov 10 07:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: They won't be fully healed even then, but if you keep them bandaged and take pain killers you should be able to fight. - Tue Nov 10 08:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough. Mind if I come with ya to the office? I'm sure you can get there on your own but I want to make sure. You never know... - Tue Nov 10 08:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean making him only fight when this Nari around and punishing him is a bit....drastic. If he can learn to control it then he won't need them around. - Tue Nov 10 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: Oh, shit... - Tue Nov 10 08:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled to Aza, "that sounds splendid, I hope that we can get some things worked out. You can come see me whenever you are ready, just make sure it's before next time you plan on sparring or fighting in general. I will let you get a few days rest if you need, I can tell how heavily this is weighing upon you." She had reached up to grip his shoulder softly and squeezed very gently before allowing it to drop back down to her side. Then she realized her gloves were still on and pulled them off professional style so she didn't touch the outside of them and made it so the medical waste was locked inside of the gloves, protected.* - Tue Nov 10 08:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rose a brow, "I don't believe Nari has anything to be jealous of... you can assure her." She didn't want to say why because it wasn't her place to say. "We will work together on it as often as you like but it seems that Koji might have something to say about how often it needs to be. I'm thinking once a week might be good enough." (every two days ooc) She glanced from Koji to Aza, "honestly, if her presence calms you then that is a start but she won't always be there."* - Tue Nov 10 08:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shook her head, "No. You are too shaken up to do it now. You need to rest and recover then come to me when you are calm. Okay?" She smiled sweetly and was settled on that decision. "Once a week isn't that bad, you know? And I bet after the first time we talk you will change your decision, don't worry I'm not going to put you on any medications to prohibit it, I'm not a doctor and even if I was I wouldn't want to supress it, I want you to  learn how to control it. Even when you are using the ...skill?" She still didn't know what it was.* - Tue Nov 10 08:33:42 2015

A gentle smile being displayed as she peered back towards Koji and Aza. "I think that is all for me here, I'll be going now," she began to depart and had to walk around the dog and Daiki to exit by squeezing between the dog and the cliff side.* - Tue Nov 10 09:05:16 2015

She flicked her gaze over towards Hassan for a moment to see who it was and then trained her eyes back on the lines of words. "Good evening, Lord Kazekage."* - Tue Nov 10 09:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced back up to the man as the pungent scent of tobacco hit her nostrils causing them to flare. She analyzed the bags under his eyes but he was rather elderly but regardless there was the fact she could tell that he was in need of sleep. She found it rude to comment on it but thought she might be able to help him. Lowering the book some and closing it partly she gave him a warm smile. "Is there something I can help you with? I could probably get you something to help you sleep, Sir."* - Tue Nov 10 09:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled wider but still very tender all things considered in such a shinobi heavy village. "That's quite the saying, course death will come quickly without your sleep, Sir." She paused before responding to him about the earlier reply, "I am doing what I normally do though, if you don't mind me comment. I'm one of the nurse--well, medical shinobi now, Sir." She was watching how his muscles moved, looking for anything that was worrisome and even flicked her sensing ability on to check him for anything concerning about his chakra. She couldn't help herself when it came to aiding others, even the leader of the village.

When he inquired about her name, the young adult's eyes jerked back to reality and out of her analysis of his health to his eyes. "Oh, I would be Miss Kiyoko Nakano, Sir, at your service.~"* - Tue Nov 10 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hey. You up for a spar, guy I've never seen before. - Tue Nov 10 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Tue Nov 10 09:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How did you get into the village without speaking with the leader of the village after entry? - Tue Nov 10 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I spoke to Yan. He said he was going to speak to the KazeKa~ He's the Kazekage?! - Tue Nov 10 09:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Oh my. - Tue Nov 10 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I don't fight children. - Tue Nov 10 09:57:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. Sorry to offend, Kazekage. - Tue Nov 10 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: How long can I stay here? - Tue Nov 10 09:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Everyone keeps saying how strict he is and rough but ...he's genuine. - Tue Nov 10 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was quiet as she stared up at Hassan, his words and the way he had looked at her were very kind and sincere. After a few moments of her smile having broadened she looked back out towards Daiki to remain silent as they handled their business.* - Tue Nov 10 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: What are you here for? - Tue Nov 10 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I just came here because Konohagakure was literally empty. It was putting me on edge. Plus the people there wasn't too nice.. I was sorta hoping to stick around for a while. Perhaps train with you guys. - Tue Nov 10 10:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: We don't usually accept outsiders, were on high alert. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm suprised Yan even let you in. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll let you stay a day. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Well.. I'm only a little genin.. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: To recover from your jouney. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Repack. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But I can't have you stay much longer. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Uh-huh.. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: That sounds fair. I guess. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Alright, good. - Tue Nov 10 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: As for sparring. - Tue Nov 10 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Yes? - Tue Nov 10 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I hear that scary white haired guy down there, he loves sparring. - Tue Nov 10 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm not too fond of hitting kids. - Tue Nov 10 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: He doesn't look very scary. - Tue Nov 10 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: But.. If he does, I suppose I have to go and ask! - Tue Nov 10 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You're not from Sunagakure, are you? - Tue Nov 10 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Was wonderin' if you're up for a spar? - Tue Nov 10 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Heh. Kinda boring.. - Tue Nov 10 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flipped the page in her book and glanced to the side towards Hassan, "Hm? No I am." She reached for her dress's sleeve and pulled it up to show the headband on her wrist which was clearly being concealed from sight. "I just have been a nurse most of my life but the hospital made me get certification as a shinobi since I was restricted in what I could do pertaining to shinobi's in the hospital. Not all that well trained as a shinobi though really, more of a technicality so I can help those with special needs that are chakra related, Sir." She closed the book and allowed it to rest on the end of the bench to give the Kazekage her full attention.* - Tue Nov 10 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I understand. I'm kinda a prodigy and you don't feel you'll be able to keep up. I'm sure you'll be fine though. - Tue Nov 10 10:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You should know that all shinobi must have their headbands in sight. - Tue Nov 10 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That's everyone wears theirs openly. - Tue Nov 10 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Add ugly to the list as well. - Tue Nov 10 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But you're fine. - Tue Nov 10 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Just do me a favor and wear it when you're on the job. - Tue Nov 10 10:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Yes? - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: That was the first law I made. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: That got a reaction out of this. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I want everyone from Sunagakure to have pride from where they came from. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Not being tripped up? Doesn't sound too hard. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: The headband isnt just scra metal for protecting your head. - Tue Nov 10 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It symbolizes many things. - Tue Nov 10 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rubbed her lips together and lowered her head, "I'm afraid I wasn't aware of that. I'm sorry," since she had the cloth cut a way so that it was made for her wrist she undid the tie and then reached down by bending at the waiste to secure it around her ankle where it would be visible. "Is that alright? I actually am very proud of this village and my affiliation to it, the only reason I had it hidden was because... honestly? I am not trained in fighting and so I was sort of embarrassed to even be wearing such a symbol. Several have asked to fight me but are far out classed than I am since I only know the very most basic of skills of fighting from the academy courses." 

She stared down at the headband around her ankle now, "I know my family isn't all that well known but I figured with the cultural paint I wear upon my face it would be easily assumed I am from here, Sir. Forgive me for the misunderstanding." She bowed her head some, clearly all about respect and this so called family she had mentioned had taught her well in her years of growing up.* - Tue Nov 10 10:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had been about to comment on something about other shinobi and figuring out how she wanted to fight but then he had stood. She could still feel how heavy his hand had been on her shoulder, a phantom sensation. With her lips parted slightly from what she had been about to say she figured he had work to get back to and instead responded, "Yes of course, Sir. Thank you for speaking with me, Good evening Lord Kazekage."* - Tue Nov 10 10:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 10 10:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Holy hell I just spoke... in depth with her father. - Tue Nov 10 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Least he likes me. - Tue Nov 10 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Tsk.. - Tue Nov 10 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'll see you around.. - Tue Nov 10 10:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked up to where Sanoke was training and then sat down cross legged on the ground. "Watcha doing?"* - Tue Nov 10 11:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) cocked her head to the side, "private exams? Is that something Gezo related?"* - Tue Nov 10 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Like for Jounin or something? - Tue Nov 10 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's right. A very tough exam needed to become a 'Gezo Private' or whatever. - Tue Nov 10 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm, why do you want to be a Private? - Tue Nov 10 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: A promise made to Hassan. Or deal, rather. - Tue Nov 10 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: My friend, and future in-law did something boneheaded. - Tue Nov 10 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: In exchange for her life not being taken, I promised to conquer the Private Exams in the name of Sunagakure. - Tue Nov 10 11:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I can't exactly go back on my promise, now can I? - Tue Nov 10 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked and stared down at the sand in shock, "Wow. That's a big deal."* - Tue Nov 10 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Taking a giant test for a rank to save someone's life. - Tue Nov 10 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What did this friend do? - Tue Nov 10 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If I may ask. - Tue Nov 10 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She. . Uh. Well she's a shinobi. - Tue Nov 10 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And fled from the village. - Tue Nov 10 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Was ordered to be killed on sight. -- And would, had I not arrived on the scene. - Tue Nov 10 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I had to them mid-act. - Tue Nov 10 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Was she brought back to the village or was she also allowed her freedom because of what you d-wait... is this that black haired girl I saw speaking with your fiance? - Tue Nov 10 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She came back on her own. But they were still trying to kill her. - Tue Nov 10 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And yeah. Her name is Mizora. - Tue Nov 10 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh.... - Tue Nov 10 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Interesting. - Tue Nov 10 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She is a strange girl. - Tue Nov 10 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....I mean that in the nicest way possible. - Tue Nov 10 12:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. -- No need to be gentle about it. - Tue Nov 10 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I know she is. - Tue Nov 10 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well... as much as you've seen me you know how gentle I can be. - Tue Nov 10 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. But she's getting better, so that's good. Hopefully I don't have to put my neck out for her again. - Tue Nov 10 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why did she leave anyhow? - Tue Nov 10 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Man. I don't even know. - Tue Nov 10 12:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sorry, I won't pry. Do you want me to leave you to your training? - Tue Nov 10 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nah. It's cool. Although you'll probably be bored. - Tue Nov 10 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have a book to read if I get bored. - Tue Nov 10 12:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lera helped me decide what I should do for my fighting style, after the things you had told me. - Tue Nov 10 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What did you decide? - Tue Nov 10 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Some time or swordsmanship with using wind on the weapon. - Tue Nov 10 12:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So kenjutsu amplified by Chakra Flow. That's how hard actually. If you go that route, derive from the basic technique to make more advanced CHakra Flows. - Tue Nov 10 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh? I didn't understand those last two things you said. - Tue Nov 10 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's extremely basic.  - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I know what chakra flow is... I don't understand what you -said-. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Derive it. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: This is just scratching the surface. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Far more powerful and proficient chakra flow techniques can be made. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Such as this. - Tue Nov 10 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh... - Tue Nov 10 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stared on and was mystified, "interesting."* - Tue Nov 10 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That really does look like what I want to do. - Tue Nov 10 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What kind of sword do you think I should use? - Tue Nov 10 12:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Can't ever go wrong with a Katana. I'd suggest a Zanbatou, but you look too weak to carry one. - Tue Nov 10 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Lera is fucking ... three inches shorter than me. - Tue Nov 10 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Tiny little ...shower door breaking ---nope don't think about that. - Tue Nov 10 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She probably cheats. - Tue Nov 10 12:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: With her Doton release. - Tue Nov 10 12:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled deeply and shook her head rather swiftly, "Uhm... well regardless if I could learn to use a Zanbatou, I think it would be better to use something extremely light... fast.... I am light weight even if I am taller, but at the same time I need something fast to draw since I will be mainly a medic and need to be able to use my hands."* - Tue Nov 10 12:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Is there a place I can see all the types of swords I might be able to use? - Tue Nov 10 12:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Surely there is more than just katana's and zanbatous. - Tue Nov 10 12:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. I'd hit the local weapons shop. East of here? Outside of those three, I only know of. . . - Tue Nov 10 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. A Tanto. And Wakizashi. - Tue Nov 10 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Maybe the library would be better. - Tue Nov 10 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Or that. - Tue Nov 10 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'll have to check it out. - Tue Nov 10 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How would I get a weapon if they don't have it at the shop? - Tue Nov 10 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'unno. Pray that you run into a blacksmith that does custom orders? - Tue Nov 10 12:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.... okay. - Tue Nov 10 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You think that the Kazekage would be able to help? I mean when he has time. - Tue Nov 10 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. You could also try to put in an order. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: With the Gezo. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How do I do that? - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. They're expensive as hell, though. Just speak to Hassan, he's a Sergeant. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Tue Nov 10 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Tue Nov 10 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stuck her tongue out at him from over her book she had been reading while he was training. "I don't pick up 'girls',for one I am pansexual, and Lera is ...special. I read, I work...probably way to much, I socialize... and I'm teaching myself how to become a therapist."* - Tue Nov 10 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled wide at his innocence to the word, "It means I pick who I see based off who they truly are, not their outward appearance. That includes their gender."* - Tue Nov 10 13:29:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't mean like, right now, of course. - Tue Nov 10 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can probably utilise some of my connections and get you a different kind though - Tue Nov 10 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah he mentioned katana's, I'm not sure yet. - Tue Nov 10 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He made jokes about me being too weak to carry a zanbatou. - Tue Nov 10 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Pfft. I use to struggle to lift the smallest of weights - Tue Nov 10 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyone can do anything if they try hard enough. - Tue Nov 10 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I will try to learn how to use zanbatous in the future as well. - Tue Nov 10 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah but then I thought about it, well I had already thought about it honestly, but I mentioned to him. I should use something fast to be drawn and used since I will need my hands as a medic. - Tue Nov 10 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmnnn...I probably have my old training blade somewhere. - Tue Nov 10 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Fast hm? - Tue Nov 10 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: There are a lot of fast types. - Tue Nov 10 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Like what? - Tue Nov 10 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...Daggers, Short Swords, Rapiers, Sai's and a few others...that I can't put to mind. - Tue Nov 10 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Tantos. - Tue Nov 10 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah, those too. - Tue Nov 10 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A machete would probably work. - Tue Nov 10 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thick and strong, yet light and fast. - Tue Nov 10 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So all short range except for the rapier? Short range is the fastest? - Tue Nov 10 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was sort of looking back and forth between the two of them.* - Tue Nov 10 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Generally, the shorter the range the faster it is to swing. - Tue Nov 10 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What is a rapier? - Tue Nov 10 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its a long thin blade, easy to break if you catch it on the edge. Its designed for sharp thrusts, extremely potent if you wield it with skill. - Tue Nov 10 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anything else that might be interesting or suited to me? - Tue Nov 10 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Sai's, Rapier, possibly a katana...not liking the katana's all that well though. - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm....You'd look sexy with Sai's...I mean...Hm, Maybe Kukiri's? - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What are those? - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Damn...didn't get her. - Tue Nov 10 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was way too focused, she couldn't help it.* - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're short curved blades. Thick and durable. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Don't think I've ever seen those before. So they are fast but durable? - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Sai's, Rapier, or Kukiri... - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Instead of being curved backwards like a Machete, they're curved forward. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Sai's are small but easy to break. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're generally also used in pairs. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Rapier gives range but even more easy to break. - Tue Nov 10 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Kukiri is strong but short. - Tue Nov 10 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I want to look into the rapier and kukiri. - Tue Nov 10 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Probably read up on them. - Tue Nov 10 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. They're sure to have something on them in the library. - Tue Nov 10 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anyway.~ - Tue Nov 10 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhhhmmm? - Tue Nov 10 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Do you know a guy named Aza? - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Aza? Can't say I do. - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... okay, I was going to ask you about him. - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who is he? - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He has some trouble controlling something and I am going to help hi--oh, he's one of the shinobi here. - Tue Nov 10 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ahhh. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Boyfriend to someone called Nari. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't know. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't know her either. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just was going to ask you about him if you knew anything. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sort of concerned if he looses I might get hurt. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope sorry, I'm still unfamiliar with some people in this village...? - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If he loses it? - Tue Nov 10 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Really sweet guy, just has issues controllin-yeah, he has some shinobi skill that makes him forget himself. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Looks Like I have to stick by you then. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Weeeeell, that is very nice as always to hear. For those sessions though I don't think he will want anyone but Nari around. He said that she helps keep him calm though, so there's that? - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He's pretty secret about it. - Tue Nov 10 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmm...I see... - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I will worry you know...? - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'd rather stick as close as possible... - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Don't wo--.....ahhhhhha. Called it. - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reached out to poke her nose.* - Tue Nov 10 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Well aren't you two love birds? Also, It seems like he needs to be kept in check whenever she is not around. Wouldn't want people to get hurt. - Tue Nov 10 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) plucked her finger back and darted her eyes to Kurt, a blush spreading across her cheeks peeking out from the facial paint. "Er....y-yeah... I mean... mnr... well see that's why he is going to come see me. To learn how to control it, everything will be alright, it's to help keep him and everyone else safe." Nodding confidently.* - Tue Nov 10 14:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ...That doesn't stop me from worrying ya know. - Tue Nov 10 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeeeees, I know. - Tue Nov 10 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Sigh* - Tue Nov 10 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: It'd be best if you had allies around you while you're doing that. - Tue Nov 10 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I won't insist to be in the room...but...i'm gonna keep an ear out. - Tue Nov 10 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed and then reached her hands up to run over Lera's shoulders and then one against her neck and the other against her cheek. "Remember what I told you? What the lady told me about how I am going to throw myself away to save others? This is my way of contributing, you put yourself in danger everyday by fighting and nearly dying, I help people in ways that other's can't and it has it's own dangers. I can't just -not- be a shinobi now, I've gone and become one and I don't think your father will allow that to be taken away so easily, not to mention it's needed of me to help further in this village and community." She smiled gently and glanced at Kurt and then back to Lera with her auburn gaze, "I will accept you being outside the door in case something happens. I can't have him running off and denying this because if I do then he might hurt someone or he will get hurt himself, Koji saw what he did and he almost killed a girl and in turn she very nearly killed him before others had to stop her."* - Tue Nov 10 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: After the first two times...not going to lose this for a third time.. - Tue Nov 10 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Listen, I don't think he could hurt me if he wanted to.... he told me I reminded him of his mother...and he was crying. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I know why you worry. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Right...It extends to a lot of stuff though...I don't just mean him. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And that's okay. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: No no, I know, love. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I'll be careful, always for you. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Alright...thank you. I'll try to be careful too. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hah, I don't really believe that but I hope you prove me wrong. - Tue Nov 10 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I actually had a pretty nice idea earlier. Something for me to do~ - Tue Nov 10 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Oh? - Tue Nov 10 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'm thinking of opening a business here in Sunagakure. With some of the profits going to the village of course. - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...retiring? - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It'll be a business that buys and sells jutsu, I'll also offer my services to teach new jutsu. - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Nah, not for a long while yet. But its something to keep me busy when I'm not training. - Tue Nov 10 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That... sounds nice. Is this your way to stay here? - Tue Nov 10 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Though I could go back to Kirigakure, theres nothing left for me there. - Tue Nov 10 15:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Everything I care about is here. - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Then don't go back. - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I won't - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Not while I have you... - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pulled her hand away from Lera's cheek and twitched her lips to the side, "That's selfish of me."* - Tue Nov 10 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I just want....you...thats all I want. - Tue Nov 10 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's lips formed a weak smile and then a much larger one. "Alright, I'll accept that."* - Tue Nov 10 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rolled her eyes, "No shit."* - Tue Nov 10 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hahahaha. - Tue Nov 10 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You enjoyed it though. - Tue Nov 10 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Not sure if I'm the one that went after you to charm or if you plotted it all along and trapped me. - Tue Nov 10 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Who knows~ - Tue Nov 10 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I'll get my answers.~ - Tue Nov 10 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'm looking forward to the attempt already. - Tue Nov 10 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ..did you get your shower fixed? heh. - Tue Nov 10 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ehhh, who needs a door anyway. - Tue Nov 10 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Still can't believe you ripped it off. - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It was just some interior decoration. - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: it worked though didn't it? - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: To prove a point or to ...calm  you down? - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Maybe both...? - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's lips smirked off to the side, "Yeah, both."* - Tue Nov 10 15:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Who knows what i'll 'rip off' next time... - Tue Nov 10 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: If we keep it up your whole house is going to need renovated. - Tue Nov 10 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's eyes widened and she glanced at Kurt for a moment before flushing.* - Tue Nov 10 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: We're already thinking in sync... - Tue Nov 10 15:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: He's standing sort of ...close. - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm? - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Pretty sure he just...heard that. - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: And she finds that amusing... - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) squinted with a pout.* - Tue Nov 10 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: What? Whats wrong with talking about interior decoration? - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I am minding my own business. - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
