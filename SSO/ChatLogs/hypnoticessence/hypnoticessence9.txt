<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shook her head as Mirai zoned out. She took out a nose inhalant device and a set of gloves. Walking over towards Sanoke she gripped his jaw and chin gently and then held the device under his left nostril. "Inhale quickly and deep, then we will do the other side. You will feel a powder and it will be strange but everything will be alright, Sanoke-san."* - Fri Nov 13 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Now the other nostril... if he doesn't freak out. - Fri Nov 13 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) finished the other nostril on Sanoke and then tossed the device. "All good, Sanoke." She walked over to the desk and picked up an alcoholic swab, "Izanami can you pull down your jacket enough for your upper arm to show?" She had the alcoholic swab ready to clean the girl's arm.* - Fri Nov 13 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stuck the girl with the shot in the arm after she had wiped it clean and then plunged the end.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked through the suckers in a giant jar and there was a blue one at the VERY bottom. She looked at it and cringed, "Uh... do you want to get it?" She held up her arm, "Stitches?" the arm was covered in stitches and if she tried to get it she would rip them open.* - Fri Nov 13 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled at the child and watched as she retrieved the sucker. "Pretty sure that little br---...boy ran off. All well, I'll get him later." She shrugged and tugged off her gloves and tossed them in the can. "Mkay, all done." With that she started to head for the door.* - Fri Nov 13 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Ivels such a baby.. - Fri Nov 13 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked over at Mirai as she had run off to do something assumably mid flu shot giving. "Uh, so... I grabbed some books to go over some things." She pulled out a few things such as books over various anatomy and skills needed for a basic nurse as well as a couple of oranges, a stitching kit, and bandages. "You are going to use the orange to learn how to stitch."* - Fri Nov 13 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Kiyoko. - Fri Nov 13 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Feeling better? - Fri Nov 13 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched as Mirai took a seat beside her and sat the books on the bench, they were more like homework for Mirai to take home to look over. "So pull on a set of gloves first and then take the scalpel in the kit or any knife you have you want to use and cut open the orange so just the skin and a very small amount of the fruit's flesh is revealed. She then waited for the girl to do as such and then pointed along the orange, "You see how it's open now, you are going to have to learn how to hold the flesh together with the skin and stitch it up while you work." The orange being in Mirai's hand was easy enough to see and was the most ideal thing to work with here in the desert since the Kirigakure way of using fish was messy with scales and fish were rare out here. 

"After you tie off with a knot at the end then you do the first stitch at the very end of the cut. This is the hardest stitch to make in the process, you have to make sure it's tight, but not too tight that it might hurt or snap, and also assure it is straight." she gestured with her hand in a weird motion that looped in a circle sort of. "This is how you are going to move the needle to get it stitched properly, you curve down and then forward and then up to go under the skin just the right amount before coming back up. This will take a lot of practice and your stitching can always get better with time." She then leaned back away from the girl and waited for her to do her first attempt at stitching the orange, Kiyo had several oranges to use, about two pounds actually but no more since she didn't want anyone yelling at her for carrying over five pounds with her stitches possibly stretching.

Her gaze then went over towards Mitsunara, "Hm? Yes, quite a lot." It was obvious the girl wasn't in a wheelchair anymore but was still stitched all over but all bandages had been removed and she no longer had a concussion.* - Fri Nov 13 07:28:25 2015

"So I want you to take these home, they are going to help you learn how to set a broken bone, other things like that, after you think you are ready I'm going to have you take a little test run and show me what you have learned from the book alone since you are such a natural.
