<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Your father doesn't want us to have the wedding at the court yard because he said something about it being the 'barracks'? I don't know. - Wed Nov 18 13:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) could obviously feel the bandages and then looked down and frowned. "What happened?" She already was pulling the sleeve back to look at Lera's hand and then the other seeing that they both were bandaged.* - Wed Nov 18 13:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was trying to see if she could see any signs that the bandages were done sloppily or incorrectly.* - Wed Nov 18 13:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't... - Wed Nov 18 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Wind? - Wed Nov 18 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Uhm... - Wed Nov 18 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A little bit of wind was in there yeah.... - Wed Nov 18 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its better if I tell you about it somewhere else...I really don't want anyone else to even attempt it.. - Wed Nov 18 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I...don't... - Wed Nov 18 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't even know.... - Wed Nov 18 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pulled out some supplies and then started to dab at the areas that had blood scabs to try and clean them up with the alcholic wipes, this would hurt quite badly of course. Soon after she would then form seals and began to heal the area, this wasn't going to heal her hands fully but it would give her a baby layer of skin to help the regrowing get going but it would be extremely sensitive... because of whatever she did she lost all her callouses on her hands built up over the years and likely was going to end up getting blisters often for a while.

After she had finished healing what she could, Kiyo bandaged them up again carefully and then kissed Lera's cheek gently. "Be more careful, love."* - Wed Nov 18 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Probably should tell her it nearly killed me huh... - Wed Nov 18 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded in worry but she seemed a little more tender and worried than angry or demanding like she might normally have sounded. Leaning in against Lera's shoulder she wrapped her arm around her's and closed her eyes slowly.* - Wed Nov 18 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Looks like you won't be training for a little bit, I could make you dinner tonight instead of you always going and eating at those fancy restaraunts after training? - Wed Nov 18 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Especially after how you already broke the bathroom. - Wed Nov 18 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Such a clumsy woman.~ - Wed Nov 18 13:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe...yeah... - Wed Nov 18 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe we should 'break' the bathroom again after dinner...hmmm. - Wed Nov 18 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) turned a dark red.* - Wed Nov 18 13:56:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: P-pretty sure that constitutes as training. - Wed Nov 18 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can just...not use my hands? - Wed Nov 18 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) swallowed hard and looked over towards Lera.* - Wed Nov 18 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) lowered her head quickly and fumbled for words.* - Wed Nov 18 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ahh...you're cute when you're flustered. - Wed Nov 18 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sh-shh... - Wed Nov 18 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I knoooooooow. - Wed Nov 18 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe~ - Wed Nov 18 14:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. - Wed Nov 18 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Leraaaaaaaaaaaaaa. - Wed Nov 18 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Hmmmmmmm? - Wed Nov 18 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Hmmmmmm? - Wed Nov 18 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Are you hungry yet? - Wed Nov 18 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I'm always hungry~ - Wed Nov 18 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then stood while holding her arm out for Lera to take instead of her hand so they could head back to their home.* - Wed Nov 18 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) it could be noted that because Kiyo has been using the house more than Lera that there is wedding arrangement books, bags, testing colors and the like all around the house but in an 'organized' manner. Most of which are stacked in the South East corner out of the way, but with the large amount of things she had been collecting it was starting to get full in the house.* - Wed Nov 18 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) paused as she was removing her shoes and looked like a deer caught in headlights. "Ai! Don't be snooping,  you said I could handle all of it and I'm doing a good job... even if you are paying for everything. Hmph. I still don't know why we couldn't just do something really small so I could pay for it." She was sort of weird about Lera paying for ... pretty much everything in their lives now. Granted Kiyo was sort of a doctor that did charity rather than a full blown paying job, she got a low amount from the hospital but didn't charge for any of her psychologist work. Heading into the kitchen she waved Lera off, "go do what you like, this probably will take a while. I'm only one woman, I can't cook like your fancy restaraunts do in under twenty minutes."* - Wed Nov 18 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) paused half way putting her apron on to see Lera was going to watch her. She grew a little embarrassed but then continued forward and started pulling out various ingredients for the large meal since Lera was such a heavy eater. First though, Kiyo had recently learned how to make a traditional and casual drink that her family used to make, she had managed to sneak some of the recipes in the past but hadn't been able to look through them until recently at Lera's. She began to whip something that looked like alcohol and cream with milk mixed in and some clear syrup that was basically liquified sugar. When it was frothy she poured some about half way in a cup and then sprinkled some little toasty rice balls on top that gave the drink a little dimension.

"Uh... I hope you like it, never tasted it myself since I wasn't allowed to drink back home and I don't drink all that often anyway...It's suppose to be really light and sweet..kind of milky?" She held the glass out for Lera to take to enjoy while Kiyo was making the meal.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her lip and smiled as she began to chop vegetables, slice meats, heat skillets, and all the assortments of cooking necessary for the meal. She put on a pot and some water to boil with the lid cocked, then some oil in the skillet to start getting heated for frying.She peered over towards Lera and could tell by how she drank the alcoholic beverage that she didn't drink much. "Don't worry, I made it light... I uh.. I kind of can't drink all that much so I'm waiting till the meal."* - Wed Nov 18 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flushed faintly and glanced at Lera before focusing back on tossing some vegetables into the pot of boiling water. "You trying to get me drunk?"* - Wed Nov 18 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) snickered and added in some meats to the pot and then seasoned it with pinces of spices and herbs before putting the lid back on and adjusting the temperature. The house began to fill with the scent of her cooking and what she was making probably would go over Lera's head entirely as she prepped the other parts of the meal. "I act sort of silly sometimes if I drink too much, not sure how I'd act around you. I think I will play it safe until I have you permanently trapped after the wedding.~" She winked one eye while sticking her tongue out at Lera.* - Wed Nov 18 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) would never blow Lera off but as soon as she blew in her ear she cringed and squirmed. "Ai! None of that," trying to wave a giant spoon that was still clean at Lera before sticking it into the pot and stiring the soup inside.

http://cdn2.norecipes.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/tonyu-jiru-1.jpg?9cc842* - Wed Nov 18 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) left the soup to be, it was already making the house smell delicious, and moved on to another dish. She was mixing something up in a bowl with chicken torn up that was already cooked, corn, flour, cream, and various other things until it became a thick paste and then she dipped them in a breading and dropped the balls into the frying oil.* - Wed Nov 18 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) || Lera -knew- that was a fucking hot spot for Kiyo. She groaned lightly and almost burned herself as she leaned back into the woman's body. "Mnn.. how am I suppose to cook with you distracting me, huh?" She turned the little balls in the pan and then removed them to sit on their plates for the two of them and dripped dark homemade sauce over them to finish them off. Sitting the places at the back of the stove so they stayed warm while sitting up with the creamy texture on the inside. "Oh right I forgot to tell you, the drink is called Arare, the soup is creamy salmon miso soup, and these are Korokke. They are little chicken and corn croquettes." She smiled some and then took the prepared chicken wings and breaded them before dropping them into the oil. "And this is Tebasaki. Japanese fried chicken with sesame." She fried it up before dipping them in a sweet and slightly spiced glaze and then sprinkled sesame seeds over the top. She one by one carried each dish to the table before making a good pitcher of the alcoholic drink for them to get refills from and stood by the table.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sat down beside Lera and ate her food as well and drank some of the Arare. "You don't have to hold back, love. Go at it how you'd like, it's just you and me." She ate her's at a polite pace and manner with occasional sips of her drink.* - Wed Nov 18 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) hadn't heard the whisper since she wasn't listening that hard out for it. She simply kept eating and had paused only when Lera did to look up at her with concern but it was obvious the woman was just enjoying her meal. A smile tugged at her lips and she went back to eating but could hardly manage to try a little of everything since the meal was too big for herself.* - Wed Nov 18 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) couldn't drink more than one and a half to have the same pink glow that Lera had on her cheeks. When Lera said it tasted like -home- she blinked and sat her cup down. "That's... that's the sweetest..." She looked like she was going to cry just from being so happy and leaned in to kiss Lera's cheek next to the corner of her lips and then kissed her lips not caring about them just eating.* - Wed Nov 18 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) hummed gently and kissed back for a good while before pulling away and motioning to start cleaning up. She was such a wifey.* - Wed Nov 18 17:21:55 2015
