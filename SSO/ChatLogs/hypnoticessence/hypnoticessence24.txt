<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes and started to tremble, suddenly being stuck between Mitsunara and Lera had her nervous as fuck and the fact Lera was holding her in place didn't help. Swallowing a large lump in her throat as her face turned beet red.* - Wed Dec  2 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gave a small whine of being put on the spot. She closed her eyes when the kiss was felt on her cheek and sighed out nearly in a pant as she turned her head away looking for help from ANYONE---oh right, all her friends are dead. 

She looked back towards Mitsunara and then spoke up weakly with a whisper, "I...I didn't know you liked women too."* - Wed Dec  2 20:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) led him away from the area.* - Wed Dec  2 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) ordered herself a ginger mint tea, "I guess we can get business out of the way. Before Hassan died he asked me to get into pharacutical medicines for him. Because of that I'm now able to create things that this village previously wasn't being provided."* - Wed Dec  2 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was wondering if you were willing to fund the project for soldier pills. These would basically help boost up our forces in times of trouble. - Wed Dec  2 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was used to Lera eating this way and seemed unphased as she drank her tea perfectly politely. "Well, I'll have to go over a few things but we can probably buy all the ingredients for it easily enough... or collect them ourselves through the mines. As for what they do, they basically give you a super charge, I've already experimented and created one but other than that I haven't made anymore because I wanted to see who would want them. I haven't...taken one because I'm honestly a little scared to but the goal is for it to increase your chakra after you have used a great deal or before a giant fight... due to my testing with the lab rats I'm going off the assumption it can keep you fighting strong for three days and nights if necessary due to it's lasting effects on the body but then after that time you are going to likely pass out and need to be hospitalized. It would be used for drastic circumstances... maybe only supplied to chuunin and above?"* - Thu Dec  3 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded some with a smile and sipped her tea again and seeing as that matter was passed she eyed him to see if he looked to be in a good mood.* - Thu Dec  3 00:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oooh. I mean, I like you both. And normally I'd do it buut. . I kinda like not being in fights. My fiance is possessive. - Thu Dec  3 00:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sat her cup down and sighed out heavily, "I mean she wouldn't understand? It's just so we can have babies... and so that ...ugh.." She shifted her tea cup some looking obviously down about his refusal.* - Thu Dec  3 00:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You can't talk to her and see what she will say? - Thu Dec  3 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Would it be better if I went to her? - Thu Dec  3 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. I'm unsure, probably better if you do it.  - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Although she's a fire cracker. . Thiscould end bad.. - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was trying pretty hard to hold her tongue on her thoughts about Mirai, especially recently after the whole thing at the courtyard and her forcing him to come to her when she wasn't even in a good mood and just stood there silently.* - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You think she might go for it if I spoke with her? - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Probably not. She wouldn't want to share any part of me. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Even if it's just donation. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm trying not to talk badly about your fiance... I know you love her. - Thu Dec  3 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Maybe. Yeah, she'll probably even admit that she's selfish with me. But hey, that's my finance. If she doesn't want me giving other people donations, I'd respect that. I mean, I wouldn't want her - Thu Dec  3 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: To be like a suggo-rat mom. - Thu Dec  3 00:21:45 2015
