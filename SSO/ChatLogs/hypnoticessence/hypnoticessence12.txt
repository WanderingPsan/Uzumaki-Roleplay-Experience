<br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No one from the police force was even notified so you couldn't have been appointed. - Sun Nov 15 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: They said they were looking for someone with purple hair... - Sun Nov 15 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: She giving you trouble? - Sun Nov 15 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: They were notified. - Sun Nov 15 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looks like she can't even lift ten pounds with her current injuries.* - Sun Nov 15 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Who was notified then? - Sun Nov 15 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: They weren't notified. - Sun Nov 15 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And who appointed you? - Sun Nov 15 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: I'm sorry. I'm not at liberty to disclaim that information. - Sun Nov 15 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....yes -you are-. - Sun Nov 15 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you really going to make me bring my father in law into this? - Sun Nov 15 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: If it has to come to that, Yes. - Sun Nov 15 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pursed her lips and looked to Aza, "Please go get Lord Kazekage."* - Sun Nov 15 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Sun Nov 15 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Knew I should have stayed out of this. - Sun Nov 15 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: the prime suspect Akira is trying to get rid of the body....I knew he was the killer... - Sun Nov 15 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Probaby going to end up getting kicked out of Suna for this. - Sun Nov 15 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Will do. . . - Sun Nov 15 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked to the boy next to her, "Your assistance isn't needed any longer, thank you for informing me where the body was. Aza will help carry the body once Hassan gets this lady to step aside."* - Sun Nov 15 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right right. - Sun Nov 15 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you need to question me later, My name is Akira. - Sun Nov 15 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Were you involved? - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) frowned now at Akira.* - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But I found the body. - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think you should go speak with Koji..... - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Still makes me a suspect in -some- peoples eyes. - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: he 'found' the body. - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That -does- make you a suspect. - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And I don't know who Koji is. - Sun Nov 15 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He's the leader of the police, black, afro, white eyes. - Sun Nov 15 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Can't really miss him. - Sun Nov 15 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right, ok. - Sun Nov 15 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Please leave. - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: .... - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: How'd he die? - Sun Nov 15 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Leave -now-. - Sun Nov 15 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: Just answer the question, please. - Sun Nov 15 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Sir you're going to have to leave. - Sun Nov 15 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We can't answer the question since he hasn't had his autopsy, now leave. - Sun Nov 15 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: All I know, is if they don't let Kiyoko have the body, there might be a few more added to the count. - Sun Nov 15 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What was your name? - Sun Nov 15 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) is looking towards Aoi in wait of an answer.* - Sun Nov 15 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....detective... yet you didn't identify yourself as part of the police force when I arrived? - Sun Nov 15 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Because again. You don't have that level of clearance. I am being polite by giving you my information now. - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced at Kuro and then back at the woman and there was a hint of irritation in Kiyo's normally very calm and loving eyes.* - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ..... - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes -I do- have the clearance. - Sun Nov 15 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are choosing not to believe I have the clearance. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: This lady is trying to move and disrupt the seen. The seen hasn't even been inspected for clues or evidence. And she's trying to carelessly contaminate the scene. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: scene* - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, this isn't the proper scene. The body was already moved. - Sun Nov 15 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I am not trying to move and disrupt the scene, I'm trying to take it for an autopsy which is my job, and I have a right to it. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Exactly! - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thank you! - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Right, if it was moved. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: There can still be evidence - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And it's getting further and further contaminated. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I suggest you let her take the body, and let her do her job. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'll show you the scene. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Sir, your comments mean nothing.  - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't need to see the scene, I'm a -doctor- I need to autopsy the -body-. - Sun Nov 15 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Aza... just... no. - Sun Nov 15 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: If you are a doctor. - Sun Nov 15 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Why are you out here, and not at the hospital - Sun Nov 15 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: preparing for the body to arrive. - Sun Nov 15 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...-because there was a body to retrieve-. - Sun Nov 15 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: This girl. . .really wants her face smashed in. - Sun Nov 15 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out and looked to Kuro, "please talk some sense into her, Kuro."* - Sun Nov 15 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Why does everyone think, they can tell me what to do when I have more authority then most of them. - Sun Nov 15 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: What a terrible doctor..... - Sun Nov 15 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Kiyoko. . .I swear people better stop giving you a hard time. - Sun Nov 15 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: At least someone has common sense... - Sun Nov 15 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ............. - Sun Nov 15 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Sun Nov 15 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Are you really going to suspect Kiyoko? - Sun Nov 15 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) literally looks like she could snap in half she CANNOT PICK UP TEN POUNDS. She just looked at him and then waved her hand up and down, "I cannot tear limbs off, do you see my body right now?" She is not only physically weak but has stitches covering her ENTIRE body not to mention bruises and Kuro knew all this he saw her in a WHEELCHAIR days before with a concussion.* - Sun Nov 15 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: Injuries...She could have been injured attacking the victim... - Sun Nov 15 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Kuro I have the authority to take this body to give it an autopsy, if you really must know where I have been I was at the hospital doing my -shift-. - Sun Nov 15 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You know I couldn't have done this because you saw my condition I have been in for a few weeks now. - Sun Nov 15 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: This deceased man is a stranger, I haven't even seen him until I walked up twenty minutes ago to take the body in for autopsy. - Sun Nov 15 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: This whole thing is just becoming more and more of  mess. - Sun Nov 15 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And just so you do know, Kuro. I do have authorization, you've likely seen my sign in at the police station numerous times. - Sun Nov 15 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've never seen it, then again I've never been to the station.   But I do believe in your skill as a medical practicioner. - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: .. Yo, me and Chikyu are headed into the Arena. - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mind if we pass through? Also, this isn't where the guy died. - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: That redhead with the Chakrams dragged the body down here to show it to everyone, from a bit up north by the wall. - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Did you guys find anything else about the woman we are searching for? - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked towards the body as long as Aoi didn't cause any trouble. With the bag in her hand she would start to untip it to pull out a body back and two sets of gloves. "I need two people to put these on and then lift the body into the bag to be taken to the morgue. I can't pick the body up at all due to my stitches." She was examining the gorish scen with her eyes for now, trying to get a hint at what could possibly be the form of death if not from the arms being torn off.* - Sun Nov 15 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Have you questioned the red head? Who drags a body to show it to people? Wouldn't you bring the people to the body? She likely contaminated it a great amount in doing that. - Sun Nov 15 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: It was a male that found it I thought? - Sun Nov 15 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It was a dude, I haven't questioned him, uh... - Sun Nov 15 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: With the round blades on his back. - Sun Nov 15 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Anyway.. headin into the Arena, now. - Sun Nov 15 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright but I need it picked straight up and onto the bag. So I need someone else to help, Kuro... please? - Sun Nov 15 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Kiyoko. . .I can do it myself. . . - Sun Nov 15 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Are you sure? - Sun Nov 15 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I can help. - Sun Nov 15 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Aza I know you are strong but I need the body picked -straight up-. - Sun Nov 15 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You can carry it on your own afterwards but I need it to go straight up so evidence isn't lost. - Sun Nov 15 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Two people. Just please come put the gloves on? - Sun Nov 15 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: I guess I shouldn't inform her of being able to use Chain without turning now then. - Sun Nov 15 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: I could pick it up with -that- but It would creep people out - Sun Nov 15 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: So Kuro isn't a police officer yet this Aoi girl thought that she would listen to him and I didn't have the authority to know who told her to stand here. - Sun Nov 15 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Annoying. - Sun Nov 15 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Oh... this where the incident was - Sun Nov 15 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just pick up the body together straight up and then set it down into the bag and zip it up, if you have other things to do, Aza can carry the body easily enough. - Sun Nov 15 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right, thank you for your help Kuro. - Sun Nov 15 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I have a request. - Sun Nov 15 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stood up as she had only gotten a look really at the arms of the body because she hadn't touched it. Looking up to the man she waited for his request.* - Sun Nov 15 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: When you're done with the autopsy, I wish to cremate him and bring him back to Kumogakure to bury with the rest of my friends and allies. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see, you probably won't be allowed to do that until after the murderer is caught though. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Due to if we need to go back for a second autopsy. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: After that though I will cremate him. - Sun Nov 15 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Thanks. - Sun Nov 15 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Off we go. - Sun Nov 15 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mirai, going to need you. - Sun Nov 15 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm thinking of leaving the village for a while to view the state of the world. If this is all done before I return, let me know.  - Sun Nov 15 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right. - Sun Nov 15 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked over to the table where the body bag was sitting and pulled on a set of gloves and some heavy duty plastic apron, mask, goggles, etc. This was to assure she wasn't going to contaminate the body. She gestured for Mirai to do the same and then sighed out. "This is probably going to take a while to do, I'll need your help inspecting and then cleaning the body." She stared down at the body still laying in the back and then lifted his head some and gestured for Mirai to lift his legs so that she could get the bag out from under the body. It was then sat on another table to look through even if it was likely just sand particles and skin folicles. 

She then looked up to Mirai, "we need to remove his clothing as carefully as possible and set them onto the table with the bag to be examined later. As she removed the clothing from the top of the body she expected Mirai to do the same for the lower half. If they finished that up she would look at the body and then simply think aloud. "Where are the arms?"* - Sun Nov 15 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded to Mirai as she examined but frowned, "No I got all that from various people and put it all together but I mean -where- are the arms? They weren't with the body at the gate when it was found so that means he was killed eslewhere. As far as I'm seeing right now he bled out from the shoulders from blood loss." She went to check his head and various things like that trying to get a look if there were any other injuries. "Go ahead and check his legs and feet for any injuries or anything strange," she wouldn't find anything though but it was good practice? Kiyo thought she wasn't finding anything else but the arms too until she started checking orfices and saw that his tongue was also missing. "Going off what I see he had to of died from his arms because of the type of bleeding going on around the wound, he definitely was alive when both his tongue and the arms were cut off but he would die faster from the arms." She hummed lightly and inspected his chest but found nothing. "I don't really see a reason to open him up for now, we can have the clothing and bag analyzed by the lab to see if they come up with anything that might be DNA related to the perp." She then glanced up to Mirai, "all of this doesn't bother you at all right?"* - Sun Nov 15 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you a police officer? I didn't realize that. - Sun Nov 15 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We need to find the arms.... - Sun Nov 15 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn..yes. Alright. - Sun Nov 15 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: After we take samples from the clothing I will have them sent to Koji or you can take them over. - Sun Nov 15 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 15 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right I kind of wish you had been there sooner to deal with that Aoi girl. Is she really a detective or did she make that up? - Sun Nov 15 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Who? - Sun Nov 15 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The red head who was trying to keep me from taking the body. - Sun Nov 15 04:24:57 2015

She began to go over various measurements and changes to the housing plans but they were all pretty similar to the other houses being built on this street so the contractor knew how to make the changes relatively easily. * - Sun Nov 15 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) tossed on a hard hat and a bright yellow reflective jacket as she walked around the work site carefully.

Hassan trusted her to do this so she was doing her best, Kiyo was smart too so managing the workers wasn't that difficult.* - Sun Nov 15 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) saw a few of the workers slacking and she went over to scold them even as kind as she was.

She saw this going fairly well, soon enough there was an injury on the job site with a nail gun and a foot and she had to go patch the guy up and send him off to the hospital to get a tetnus shot.* - Sun Nov 15 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked back over to the forman after the man who was injured was sent off.

Soon after it was lunch and she ate with the contractors while speaking over the plans for the upper floor and roofing that needed completed.* - Sun Nov 15 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had finished up for the day and the house was complete, a perfect cookie cutter house!

Making her way back to the courtyard.* - Sun Nov 15 05:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) settled down at the desk where there were two comfy chairs near the desk and then a sofa further back. "Sit wherever you are comfortable, do you want some water?" She already had flicked on a little music playing radio in the corner of a hutch that began to play calming traditional japanese flute music.* - Sun Nov 15 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked around, "Umm...no one was using it so I just sort of...took it? Heh... A lot of people don't really mind me taking control usually." She took out a notebook and pen and then wrote a few things down, mainly Aza's name, his age, the date, and time. Titling it 'session two' before looking up to Aza. "Okay since you've been doing so good I'm going to just go ahead and ask you some questions, any you don't want to answer just simply say pass and we will move on. If you start to feel irritated in any way then we will do an exercise to help you calm yourself. Is that understand and okay, Aza?" She was speaking in a sweet tone just above the volume of the music.* - Sun Nov 15 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shook her head to what he said about leaving. "No if something starts to go wrong, I have a panic button under my desk. There are two armed guards outside and a nurse on call waiting. If you get too worked up then they have methods of making you sleep so that you won't cause any harm to anyone. Alright?" If he was okay with that she would move on to her first set of questions. 

"Do you remember when you first felt this 'beast' as you call it?"* - Sun Nov 15 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wrote this down quitely and then waited a bit before asking a second question. "Do you remember if it was just always there since you can remember? Or did something cause it?"* - Sun Nov 15 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded some and watched him, he was doing extremely good. "Does anyone else in your family have this 'beast'?"* - Sun Nov 15 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and put a little star beside that question before moving on. "Do you ever recall a point where you were able to control it, other than recently with music and Nari."* - Sun Nov 15 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) jerked for a moment in fear but froze as he patted her on the head. Swallowing heavily and then smiling followed by a giggle, "That's pretty neat you know? Do you enjoy that you can control that? And use it so freely? I bet...it's 'handy'.~" She tried to make a lame joke to lighten the mood.* - Sun Nov 15 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) giggled girlishly at him insulting her attempt at a joke. "What was that there? What did you just think, Aza?"* - Sun Nov 15 07:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then put a star and a note for what had happened. "When did Nari start to be a method of calm for you?"* - Sun Nov 15 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded, "Just a little while? Like a week or was it instantly like how you made a connection with me to your mother?"* - Sun Nov 15 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked some at him saying this, "does that upset you? Or just sadden your spirits?"* - Sun Nov 15 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Hopefully. . . - Sun Nov 15 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and gave him a soft glance with a gentle smile. "When you came to get me for Nina, you had apparently been there. Had your watching of spars been lifted? And while you were watching how did you feel?"* - Sun Nov 15 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded some and then looked over to him, "when you look at me, does how I look now, the stitches and scars forming. Does it make you remember what happened or does it just make you sad, or do you feel something else?"* - Sun Nov 15 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and gave him a sad smile, "just one last one for today, do you remember anything when the 'beast' comes out?"* - Sun Nov 15 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Should I tell her about Yan finding out about my parents and using it ag- No No. . .don't think about that. - Sun Nov 15 07:50:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stood up and turned off the music before walking over towards Aza, "Do you want a hug?"* - Sun Nov 15 08:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked up to him curiously and then nodded, not liking that the music was off when he had something else to tell her. "Yes."* - Sun Nov 15 08:08:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rubbed his back gently and then lifted her head to look up at him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled warmly but said nothing and then lowered her hand and opened the door, "Should we go have some fresh air then?" She knew she needed to be careful, he was getting very close and if she let him develop personal feelings for her other than the mother figure it might cause him to become heartbroken or lose Nari emotionally and that would mean losing his control factor.* - Sun Nov 15 09:04:51 2015

Further she saw Yan which she hadn't seen for quite a long fucking time now, it felt like ages even. She had wondered where he'd been but assumed it was a mission or something. Just as she was going over to hug the fool she heard Mitsunara screaming and shouting and cursing up a storm. Widening her eyes as she had jumped and turned pale as a ghost.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was really confused about what was going on, was Yan suppose to be dead or something? Was he really gone -too- long by shinobi standards? She just thought he had a long trip you know? She walked up to him and stood on her tip toes to give him a hug. Most of her body was healed but she still had stitches all over her body and a few small nearly healed bruises in places. She also had something new on, a gold and titanium ring around her left ring finger as she hugged him tightly as her wounded body could manage for only as long was considered a friendship hug. Pulling away she peered up to him, "sorry I missed your party, uh... think I was recovering that day? Heh..." She had realized a few days ago she hadn't made it to his party on friday.* - Sun Nov 15 09:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wrinkled her nose at Lera and gave her a little glare before taking out tools to work on the girl. She sat them all out on a tray beside her roll-y stool and leaned forward towards Lera's leg on the bed. "Do you think you can do without healing for another few days? I want to heal it but you'll just end up getting mad at me for feeling tired from overdoing it." She gave Lera a crazy look when Lera said the words 'sweet scar' and shook her head. That led Kiyo to think what she might think of the scars Kiyo was going to have very soon. She cleaned out the wound with some fluid in a little squirt bottle and then stitched up the leg wound and then the others and bandaged them up nice and tight and covered. "I'll change the bandages in the morning after residual bleeding has subsided."* - Sun Nov 15 10:10:33 2015
