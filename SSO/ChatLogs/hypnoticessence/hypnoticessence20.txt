<br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes and then flushed deeply instantly realizing why she wanted her to name it. "I.. but... I wouldn't even know what to name it. I haven't -seen- it or even understood what it is other than multiple elements together."* - Sun Nov 22 16:31:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Just so you know what it looks like. - Sun Nov 22 16:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked as she stared at what looked to be so beautiful but by the shaking of Lera's voice it was very dangerous... not to mention what she had seen. "What does it do?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: In more detail. It destroys objects on an atanomical level. - Sun Nov 22 16:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) suddenly hugged Lera tightly.* - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Don't worry! I'm not going to use it until I'm sure it won't hurt me too, - Sun Nov 22 16:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Pandora's light. - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Oh damn. Thats way better than what I thought of. - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) loosened her hug an looked up to Lera, "do you like it?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Good good. - Sun Nov 22 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...thank you for letting me name it. - Sun Nov 22 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I want you to name all of the techniques I make~ - Sun Nov 22 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt silly and nuzzled down against her chest.* - Sun Nov 22 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nuzzled like a puppy against Lera's chest and neck with little cooes of delight. "Mngn... you're making me feel so gushy."* - Sun Nov 22 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) huffed gently and squirmed after the kiss to the crown of her head, "I don't always, it makes me feel like a goofball."* - Sun Nov 22 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned lightly at being squeezed, "trying to take my breath away!" Gasping in a fake manner as she stuck her tongue out at Lera.* - Sun Nov 22 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) screamed a very light feminine scream as her tongue was caught and then whined gently as she was held there looking pathetic for Lera. "Mngngerg.. stawdp..." * - Sun Nov 22 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled sharply through her nostrils as she was suddenly taken up in a kiss. Moaning lightly as she kissed back and let her eyes lull shut. "Mng..." a rumble in her throat as she shifted atop Lera's body to get a better position to kiss her deeper.* - Sun Nov 22 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's hands shifted up with one against Lera's neck off to the side with only her thumb just over the front of her throat and the other went through the lengthy black locks of hair. Gently holding her in place with a semi firm grip. Kiyo's mind shifted dark for a few moments and she was struggling to keep things gentle....* - Sun Nov 22 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped for air as the kiss broke and then pulled back at what Lera said. Staring into her eyes, "you.. are giving me control?" She craned her head lightly as her hand loosened in the woman's hair. The hand that was over her throat was still ever so faintly pressed against her throat, she hadn't even realized she was doing such.* - Sun Nov 22 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked several times and then smiled a sly grin as she pressed their lips together again and her han shifted so more of her hand was over the front of Lera's throat. Pressing down lightly to keep her head against the cushion of the couch and groaned into their kiss. Her other hand ran over Lera's side from breast, to ribs, to hips and felt all along her body with a slow and rough motion. Her hand found it's way under the woman's jacket and then slipped down into her pants to tease just along the crease of her lower abdomen and thigh. Lightly  brushing her finger tips over the extremely sensitive area that might hint at tickling but mostly was arousing. Just before her finger tips were about to touch the girl's outer right lip, her fingers shifted back up and did the same to the other side.* - Sun Nov 22 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) broke the kiss when she felt the sting of fingernails against her backside. Looking into Lera's eyes with her own auburn set and giving her a look of scolding before leaning forward and biting down on her bottom lip a little hard. She then pulled back and started to kiss down Lera's neck as her hand moved out of the way and up into her hair to hold her in place once more. Forcing her chin to shift up and nibbling at the skin lightly as she went down the girl's neck towards her chest. Finding Lera's collar bone, she bit down a little harder and then began to suck relentlessly with her tongue shifting in circles that was quickly beginning to form a strong hickey.

Fingers ran over her outer lips in a gentle pet but refused to touch her clit or slit directly. Teasing the girl relentlessly as she kept her in control and showed Lera that she was in control regardless that Lera wanted more. Kiyo actually was trying to push Lera to take control back, wondering how long it would take before the woman couldn't take the teasing and would try to take Kiyo just as she had done the night in the bathroom with the shower door.* - Sun Nov 22 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes while staring down at Lera's shoulder as she sucked at her collar bone and then bit harder in response to her begging. She never thought -Lera- of all people woul beg. As a little prize for the begging her index finger rose and then gently started to circle the girl's clit to give her some stimulation but it simply was even more teasing and wasn't going to give any kind of release unless it went on for an extended amount of time. A light snicker sounded in Kiyo's throat as she continued to suck and likely the hickey was going to start becoming achey and painful while drawing arousal out of the woman. The hold in her hair became sharper and more dominating as well, clearly Kiyoko was not new to this.* - Sun Nov 22 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: She's...too...good... - Sun Nov 22 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) lifted her head with a soft chuckle and went to whisper against Lera's ear with a teasing seductive tone. Her finger continued to circle her clit slow and menacing. "If you can cum... just from this... I will give you something -eeeeexxtra- special, my precious pet.~" She had never spoken this way to Lera before. It was as if each word was dripping with sex just before her tongue flicked out to curl behind Lera's ear and pull the lobe past her lips for a slow tugging suck before releasing. Kissing and licking little trails down her neck all the way down her chest and between her breasts before licking back up and taking a broad lick over the hickey that had formed so painfully. The finger on her clit kept it up with the slow circles but every so often gave her clit a soft pinch and then a tug before going back to the circles. She was trying to tease Lera into her clit swelling and becoming extra sensitive.* - Sun Nov 22 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) chuckled again as the girl couldn't cum from the soft touches and pinches. She latched onto her clit and rolled it aroun between her finger tips as she whispered against her ear again. "Awww, so adorable... are you sure you can't cum for me? Course maybe you are scared of what the extra something is? Maybe we should forget that.... I'll just make you cum a couple of times in a row until you can't walk. How does that sound?" Of course she was trying to egg the girl on as she squeezed her clit and tugged at it in all directions slowly. She was trying her hardest to get Lera to cum while maintaining the same slow and soft pressure of things.* - Sun Nov 22 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) switched her hand position as soon as Lera started to cum. The butt of her palm was pressed against Lera's clit and rubbed hard in circles to lengthen her climax and send her over the top. As she continued to do so she leaned forward and whispered into her ear as the woman was orgasming. "That's a good girl, cum for me.~ Maybe I should hold off on that extra bit till next time? Aren't you all tuckered out?" She chuckled against the woman's ear as she came down from her high.* - Sun Nov 22 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Mnnn I did tell you I knew how to dominate you. - Sun Nov 22 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Good at this.... - Sun Nov 22 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) slowly made her way down Lera's body, kissing here and there as she stripped the woman's pants down her hips...thighs, and past her knees. Spreading her legs so that one was high up on the back of the couch with her ankles traped in her pants, Kiyo reached under Lera's ass and gripped her hips from the backside before lifting her up so her hips were elavated. "If you don't like your treat.... then you can always tell me to stop, just say the word and I'll back off." She kissed the woman's inner thigh and licked across the juices over her outer left lip as she trailed her tongue downwards. 

Her tongue didn't stop when it reached the end of her slit, but instead continued down as Kiyo parted the woman's cheeks lightly and her tongue snaked down in a curl between the girl's cheeks. She spread Lera's ass cheeks a bit wider and watched the woman's face for a reaction as her tongue tip stretched back just above her pucker and then licked up towards her lips again. Her tongue extended back out after the test to see if Lera hadn't stopped her, preparing for another taste.* - Sun Nov 22 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) spotted the hand rubbing her clit and snickered lightly as her tongue pressed against the tight virgin pucker and began to lick in tight and soft circles. She kept up the lapping and her chest made a light moan of pleasure at pleasuring Lera in this way. Her movements became soft and she massaged Lera's hips and cheeks with her hands gently while holding her hips up. Ever so slowly her tongue began to massage with more and more pressure, trying to relax and stimulate the nerve endings. Every so often, she'd get a taste of Lera's pussy juices slipping down her slit and against her tongue, sending a chill of pleasure down Kiyoko's spine.* - Sun Nov 22 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned as she indulged and then dipped her tongue inside of the virgin rim Lera willingly presented to her. Her lips pressed against the girl's ass cheeks as she closed her eyes and felt her upper lip becoming marked with the girl's sex. "Mnng..." Licking and sucking gently as she sent her tongue deeperand circled about her insides. Wanting the girl to cum over her face if she wanted to, and squeezing down hard on Lera's ass with her fingers.* - Sun Nov 22 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gagged for air as Lera forced her nose in against the woman's bottom edge of her slit. "Mngngnn!?!" she didn't dare open her eyes knowing she was about to be coated in the cum from above. Her tongue worked double time as Kiyoko helped Lera through the rest of her orgasm. When the legs released her, Kiyoko sat up quickly and fell back on the couch with her face caked and dripping in pussy juice. Gasping for air with her cheeks bright red and her trying to get some air back in her lungs. "Nng..." of course this meant Lera's hips would fall back down to the cushion of the couch she had soaked in her cum.* - Sun Nov 22 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned as she was pulled back towards Lera, she felt tired, her jaw hurt...and she only could taste and smell sex. "Nng.." she closed her eyes as she panted and the cum across her face up to her bottom eye lashes was beginning to dry into white flakes.* - Sun Nov 22 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) closed her eyes and while Lera licked her clean she began to flush a deep red over her entire face in embarrassment, the roles quickly changing...* - Sun Nov 22 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Amazing... - Sun Nov 22 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Love you... - Sun Nov 22 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) turned her face away after feeling ashamed of being cleaned up in that manner. "L-love you too."* - Sun Nov 22 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Nngn..y-yes. - Sun Nov 22 19:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You might roll an ankle trying to get up now. - Sun Nov 22 19:27:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shrugged lightly and laid the dresses over one of the chairs at the end of the rack. "Bryson is just a priest who is always demanding I become more pure than I already am, he hates that he can't figure out why I'm so pure, maybe even more than him, yet I am with a woman. It drives him crazy." She chuckled a bit, "he kind of is obsessed with it."* - Mon Nov 23 01:56:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He couldn't even face the fact when looking at my aura. - Mon Nov 23 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Of course it isn't, they make up whatever they need. - Mon Nov 23 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Said I was speaking blasphemy. - Mon Nov 23 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yet, necromancers are deemed to be 'evil'. - Mon Nov 23 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes...and he's permitted to sin to hate you. - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Which I then scolded him on how wrong that was. - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That just because he's 'good' doesn't mean he should be allowed to sin to deal with 'evil.'. - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: As for your purity. That is a lie. Beings are never 'pure'. - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He did not like that very much. - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Because you'll always have something that isn't 'right' within you. - Mon Nov 23 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Like a quirk. - Mon Nov 23 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh. - Mon Nov 23 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: The only thing that's obscured to be 'pure' is the energy that those priests use. - Mon Nov 23 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But everyone says I'm the nicest and purest person they know. - Mon Nov 23 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Think about it this way.. - Mon Nov 23 02:04:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That's why 'purity' is just a tool for priests to brainwash people. - Mon Nov 23 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well I'm not pure because they want me to be. - Mon Nov 23 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Or... mostly pure I guess. - Mon Nov 23 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're not 'pure' at all. - Mon Nov 23 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't think that is true. - Mon Nov 23 02:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're telling me you've never lusted after anything? - Mon Nov 23 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What did you see that was 'unpure'? - Mon Nov 23 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...well of course. - Mon Nov 23 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Exactly.. - Mon Nov 23 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: When you spoke of being even more pure than Bryson.. - Mon Nov 23 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That isn't the instance I mean... about being pure. - Mon Nov 23 02:06:43 2015
