<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Your heart doesn't beat at a normal rate when you are tired because it can't make as strong of a beat. So it gives faster weaker contractions instead to make up for the weakness. - Sun Nov 22 10:28:54 2015

I hope for your sake that it's true. I went out of my way, in my free time to help you. All of the sessions I do for people aren't on the clock you know? And I don't even charge you... it's sort of my personal want to help you and then you just toss it in my face and do things that I told you not to do because they are going to harm you... or upset you..." She twitched her nose, "I'm just trying to say that I do care...even if I seem upset right now." 

Her head turned to look back towards Hassan, "we can talk whenever."* - Sun Nov 22 10:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean... you decide what is illegal or not, illegal isn't what bothers me... it's the possibility you could end up hurt. And yeah... taking smaller doses for a longer period of time like a treatment... usually when steroids is used to boost the body it is much more focused and in large quantities. - Sun Nov 22 11:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Hmmmm....Maybe I should teach her shuriken manipulation as well... - Sun Nov 22 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I bet she could use wires with the Kukiri when she gets them... - Sun Nov 22 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched her display the jutsu and then felt her moving behind her. Looking back over her shoulder to Lera and her cheeks heated lightly at being shown how to use a jutsu this way. She had to admit she enjoyed it... Her hand was guided out to show how to thrust her palm forward and when to release. Her breathing picked up and she held back her comments on the method of teaching. "O-okay I think I got that," she brought her hands together in a small clap and then thrust her hand forward slower than normal and released her chakra through her arm at the precise moment Lera had shown her. A tiny gust of wind was formed but nothing spectacular. 

Inhaling and sighing out she focused her energy again and brought her hands together this time in a slightly more emphasized clap. Stiring her chakra as soon as her hands had met together and then flowing it from her lungs out through her shoulder, arm, and finally through her palm. A small gust swished out before the two of them as Lera stood behind Kiyo. "That wasn't terrible..." muttered from her pale lips.

She tried a few more times and eventually after she had clapped and given a fluid motion of her arm forward in a thrust she had achieved the beginning of the jutsu. Having figured it out she looked back over her shoulder towards Lera. "Is that right?"* - Sun Nov 22 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Not bad at all. See? I told you, you're a natural at this. - Sun Nov 22 14:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You pick. - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh... - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hm. - Sun Nov 22 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I assume you already know Suimen right? - Sun Nov 22 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nope. - Sun Nov 22 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: You don't? - Sun Nov 22 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm a sad shinobi. - Sun Nov 22 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Not really, its odd how it doesn't seem to get taught in the academy these days. - Sun Nov 22 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: With your chakra control though, it'll be a cakewalk. - Sun Nov 22 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Need to make some water for her to walk on... - Sun Nov 22 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Let me just make a little pool, for you to practice walking on. - Sun Nov 22 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I had a special kind of academy experience... - Sun Nov 22 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Special kind...? - Sun Nov 22 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Well, don't you worry love. Whatever you want to learn, I'll do my very best to teach you. - Sun Nov 22 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Like...I don't know how to use Kukiri, but I should be able to show you the basic form right? - Sun Nov 22 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked at the tiny pond and blinked some. "You really are incredible..." She stepped next to the pool and stared down at herself, looking over the face paint across her nose and eyes. "Yeah, I was simply sped taught the basics, given a book to read, read it... took the exam. They were only trying to get me to be qualified for the hospital, not be a 'real' shinobi. That's why I have no fighting experience. I became a shinobi in the middle of one afternoon. As for the kukiri, I definitely think you can show me a thing or two."* - Sun Nov 22 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. If you trust me, I'll do everything I can. - Sun Nov 22 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyway, i'll show you how to do Suimen. - Sun Nov 22 15:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked a few times as she watched, it looked impossible and she didn't believe it to be possible except that Lera was doing it and she had heard of it before. Course Lera could fly so the impossible existed... She channeled chakra into her feet and slowly tested the water. At first her shoe sank into the water a small amount and she lifted it to try again. Testing it several times before walking out without much trouble.* - Sun Nov 22 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stepped closer and kissed Lera back with a gentle leaning down towards her. "Hush, don't be rediculous."* - Sun Nov 22 15:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded some, "of course."* - Sun Nov 22 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright....you're gonna need some shuriken and some wires.... - Sun Nov 22 15:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh... I don't have those things. - Sun Nov 22 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched how she controlled the wire and the shuriken. She didn't see how she was going to do something like that but then tried to take the wire and shuriken from her after unwrapping it from the rock and chose a bigger rock to test on since the small one would be too small of a target. She focused in on the rock and tossed the shuriken out with the wire loose for now, when it just had went a small amount past the rock she then twitched her finger similarly but it dropped because she had done so too hard.

Huffing gently she realed it back in and tossed the shuriken again, this time she was more gentle and it only curved off to the side a small amount. Realing in once more she tossed it and got a middle ground as the shuriken wrapped about the rock a single time and locked into place against the other side of the wire. "Okay...that's not that hard... I thought it would be more difficult," course it was more difficult than that, but it seemed that Kiyo had a natural knack for what she had just done.* - Sun Nov 22 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I am? - Sun Nov 22 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean... Yeah, of course I am. - Sun Nov 22 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah...that was fast. Really fast. - Sun Nov 22 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Next i'm gonna find out that you actually have all five elements and never realised. - Sun Nov 22 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no, I really don't. - Sun Nov 22 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh huh... - Sun Nov 22 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shoved Lera's shoulder weakly, "Hmph... are we done then or do you have more to show me?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I can show you more if you want me too. - Sun Nov 22 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not really tired. - Sun Nov 22 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Okay. Then, i'll show you how to break a genjutsu. - Sun Nov 22 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) jumped with the foreign shinobi spawned in front of her. They were from all regions since she wasn't particularly scared of any one foreign country but was warry of all of them. She peered around and spun before Lera had touched her and she felt the freezing of her chakra and then a surge as the clones disappeared. Gasping for air at the surge going through her body she turned to look towards Lera and nodded solumnly at the description of the jutsu.

Putting her hands together and focusing all of her control, while also having her sensing active since it put her in better touch with her own chakra network, she managed to shut it off instantly. Now her sensing had shut off for the moment and she struggled to give the surge back but in a moment she had flushed chakra through her body and gasped again with a shudder. "I think I got it," she looked up and the clones were gone once again.* - Sun Nov 22 16:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) chuckled, "I think maybe we should rest now.... that was a lot."* - Sun Nov 22 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright~ Home? Or back to the square. - Sun Nov 22 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Up to you. - Sun Nov 22 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Because I am nice.~ - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And considerate.~ - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And I love you.~ - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I already knew that! - Sun Nov 22 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Its good to relax...~ - Sun Nov 22 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And Actually...I have a question! - Sun Nov 22 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) curled up into her lap with shoes off. When Lera mentioned a question, Kiyo rose her chin to perch on Lera's arm across the couch. "Ask away, love?"* - Sun Nov 22 16:20:28 2015
