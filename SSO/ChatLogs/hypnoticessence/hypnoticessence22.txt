<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced up as the boy fell to the ground, she saw the child and rose her brow at his blasting music. The music was ...extremely calming to her. It even scent chills over her skin for a moment as she heard it blasting faintly out of the earphones. She pretended she was still reading, when her eyes remained trained on the middle of the page and listened to the song through the silence of the courtyard.* - Wed Nov 25 14:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rubbed her lips together and closed her eyes. Sighing out heavily as she heard the boy begin to sing along to the tune. Her stomach fluttered and her breath hitched as she listened to the lyrics and had to close her book slowly. Setting it down on the bench between herself and Lera. She lowered her head as thoughts of the not to long ago past came to mind. She ran her right hand's fingers over the gold and titanium ring on her left hand. Telling herself that Lera's love and their soon to be marriage would repair the pain she had been feeling lately. Kiyoko had been hiding it well from others, except Bryson honestly, and now it seemed that just two songs were forcing it out of her. Eyes burned as she closed them and tried to stop the emotions from coming out. At this point she was trembling and trying to ignore the music she was hearing so that the emotions would be locked away again.* - Wed Nov 25 14:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's brow crumpled and her bottom lip trembled. She felt hot tears running in streaks down her face as she lowered her head into her palms trying to close out those around her so they wouldn't see her struggling to keep her emotions in check. Several things were being realized and remembered, as the song persisted she forced herself to take a heavy breath and then wiped her tears. <Stop fucking crying.>* - Wed Nov 25 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned and then stood up and started to put her book away. She had to get away before she started crying again. Maybe she could go do some work at the hospital or something. She looked at the boy as she passed him but made sure to start walking away quickly if he hadn't tried to say anything or noticed her.* - Wed Nov 25 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stopped in her tracks and turned around to face him with slightly blood shot eyes and a weak smile. She sniffled, "Yes?"* - Wed Nov 25 15:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked the young boy over, "I uh... My mother used to make them, I don't have all that many of them anymore." She smiled sweetly hiding the pain as it started to go to the back of her mind.* - Wed Nov 25 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled to the boy a bit brighter, "thank you...that is very kind of you. I... like your music." With that she turned and started to leave again since he looked to be laying down again.* - Wed Nov 25 15:33:07 2015
