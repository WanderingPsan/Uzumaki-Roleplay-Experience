<br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Oh, that's a good one. Y'know any clone techniques? -- I'm getting off topic. I need ninjutsu thrown at me so I can practice my chakra absorbtion. - Fri Nov 20 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...no...this is the only ninjutsu I know other than my healing. - Fri Nov 20 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Ah. Well I'd offer, but I'm sure Lera got you covered. Anywho, go throw some ninjutsu at me. - Fri Nov 20 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: She's going to start teaching me again yea--oh.. like right here? - Fri Nov 20 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) whispers: Eh. Training field works. - Fri Nov 20 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okays. - Fri Nov 20 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) fell to the sand and groaned heavily. She hated that jutsu terribly... She stood up and forme handseals before shooting her hand out and curling her wrist some to send out the tornadoes towards his location.* - Fri Nov 20 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: its fine - Fri Nov 20 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes and her jaw dropped. For a moment she didn't attack again but only saw what had happened. She was utterly stunned and soon after he told her to attack again she quickly flicked her wrist again with a twist and sent out more tornadoes towards his position. By this point sand would likely be flying every where. Her technique was good but she wasn't the most skill wind user by far.* - Fri Nov 20 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: After the chuunin exams. - Fri Nov 20 17:43:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Huh? - Fri Nov 20 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Joining what? - Fri Nov 20 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) huffed at him insulting the power of her wind and then twisted her wrist again and flung both out. She was still very inexperienced so this -really- was all she could do.* - Fri Nov 20 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Huh? - Fri Nov 20 17:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: The exams. - Fri Nov 20 17:47:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . I'd rather not. - Fri Nov 20 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You owe me. - Fri Nov 20 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: That may be true. - Fri Nov 20 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: But, I'm really not ready in any way what so ever. - Fri Nov 20 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: ready - Fri Nov 20 17:48:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Kazekage. - Fri Nov 20 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yo? - Fri Nov 20 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: My apologies for before, That won't happen again. - Fri Nov 20 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I already sined you up... - Fri Nov 20 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov 20 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sorry about that, thought you would be more excited. - Fri Nov 20 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Then I'll be purposely failing in the first round. - Fri Nov 20 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Hope you don't mind. - Fri Nov 20 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Give it your all or i'll pass you. - Fri Nov 20 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov 20 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Wouldn't that be even more reason not to try? - Fri Nov 20 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Again, I'd rather not. - Fri Nov 20 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Aza... it will help you strengthen yourself and prepare for when you are ready to pass it. - Fri Nov 20 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You should take it. - Fri Nov 20 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Nah. - Fri Nov 20 17:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Anyway. . . - Fri Nov 20 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Gonna go back to the house. - Fri Nov 20 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: You guys. . .have fun or what not. - Fri Nov 20 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wasn't angry with his comment but she wasn't happy with it either. When he asked to take a break she lowered her hand. It seemed as though her efforts had taken hardly any of her chakra at all, and she was far from breaking a sweat over using the jutsu several times rapidly in a row, likely thanks to the control she held.* - Fri Nov 20 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Nifty technique, though. - Fri Nov 20 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Although. . Hrm. . -- Well, I guess it makes sense she taught you that. You need to learn a low-leveled technique before you learn the stronger ones, after all. - Fri Nov 20 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: She only got to teach me one before I was injured. - Fri Nov 20 18:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov 20 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*tries hard not to look at Aza*> Seems legit. - Fri Nov 20 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And what about your medical work. .? Still havn't found anyone to help? - Fri Nov 20 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mirai is learning but no, seems I have to teach myself. - Fri Nov 20 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Tragic. Hrm. . . I'll see about getting you guys some scrolls or somethin'. - Fri Nov 20 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thats nice of you. - Fri Nov 20 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: The chakra scalpel technique. That's the only one that comes to mind. - Fri Nov 20 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mhm. It ain't no problemo. <*Looks to the crowd*> You guys trying to use the arena? - Fri Nov 20 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Nah. . .I'm just leaving. - Fri Nov 20 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. Good look with that chunnin exam. - Fri Nov 20 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You joinin' Kiyoko? - Fri Nov 20 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...... - Fri Nov 20 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) burst into a little chuckle.* - Fri Nov 20 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No... no no. - Fri Nov 20 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh. . ? - Fri Nov 20 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Why? I'm sure you're plenty strong. - Fri Nov 20 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You just saw me use my one and only offensive attack. - Fri Nov 20 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. . Hrm. I guess that makes sense. And you don't have your weapon yet either. - Fri Nov 20 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Nope. - Fri Nov 20 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not about ranks anyway. - Fri Nov 20 18:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Makes sense, I guess. It's not like being a chunnin will suddenly make you any more or less important as a medic. - Fri Nov 20 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Aren't ya like in charge of the hospital anyhow? - Fri Nov 20 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, I am. - Fri Nov 20 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I would only raise myself in rank if it was necessary for security clearance. - Fri Nov 20 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mmm. . .You probably won't even need to take some exam. He'll probably just promote you. - Fri Nov 20 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm. - Fri Nov 20 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho. What's up now? Kinda done training for the day. - Fri Nov 20 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn... what do you want to do? I didn't even get tired from that. I need Lera to teach me more techniques. - Fri Nov 20 18:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You're lucky to have Lera, y'know. She taught me how to use Doton. On a side note. . Uh. I'm unsure. - Fri Nov 20 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What do you usually do? - Fri Nov 20 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uh... well I mean I usually go around helping people... but Aza just walked off, Akira had a session earlier... no one's hurt.... - Fri Nov 20 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And I know I'm lucky.~ - Fri Nov 20 18:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) jumped under Sanoke's arm and grumbled as she felt her heart racing from his little teleport jumping shit. She groaned as he flicked her forehead and reached up to rub at the reddening mark. "It's just that most everyone needs me usually so I am always busy..."* - Fri Nov 20 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked at the mention of a green haired girl. She tapped her chin and couldn't think of anyone with green hair. "Eh? And I get free time sometime... I spend it with...Lera." Her cheeks flushing faintly.* - Fri Nov 20 18:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, you probably don't know her. And that's good, I'd hate for you to just be some workhorse all day. I've known people like that, and they're never happy/ - Fri Nov 20 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But I'm happy, Sanoke-san. - Fri Nov 20 18:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Good. Anywho, probably going to see what's going on in the square. - Fri Nov 20 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Want a lift? - Fri Nov 20 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah...why not... - Fri Nov 20 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: *Sigh* - Fri Nov 20 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...it makes me sick but I am trying to get used to it. - Fri Nov 20 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh! I mean, I could go slower. I use shunshin off the time. Hop on. - Fri Nov 20 18:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) crawled onto his back, not liking that she was going to be carried this way since she had a dress on.* - Fri Nov 20 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned as they came to a stop in the square. Dizzy as all get out...* - Fri Nov 20 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Huh? - Fri Nov 20 18:43:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her inner cheek and flushed bright red as she was taken into Lera's arms with that look in her eyes. "Hmph...."* - Fri Nov 20 18:49:48 2015
