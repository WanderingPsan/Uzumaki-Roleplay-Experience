<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: (no worries :) - Thu Nov 12 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was pretty much sitting in the middle of the courtyard in her wheelchair with a book in lap. She had on a very plain dress because it was the easiest thing to get on and some sandles. All over her exposed body was stitched up areas, large bruises, and scabs that were black from growing a few days old. Luckily enough she no longer had on bandages or the bandage wrapped around her head because of the concussion so she didn't look -as- bad as she could. All things considered though? She looked like hell. Upon her face was no face paint which Lera had never seen before, the only reason her family was cutting her some slack was due to how bad of a condition she was in. There was a single fold in Kiyoko's brow as if she was either concentrating or not in a good mood.* - Thu Nov 12 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) put the book down as soon as she saw Lera. Giving her a grim smile as she tried to figure out the best way to talk about this. "I have been looking for you everywhere..." spoke out in a harsh tone, it was the only thing she could really come up with at the moment.* - Thu Nov 12 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: How though...who...? - Thu Nov 12 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stared down at Lera's hand and then smiled. "Will you promise not to be mad at anyone?"* - Thu Nov 12 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed heavily and shut her eyes.* - Thu Nov 12 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: May I ask what happened? - Thu Nov 12 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reopened her eyes, she would have liked to respond to Kurt but with Lera here... after everything that had happened and not having seen her in days she was fairly focused on the woman at her feet. "I went by myself, Lera... I -truly- understand how bad of an idea that was now, at least for speaking about what we were trying to speak about..."* - Thu Nov 12 13:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gripped Lera's hand after the kiss when she mentioned about not being mad at her. "I'm not worried about you being mad at -me-, don't be mad at -him-." She was looking at her very seriously on this matter.* - Thu Nov 12 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I won't...but...next time...next time let me be there...? - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yes, he already agreed. - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And we will do it at the hospital, with armed guards outside... and Nari there when necessary. - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: ...and a panic button... - Thu Nov 12 13:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shifted her eyes off to the side.* - Thu Nov 12 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was just kind of ashamed. :|* - Thu Nov 12 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: There's something I need to tell you in private, it's a story about something that happened afterwards. - Thu Nov 12 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Rather right afterwards. - Thu Nov 12 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Alright.. - Thu Nov 12 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced back towards Kurt, "I just got in over my head and tried to do something on my own that I shouldn't. It's alright now, nothing time can't fix."* - Thu Nov 12 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Very well. - Thu Nov 12 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) glanced up to Lera, "where ever you feel comfortable."* - Thu Nov 12 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *nod* Right... - Thu Nov 12 13:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was wheeled in and didn't move from where she sat, "So... this is a little bit long...okay maybe telling it won't be so long but it -felt- like forever."* - Thu Nov 12 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out heavily and then began to speak again, "after what happened to me and people had shown up ...kind of right when it happened, Yan and some one else were trying to help me and Yan was going to have to be the one to help me because no one else had the control to help or even think about doing something a medic was needed for. There were no medics around...but me... so I was trying to tell him what to do. Then there was this man that showed up I guess while they were fighting Aza and he walked over and just started doing stuff, I had no idea who he was and he was helping me. He got me stable and then they took me into Yan's house. See... I had been thrown out of the house and across the desert... a good fifty feet because of my weight, I ... was really bad, because of that there was a lot of sand inside of my wounds that had to be removed to avoid me getting an infection and dying. If Yan had done this I probably would have died." 

Pausing as she caught her breath, "So he took me into the bathroom, all of this strictly professional of course. He kept trying to make sure I was alright with everything, not wanting me to feel violated and I kept telling him to just shut up and get on with it. Before we had actually entered the bathroom though I had muttered something about you by name, I think that there were a lot of people coming into the house and someone joked about everyone watching me in the bath and I muttered something along the lines of 'Oh Lera will love that.' Eh..." She chuckled and rubbed her cheek some. "Anyhow, he took me in, stripped me down to my undergarments and all that, then he was going to have to flush the sand out of my wounds. Lera.... I don't know if you've ever had to do this before..... god help you if you have but I've never experienced anything other than stubbing my toe or cutting myself on a kitchen knife before this point." She shook her head with gooseflesh coming over her body just thinking about it.

"I've had to do this to patients before but to actually feel it and have to go through it over your entire body? God... it was hell, and the man said it was worse than hell that he had to put me through. He was working through all of them, most of them were bad and I screamed, cried... all that...but he talked to me about you the entire time. Asked me all about you and -us- and just keeping me going by thinking about you and about my career and how you were helping me learn and decide how to fight. When it got to my back and chest is when it got to the worst part..." She reached up and pulled down the top of her dress enough to show Lera what she was talking about. There was one that was horizontal across her chest right under the collar bones that was twenty stitches long, there were three others that were situated very close to her breasts. One was nearly on the breast while one was right between them on the sternum and the other just below one of her breasts. Pulling the dress back up she continued knowing how serious this would have looked compared to any of her other wounds seen.

"They were the worst, I passed out a few times but he took breaks, he kept me talking, he was kind... and gentle... he made sure everything was alright even after I had told him how weak I was and that I was to be treated like a civilian due to my lack of hardening from fighting. He finished all that and then cleaned me up, gave me clothes he had sealed away and the shirt off his own back he had been wearing earlier... put me to bed and then told me who he was." She looked over to Lera. "He told me who he was and I listened and then I told him how much of a fool he was for healing me, I told him after all the hours that I was in that shower with him being tortured by his sheer will to save me how stupid he was for his actions. He had called himself a murderer at some point as I laid in the bed, I guess to give some impact to who he was. I told him after all of that if he hadn't killed me himself that he wasn't a murderer that he was a hero. He told me that I had changed his decision on something, that I had changed his views on something very important to him and because I was alive that you would remain alive as well until I passed away, that no harm would come to me from his hand or anyone under him." 

She looked the girl over making sure she was still focused, "then I asked him what it would take to assure you were never touched even after my death. He told me that if I became the best doctor across the world that you would never have your life taken by him, and would be safe. I told him that I supposed I couldn't fulfill that promise, I told him about how Mitsunara had told me there were two kinds of doctors, ones who do it for themselves and ones who do it only for the patient who are self destructive. I told him all about how I didn't care if it was self destructive and that I chose to be that person my entire life and that even while I was hurt by Aza that I was doing that very stupid thing of self destructing to save someone else and even after what he had done I was screaming to tell the people not to kill him and I was going to help him again after I had healed. The man then told me that because I was a compassionate doctor, and that I was already so compassionate that in his book I was the best doctor at the moment and had me promise that I would continue to be the best, not just the best that I can try. Then he told me that you were safe, that he was never going to hunt you again, and that even after I die of old age that you will be protected, Lera."

She paused for a moment, "This man's name was Ortho."* - Thu Nov 12 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) swallowed hard as she peered down to Lear. The words that she spoke were enough to throw Kiyoko into a full blown emotional trance of knowing exactly what she wanted to say, it's what she wanted to say the first time she heard Lera say it but was too scared to follow through. "I love you, Lera, and I'm never going anywhere. I'll be by your side until my days are numbered and then if it's even possible I will be there as a hand on your shoulder to help you push on without me there to tell you that you are amazing." Tears trickled down her face, knowing how much this was likely to impact Lera, she hadn't even done it intentionally until she had found out who Ortho was and then was determined to clear her name with him. "I hope this didn't scare you that I was in his care, I can't think of anything better to come out of this situation than what has."* - Thu Nov 12 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: No... no you don't owe him. I owe him, okay? - Thu Nov 12 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: In a way...he save both of our lives. - Thu Nov 12 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I don't think I can handle it again. If I lost you...I'm not strong enough. - Thu Nov 12 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled wide, "Weeeeell, hey now I like to think -I- saved your life.~"* - Thu Nov 12 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....teasing of course. - Thu Nov 12 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. It was already yours to begin with. - Thu Nov 12 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Thu Nov 12 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reached out to take Lera's chin and leaned forward to kiss her deeply. She wondered if Lera had never realized that she didn't say she loved her before and that this was the first time. Regardless it didn't matter, Lera knew all along that Kiyoko loved her and that was all that mattered.* - Thu Nov 12 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Am I...making sense? - Thu Nov 12 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) swallowed hard and nodded without a word but a single exhale with her lips pursed slightly. She was struggling to even stay sane with how Lera was talking, "whoever knew saving someone's life would have such an impact on them. Hah..."* - Thu Nov 12 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I want to...but not yet...first I'll buy a ring. - Thu Nov 12 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) chuckled with a bit of embarrassment as her cheeks reddened, "Yeah... me too. I think you should probably meet my family as soon as I'm better."* - Thu Nov 12 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. I'll start preparing my best 'nice' girl speech. - Thu Nov 12 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Don't pretend, you be you. - Thu Nov 12 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know you want me to stay around them but if they can't accept you then I don't want them. - Thu Nov 12 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I feel like I should tell her my dark secret...I don't want her to think bad of me... - Thu Nov 12 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah... I suppose. - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lera can I ask you something. - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Go ahead. - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you... really do those things to him? - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do what...? - Thu Nov 12 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you torture him - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: *? - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Torture Ortho? what?? - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I assume thats who you're talking about. - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You, Kirie, Violet, and Elon were named as people who had tortured him. - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What really? I've never tortured anyone in my life. - Thu Nov 12 14:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Have you told him this? - Thu Nov 12 14:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Truthfully. I had no idea as to why he was doing what he was doing. - Thu Nov 12 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It was completely random and out of no-where. - Thu Nov 12 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did those other three? - Thu Nov 12 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't speak for Elon or Kirie. But for definite, Violet was too kind to do something like that. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He said you all were 'named'. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Said it many times. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So this was why he was after my life...? - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And why he killed Violet? - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I...don't understand though. Me and Violet never did a thing to him. - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In fact. I was alone surviving on that forest island - Thu Nov 12 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: FOr well over a month and i'd spoken to Ortho just fine moments before I left. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He only admitted to killing Violet and Elon. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: This is why I'm confused. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then it seems it was all a big misunderstanding. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...somebody did say to me that they believed someone else killed Kirie. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...this thing he things you and others did. - Thu Nov 12 14:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Part of it was just physical torture which he believed you to be part of. - Thu Nov 12 14:46:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So for one you need to get your flu shot. - Thu Nov 12 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Eh, no thanks! - Thu Nov 12 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) started to pull on her gloves and set out a shot and alcohlic wipes and all that. "Shush, you get a sucker afterwards."* - Thu Nov 12 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'll give you a sucker - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh....I don't know.... - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yan. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You know me. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not going to hurt you. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Eh..it's just...I don't do needles. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Can I take a pill? - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lucky for you I'm even in my right mind again, most of the village had to get their shots while I was loopy on drugs because Hassan wanted me to do them. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No, but I can do a nose inhalation. - Thu Nov 12 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Sounds better. - Thu Nov 12 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded to the chair beside her, "Come sit." She pulled out the more expensive method of delivering the vaccine. "You know even Tetsumi toughed it out, thought you would be braver."* - Thu Nov 12 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reached up for his jaw and chin to hold him still and then she put this little device under his right nostril. "Inhale quickly and deeply, you will feel a powder....and it will feel strange."* - Thu Nov 12 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) did the same to the other nostril and then threw the item away. She wasn't sure why he had winced but she was professional so auto assumed perhaps his jaw was sore from training. Releasing his jaw she pulled off her gloves and tossed them in the waste basket. "I want to talk about how you and Hassan suddenly decided to -force- Aza into a time limit of getting his ability under control. What happened to letting me work on it? Aza has been getting better already, he stopped himself from attacking Bryson when there was an incident concerning me and he has found two new ways of controlling the urge to grow angry. So why the sudden rush to cause him stress and not allow me to do my job?"* - Thu Nov 12 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm simply following orders. - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I think we made progress, too. - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What you did was make him nervous. - Thu Nov 12 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And him nervous means halted progression. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ....Such a weak-willed ninja. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Let me handle i-... - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm sorry to be rude, Kiyoko. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) folded her brow as she looked down at the table.* - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But what I told him should invigorate him to defeat this mental disease. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It shouldn't deter him. - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He did something horrible, and that horrible thing he did..should fuel his desire to never lose control again. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Allow me to do this, I went through quite a lot to help him already all things considered and I know it looks like he just beat a weak little girl up but I'm still wanting to help him not only because I have love for my position but because he's my friend. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Instead it's making him depressed, Yan. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I haven't seen him eat. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He must be stronger then. - Thu Nov 12 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And every time someone mentions what happens he puts his hood up, or lowers his head, or get's quiet. - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Talk to Hassan, get an OK and let me know. - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Worry about stronger after he is able to control it, okay? - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...fine. - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) muttered, "That won't be awkward at all."* - Thu Nov 12 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Do you and Hassan not get along? - Thu Nov 12 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...no that's not it...we get along very well...but I'm dating his daughter and I haven't figured out if he knows that yet. - Thu Nov 12 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Dating..Oh. - Thu Nov 12 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) isnt gay.* - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You think it's something to work past? - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The awkwardness, yeah.... - Thu Nov 12 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh, yeah. I suppose. No that's all... - Thu Nov 12 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Wait..what did you think I meant? - Thu Nov 12 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That maybe he didn't like his daughter being with women... or maybe with people who are weird and wear face paint all the time, or someone who is weak...I don't know.. - Thu Nov 12 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You're a good woman. I think he'd be pleased. - Thu Nov 12 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and started to clean up the desk. "See you later Yan."* - Thu Nov 12 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked up to Hassan looking reasonably better but still stitched up to fucking high heaven and having bruises that were healing. She looked much more like her normal self in the eyes though, "Sir, could I speak with you privately?"* - Thu Nov 12 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I believe that's Hassan's decision. - Thu Nov 12 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: He told me to come to you... - Thu Nov 12 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I figured as much. - Thu Nov 12 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I don't do private chats. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: .... - Thu Nov 12 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Just tell me here. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Well that's a lie. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Get a letter of reccommendation from two high-ranking officials. After that, return with them to me and I will discuss it with you. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ..That's what I meant, Sir. Just quiet enough that people can't hear. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: ... - Thu Nov 12 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Privacy usually means away from others. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stepped over to stand beside him and then lowered her voice.* - Thu Nov 12 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But this is easier. - Thu Nov 12 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Yan told me I needed to speak with you for the final say on removing your time restriction on Aza controlling his skill. I have been working on him and took this job upon myself to fix, I know what happened was ... quite hard to over look but I hope the fact I am still helping him after what he did is a sign of how much this means to me as a shinobi and a nurse. - Thu Nov 12 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: *as a shinobi and as a nurse, Sir. - Thu Nov 12 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: .....Are you seriously asking me that? - Thu Nov 12 22:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: Hassan told me to come to you for a subject like this.. - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: How about this, i'll check in on him in 1 month, and if I see progress, I will extend the time limit. - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: That is reasonable, thank you, Sir. - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: --Lord Kazekage instead of Hassan*-- - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So let's look over your career as a shinobi...... - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: Just please let me resign.. - Thu Nov 12 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You were trained to become a shinobi by our facilities, absorbed funds that were set aside to train loyal ninja. You went rogue, hid for an extended period of time and now instead of repaying us for what should have been your execution....You are asking to resign as a shinobi which would effectively end your loyalty completely to our village? - Thu Nov 12 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Or well, obligation to our village. - Thu Nov 12 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Is this correct? - Thu Nov 12 22:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Sanoke made a deal with you to save her life and she does this? - Thu Nov 12 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Just as I thought, you are honor-less. - Thu Nov 12 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: If I wasn't loyal after attempting to resign I would've mentioned decisions on leaving.. - Thu Nov 12 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I will set up a meeting between Koji, you and me. - Thu Nov 12 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: I'm worth nothing to Sunagakure. I'm honorless to myself. I don't want to hinder anyone anymore with my instability and lack of responsibility.. that's why I want to resign. - Thu Nov 12 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Koji is your clan leader..he has some say here. - Thu Nov 12 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So..I'll contact you with details of time and place of the meeting. - Thu Nov 12 22:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Good to hear, Kiyoko. - Thu Nov 12 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked over towards Aza as Hassan had not replied to her last statement.* - Thu Nov 12 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Everything's fixed, we have a month and if you have made progress he will extend the time limit. - Thu Nov 12 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Yo, anyone seen my dad? - Thu Nov 12 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Them Yams Salty Fam) thinks: It takes this much just for a useless kunoichi to resign... - Thu Nov 12 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: Yeah. - Thu Nov 12 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: He went out of his way to protect her, I don't know why though, to me she is a failure of a shinobi. - Thu Nov 12 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Willingly tossing away her career is certainly a failure.... - Thu Nov 12 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Aza! - Thu Nov 12 22:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) thinks: Why can't I just avoid this kid. . . - Thu Nov 12 22:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked up to Hassan, "Excuse me a moment, I don't think that little boy has gotten his flu shot yet." She started to walk towards Ivel then glanced at Aza wondering why he was being such a dunce.* - Thu Nov 12 22:37:39 2015
