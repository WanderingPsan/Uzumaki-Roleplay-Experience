<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked up towards Izanami.* - Sun Dec  6 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hey. - Sun Dec  6 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hn? - Sun Dec  6 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: Oh hi Kiyoko-san. - Sun Dec  6 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: We need to amputate that arm and get testing started when you are comfortable. - Sun Dec  6 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: S-oh, okay uh...I guess I'm ready right now, im not doing anything important. - Sun Dec  6 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You certain? - Sun Dec  6 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) whispers: I'm absolutely certain yeah, no need in me tugging around an arm I can't use right? Haha. - Sun Dec  6 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Right right... then we should go ahead and head for the hospital. - Sun Dec  6 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wasn't as aware of her surroundings as Lera was so she wasn't ready for someone to wrap their arms around her. Jumping a bit she looked over her shoulder and then relaxed after seeing who it was. "Hey... just was gonna head to the hospital to get Izanami started on the project with her arm. If she wants you can come along?" <It would be best for her to have someone there.>* - Sun Dec  6 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Ohh, was it a fun one? - Sun Dec  6 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah, I'll come along. - Sun Dec  6 20:27:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You do? - Sun Dec  6 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Someone might be joining soon. His greeting skills are on fleek. - Sun Dec  6 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wiggled free of Lera's arms and then walked off for the hospital.* - Sun Dec  6 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Who might that be? - Sun Dec  6 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked into the surgical room and then sat out a medical robe for Izanami. "Go ahead and get changed into that, then crawl up onto the bed." She had a bed next to the table for now so that Izanami could be comfortable. She went into the scrub room and had the nurses come and clean up as well as she was getting prepared for the surgery, Lera could probably help Izanami or go into the room to watch from the observation glass. 

She came back out about five minutes later and was fully decked out in her hospital robe, mask, goggles, gloves, and what not. She stepped up to the operating table where many nurses had already set out her supplies. She saw that everything was set and then walked over towards the cabinet and pulled out the necessary anesthesia and began to clean up Izanami's arm opposite her damaged arm. "Alright so we are going to put you to sleep, when you wake up the arm will be removed and bandaged. Are you certain you want me to continue?" In the past, dealing with removing arms had turned out... with bad circumstances... she didn't want Izanami raging and attacking her.* - Sun Dec  6 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Eh...goodbye arm. - Sun Dec  6 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked Lera over for a minute, "If you are gonna stay hun, you are gonna have to go scrub up and put on some gear so you don't infect the open wound." She smiled weakly behind her medical mask. Injecting the IV into Izanami's arm to keep her under, within ten counts down from one hundred the girl would be passed out --- as long as Lera went and scrubbed up.

Once all of that was done she moved the robe away from Izanami's arm and then began to use a weird type of sponge held by medical tweezers that was soaked in brownish orange cleanser to keep the area clean. She wiped it all over the arm and shoulder and then prepared a scalpel to cut through the layer of skin. She began to slide through with a straight line along the arm's curve just below the shoulder joint. Course this meant that because of how she did it there was going to be a little nub of arm still intact that was injured and numb but not -dead- cell wise so it wouldn't rot.

Once the skin and first layers of muscle had been cut through she took up several small tools and began the long process of cutting large veins, tendons, and other important bits so that they weren't bleeding out. As this process was happening, a nurse was taking blood from Izanami to give back to her when the surgery was finished and also to lower bleeding during the surgery, of course this was going to make Izanami feel very weak after the surgery was complete. The bone saw wizzed on, and then blood splattered all ove Kiyoko as she cut through the bone and a nurse held the arm steady before pulling it away and cataloging it and freezing it for further study to help Izanami in the future. 

Kiyoko folded her hands into seals and then started to run it over the end of the bone to simply grow a tiny protective layer of tissue and protiens that would help the bone heal in a healthy way and then worked to heal the end of the nub so that there was no more bleeding but it was not covered in skin. When that was finished she cleaned the area of excess blood and then had a nurse wrap her arm in bandages in a perfected manner so that she wouldn't see the open wound at the end of her arm. For now they couldn't close it up with stitches since the arm below that had dead cells and they needed to work on stretching her skin over the end to stitch it up in the next week or so.

When Kiyoko was finished, Izanami was stable, and all the nurses were doing their little odds and ends job... the surgeon headed into the scrubbing room and cleaned up as she tossed all of her medical outfit into the biowaste bin and then pulled on fresh robes and a mask to walk back out to speak with Lera while Izanami slept. They would have to move her back over to the bed and take her into a hospital room before she would wake.* - Sun Dec  6 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had the nurses move the girl over to the rolly bed and then had them roll her out of the surgery room and into one of the hospital resting rooms. She motioned for Lera to follow now and remove her medical robes. She also removed her robes and headed into the other room to wait for Izanami to wake.* - Sun Dec  6 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) || Nurses were hurrying at a walking pace through the room and then brought in the blood bags and hooked them up to Izanami, they were now chilled and Izanami had to be wrapped in heating blankets to keep warm but her arm was going to hurt from the cold and hot on her body. She would probably lose feeling in her still in tact arm as this happened. There also was an IV hooked up, and pain medication had been delivered. Kiyoko stood up from where she was sitting and then began to look Izanami over to assure she was comfortable. "How are you feeling?"* - Sun Dec  6 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, the arm is amputated... we will need to do a lot of physical therapy and studies but you can rest now. - Sun Dec  6 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Physical..therapy.. - Sun Dec  6 21:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No fluids yet but we can give you ice chips so you can feel a little refreshed. - Sun Dec  6 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmm, okay. - Sun Dec  6 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) asked for one of the nurses to bring in a cup of ice chips, she then fed the girl a few pieces slowly so she could relax. The blood transfusion was finished now and Izanami probably would be greatful as it was removed and the warm blankets remained around her body.* - Sun Dec  6 22:07:47 2015
