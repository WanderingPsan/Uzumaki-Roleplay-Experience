<br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *wink* - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The fact you know what we are talking about shows you can hear us. - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It is pretty rude. - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) didn't seem irritated at all, she seemed embarrassed.* - Tue Nov 10 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Heh, she's embarrassed....cute. - Tue Nov 10 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Doesn't mean I will judge what you are talking about. - Tue Nov 10 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's voice cracked some, "R-right."* - Tue Nov 10 15:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Too cute... - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ah...did I say that outloud? - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Woops/ - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....hmph. - Tue Nov 10 15:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You want to show me how to use wind then?  - Tue Nov 10 15:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) totally decided to change the topic.* - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. If you want to learn. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Anything but being teased. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. We'll move over to that rock, I can practice at the same time then. - Tue Nov 10 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do you want to learn the chakra flow technique spefically? Or just all the techniques I can teach you. - Tue Nov 10 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I mean the main one would be the chakra flow that I'll be using but if you have something else you'd like to teach me I will learn. - Tue Nov 10 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh, I know a lot of Wind techniques. - Tue Nov 10 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Probably not as many as my father, but enough. - Tue Nov 10 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Up to you.~ - Tue Nov 10 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hrnnnn.....Choiceeeessss. - Tue Nov 10 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well alright. I'll at least teach you the basic wind technique. We can go from there. - Tue Nov 10 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alrighty. - Tue Nov 10 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pretty much had the control needed to do this, after all being a medical shinobi she -had- to have good control over her chakra. She formed the single seal and then tried to develop the chakra but didn't know -where- it came from she just was trying to use chakra in her body. She then inhaled deeply and exhaled with her lips in an O and her cheeks puffed up but all that came out was a little puff of what looked like when it's cold outside. "The hell?"* - Tue Nov 10 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You got the wind part down really fast.... - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...That was wind? - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It took me more attempts than that. - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: More like a dud. - Tue Nov 10 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nah, its a good start. Especially if you've never used the element before. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...not at all. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Then its good. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll be practicing my jutsu at the same time as well. - Tue Nov 10 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Tue Nov 10 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) scrunched her nose and formed the single seal again as she tried to feel through her body to find her wind chakra. She was searching and searching but at first couldn't find the right place in her body where it was located. Eventually she found it and groaned some at how it felt, much more powerful than medical chakra, offensive in nature and demanding to be released. She inhaled once more and this time blew out with less puffy cheeks but managed a light breeze in front of herself and Lera.* - Tue Nov 10 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt a bit light headed from the deep breathing but now that she could tell where the chakra was located she wouldn't have to hold her breath for as long while channeling her chakra. Forming the seal a third time, Kiyoko gathered chakra within her reserves and felt it swelling up in her lungs and then bursting out from her mouth as a tiny swirl of wind sent out at a slow pace but it at least had the correct rotation for beginning the form of a vortex.---Then she saw what Lera was doing and straight up dropped her jaw, "holy hell."* - Tue Nov 10 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? Don't mind me, keep going. You nearly have it. - Tue Nov 10 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded to the woman and immediately formed another seal and channeled the chakra up again as she curled her tongue lightly and managed a fast and easy way to form a strong swirling process to form a vortex. Lera wasn't the hands on type of a teacher, that was okay, Kiyoko was a fast learner and learned through experience and information she gathered. This forth attempt the vortex spun much faster but wasn't very long range.* - Tue Nov 10 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) swallowed a lump in her throat as her thoughts tried to lead her astray from the task at hand the closer she got to learning the technique fully. Shaking her head to clear her mind as she formed the seal again, Kiyoko swallowed the air around her and then channeled chakra through it's atoms before expelling it once more before her. This time the vortex had just the right curvature to be considered good enough, and it's range was fairly good for someone who was such a beginner. Lowering her hands, the girl looked over towards her mentor. "Good?"* - Tue Nov 10 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded a few times towards her advice, "Gotcha. Also, no offense... I'm grateful, but MAAAAN are you a shit teacher. I had to figure a lot of that out oon my own.~" Sticking her tongue out at her.* - Tue Nov 10 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, I know I know. I'm not very good at explaining things... - Tue Nov 10 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In my head it just sort've...works ya know? - Tue Nov 10 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not quite the same for everyone else though... - Tue Nov 10 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I thought that would take more out of me than it did. - Tue Nov 10 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, its a very basic technique. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Doesn't take a lot to use. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Course my chakra is pretty low from healing earlier. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Is it? You should've set something, we could've postponed this. - Tue Nov 10 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shook her head, "I wanted to learn something, plus I sort of wasn't paying attention to it. I just realized it when I felt a bit dizzy. I should have realized I needed to replenish after earlier. It was a lot of healing and I didn't even do all the healing I needed to, the girl Aza was fighting was silly and accepted some weed from Yan before I could get to treating her wounds."* - Tue Nov 10 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ....Bah. Yan and that stuff. - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It isn't all that bad. - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, Looks like I have to carry you home then *nod* - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...oh my.~ - Tue Nov 10 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think you just like treating me like a damsel. - Tue Nov 10 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Comfy? - Tue Nov 10 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thought they were just going to go to the couch to chat but then she had been taken all the way into the bedroom. "Oh, trying to put me to bed now are we? Goodness me, do I have control over anything anymore?"* - Tue Nov 10 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She's kind of adorable with how protective she is. - Tue Nov 10 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rose a brow and propped herself up against the headboard of the bed, "Oh really? What kind of something?"* - Tue Nov 10 16:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Mn...this room... I love the smell of it. - Tue Nov 10 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: So many books. - Tue Nov 10 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her lip, "Man, you haven't used that in a long time? Ain't rusty are you?~" Scrunching up her nose and wiggling in the bed. "Alright I'll be a good girl and listen, I can't wait."* - Tue Nov 10 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's smile faded away and she became serious. Listening to the piano begin to sound and then Lera's voice. At the first note of her singing, Kiyoko's heart stopped for a moment an her breath hitched at how beautiful it was to hear. As the song continued, the girl studied Lera carefully and listened to every word of the song. As it came to an end, Kiyoko sighed out in a peaceful way but her heart was pounding so hard she could nearly hear it and certainly felt it pumping within her chest. She tried to speak but nothing voiced for a moment, clearing her throat lightly she spoke out in a hushed tone, "did that song mean something special to you?"* - Tue Nov 10 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) recalled what she had told her in a previous conversation. The serious expression dropped into a small line between her brows. "Did you write it for him?"* - Tue Nov 10 16:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: She must not have been with Violet for very long. - Tue Nov 10 16:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rolled over to lay watching Lera's hand nearest her, not daring to look up at her face but also not touching her because she knew this could be difficult to handle. Whispering out, "thank you for playing it for me, it is the most beautiful song I've ever heard." A small tear gently rolled down her left cheek before disappearing under her jawline onto the bed. She couldn't help but feel some sympathy for Lera, the fact she had chosen to share this with her...really showed how much Lera trusted her.* - Tue Nov 10 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's bottom lip trembled and she wasn't sure what to say. No one had ever felt that much for her, she knew her family loved her in their special rediculous way but this was something new, something to be cherished. Now she understood quite a lot more why Lera was so protective of her and understood why their connection had grown so strongly so fast. 

Kiyoko shut her eyes for a moment if only to stop herself from shedding another tear. Whispering out in a trembly voice, "I'm going to say something I've never said before, and it's probably too early to say it but after that and how I've started to feel for you it just can't be held back." Her eyes now rose up to look into Lera's, "I'm falling in love with you, Lera. There's nothing you can do about it."* - Tue Nov 10 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wrapped her arms around the petite girl and held her warmly. Whispering into Lera's ear, "I'm not going anywhere, I'm going to be here for you until you start showing greys and then some. And if we don't make it that far? At least we had each other till the end, I'm all yours, Lera." Kissing the crown of her head and then closing her eyes as her heart beat loudly in the woman's ear as she lay upon her chest.* - Tue Nov 10 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Oh god, what have I done to you, poor sweet girl. - Tue Nov 10 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) held her tighter and rocked Lera gently as she kissed her long and softly over and over atop her head, shoulder, and forehead. "Shh, shh... it's alright."* - Tue Nov 10 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Shh, you didn't lose it. You let go, that's alright. You can let go anytime you need to. Clearly you haven't in a long time. - Tue Nov 10 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I guess...I guess I haven't...funny huh... - Tue Nov 10 16:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You say you think you were the strong one but you -are-. You have gone through so much loss and survived and remain strong, crying doesn't show weakness.. it shows release. I am weak, I wouldn't even know what to do if I experienced loss. - Tue Nov 10 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I...I don't want you to have to experience. I'm going to do my utmost to prevent it... - Tue Nov 10 16:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I know you will, but in this world with me now being a shinobi and gaining shinobi friends, you know that is likely impossible. - Tue Nov 10 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I know...I won't promise, but I can try. - Tue Nov 10 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Good, good girl... - Tue Nov 10 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) kissed the top of her head again gently.* - Tue Nov 10 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) giggled girlishly, "soon, soon." She leaned in to keep Lera with a good deal of emotion behind it. Only a few seconds before she pulled away slowly. "I do have a question for you."* - Tue Nov 10 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm? Whats the question? - Tue Nov 10 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you used to always being in control in a relationship? Or are you just getting a chance with me because I'm so weak.~ - Tue Nov 10 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmm...well, usualy I am in control with these things. But even I get 'dominated' sometimes. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe I like being dominated...hehehe. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you were the dominating one in both relationships? - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Most of the time. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Interesting. - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was just wondering.~ - Tue Nov 10 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh, I don't mind letting you take control~ if you think you can handle me. - Tue Nov 10 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pursed her lips a bit and shut her eyes defiantly, "I actually like you in control. Perhaps that's what I needed, someone to be in charge."* - Tue Nov 10 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Plus.... - Tue Nov 10 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sort of silly for me to try and control you with how much stronger you are. - Tue Nov 10 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I have plenty confidence in bed but you are clearly meant to be in charge. - Tue Nov 10 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha, we'll see we'll see. - Tue Nov 10 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We have a loooot of years ahead of us. No need to rush. - Tue Nov 10 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Planning ahead are we?~ - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maaaybe. - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Tell me. - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: What do you see, love? - Tue Nov 10 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) giggled softly, "well aren't you the helpless romantic. I didn't know you want children."* - Tue Nov 10 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh well then, LOTS. - Tue Nov 10 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehehe. - Tue Nov 10 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You sure know how to scare a girl. - Tue Nov 10 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) teased of course.* - Tue Nov 10 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We can take it in turns~ I'll have one first and then you have one~ - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Or maybe at the same time... - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh dear. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I feel like you are fibbing. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I hope she is fibbing. - Tue Nov 10 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn, I suppose I will just have to see. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, lord knows we have enough time. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right right, after all you still are a baby.~ - Tue Nov 10 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yes but theres on big factor. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm -your- baby. - Tue Nov 10 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flicked Lera's nose.* - Tue Nov 10 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stared up at the ceiling as her hand was taken and then shut her eyes and inhaled deeply. "Me too, large part being that I love the smell of your room."* - Tue Nov 10 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) quickly made a loud 'Pfft' sound and opened one eye to look at Lera. "It's the books, you silly butt."* - Tue Nov 10 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Family isn't going to like that, getting away with one night was hard. - Tue Nov 10 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled weakly, "perhaps."* - Tue Nov 10 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: *Sighs* Yes. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I know they will be upset. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I -do- want to stay. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Perhaps you meeting them is a good idea. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm sure they won't be able to refuse. - Tue Nov 10 17:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's jaw dropped as she never had seen a animal summoned before but mostly because the wolf was so FREAKIN' CUTE. "A-awwwwwww---" Cutting off suddenly when she spoke. "You can speak," looking at Lera, "She can speak." Looking back at the wolf, "You can speak."* - Tue Nov 10 18:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) closed her eyes as her cheek was licked and giggled, "Yes I believe I did. Now I feel silly for gushing over you but you are just so...adorable. I'm sorry, the fact you can speak and are intelligent makes me feel silly for saying that." She placed a hand on either cheek and smiled wide while staring down at the wolf.* - Tue Nov 10 18:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her lip and then glanced at Lera before reaching down with her left hand and started to rub and then scratch behind the puppy's ear, then her right hand lowered and rubbed at the other one as she began to give the wolf a doggie ear massage.~ Kiyoko's were famous.* - Tue Nov 10 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) turned her lips down in a 'not bad' expression. "I didn't know wolves could purr, or am I just that good?" Giggling as she started to scratch down the wolf's back and back up again to rub her ears nice and long to stretch them some.* - Tue Nov 10 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh dear. - Tue Nov 10 18:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked up to Lera, "I'm guessing she can get along with this forever?"* - Tue Nov 10 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yep....she'll have to go back eventually, but you could scratch her like that for the entire time. - Tue Nov 10 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh. - Tue Nov 10 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) scratched the wolv for a bit longer but then eventually released her, "I think it's time for you to go home Jenna."* - Tue Nov 10 18:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well then, I suppose it was my turn. - Tue Nov 10 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Tue Nov 10 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Gosh.. - Tue Nov 10 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.. - Tue Nov 10 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh ... I guess I could tell you that... - Tue Nov 10 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's face immediately started turning red.* - Tue Nov 10 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Or...something else. - Tue Nov 10 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Fuck. - Tue Nov 10 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed heavily and pulled the covers up over her head like a child, "sooooooo after the first time we had spoken. It had been a couple of days, and I was helping Koji take Trilliam to jail, making friends with both of them actually and then when me and Koji were leaving the jail." Sighing heavily again under the covers as her voice remained lightly muffled, "I asked him if he'd seen you lately, for some reason he thought that the Mizukage had called you back to Kiri and you had gone. I grew upset... a TINY bit and then he offered to get me a passport to go see you. Of course back then I thought there was no chance you were even considering being interested in me and I immediately told him that was too persumptuous considering taking a trip across all the great countries to see someone who MIGHT end up eventually being interested in me, but I WANTED to go. Koji didn't understand what was even going on, he's only thirteen after all so he didn't catch on that I liked you, just thought I wanted to see my friend. Then I started turning red and he thought I was ill and then Sanoke just HAPPENED to walk up." 

She took a gasp for air and groaned, "He saw how embarrassed I looked, being older than Koji he could tell something was up and started asking me. I tried to lie twice and failed miserably, then because he was so insistant I.... literally ran out into the desert because I couldn't lie properly to him, he saw right through me. He just did that teleporting thing in front of me, I fell on my ass like a fool, he made me get back up and I told him that I was interested in you and then what Koji had told me and he teased me a bit and that was the end of it. I went to the courtyard." She groaned and wiggled under the blankets, "Then you were just SITTING THERE! And it was like, 'are you fuckin' serious right now? I just went through all that for NOTHING?! That's when he had did the teleport thingy and I was really sick? You know when he started taunting me in front of you and then you attacked him to make him heavy or what have you to get him back for fucking with me. Yeah.... so...yeah, that's what happened." She swallowed hard and was trembling at this point, red as a beet under the covers.* - Tue Nov 10 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned loudly nearly to a howl at her suffering of embarrassment. "No no no, shhhhhh." She groaned more as she was hugged, all the same the words Lera spoke sent shivers all over even as she felt like she was going to burn up with the emotions swelling inside of her.* - Tue Nov 10 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haha, honestly you had my interest when I saw you for the first time. I most definitely would not have complained if you'd gone after me. - Tue Nov 10 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I planned to it's just that you had supposively left that I thought I wasn't going to get the chance. - Tue Nov 10 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And I didn't want to be stupid and go all the way to Kiri and then you be like 'I thought I told you I don't want to be with anyone?' - Tue Nov 10 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I understand, don't worry. I'm here now. You got me. - Tue Nov 10 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah, I know.....  - Tue Nov 10 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Forever and then som. - Tue Nov 10 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mnn... I think I will stay here. - Tue Nov 10 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) snuggled in against Lera's chest under the covers, getting a little 'too' friendly against her breasts. "Mn, yeah...this is perfect."* - Tue Nov 10 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: What is Trilliam doing out? - Tue Nov 10 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked up towards Trilliam, "hey there, did you get my note and food I left? I visited you several times but you always were asleep."* - Tue Nov 10 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hello everyone. - Tue Nov 10 19:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm .. - Tue Nov 10 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) spotted both Mirai and Aza, two people she needed to speak with. She headed over towards Mirai first since that shouldn't take long. A warm smile tugged at her lips as she approached the woman. "Hello, ma'am. I know we haven't met but I'm Kiyoko, your fiance, Sanoke, asked me to meet you and offer up teaching you medical techniques and basically get you into it since you were interested? Would you like to meet up sometime soon to talk things over? I have something I need to do right now but I thought I should get this out of the way since Sanoke asked me to."* - Tue Nov 10 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) whispers: If I did...I'd have to kill u - Tue Nov 10 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh! - Tue Nov 10 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds great. - Tue Nov 10 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can talk whenever you have free time. - Tue Nov 10 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had smiled towards Trilliam and nodded but it seemed his guards wanted to take him back to his cell so she stepped away and thats when she had headed over to Mirai.

------

Smiling brightly towards Mirai, Kiyoko bowed her head to the woman, "I can't wait, Yan said he wanted to learn from me too so maybe you can do it together." Then she turned to Aza! "Are you ready to start the first session, Aza-sa----" then he stated where he was going and the smile upon her face dropped. "But....what about?"* - Tue Nov 10 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) twitched her lips to the side, "Do you... not want to?"* - Tue Nov 10 19:31:37 2015

We can go either to your house, my home, or the hospital, or even to the cafe for some tea while we talk, even your favorite spot in the village."* - Tue Nov 10 19:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Tue Nov 10 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked in and looked around the home in a curious manner, absent of judgement, she was trying to see what kind of state he lived in and then took a seat across from him at a diagonal.* - Tue Nov 10 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) could see the emotions on his expression, "I want you to seriously tell me the truth, do you want me to leave and we not do this? I will not make you do anything you don't want to do. I offered this to you out of the kindness I have, you seemed happy that I wanted to help but now you do not. I understand that Koji tried to make it manditory but if you don't want to do it then I will speak with him."* - Tue Nov 10 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled genuinely and leaned in over the table towards Aza, "because I'll tell you a secret. Someone asked me what type of nurse I am when it comes to helping people, the person who does it to make themselves feel good, or the kind who is truly devoted to helping others and that means that they will self destruct in the end to save everyone around them. Even knowing that I will self destruct I -still- choose to be the person who does it to purely help others. That is just who I am." * - Tue Nov 10 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) craned her head to the side, "how about this, Aza. How about this first session be about me. You can ask me anything you want to get to know me and to have me prove that I am honestly here ONLY to help you control your skills and find some balance in your life. Does that sound good? No tricks, you can even request for me to complete actions if they pertain to proving to you my intent." She could tell this was very dangerous, the first dangerous task she had taken as a medical shinobi, hell the first dangerous thing she had EVER done since she was always a nurse. In that moment she wished she had allowed Lera to come stand outside the building like she wanted to do since admittedly she was a tiny bit scared but she was hiding it well.* - Tue Nov 10 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's eyes squinted at the outer edges when he had said he didn't care about her. It kind of hurt honestly but she tried to not let it phase her. Sighing out she wrung her hands in her lap before stating, "one last thing, perhaps this will convince you." She held up one of her hands and it was trembling quite severely, "Aza... I am terrified of your power, I saw your chakra when I was out there trying to take care of you before it dropped drastically and I saw what you could do, I see you now growing upset and it scares me that you might hurt me. Yet I sit here because I really do want to help you, I don't want to steal your secrets, manipulate you, or anything else for that matter. I just want to -help you-. Do you think if I wanted something from you that I would go so far as to risk my own life, a life that can't even be defended? Last night was the first time I even learned anything close to offensive attack wise and I'm not even that good at it. I might as well be a civillian. Do you understand now, how truly helpless I am in this situation, yet I am still here with you."* - Tue Nov 10 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rubbed her lips together, "you are not a monster, even if you feel that way I don't see you as a monster. I see you as a man who needs help because he has power that is trying to take over him and if you learn how to control it you can be happier and safer, and people around you can be safer." She smiled towards him as her hands had stopped trembling for now, she could tell he was getting worse though and when he warned her she looked him over. "Do you feel I am in serious danger right now, Aza? Do you feel like you might hurt me, because I won't leave if you are just saying that to make me leave. If you genuinely feel like you might hurt me then I will. Know though that if you ever want to try again, -ever- that I am always going to have my arms open to you. Even if it's just as us being friends, okay?" She looked at him with sad but kind eyes as she waited for his answer.* - Tue Nov 10 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) saw what was about to happen and as he stated she got up and started to run around the table as it was beginning to crack from his strength, she was not at all fast...she wasn't trained, she knew who she had to go to for help but she probably was not going to be even CLOSE to fast enough to get away from Aza.* - Tue Nov 10 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) kept running to get around the table, slipping on one of the cushions and gasping for air as her adrenaline sped up and she -really- wished Lera was here now but there was nothing she could do about it. Her sensing activated instinctively and it only served to terrify her more. She refused to attack him even with her one skill she had to use against him since she had already began to care about him and further she knew it would only serve to answer the beast inside of him more. She kept on running!* - Tue Nov 10 21:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) kept on running and screamed out in terror, she couldn't help it. She hadn't wanted to scream but it was impossible to hold back. The girl kept running and scrambling trying to get away. * - Tue Nov 10 21:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) || All the people approaching outside would see is Kiyoko being thrown out the door with a giant bruise already forming around her neck. Her frail body skidding across the ground as she groaned and screamed while her body was scabbed up and bleeding as soon as different parts of her body struck the ground. As the nurse's body finally came to a pause and she could see people arriving, all Kiyoko could actually think about was screaming out, "PLEASE DON'T KILL HIM." With that she was struggling to stay awake after the rough ride across the ground, pretty beaten up extremely easily. * - Tue Nov 10 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) || The only injuries on the medic's body was scraps, bruises, cuts, and all that good stuff all over her body along with two large bruised handprints around her neck not to mention a cut on the back of her head likely giving her a concussion from when she slammed into the door to fly through it. In all reasonings she was pretty fucked up for her level of ability but for shinobi it was probably a thing of 'walk it off' even though Kiyoko was a shinobi, as seen by the headband tied around her ankle. 

Auburn eyes flickered opened and shut repeatedly as she tried to speak in a hoarse cracked voice from screaming and the fact she was strangled. "Just... make sure...they don't... k-kill him... h-he didn't mean...to do this... he didn't mean to... can't...control it... don't let them... DON'T LET THEM.... DON'T KILL HIM!" She had began to rise her voice even as it was growing more cracked and mangled as she tried to scream the words out for those in the area to hear. She desperately didn't want Aza hurt, she knew he hadn't meant to do what he did.* - Tue Nov 10 22:00:57 2015

"Dont.Let.Them.Kill.Aza!" She was only holding on by being able to say this even as she was in utter pain, who fucking knew what Lera would do if she found out what Aza had done but hopefully Kiyoko could speak with her before she got to knowing it from someone else.* - Tue Nov 10 22:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) couldn't talk anyone through shit right now, all she could think was 'don't let them kill him'. She was mumbling it now and staring up at the sky with half lidded eyes as her blood on the scabs began to clot and sand go into most of her wounds.* - Tue Nov 10 22:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) screamed out in pain as she was picked up, shutting her eyes tightly and jerking for a moment in Yan's hands. She couldn't help it, she had never been in this much pain before. The most the girl had ever experienced was a paper cut, or even stubbing her toe, that is literally how little training she had. When he asked the question her head was spinning but she shook her head with a groan.* - Tue Nov 10 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was trying to hold back her cries of pain. "Medical... kit... leg... bag... syringe.... little...syringe..." if he looked he would find a small syringe that had something clear in it, not very much of whatever it was, with a cap over the needle. "Put... in...upper outer...thigh...ugh..." She lulled her head back as she tried to handle the pain and just prayed to whatever might be out there that Yan got the stupid needle out of her medical kit and gave it to her. "A-after... needle... shower.... clean wound... luke warm.... stitches.... check... nnnggnn.. head... no stitch...head...with...no doctor...fuuuuuck..." She cringed as a wave of pain went over her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt the heat of the syringe and then the sudden burst of release of the pain. "Nngnn..." she groaned in relief as the pain flooded away, it had been morphine for emergency situations, a very low dose but good enough to use on anyone over the age of twelve if they were in a really bad state and not bleeding out, which she was far from. 

As her head was healed it did help to heal the cut and the sweling of her thin muscle and skin over her skull but not the swelling on her brain, healing jutsu could not heal concussions and of course Ortho should know that so if he checked for the signs he would see she had a medium one that would probably take about ten days to fully be okay again and not need supervision from at least one person. The rest of her body he tried to start healing she allowed him to heal some of her, the worst parts at least but then she jerked to grab his wrist. "Too much, lowering my white blood cell count. I'm not as strong as other shinobi, treat as civilian." That should tell him something at least...

He would see several places that needed stitched but over all the rest of her was good except the fact majority of her wounds had sand in them so unless he had a good amount of fluids to rinse out her wounds he was going to need to get her to a hospital or a shower, either one. Then she spoke up in response to his question, "everything's pretty foggy now, morphine was in the syringe. If there's something else wrong with me I can't feel it. Might have broken a rib or two, I'm not sure." She likely fractured them but not broken since the way she landed she hadn't started hitting her ribs on the ground until several bumps against the ground later.* - Tue Nov 10 23:50:11 2015

If he cleaned out any wounds of sand that were actual gashes or scrapes where he had to rub or dig or flush out the wound she grit her teeth in pain and occasionally groan since the morphine dosage wasn't high enough to stop her from feeling severe pain.* - Wed Nov 11 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was doing pretty okay until he got to her back, when he got there she screamed out lightly in pain and had to take deep breathes as he was pulling her wound open and flowing water directly into it. It stung, felt pressured, pulsated...everything imaginable... She was listening to him and remembering his name and seeing as he was from Konoha she wasn't all that much concerned, not Kiri but hey it was better than Kumo or Ame. 

When he asked about Lera she smiled and then giggled foolishly, "I recently started seeing her. I'm Kiyoko Natsuna," by this time the face paint that hid her face in some areas, clearly cultural, was being washed away and smudged to reveal her true very feminine young adult face.* - Wed Nov 11 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) could feel him touching a wound that felt like it was blocked and the fact he had already been letting the water pound away at it but it wasn't enough and she heard his tool bag made her queezy. As he began to dig around she screamed out much louder and it echo'd in the room as she tried to reply to him while he was working with heavy panting between. "Y-yeah, she makes me happy. I went after her, funny.... I was scared as hell of her at first but she was just to.... just something about her. She says I'm the one that makes her really happy, apparently I'm the first thing to fill the gap since her first love died." She was saying all this purely for conversation, he was from Konoha so why did it matter? She needed it to think about just to get through this and the morphine was starting to wear off. "Oh... fucking.... shit.. I feel so dizzy... so much pain... i've never felt anything like this before. This is probably nothing for other shinobi huh?" She laughed at hersef for being so pathetic as he was turning her around and she tried to relax with her eyes closed.* - Wed Nov 11 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) wasn't scared about the stitches, it was all of this digging that was killing her. He had given her a little break as he was cleaning her minor wounds but when he had gotten to her chest she felt her eyes bulge as her body trembled as she wasn't able to reply for a moment. Tears fell from her closed eyes and down her cheeks to her chest. "Holy hell, feels like you are killing me... sh-shit..." she cried out nearly in a sob. 

"I was too scared to tell her I love her just yet... I've never said it to anyone before in my life. Never felt it, know what I mean? I ... think I do love her, I told her I was falling in love with her. She told me she loved me, I believe her... there's no way you couldn't believe her with how she was in that moment." She shook her head and laughed and then screamed out in pain at the digging for sand in her chest. Whimpering ensued as she tried to hold it together and not look at Ortho in the eye because she didn't want to guilt him.* - Wed Nov 11 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) saw what he wanted her to do and she slapped his hand, "don't be so fuckin' childish, just do it yourself, you are a medic and I can't hold still for shit. You are lucky I'm still on the chair and in the tub." She groaned severely, "just get it over w-----" a very loud scream sounded as she struggled to hold it together, her vision blurred as he worked on the wounds between her breasts and she struggled to stay conscious. No longer was she talking about Lera, she couldn't even think about Lera, the only thing she could think about was how she was hardly alive in her mind and actually wished she was dead for a moment just so the pain would stop. By the time he had paused she was sobbing unable to control it.* - Wed Nov 11 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sobbed at a good pace as he tried to get her to talk. "I d-don't know, we talked about our future.... ngnng.. growing old together, kids... she wants to meet my parents..." a scream sounded and she wavered in a tilt needing stability from his hold to remain upright. "She's training me some, to teach me how to fight. I'm useless at fighting. Been a nurse since I was legally old enough, only in this mess as a shinobi because they wanted me to pass certain restrictions in the hospital." Then she sobbed so heavily and screamed so bad that the begging began. 

"Please, please no more, I can't... I can't... it's so bad," she couldn't see because she was sobbing so hard and her eyes burned with the water and tears plus emotions. The begging continued as he started in on the worst gash and now she was clinging to him practically, passing out and waking up screaming over and over. Blood loss was reaching a high point now and it was good she stopped him from healing her further. By the time he was nearing the end of the thirty minutes of torture to get the sand out she was no where near the same girl, she couldn't even speak for now. Shock had settled in...* - Wed Nov 11 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's beathing wavered as she looked up into his eyes with tears cascading down her cheeks. "She's been helping me pick what to use to fight with, I use...ngnng.. wind... I picked swords with wind to fight with. We are trying to decide what type of sword. We narrowed it down to rapier, kukiri, and...ngn..something else..what was the other thing.. I can't remember now. Stupid..ugh... I don't think I should be passing out while having a head thingy...ma-jig..." She meant a concussion of course. "I uh... I love Suna, I'm proud of Suna... only traveled a few times with family, I'm not big on traveling though. Like to stay where I know things... unless I get to learn, then I might travel." * - Wed Nov 11 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Is this what death feels like? - Wed Nov 11 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I...want to sleep but I know I can't...head..thingy...ngn.. - Wed Nov 11 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I honestly think Death feels better than what I put you through, haha. - Wed Nov 11 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was injected with the numbing medication and immediately her skin was numb and the deep down wounds started to ache less and less but not entirely. She was not able to move now and he probably had to hold her up.* - Wed Nov 11 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hah...hahah... - Wed Nov 11 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Hell... that was hell... - Wed Nov 11 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped and opened her eyes looking at Ortho, "Lera's going to kill him."* - Wed Nov 11 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Why do I feel so weird. - Wed Nov 11 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Wed Nov 11 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: oooh I know this one...I can't think of the answer. - Wed Nov 11 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Pfft... - Wed Nov 11 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You act like you aren't a medic sometimes. - Wed Nov 11 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Boundaries still exist. - Wed Nov 11 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: None of those guys would be able to even look at me, or they would be too busy looking. - Wed Nov 11 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And Lera isn't here. - Wed Nov 11 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Understood. - Wed Nov 11 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Do you keep asking me because it's weird for you? - Wed Nov 11 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Married or something? - Wed Nov 11 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I keep asking you because I have a little sister. I wouldn't want some trusted.. or forced trusted.. medic to take advantage of her.. so I don't do it to other females. - Wed Nov 11 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No.. I'm not married, but.. - Wed Nov 11 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Ppffftt, I think I'm older than you bub. - Wed Nov 11 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph. - Wed Nov 11 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: No comment. - Wed Nov 11 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you gonna get it over with? - Wed Nov 11 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Yeah, yeah. - Wed Nov 11 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Wanted you to rest a bit, Mrs Pushy. - Wed Nov 11 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm tired of being in here, plus I can hardly feel anything. - Wed Nov 11 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched him pulling off her undergarments and of course her breasts were rather good size considering her height, full C's, and nicely colored in the more intimate areas... olive toned. When he had removed the panties all he would see was a bare sex excluding a very dark extremely thin line of hair for decoration. As he went about cleaning her she tried her best to lean on the chair in a way that wouldn't pull her stitches but she wasn't likely to slip off so he could use both hands. She also closed her eyes so she couldn't have phantom sensations of where she -saw- his hand at. That could SURELY cause some akwardness. When he spoke up she smiled, "Concussion! Right, that's the word I was looking for. It's just you know...all the drugs..and stuff. I've done good only to forget that word you know? I even was giving instructions to Yan before how to fix me. Glad you showed up though, this would have been...much worse."* - Wed Nov 11 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Probably be dead. - Wed Nov 11 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Seriously, I gotta wash some blood off me. I just did an execution for the Kage, and I am in a bad mood. You guys still busy, or can I come in and catch a shower? - Wed Nov 11 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) just sat there fyi, she was out of it with eyes closed.* - Wed Nov 11 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did someone else just see me naked? - Wed Nov 11 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sounded like a girl - Wed Nov 11 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Nope. - Wed Nov 11 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh. - Wed Nov 11 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: They didn't come in. - Wed Nov 11 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) thinks: This should be funny.. - Wed Nov 11 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: They better not be doing anything in my brathroom... - Wed Nov 11 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, Sure. - Wed Nov 11 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) just sat there numb while he dried her off, "yeah yeah, no falling asleep for ten hours and all that hubb-bubb." She was now just in the towel assumably and looked down at herself where he had placed her. She couldn't stand so assumably she is laying on the floor or sitting on the toilet? "No clothes I'm guessing?"* - Wed Nov 11 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was forced to stand even though her ankles were bent all weird and her legs didn't want to hold her weight, luckily he picked her up and didn't make her walk so when she ended up on the bed she sighed out at not being upright, it was making her sick to the stomach.* - Wed Nov 11 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ... - Wed Nov 11 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I have seals on my body. I hide them amongst my tattoos. - Wed Nov 11 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had groaned lightly at her stitches catching occassionally on the shirt but she was okay once he had it fully on and assumably had put on the sweat pants.* - Wed Nov 11 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I seal all kinds of things on my body. Extra clothing, weapons, everything. - Wed Nov 11 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Huh....weird...handy...that would be great for medical shit.... Can you go get Yan or whoever keeps asking about me? - Wed Nov 11 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reached out for his hand.* - Wed Nov 11 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Can I ask you something? - Wed Nov 11 03:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I have been busy being so kind and taking care of everyone all my life I've never needed someone to help me like this. - Wed Nov 11 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's fine, it really is.. - Wed Nov 11 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I may be a murderer, but I do have morals, haha. - Wed Nov 11 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: If you hadn't been there, I'm pretty sure I'd be dead. And.... I don't think I could survive that thing in the shower.... so thank you. - Wed Nov 11 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Murderer. - Wed Nov 11 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: All shinobi are murderer's. - Wed Nov 11 03:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Did you really just save the life of a weak girl, practically a civilian who is the love of your enemy? - Wed Nov 11 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You are no murderer, I call that a hero. - Wed Nov 11 03:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You instead made sure it was the easiest possible for me. - Wed Nov 11 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: You were in the crowd and no one knew you were a medic but you came and helped me. - Wed Nov 11 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I mentioned Lera before we got alone in the bathroom, you had -HOURS- to decide. - Wed Nov 11 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: So unless you plan on killing me now? You are a hero. - Wed Nov 11 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: ..Honestly? Lera's death was something I felt, and still do feel, is necessary for the next generation to progress. Right now, though.. I'm willing to hold off.. if not completely forget.. about aiming to kill her. - Wed Nov 11 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: If she didn't come back to Kiri, would you still want to kill her? - Wed Nov 11 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's not the fact that she came back to Kirigakure.. it's the fact that her name was called in the torture I went through while under a Genjutsu.. - Wed Nov 11 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: That happened in Kirigakure. - Wed Nov 11 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Just because she is loved? This torture, I'm guessing you can't tell me why Lera was named or you'd have to kill me? - Wed Nov 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I was forced to mentally relive the death of my parents, the death of my sensei and the betrayal of my student-sibling. - Wed Nov 11 03:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: The mental torture was avenged, just not at my hands. - Wed Nov 11 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You realize in a world of shinobi, the biggest fear is not of your enemy but of your leader? - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I assure you.... I have heard of none of this, or you. - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I wouldn't have mentioned her if I did, for her sake. - Wed Nov 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: It's for that.. different perspective why it's easy for me to forget about killing her.. - Wed Nov 11 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I don't know, Aza is pretty scary. - Wed Nov 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmm. Aza? The one everyone was attacking? - Wed Nov 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thank you for sparring her life.... I hope that soon, or in the future at some point. I can convince you not to kill her, even after my death. - Wed Nov 11 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Tell you what.. - Wed Nov 11 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: Make a single promise to me and I'll make sure I won't seek her death.. even after you are gone. - Wed Nov 11 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: What is the promise. - Wed Nov 11 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes, and a smile pulled at her lips. "I'll tell you something It seems I've had to tell people quite a lot lately." She shifted against the bed, "A woman asked me what type of nurse I am, the kind who helps people for my own selfish reasons of making myself feel good. Or the kind that really truly does it all for the people she helps, and told me thereafter that those people who do it just for the people they help are self destructive." She looked down at herself again, "I had told that lady I was the one who does it for other people always, and accepted that I was self destructive. The reason why I am so injured and you had to save my life is because I was trying to help someone medically and didn't get out in time, because I wanted to help him until the very last moment I could." She sighed and smiled then, "and I still want to find him again and help him once more, if there is even the slightest chance." Pausing in thought, "See because I am so self destructive to help others, I don't think I can ever be the best doctor ever. The selfish ones are who become genius while I sacrifice everything, slow down, all for the benefit of the patients."* - Wed Nov 11 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled wide, "I promise you, Ortho. I will become the best doctor across the regions."* - Wed Nov 11 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Good. Consider Lera off my hit list. - Wed Nov 11 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: As if she was never there,~ - Wed Nov 11 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's eyes were watering but she tried to lower her lids enough so he couldn't see them glazing over.* - Wed Nov 11 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Thank you. - Wed Nov 11 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're welcome, Kiyoko. - Wed Nov 11 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think my friends might want to see me now, but...seriously...anything you ever want. - Wed Nov 11 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll keep that in mind, haha. - Wed Nov 11 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll tell them that they can come in. - Wed Nov 11 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was propped up on a few pillows with a man's shirt on that seemed too small because of her breasts, it made it barely go two inches below her breasts and showed all the stitched up wonds, bruises, and bandages on her belly. Whatever she was wearing for her lower body was covered and her hands were resting at her sides with several stitched areas, bruises, and bandages over her body including her head. Her meds had worn off so she was just resting there for the moment.* - Wed Nov 11 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Better than I was when he was cleaning the wounds. - Wed Nov 11 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Marco. Doc woke up. - Wed Nov 11 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah.. - Wed Nov 11 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) listened in on what she said and shook her head finally at what she said about Ortho, "no I owe him my life." She was about to ask about Aza when Yan presumably walked in.

Nakano, Kiyoko was propped up on a few pillows with a man's shirt on that seemed too small because of her breasts, it made it barely go two inches below her breasts and showed all the stitched up wonds, bruises, and bandages on her belly.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We've got dinner out in the living room, may as well join us. - Wed Nov 11 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm feeling like shit, but when he was cleaning my wounds it felt like death, Ortho said death is more merciful than what I had to go through. - Wed Nov 11 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ... Yeah, that shit must have hurt - Wed Nov 11 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't know where it stands now, but that man that helped you. - Wed Nov 11 06:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I would like to see Aza, if he isn't in jail. - Wed Nov 11 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And probably Koji... - Wed Nov 11 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: We.. don't know where Tetsumi took him. - Wed Nov 11 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh. - Wed Nov 11 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mitsunara...do you mind getting a wheelchair? - Wed Nov 11 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I'm going to crash on the pillows..Uh, help yourselves to anything... - Wed Nov 11 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Uh... sure, if you need one. - Wed Nov 11 06:24:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The hospital will lend you one in my name. - Wed Nov 11 06:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked up to her with a winning smile, "until you can find someone else willing to push me around?" She then tossed the covers off to show the male sweat pants she was wearing that were extremly low riding from their size compared to her. "Yeah uh... I need you to support me while I shift over into it." If helped, she would turn on her heel and slowly slide down into the wheelchair seat.* - Wed Nov 11 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I guess to the square...is the fact my um...my shirt is so small and I have no facepaint on ...rude? - Wed Nov 11 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh. I don't think it's rude. - Wed Nov 11 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Might get some odd stares for the low ridin shirt.. - Wed Nov 11 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: But I don't think anyone cares about the facepaint but you. - Wed Nov 11 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And my family... - Wed Nov 11 06:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I do but it's fine, it hurts too much to change. - Wed Nov 11 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: What about the facepaint? Do you wanna at least do that, or..? - Wed Nov 11 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) shook her head, "like you said, it'll be fine."* - Wed Nov 11 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm...word of advice..if your seal speed isn't that fast, establish distance before trying to use ninjutsu. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Shall we continue? - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Word. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Nah. I was only using it to find something out, if I'm honest. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Normally, I wouldn't rely on ninjutsu. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What were you trying to figure out? - Wed Nov 11 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Yan said some girl could show me how to use some Katon ninjutsu. I was curious if that was you. - Wed Nov 11 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You want to learn how to use katon? - Wed Nov 11 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: W-Well.. I sorta specialize in Taijutsu.. Mainly. - Wed Nov 11 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: I kinda know a bit of Katon though. - Wed Nov 11 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was covered from head to toe in stitched giant area's, small area's also, bruises, scabs, bandages, and a giant bandage wrapped around her skull. She had on men's clothing, a set of very low riding sweat pants due to them being way too loose, a very tight shirt that only fell two inches below the bottom of her breasts to expose her belly because it was made for a skinny man with no chest... She also did not have any face paint on from her family markings which was -never- seen. She almost didn't even look like Kiyoko at all...* - Wed Nov 11 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Well.. It's mainly just learning the techniques I'm interested in. Just in case I need them. - Wed Nov 11 06:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Course not. - Wed Nov 11 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sounded like it by how you said that. - Wed Nov 11 06:46:36 2015
