<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yes get some rest. - Wed Dec  9 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had on a lab coat over her chuunin and shinobi gear, she also had... glasses on... *Cough* READING GLASSES OKAY? She blinked a few times with a squint and then pulled the glasses off. "O-oh come in Mitsunara-chan."* - Wed Dec  9 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked down to the glasses and sat them on the counter next to her notes. She looked over to Mitsunara and then gestured for her to come over futher into the lab as she buttoned up one more of her lab coat buttons. "Uh... just for reading, or else my eyes hurt. We won't start with the operation, I held off on making the compound since you were feeling out of it, I can work on it now and you keep me company?"* - Wed Dec  9 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sat down on a stool and replaced her reading glasses onto her nose with a small adjustment to their resting position. Once she was all set up she started to pull things out of the little medical refridgeration unit and various other tools for her to use with viles, thick chemical gloves, and the whole shabang. 

"The compound is going to be used to eye drop into your eyes and make you more sensitive to light as the first step of the testing. We will do this in several treatments of altered compounds to get the right one, I'm not going to lie, the risk you face is going blind if I do this... and because of that we will only work on one eye at a time and I have cadaver eyes on back up if such things happen that match your organ and blood type. I've already tested them so if you do go blind we can give you a surgery the next day to replace the eye."

She pulled on the thick chemical gloves, a hard mask, and plastic chemical resistant goggles to protect her eyes. Once everything was sat out she calmly spoke up again, "be sure to stay over there... if any of this gets on you while I'm mid creation it might harm you, I'm not entirely sure what the lasting effects might be." With that she took up a lengthy eye dropper used for moving chemicals from vile to vile for testing. Kiyo dripped some base compound into the main vile she was going to use the combine the mixture which was basically nothing dangerous, simply a base liquid used for eye drops. This was pretty much a pre-mixed combination of purified water, silver sulfate, sodium nitrate, and borate buffer. 

Next she took up a bottle of phenylephrine and took in the lower end amount of what she wanted to use to start things small. Lowering the eye dropper tool into the long vile with the base compound she dripped the phenylephrine into the vile and then used a small stirring tool made of glass and then set it off to the side in a biochemical tray to keep the area preserved. Next she added in an experimental aid that she had developed over several testing periods to use to force the eye to remain dilated even after a few hours. This was going to keep her eye dilated so that the iris muscle would be constantly strained and forced back. She hoped that this would lead to a new development on how the iris behaves so she could study it's reaction to dilation over an extended period of time. She was hoping for a max of a few days for the effects to last for this treatment.* - Thu Dec 10 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) listened to the girl and nodded slowly, "I want to make sure you are safe...you're a really good friend of Lera and me... " she paused and smiled girlishly, "in many ways." Rubbing her lips together under the mask as her cheeks flushed faintly, placing all her tools down and then putting the vile into the vortex mixer and pressed a few buttons to get it spinning the closed vile. She stood up and walked over towards Mitsunara after pulling off the chemical gloves and putting them into the biochemical recycle bin for gloves, masks, goggles, and heavy aprons to be sterilized for use in the future. 

She pulled on a pair of medical gloves and then had Mitsunara set the book off to the side and lay back while remaining still. She took out a pen light and tested the basic dialation responses of her eyes and then took a small scope up and peered into Mitsunara's eyes one by one while being very close in proximity to study the iris muscle formation on each eye. "Which eye would you like me to focus on today?" 

Pulling back she walked back over to the vortex mixer and opened the top to pull out the vile. Uncorking it she placed on a little eye dropper top and walked over towards Mitsunara. "Up to you which eye we start with, I suggest your non dominant eye of course." She adjusted the dropper and pulled out a small notepad to set beside Mitsunara on the table for her to take notes of the reaction initially after contact would be made.* - Thu Dec 10 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then using her left hand she parted the upper and lower lid and directed Mitsunara to look away from the eye drop. She then squeezed just enough for two eye drops of the special chemical mixture to hit her eye. She stepped back to watch the reaction, of course... it -probably- was going to burn and not feel all that pleasant since this compound had turned out bad.* - Thu Dec 10 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gripped Mitsunara's arm quickly and tried to rush her over to the station that was specially made to flush out eyes. "Hurry hurry!" She would try to get the girl to rinse out her eyes as fast as possible but it would be too late, the damage had been done. Standing off to the side biting down on her lip she wated for Mitsunara to finish flushing out her eye and then examined the damage, "S-shit... are you sure you want me to do this? I don't want to hurt you and it seems I did a bit of damage with that compound."* - Thu Dec 10 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) grumbled a bit, "Go home and rest for a while... make sure to wear sunglasses."* - Thu Dec 10 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) settled down at her work station with all of her gear pulled on: goggles, mask, lab coat, and heavy chemical gloves. She started a new vial for the compound and then dripped into her base compount mainly of purified water but a few other things to bond the chemicals together. She had been working on a new experimental chemical the last few days and needed to combine it now with the phenylephrine to see how it would react. 

Dripping the phenylephrine into the vial she then sat the eye dropper to the side. Going to the small fridge she took out a variety of inactive chemicals and then went to work in a dish with carbon-hydrogen compounds and tried to add in various types of organic molecules to create a new chemical that would hopefully be a new direction to her attempts to force the iris muscle back permanently.

She messed up a few times and the bond didn't occur but finally she got a chemical that looked like it was going to bond properly. She did various treatments of special forms of light rays and placing the compound into the vortex mixer several times until finally she had the new experimental chemical created. Sighing out she took a small break as the chemical was stored away into the refridgeration unit on the counter and changed out of her gear and into a fresh set. Once she was ready, Kiyoko called Mitsunara back over the phone and then went to adding the new chemical to the mixture of phenylephrine and base saline. 

Tossing the vial into the vortex mixer she waited off to the side while resting on a stool and tapping her pencil while writing notes occasionally. She clearly wasn't sleeping much because of this and her eyes were blood shot from staring intensely for so many hours. Once the compound was finally mixed and the vortex mixer stopped humming as it came to a stop, she pulled on a pair of medical gloves, switched out the stopper for a eye dropper top and waited for Mitsunara to arrive.* - Thu Dec 10 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) waved to Mitsunara and patted the table for her to sit down. She already had the eye dropper in hand and then leaned forward and parted the upper and bottom lid on the woman to drip it into the same left eye as before. She waved off what Mitsunara said but knew she was right about the sleep. After two eye drops had been put into her left eye she pulled away and did a few tests to examine the reaction. "Looks like we have a positive reaction, let me know how long it lasts yeah?"* - Thu Dec 10 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Right, will do Doc. - Thu Dec 10 02:00:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hi. - Thu Dec 10 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was sitting at the counter working on some of Mitsunara's compound for her experiments when Izanami walked in saying hello (Before all that Alister bullshit happened). She turned on the stool and stood up, <I swore I locked that door> "Hey uh, you wanted to get started yeah? We sort of got delayed with both of our promotions but uhm... just come over and sit on the table here and we can do some nerve testing first." She had been brain storming lately on how to get the nerves in her shoulder and arm nub working and now she needed to see if the tests would work or not. Going through a variety of cabinets, Kiyo started to pull out various gear and machines she brought over and sat on the table beside where she wanted Izanami to sit.* - Thu Dec 10 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) thinks: Hnnn...! - Thu Dec 10 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) recognized Erin and thats why she hadn't been kicked out yet. She started to go through a variety of the machines and decided she was going to start with one a little unorthodox but it was the best shot for Izanami's nerves being repaired without major surgery and nerve replacement in all honesty. She had Izanami roll up her sleeve and remove all metal objects from her person, as well as rubber and then began to connect little patches of jelly covered circles with wires attached to them to her arm and shoulder area along various places where there were nerve endings and circiuts that controlled her arm movement. 

"So this is probably going to hurt... like... -a lot-. If you want me to stop let me know, I'm not going to force you to do anything. It's not going to make you seize or anything, the most you are going to likely end up with if something goes bad is some muscle numbness in your shoulder and chest and probably something like.... eh, maybe twitching? That's the worst of it really, there is also always a chance this could damage the nerves further if you want me to do it at the best result possible which means more electricity. We are basically going to be shocking your nerve endings to try and give them a little kickstart." She waited to see if Izanami was ready to continue.* - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) thinks: Oh man she's gonna be in pain. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then flipped on the machine and messed with some nobs, a few rounds of the electifying shocks would go thorugh her arm but she would feel nothing there---but the nodes that were on her shoulder and back region she would feel medium pulses of shock that would hurt since Kiyo hadn't started lightly with the treatment.* - Thu Dec 10 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes and shut off the machine quickly at how Izanami had reacted. "D-do you want to stop?!" Her voice sounded panicked at how Izanami had reacted, she didn't want to hurt anyone!* - Thu Dec 10 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: N-no. - Thu Dec 10 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-okay... - Thu Dec 10 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Haha...i've been hit with worse.. - Thu Dec 10 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: GIVE IT MORE POWER, DOKTOR! - Thu Dec 10 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ...Mrm... That's the spirit.. - Thu Dec 10 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) frowned a bit at Izanami's comment and then turned on the switches again but this time at a more controlled hertz. The treatment would be much more bearable, but of course not COMFORTABLE, as it went on for several minutes and as Kiyoko scanned with her sensing and took note of how the nerves reacted she pricked Izanami's arm to try and see if any nerves would respond (which they would, but Izanami won't be able to feel it or notice).* - Thu Dec 10 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: VERY GOOD, DOKTOR! AHAHAHAHA! NOW, DOKTOR! CHANNEL ZE SPIRIT OF MENGELE! - Thu Dec 10 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) didn't change anything on the settings since the frequency seemed to be working well. She continued to test the nerves around her arm and shoulder. More nerves began to shoot off and Kiyo felt a smile tugging at her lips, she forced it away quickly not wanting to give Izanami too much hope just yet. The machine kept wizzing and the small buzz of the shocks emitted while Kiyo wrote notes and worked quickly as the treatment continued.* - Thu Dec 10 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thought about how Izanami was trying to distract herself, "Maybe we could bring in some music to play next time so that you can have something to focus on? Or maybe a TV? Do you like TV or music?" She was monitoring the machine all the while as she spoke and tried to distract the girl with conversation. ---at this point it would seem like the nerves had been overloaded, as soon as she saw this, Kiyo would try to shut it off as quickly as possible.* - Thu Dec 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay... I think that's enough for today. - Thu Dec 10 06:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked sort of worried about Izanami, "Hey uh... try not to go shouting from the top of your lungs that I hurt you.... the police force already doesn't like how things have gone bad for me in the hospital... I need to keep my record clean."* - Thu Dec 10 06:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) folded her hands into seals and started to heal the major bruising but the fractured bones were going to have to heal themselves.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had a nurse wrap Mitsunara's ribs and then handed the one year old purple haired boy off to her.* - Fri Dec 11 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) went into the lab's back room and then pulled on several pieces of gear for her to begin working on the same compound she was already using on Mitsunara. What she wanted to do was add in a bit more of the experimental chemical she had created so that it would be a more potent dose to see how it might turn out. She was hoping for a good result after all since Mitsunara had already gone through some pain for this. Adjusting her thick chemical gloves she took up the lengthy eye dropper and then opened the chemical's vial and began the slow process of luring the eye dropper down the tube.

Once the proper amount of the chemical creation was extracted she gently moved it over to the main vial of compound being used to change Mitsunara's dilation. As the mixture was complete she put on a stopper and slid the little tube into a slot in the vortex mixer and let it whirl away in a spin to combine the compound to completion. While that was going she switched out of her chemical gloves and into a pair of specialized gloves with tiny grooves for gripping and went over to a different station on the counter.

She pulled out a few petri dishes of tissue samples, one being a biopsy from Izanami's arm after it had been amputated, a section that was still active with live cells not the dead cell area, and a petri dish marked 'Sal Alpha'. She first took the top off of the biopsy from the arm and then off of the alpha test and extracted the blastomea cells in the dish to move over towards the biopsy dish. She formed handseals and then focused healing chakra over the two to bond them together as one. What was special about these cells is that they were the regrowth cells from a salamander. She was trying to use these to re-inhibit growth in the live biopsy from a human to encourage growth of new cells. 

She knew it was very likely that either it would be rejected entirely, or it would end up trying to regrow a salamander's tail or limb that it was designed to create... there was only a slim chance it might replicate the cells from the human biopsy, and she was trying to condition these blastomea cells to learn how to replicate human cells rather than salamanders. The vortex mixer shut off, and Kiyo's head rose in response. Putting the petri dishes away to work their magi---science, she pulled the compount out of the mixer and put a eye dropper stopper on the open end. Walking over towards Mitsunara with a small smile, "you ready then?"* - Fri Dec 11 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) leaned forward and pulled Mitsunara's bottom and top lid back before dripping the compound into her eye. Seeing that the reaction wasn't a severe one but not exactly 'great' either she noted it down in her work notes on Mitsunara's research study and then nodded. "Do you think you can stand another set of drops?" She waited with the compound in hand wanting to push this experiment further along.* - Fri Dec 11 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hassan, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) dripping two more drops into the left eye she took up a scope and leaned in closely to watch the transition. Frowning when nothing changed literally at all, nothing... not even a small shift in the iris muscle. "Erg... I think the iris might be getting used to the compound, I need to change it again."* - Fri Dec 11 02:03:18 2015
