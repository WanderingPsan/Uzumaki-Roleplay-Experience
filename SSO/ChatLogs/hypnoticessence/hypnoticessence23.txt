<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) kissed her again with another peck, pausing a few centimeters from her lips. She flicked her gaze from Lera's lips up to her eyes and then back down and up again to search the woman's eyes as her heart pounded with emotion of love and sadness mixing. Her lips pressed against Lera's own again slightly more romantic this time, then deeper... she pulled away between each kiss, getting a little breath of air as the kisses became deep and slow, strong and constant with the most delicate of care with each movement.* - Sat Nov 28 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) panted softly as she broke the kiss for a moment and gripped Lera's shoulder and pulled her down onto the ground on top of her with full force of falling onto her back with Lera on top of her. Running her hand up through the girl's lengthy hair and gripping semi firm before kissing her again with a wince of pain from falling to the gound. Her other hand was running along Lera's side and then over her back. When she broke the kiss again she went to Lera's ear again, "I think you deserve the chance to fuck me as hard as you want right now... we both need it. Take out the pain, Lera... make it hurt till it feels good."* - Sat Nov 28 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) bit down on her lip as she was cautious to not tear her dress. She kind of wished Lera had tore it off of her in the moment of things, sure she would regret it later....but in that moment it would have helped them both. As her bra snapped it left a red mark against her back as the strap tore and her bra went flying across the floor while Kiyo's eyes followed it. Suddenly she felt the lips and teeth teasing her nipple causing her to gasp out and grip one hand onto the couch and the other on the leg of the coffee table. "Nngng..." she hadn't expected such sudden stimulation for some reason. "Don't need to be careful, Lera.... I know how you are, you've always been holding back... only when you tore off that shower door did you let go. Go ...ngng.. crazy."* - Sat Nov 28 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) jumped a bit when her panties were torn off and her heart was beginning to race with beathing intensifying due to seeing Lera's body and the aggressive nature of feeling clothing ripped off of you most private areas. As the fingers entered so quickly she gasped out and her eyes bulged as she reached down to Lera's wrist and held on tightly with nails digging in. "Oh FUCK?!" She groaned as her eyes rolled back and she went slack soon after as her body writhed from the focused attention on her g-spot so quickly when she had only been slightly around a few moments ago. The thumb circling her clit made her hips pick off of the floor boards to meet the rotations and rolled her hips against each passing over the top of her clit.* - Sat Nov 28 10:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) watched the girl with a gasping breath and a low growly groan as she sat her remove her pants. When the woman pressed her sex against Kiyo's own she had to bite down on her bottom lip hard enough to turn it white around where her teeth imprinted. "Nng..." her eyes rolled back against soon after as she held onto one of Lera's thighs and the other hand gripped the coffee table leg as their pelvis' fit together and the stimulation of grinding managed to get Kiyo further into a state of craving.* - Sat Nov 28 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was sort of in the moment....but when the vibating toy touched her she yelped in surprise and jumped a few inches. "W-wahhh...ngng..." She had never played with toys before but she had be penetrated at least. She squirmed on the floor and instantly was unable to speak out of utter pleasure as her body trembled from the vibrating and her cheeks turned bright red.* - Sat Nov 28 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whined heavily as she looked up to Lera holding back on her. Kiyo seemed perfectly fine and even gripped Lera's hips to try and force her deeper with a heavy shudder of her body. "Nng... Lera, come on... you are taking it easy, stop this shit," her words growled out in a way unlike Kiyo normally. * - Sat Nov 28 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) gasped out as the hard fucking radiated through her body, "Oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, yeah, like that bae--" she cut off as the fingers forced into her ass and she jumped some with a buck of he hips before groaning out loudly into a scream of pleasure and pain. Dragging finger nails down Lera's sides causing red streaks and gripping onto her hips as she rested under the girl with heavy pants making her chest rise and fall. She reached for her forehead and temple rubbing and gripping her hair as she parted her lips and then licked over them before resuming panting. An orgasm quickly began to surface and force out as she tensed hard enough that for a moment her vibrating body had froze with no breathing or relaxing in her muscles before letting go as a wild moan like a howl sounded out as she rode the climax through.* - Sat Nov 28 11:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was unable to speak any longer as her words became incoherent and she struggled to make any sound but moans as she was forced to continue on through her orgasm. No let up... it only made a second orgasm quickly pick up as Lera leaned in to whisper and then bite down on her neck. "N----ngnngg...!" She sceamed out again with the sensation of pain and pleasure. Her legs tried to wrap about Lera's body to hold on tight with one hand going through the woman's hair to grip tightly for more support. She was loosing control and already she had a leg cramp but chose to ignore it.* - Sat Nov 28 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt her eyes water from the teeth biting into her, -finally- Lera had gotten to what Kiyo was really asking of her. She felt the teas poor as the pleasure seeped through her entire being. Kiyo screamed out with a grunt initializing it's beginning from the deep plunge into he ass that was likely going to leave her sore. She never had been bit this hard before...fucked this hard before in her ass, hell she neve had given her ass to anyone before so this was entirely new to her. Lera had definitely made her sore, she probably wasn't going to be walking for a few days because of it.* - Sat Nov 28 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: There...I didn't hold back.. - Sat Nov 28 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rest her head back and then groaned in pain as the dildo was removed. "W-wasn't what I meant, but it...d-did what I meant for the e-end result..ngnng...I can't move..." She was twitching and shaking from shock of the pain and pleasure.* - Sat Nov 28 11:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) groaned as she was picked up and shook heavily against her as her hot body was exposed to the cold air sending a chill ove her form and hardening her nipples. Curling in against Lera and feeling her teeth chatter some, "F-fuck."* - Sat Nov 28 11:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No... I expected more. - Sat Nov 28 11:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pulled the covers over her head as she pouted teasingly and trembled with teeth chattering occasionally.* - Sat Nov 28 11:37:10 2015
