"I mean I can probably remove the stitches in a week, I'm just going to look really bad. I'm pretty much healed on the stuff that was preventing me from working. Course I can't even really start training in the areas that I want to train in without getting my weapons made but Marco can't make them." She wrinkled her nose and kicked some dirt faintly.* - Fri Nov 13 10:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) began to look Saizo over from the short six or so feet to see if she saw anything wrong with him. If she saw nothing wrong with him physically she would activate her ability to sense to scan over his chakra to see if there was something wrong with it but also to determine his aura of nature to determine if he was having malicious intent or was pure.* - Fri Nov 13 10:31:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I'm serious. - Fri Nov 13 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: What seems to be the issue... and did you do anything that could have led to this pain? - Fri Nov 13 10:37:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Is it just the general genetalia area, is it a specific organ, or is it your inner thighs? - Fri Nov 13 10:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: ...Yes..? I guess it's a specific organ. My genitalia area. - Fri Nov 13 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright... have you looked at the issue yourself and have you been able to find any visible rashes or otherwise alarming signs of illness? Or is there only the soreness as an issue? - Fri Nov 13 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I can't see any rashes. It's the soreness for the most part, I wouldn't know at first glance. I don't have medical training. - Fri Nov 13 10:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded and then stepped forward, "I'm going to pull your robe up and have a look now, this might cause you a bit of discomfort as I check for any issues such as strain or other things that might have caused the soreness. We just want to check if there's anything broken that could cause you to need surgery, if there isn't then we can go ahead and just perscribe you a painkiller."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Can you give me a pill? - Fri Nov 13 10:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: There are no pills to make that go away, you have to make it go away on your own. So unless you've had that for more than four hours then I can't give you the treatment for it. - Fri Nov 13 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I've had it the entire day. How do I make it go away on my own? - Fri Nov 13 10:51:31 2015

"I'll be right back," she headed out of the room and then went to go get some blood pressure medication and an IV. She came back into the room and then began to prepare the needle. "This will help but you probably will have to stay overnight for it to go through it's full dosage." She would intend to stick him with the needle in the vein at the bend of his arm if he didn't resist.* - Fri Nov 13 10:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...are you going to consent? - Fri Nov 13 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I don't see how stabbing me is going to help that. - Fri Nov 13 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...it isn't stabbing. - Fri Nov 13 10:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...It's going to go under your skin into you vein to deliver the IV fluid. - Fri Nov 13 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And the blood pressure medication. - Fri Nov 13 10:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Isn't there another way? Or a pill of some sort? - Fri Nov 13 10:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I don't think anyone likes needles. - Fri Nov 13 10:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm not going to -stab- you. - Fri Nov 13 10:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No, I'm sorry but this only can be solved by an injection over a period of time. - Fri Nov 13 10:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: This is only safe if you've really had your erection all day. - Fri Nov 13 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Because that's how long for the treatment to process. - Fri Nov 13 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: How do I get rid of it on my own as you said? - Fri Nov 13 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And we have to make sure there isn't any muscle stretches that are going to be long term problems for you. - Fri Nov 13 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: After this long of a period of time there is no method for you to get rid of the issue on your own. - Fri Nov 13 10:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Why can't I solve it on my own? - Fri Nov 13 10:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) didn't hesitate after he consented and attached the IV to his arm and taped it down before injecting the blood pressure medication into the IV bag. "I'm not sure what happened to you, did you take any foreign medications?"* - Fri Nov 13 10:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then I'm not sure how it could have happened. - Fri Nov 13 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: What's the usual cause? - Fri Nov 13 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) went out into the hall and retrieved a brochure and brought it back to hand to the male. "Here is a brochure on healthy masterbation methods, this is how you can deal with the issue if it happens again, which it very likely will for your age. The brochure explains everything for you, I need to get back to my shinobi duties but the head nurse on duty will bring you water or food if you need it."* - Fri Nov 13 11:00:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Anyway. . I have to do my rounds. .  - Fri Nov 13 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: but next time I am free. - Fri Nov 13 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh, alright. - Fri Nov 13 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Let's get some food. - Fri Nov 13 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Sure.~ - Fri Nov 13 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) didn't recognize Lera at first since she was busy doing something in one of her medical records books. When she saw bare legs in front of her she slowly looked up and saw the rest of the female, with a bit of shock she parted her lips slightly. "O-oh?" reaching out to the hand and taking it as she came to a stand to be led away.* - Fri Nov 13 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ... - Fri Nov 13 14:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stared at the cloth before biting down on her inner lip and nodding, "This isn't going to end up getting my stitches pulled on accident is it?" She turned around after releasing Lera's hand.* - Fri Nov 13 14:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope not at all. - Fri Nov 13 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was uneasy from being led around blindfolded and heard all the different sounds knowing they were inside a building now that smelt good. "Uh....sure?"* - Fri Nov 13 14:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) opened her eyes as the blindfold was removed. Blinking a few times she looked around the room but stopped her gaze circling when it fell onto Lera's dress. "W-wou..." she couldn't say anything as her gaze looked the woman up and down. "Y-you did all this for me?" She couldn't believe it as her eyes couldn't remove themselves from Lera's dress and overall look. * - Fri Nov 13 14:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled gently at the kiss to her hand, "You certainly did. That's all this is then? Just a surprise dinner?" She rubbed her lips together wishing she had been dressed nicer and having showered more recently than a day and a half ago since she had been on such a long shift. She felt weird about it all that she wasn't prepared for something like this.* - Fri Nov 13 14:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) blinked not knowing what Lera had been about to say and simply adjusted herself on the chair and trying not to think about her itchy stitches. "What was that?" She smiled meekly when Lera mentioned about her always being beautiful, "That's sweet, Love.~ So what are we eating then?"* - Fri Nov 13 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You can eat whatever you want. Money is no object. - Fri Nov 13 14:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm.~ - Fri Nov 13 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Spoil me why don'tcha. - Fri Nov 13 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Always~ - Fri Nov 13 14:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) giggled before picking up a menu to look it over, "did you rent out the whole restaraunt for this?" Peeking up to Lera's face as she asked the question. Peering back to the menu soon after and reading over the selection. "What are you going to get?"* - Fri Nov 13 14:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened here yes at what she was going to order. "I.... I think I will let you order for me, Lera," she sat the menu down and closed it as a tender but nervous smile formed on her lips. "Would you be good with that?" swallowing hard as she tried to collect her thoughts, this place was certainly nice, it made Kiyoko feel all the more poor just being in this room.* - Fri Nov 13 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) licked over her teeth and then smiled to Lera, "Of course not, not nervous." She relaxed some with an exhaled sigh, "Tomato sounds good."* - Fri Nov 13 14:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rubbed her thumb over the back of Lera's hand while watching it for a bit. "I'm feeling better, just ...itchy, tired sometimes... glad to be working again though. I spoke with your father about extending the time restraint on helping Aza so he sort of extended it."* - Fri Nov 13 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The time restraint? - Fri Nov 13 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Him and Yan had put a time restraint on him getting in check... - Fri Nov 13 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Do you want me to speak to him? - Fri Nov 13 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no, I already did, when a month has passed he will review him and if he has made progress, which he has already, then the time will be extended. - Fri Nov 13 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright thats good then. - Fri Nov 13 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Pretty sure your dad likes talking to me. - Fri Nov 13 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) hitched her thoughts there for a moment and leaned forward holding Lera's hand a little tighter for a moment. "Does he know you are seeing me?"* - Fri Nov 13 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm...no I don't think he does honestly. It wouldn't bother him though. - Fri Nov 13 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He might have heard though...not much escapes him these days - Fri Nov 13 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He's shrewd old man - Fri Nov 13 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see, I thought you might have told him. - Fri Nov 13 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We have very different working times...he's often napping while i'm up and about - Fri Nov 13 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn, I see. - Fri Nov 13 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Something weird as hell happened on shift earlier. - Fri Nov 13 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Had to deal with my first extended erectial issue. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Extended ere...wow. Boy do I feel sorry for you - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Guy didn't even know what masterbation was.... - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah...... - Fri Nov 13 15:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How old was he?? - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I tried to avoi--sixteen I believe he said. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Damn... - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I found it hard to believe but he was dead serious the entire time. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Pshh..what do they even teach anymore. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And he hadn't taken any pills... I don't know how he even has the issue but I treated him. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right right. I wouldn't wish your job on anyone. - Fri Nov 13 15:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Hah... - Fri Nov 13 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My day was certainly less interesting I can tell you. - Fri Nov 13 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? How did it go? - Fri Nov 13 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Prety well, had a sparring session with a Jounin; came to a draw in the end, but it was fun. - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, nothing majorly interesting. - Fri Nov 13 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: How is your new business going? - Fri Nov 13 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Haven't had any customers yet, but eh; I'm sure i'll get some eventually. - Fri Nov 13 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A huge number of the jutsu I know are quite common. I may have to extend the business to include personal training. - Fri Nov 13 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well I know you have one student.~ But she's rather cheap and pays in other forms of currency. - Fri Nov 13 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rose a single brow and gave a crooked grin.* - Fri Nov 13 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) inhaled deep and slow for a moment, "Heh... uh... so anyhow, when will you teach me next?~"* - Fri Nov 13 15:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Once you're fully healed, I'll teach you any time. - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right right, making me wait. Hmph.~ - Fri Nov 13 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hah, Just want to make sure you're one hundred percent first. - Fri Nov 13 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I used to push myself to the point of injury, its really not good for you. - Fri Nov 13 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes I understand, love. I haven't even used my healing ninjutsu. - Fri Nov 13 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Good~ - Fri Nov 13 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm... where is that soup? - Fri Nov 13 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) peered over to Lera, she realized this was the first time they actually ate together. Two very busy schedules only left time for them to talk or ...do other things together. "Oh, I'm going to have to give you that flu shot later, missy. You aren't afraid of needles like most of this village I hope? Your father's pretty serious about everyone getting it and I don't want you sick." Then she paused before bringing the spoon holding some of the soup to her mouth. <Course I wouldn't mind taking care of her...>* - Fri Nov 13 15:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He's having me give the entire shinobi force them. - Fri Nov 13 15:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Fri Nov 13 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thought about this after taking a taste of the herbal filled tomato soup, it made her taste buds tingle at how amazing it was. Who knew tomato soup was even capable of this much flavor dimension. "That's part of why I thought you might have told your father about us, he asked me specifically to do it when there are many other medics and I'm only recently a shinobi."* - Fri Nov 13 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It just goes to show how good you are. - Fri Nov 13 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh, I think you are just trying to butter me up. - Fri Nov 13 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Whaaat me??? Noooooo. Would I do such a thing? - Fri Nov 13 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes,  you do so all the time.~ - Fri Nov 13 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Fri Nov 13 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't help it. Every time I see you I just want to jump on you and have my way with you!! - Fri Nov 13 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flushed a deep red, "s-so what will we have for the main course then?" She licked over her lips and sat the spoon in the bowl that was now empty. Clearly the nurse was very hungry and hadn't realized it before.* - Fri Nov 13 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hmmmm. I wonder if you can keep up with me? - Fri Nov 13 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe. - Fri Nov 13 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Keep up with you on what? - Fri Nov 13 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I told you that I love food right? its one of my...indulgences. I tend to eat enough for three people. - Fri Nov 13 15:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Well... I can't eat that way. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The only downside is the amount of work I have to do to keep this figure... - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'd get fat otherwise. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I sort of eat...rather healthy normally. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I only indulge occassionally. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe. I find that as long as you balance it with some real intense workout. - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its fine - Fri Nov 13 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyways. I'll have a curry, a plate of salad and I think a rare beef steak. Don't let me make your choice though, theres a lot of good food here~ - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No I know but I just try to avoid things that are bad for me. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Certain fats and s---ehh heh... woops. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt embarrassed going all 'healthy' talk all of a sudden.* - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No no, I want you to choose. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh jeez...if you keep making faces like that I really won't be able to wait. - Fri Nov 13 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right right... - Fri Nov 13 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Something healthy... - Fri Nov 13 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just... this seems like a special night. - Fri Nov 13 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So order what you think I might like....that is on the more indulgent side I think. - Fri Nov 13 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'll cheat. - Fri Nov 13 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh alright~ - Fri Nov 13 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) smiled warmly over to the woman.* - Fri Nov 13 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes as her mouth watered, "T-that sounds good."* - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: I've never had lobster.... - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I picked right! yay~ - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I know you like Sushi. Lobster comes quite close. - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Y-yes, I... I must confess I've never been able to afford lobster. - Fri Nov 13 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well. You'll always be able to afford it now. - Fri Nov 13 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) lowered her gaze and bit down on her lip, "I'm not sure how to feel about that... I didn't know you had such money. I mean your house is nice but I thought that was because you were the daughter of the Kazekage."* - Fri Nov 13 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: My parents used to throw money at me when I was younger. I've never exactly been...short on it. - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But not long ago I taught someone a technique that I created myself. - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see.... - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He paid me eight million to do so. - Fri Nov 13 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ....wow. - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: As you can imagine...i've lived pretty well off since then - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And here I was sweating over a million alone to possibly get my weapons. - Fri Nov 13 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Honestly I was going to buy you them as a present~ - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flushed a deep red while staring at Lera. "Y-you were?"* - Fri Nov 13 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm~ - Fri Nov 13 15:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's a -lot- though. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nah. Money is easy to come by. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Besides. Its just an object. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nothing is too much when it comes to you. - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I was thinking of getting regular sized ones and then large ones for more tactical uses...I couldn't have you pay for them.  - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* It doesn't bother me in the slightest. - Fri Nov 13 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) huffed, "Well alright then... I suppose I didn't tell you that it's kukiri I would like then, I was going to surprise you with my choice."* - Fri Nov 13 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe, Alright. Kukiri. - Fri Nov 13 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll find a blacksmith as soon as I can. - Fri Nov 13 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Fujitora will probably know a good one. - Fri Nov 13 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The blacksmith in the village...doesn't do weapons apparently. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah. I already asked him. - Fri Nov 13 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh. - Fri Nov 13 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...holy.... - Fri Nov 13 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) looked down at all the food and her mouth watered once more. It all was so beautiful she didn't want to mess it up.* - Fri Nov 13 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Go ahead and eat~ - Fri Nov 13 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It's so... - Fri Nov 13 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) 's eyes were the size of saucers, "why is it all so pretty?" Whispered out as she tried to pick up her fork to take a stab at a little bit of the lobster tail.* - Fri Nov 13 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) peered up to Lera, "at least with you paying for things I will know I can make you as much food as you are able to eat at home." She realized what she had said afterwards, stating 'home' made it sound like the future where they live together and it made her swallow hard as she finally brought the lobster meat to her lips and slipped it past. Her eyes closed and goose flesh came over her skin with shock of the flavor being so divine.* - Fri Nov 13 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt heat rising in her chest and cheeks again to that comment Lera made. She wanted to lean over and kiss her but wasn't sure how Lera might feel about kissing while eating. Taking a few more bites she went to eating her meal while giving occasional glances over to the woman. "You really try hard to spoil me, what if I grow rotten?"* - Fri Nov 13 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) giggled girlishly and watched how Lera was putting all the food away. "How are you even doing that? Elephant.~" Sticking her tongue out to the girl.* - Fri Nov 13 16:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) probably had finished her food long before Lera did.* - Fri Nov 13 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Next time I won't be so polite~ - Fri Nov 13 16:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I had to learn to eat...fast. - Fri Nov 13 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why's that? - Fri Nov 13 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Because whenever I ate with other people, they usually finished in less than half the time. - Fri Nov 13 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't like making people wait for me. - Fri Nov 13 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I see... - Fri Nov 13 16:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes yes.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) picked up her dessert fork and licked over her lips. "This looks...amazing..." she was in shock at this meal and probably assumed she never would have anything so delicious again in her life! Piercing her fork into the cake for a small bite she brought it to her lips for a tasted and moaned lightly.* - Fri Nov 13 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Are you going to tell me at some point what this is all about? - Fri Nov 13 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If it was just a surprise I feel like you might have let me get dressed up. - Fri Nov 13 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I just wanted to treat you. - Fri Nov 13 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Uhuh.~ - Fri Nov 13 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) took another bite or two, enjoying every piece, she didn't get dessert often.* - Fri Nov 13 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) flushed a pale pink and continued to eat her dessert before eventually finishing it off and taking a drink of water. "What now then? More surprises?"* - Fri Nov 13 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not just yet~ But you better keep an eye out~ - Fri Nov 13 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh? - Fri Nov 13 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I might just get you one day~ - Fri Nov 13 16:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Get me what? - Fri Nov 13 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats for me to know and you to find out. - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) leaned across the table enough to kiss Lera lightly in a teasing way.* - Fri Nov 13 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) leaned back from the kiss with a glowing in her eyes from all the the romance. She went to reach for her water again and then froze as she spotted the ring on her plate that hadn't been there before. Her gaze slowly rose to Lera and then back down to the plate. She lowered her hand that had been reaching for the water down onto the table beside the plate as she stared at it with her chest beating heavily from emotion. * - Fri Nov 13 16:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) rubbed her lips together and trembled as she hadn't looked up to Lera yet. This was a big step and Lera hadn't even met her family or told her father they were seeing each other. "I...I um..." she felt her lower lip quivering, "can I ask you something first? I kn-know it's terrible timing but this is something I had meant to ask before this day had come. I didn't think it was going to come so fast. Heh.." She felt her cheeks burning hot and a small pant sounded as she chuckled. "This is ... so much, I feel like I'm in a dream..."* - Fri Nov 13 17:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) reached out for the ring and slowly pulled it onto her left ring finger. "Yes, I will marry you Lera."* - Fri Nov 13 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) stood up and walked over to sit down on Lera's lap with arms wrapping around the back of her neck to rest upon her shoulders. Kiyo lowered her face to be just in front of Lera's and kissed her gently. "I'll love you till the sea has washed away Suna's sands and then some."* - Fri Nov 13 17:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I mean sure. But you're not a combat type are you? - Fri Nov 13 18:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Did you stay for your entire treatment? - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Rias... - Fri Nov 13 18:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I think you could handle him though... - Fri Nov 13 18:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: But I will definate need you to teach me a few things in a spar Lera. But later ok? - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: It would be nice. - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure. - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I miss you being rough with me... - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Thank you for your kindness - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess if you want to talk now...can you follow me? - Fri Nov 13 18:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Now, you needed to speak to me Aki- sure  - Fri Nov 13 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But jeesh...it doesn't look like anyone feels like sparring. - Fri Nov 13 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Lame... - Fri Nov 13 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not even the bored kid? - Fri Nov 13 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: The temptation to call him something like...erection boy...so strong. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I can't win against you. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: No point trying. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And? You should strive to fight the strongest opponents. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: I could get in trouble. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: No. - Fri Nov 13 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Only relatively stronger. A stomp isn't a fight. It's a stomp. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Don't worry, I won't - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* You get more experience that way, but whatever. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: But you're right, on the condition that it's a fight, fighting against those stronger than you yields the most experience. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Yes. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What if I deigned to use only my hands. No sword, no jutsu. - Fri Nov 13 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heck if you make me break that rule, you win. - Fri Nov 13 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: You'd still win effortlessly. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you keep selling yourself short, you'll never progress. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: It's like an elephant vs a mouse. I'd like to at least get horse size. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm not even a taijutsu specialist. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I suck at Taijutsu. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I'm a nothing specialist. I suck at everything. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Legit. - Fri Nov 13 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* Whatever I guess. - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: I can wrestle little children but that's about it. - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But out of curiosity. What exactly are you thinking of specialising in? - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saizo(Xerif) says: Anything that comes my way. I know better than to be picky. - Fri Nov 13 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right right. If you decide on Ninjutsu. Give me a shout. - Fri Nov 13 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: I think the business. We'll go there for a bit. I'll check some stuff over. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Hm? - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Jeez...still no customers. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I need to expand my archives I think. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mn.. - Fri Nov 13 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Tired hun? - Fri Nov 13 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Eh... a little...but I know you are active right now because of everything that is going on. - Fri Nov 13 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: We'll head back if you need to sleep. I can sing to you~ - Fri Nov 13 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: mmgnngn that's so tempting. - Fri Nov 13 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Are you sure? - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Of course~ - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: Course maybe we should be responsible... - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: And go see my parents. - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Ahhhh...that. Are you sure you're ready? - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: No...not at all. - Fri Nov 13 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: We can wait. If you really want to. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: But believe me when I say they can't refuse me. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: We can go. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Right. To your house then...don't worry. I already know where it is. - Fri Nov 13 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Your house got gratfiti'd - Fri Nov 13 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) asked to be let down as they were a few blocks away. She then headed up towards her large house that wasn't the fanciest. It was only large because of how many who lived there but unlike Lera's family they weren't spread out across the village like her's, oh no... all of Kiyo's family lived in one home. When she spotted the graffiti her nose wrinkled, "stupid kids..."* - Fri Nov 13 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) nodded to her and then headed up to the door and didn't need to pull out a key. The door was unlocked because there was always someone at home. She stepped inside and then spoke out in a elavated voice but it wasn't a shout, "We have company." In the background of the house they could hear shifting quickly as people were moving about and cleaning or trying to check how they looked or heading down the stairs to see who was there. Kiyo's father arrived first followed by a few other men and Kiyo's mother sat in the background of the entrance room on a comfy chair. She said nothing and only looked Lera over wondering why Kiyo had brought her home. 

Kiyo swallowed hard and before saying anything else she was taking off her shoes and lining them up with all the rest at the door and then brushing her hair back behind her ears so her facepaint was fully shown. It would be noted all of the female's had various types of the same color face paint and the men all had a tattoo in black on the right sides of their necks, Kiyo's father being the only different one from the rest likely to show the alpha of the family. Kiyo gave a look to Lera to take off her shoes, atleast she hoped that Lera understood the glance, and then turned with her head lowered towards her father in silence and waiting for him to speak. Depending on how Lera acted would determine what the father did.* - Fri Nov 13 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out as Lera spoke, and closed her eyes. The father squinted at the fact she had spoken without being spoken to and then called out towards Kiyoko in a booming voice simply from the bass of his tone rather than volume. "Kiyoko, who is this girl and why is she disrespecting this home with her presence?" Kiyo tensed and jumped some from him speaking and then she rose herself from the bow but kept her gaze downwards. She spoke in a voice that shown no emotion and was formal as it got, "This is Hassan, she is here to have dinner with us as my guest to the family. She is unaware of our customs and I should have informed her before entering on the basics, Father." 

Swallowing hard afterwards she hoped Lera might not get angry at the situation, Kiyo's mother shook her head at Kiyoko's speech in disappointment and then went back to knitting something for a child. A few children stood at the top few sets of the stairs peering down through the bars and the men who were in the entry way behind Kiyo's father muttered and whispered amongst themselves. As long as Lera didn't say anything else the father would look her over and then nodded even if he looked unhappy. "She will leave her weapons at the door for respect to the family, dinner is not for one more hour, you know this Kiyoko." Lowering her head a bit more at the light scolding she spoke up in response, "Yes, Father."* - Fri Nov 13 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) widened her eyes as she heard Lera undoing the jacket's zipper. Kiyoko knew the dress might be considered in appropriate but it's what Lera had on and was better than what she normally wore. The father grunted lightly and a few of the others whispered about it. The fact she hadn't removed Samehada though was enough to irritate him thoroughly. "All of the weapons, girl," boomed out as he waited.* - Fri Nov 13 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) sighed out in silence and then her father agrivated as he was becoming had a vein protrude on his neck. "The girl leaves, Kiyoko you have shamed this family by bringing someone so disrespectful into our presence." Her mother was watching and there was some sadness in her eyes but at the same time she was cold about it and didn't say a word to defend Kiyoko. No one else did either, "yes, Father." She tried to play her part but then shook her head and rose it.

"No actually, no..." her father interupted, "Excuse me, -child-?" his voice raising as she rose her's to try and trumph his own which was impossible. Reaching out for Lera's hand she took it within her own grasp. "I am marrying this girl, and she might not be the same as us and hold different customs but I am marrying her. And you don't have to worry about her tainting your house when we are married because we won't be living here, we will be living in her home and make it ours." This was a big deal all things considered since Kiyoko's family nevers moves away from the main family without extremely special cases. Her father said nothing and simply glared at the two girls.* - Fri Nov 13 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was glad Lera didn't say anything, but suddenly she gripped Lera's hand tightly and hoped she wouldn't do anything for what Kiyoko knew what was coming next. The father rose his hand and aimed to slap his daughter across the face, all of the people there were shinobi, including the women, so considering he was the leader of the family he was likely very strong. He was holding back while striking her but for someone like Kiyoko it was enough to split her lip. "Leave this house, you are no longer welcome. Until you remember who your family is then you are no longer one of us." As long as Lera hadn't stopped the father from his actions then Kiyoko would be panting from the pain as blood dripped down her chin. "I am part of this family, I will keep the name...the customs... because it is part of me but I will not be coming back until you have understood why you lost your daughter, because you were too foolish to see her happiness when it was in plain sight."* - Fri Nov 13 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) felt scared by the situation now, she didn't want Lera and her father to fight. Reaching up to Lera's arm she tried to coax her to pull away so she would let go. "Let's go..." whispered out as she tried to tug on Lera's arm to get her to leave with her. Grabbing the girl's coat with the weapons and her shoes without putting them on.* - Fri Nov 13 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That...could have gone better... - Fri Nov 13 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sorry Kiyoko, I didn't realise they were that...bad. - Fri Nov 13 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...it's fine. - Fri Nov 13 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) pulled her shoes back on.* - Fri Nov 13 19:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) was luckily retrieved by Aza in the right amount of time it seemed. She was running into the area with her stitches pulling and nearly on the brink of tearing but it was necessary from the tone in his voice when he had come to retrieve her. When she reached the girl's side, Kiyoko had already formed one handseal and was finishing the second. She wasn't -exactly- suppose to be using chakra right now because of her condition but Nina was going to bleed out if she didn't use it. 

Instantly chakra was being flowed down into the girl's arm with the mere attempt to stop the bleeding enough to slow it down. "Mizora, in my medical kit, get all the gauze out you can and the tourniquet -now-!" She had nearly shouted the end of the sentance as she managed to stop the bleeding a very small amount but not even close to enough to fully stop the bleeding. If Mizora had done what she said, the gauze would be quickly taken and stuffed down into the wound, this would be -extremely- painful but necessary to try and stop the bleeding further and keep sand out of the wound. I'm talking nearing some of the pain that Kiyoko had to go through when getting her wounds cleaned out by Ortho. (Who knew she would be saving his sister right? Weiiiiiird.)

Taking the tourniquette from Mizora she then wrapped it just under the shoulder joint and looked to the Hyuuga beside her. "I need you to crank that vice back and forth to tighten it, if I try I'm going to pull my stitches." The glow on Kiyoko's hands had gone away by now since she couldn't use the jutsu after there was gauze stuffed into the wound. Hopefully while Mizora was cranking the device she would reach into her medical kit and pull out a blood coagullant, "Let's hope you are old enough for this girl." As long as Nina was twelve years old she would be okay taking this type of medication, it would help thicken her blood to further slow down the blood loss. "I need someone to carry her to the hospital as quickly as possibly without shaking her around too much, I need her to stay conscious and get a blood transfusion going." Already Kiyoko pulled out a tiny test strip for blood testing and dipped the paper against Nina's arm to test the blood for the blood type on the way to the hospital.* - Sat Nov 14 07:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) walked in after Nina had been brought into the first emergency hospital room. Pulling on gloves from the wall dispenser and then a frontal light blue robe that tied at her back for sterile reasons she walked over to the bed to see if Nina was aware of where she was. "Can you tell me your name? Where you think you are? Do you know what happened, child?" She was brushing Nina's hair out of her face and then looked to Mirai as she walked in. "Toss on some gloves and a robe, go fetch me a stitching kit out of the cabinet over there, she is going to need surgery but we have to get her stable first before I can do that. Likely you will be assisting me tomorrow in surgery." She had another nurse go and retrieve A+ blood bags and an IV to set up. Once the needles were inserted with the IV at the bend of her elbow and the blood transfusion going into a needle located between her thumb and index finger at the 'V' shape there. Her hand would start to get very very cold from the transfusion but luckily for Nina she couldn't feel all that much right now from all the blood loss.

With the tourniquette on it had stopped most of the blood loss and the medication was kicking in nicely, the fresh blood was going to thin it back out but that would help to stabalize the girl. If Mirai had followed through with retrieving the stitching kit then Kiyo would look up to the white haired princess, "go ask the head nurse where the heat packs are and bring two or three in to wrap about her arm where the blood transfusion is going on, an extra blanket too for keeping her warm, she is going to start to get very cold soon and we don't want her going into shock further than she likely already is." With that, Kiyo started to use medical tweezers to remove the gauze from the wound, lucky for Nina she wouldn't feel this since the tourniquette was cutting off all of her blood circulation.* - Sat Nov 14 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) had glanced up at Mirai's actions noting that she acted without needing to be reminded which was good for a nurse, it was necessary in fact. Pulling apart the stitching kit to get the necessary items out after all of the gauze had been deposited on a tray beside Kiyo she began to stitch up the extremely large gash. As she went though, Kiyo paused and formed handseals to flow chakra into the wound after it had been stitched by using one of her hands, it was a difficult tactic she had picked up but a necessary one when working on emergency cases. It was taking -a lot- out of Kiyoko though to do all this and it was showing in her eyes and her face was becoming pale.

Wanting to keep Mirai close by not only to watch and learn but also to assist she spoke up in a much calmer voice now, "Mirai, please get ten milligrams of naproxen and inject it into the IV so that when I remove the tourniquette she won't be in severe pain." Kiyoko was trying to ignore the fact Nina had said something about Lera, but it was in the back of her mind. She had eventually finished the stitching up and then gestured Mirai to come over and watch how she released the tourniquette. "You don't want to release it too fast or the blood will rush into the limb and will leak out of the wound location. If you ease off of it though it's safe and doesn't hurt as much, you can't leave these on for more than four hours or they will lose the limb permanently, the nerves go dead and it has to be amputated." She set the tourniquette that was now disposable onto the tray with the gauze and left over pieces from the stitching and then stepped back for Mirai to come forward. "Please clean up around the wound, help get her changed into a hospital gown also if you can without hurting her arm and I will be back to check on the two of you. I need to go report this and find any family she might have, do you know her name at the very least, and if you know who any of her relatives are?" Kiyo was already pulling off her bloody gloves and the robe that was splattered with various specs of Nina's blood as well.* - Sat Nov 14 08:12:22 2015
