<br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) turned his head, noticing Reisen wave in his general direction. A simple nod was returned as a sort of 'hello' gesture.* - Sat Oct  3 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) says: How are you? - Sat Oct  3 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I am fine. - Sat Oct  3 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: You? - Sat Oct  3 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) says: Tired. . . - Sat Oct  3 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Then you should get some rest. - Sat Oct  3 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: .... - Sat Oct  3 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeds to nod once more, figuring the girl had nodded off or something, simply proceeding to make an exit from the area now. There was no longer a need for social interaction now.* - Sat Oct  3 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) drew forth his katana now, proceeding to let his mind rest on the act of utilizing it where he stood. In only a moment, Sabo was accessing his chakra as he allowed it to move over his blade and coat the weapon, easilly allowing himself access to the Samurai Sabre technique. Holding the hilt with both hands, he eventually found the length of the blade being extended past its original length before eventually settling in the midst of the air before him. Eventually Sabo was stepping forth, cutting a crease into the air with the extension.* - Sat Oct  3 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to make use of his blade, allowing himself to make several slashes back and forth as he applied his chakra, cascading its length over an even longer distance now. This had greatly enhanced the usage of his chakra as well now that he was utilizing chakra flow within his blade. Even eliminating the elemental weakness he had before with this.* - Sat Oct  3 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to make motions with the blade, slashing through the air with ease now. The technique he was using actually extending his blade quite a bit to allow his weapon to live up to its name of Laundry-Drying Pole. Sabo's eyes seemed to focus on the chakra coating the blade for a moment, wonder just how sharp they were together, considering he had yet to make contact with something other than air.* - Sat Oct  3 10:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to apply the same amount of chakra, stepping forward a bit now as he introduced himself to the shelves that remained within. Sabo's eyes peered across the various ones, looking for the least interesting and open one before proceeding to pull back his arm, raising his blade in an arc for a great diagonal slant. In an intense moment of focus, he found himself delivering his blade forward, shooting off a layer of chakra to strike against one of the shelf layers and sever it.* - Sat Oct  3 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) rose from within his position now as he heard the explosive forces take place not too far from his own position. His blade, which was seemingly still coated with chakra was moved towards his sheath, easily being inserted now. As he did so, he allowed his chakra to cease its efforts in the same motion before eventually making his way towards the door.

Upon exit, Sabo took sight of the massive creature known as Shukaku. Within a mere moment, Sabo recalled upon his first meeting with this beast and allowed himself to make an exit from the area, approaching the Mansion now as he had no intentions of just leaving, at least now yet of course.* - Sun Oct  4 00:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: And Suitengu. - Sun Oct  4 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Well then. - Sun Oct  4 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: That means the last match is Rymei against Kirie. - Sun Oct  4 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Or try to intervene in a match. - Sun Oct  4 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: I don't recommend it. - Sun Oct  4 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Now. - Sun Oct  4 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Haruna(ZenoKuthric) says: Disperse. - Sun Oct  4 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: The child speaks as if he has seen so much. - Sun Oct  4 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Is there more to him? - Sun Oct  4 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) simply observed Suitengu, nodding in response to his observation. "I'd agree if it was true." Nearly immediately however, Sabo's expression seemed to change, becoming a bit of a smirk as if he was ready for a bloodshed. A simple thought corssed his mind, and he could only wonder what benefits this child recieved from his father. 

Within a moment, Sabo was taking this chance to initiate the first move to get things started, producing a single shuriken from within his cloak, or so it appeared. One simply moving forward with the shadow cloaking another object however, and with greater eyesight, it could even be seen that this second, cloaked object had something attached to it.* - Sun Oct  4 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: So it begins. - Sun Oct  4 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Why would she say that she would not recomend intervening a match...I guess i'll have to see if it comes back to it. - Sun Oct  4 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) simply observed Suitengu's prowess with handseals as he soon went under. A sigh came from within, recognizing this technique from those in his past. However, rather than wasting the shuriken he'd already thrown, Sabo produced a single handseal, causing the tag he had placed on the hidden shuriken to produce its explosion. Considering he rarely used this technique and couldn't register how the jutsu affected the ground, Sabo was unsure of whether or not the ground would've been torn, but this was obviously his intent, to break it open.

However, regardless of this, Sabo would begin to make his way backwards, moving across the battlefield as to create a larger range between the two, assuming that the boy would probably move on a path towards Sabo and even attempt to catch him from underneath. Yet, in his moment Sabo had begun to utilize a single kunai, favoring it over his katana in this moment.* - Sun Oct  4 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Things are heating up here... - Sun Oct  4 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed Suitengu's presence now, proceeding to keep his eyes focused entirely on him. For a moment, Sabo was simply expressing his nonchalant mood about this scenario via spinning of the kunai, but soon proceeded to make an approach forward. He attempted to remain skeptic about the region they were within however, finding it odd that there was no follow-up to the tunneling technique.

As Sabo made his approach however, he began to prepare a few handseals of his own, proceeding to successfully complete up to five should he go untouched as he moved forward. His kunai setting in a flipped position of sorts.* - Sun Oct  4 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to keep his expression, seeing now that Suitengu had utilized his underground voyage to set a trap, anticipating Sabo's Kenjutsu prowess and preference for close-range. This had led him to simply change his reaction, quickly breaking the handseals and utilizing his reflexiveness to quickly extend his weapon's reach with the use of his chakra, quite easily forming his chakra around the blade into that of an unusually long sword.

A simply movement of his weapon and it crossed his front region, moving laterally from right to left to simply remove the heads of the wolves as he proceeded to stop his forward motion and back away, the end of his blade moving in a diagonal slant from his body to the ground. He was obviously attempting to escape the range that this Doton jutsu presented, and more importantly, the threads.

'Can't believe he made me use it this early...'

Sabo's otherhand however, had began to move itself towards the hilt of his katana, aiming to rest itself there for a moment as he kept his eyes open and his ears even more open, attempting to listen for any other actions of Suitengu.* - Sun Oct  4 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to make his bounds backwards, seeing that Suitengu's threads had an incredible range as well. This brought an intresting thought to Sabo's mind as he began to plan out his course of action with the approach. Opening his hand, he easily dropped the kunai he once held, now drawing forth his katana he proceeded to access one of his other Kenjutsu techniques now, letting his blade and his chakra combine once more to form an even faster slash.

Sabo's blade seemed to move with an impressive speed, beginning its arc from one end and moving to the complete opposite side, forming a complete crescent arc as a trail of chakra seemed to flow beneath it. A single breath was released, hoping that this was enough to sever the threads before him and end their approaching assault as he still followed his backwards movement, never seeming to stop backing  as he recognized this as a battle of range.* - Sun Oct  4 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) thinks: Sloppy...but effective.. - Sun Oct  4 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to back away, taking note of the wolves. While Sabo's previous actions had been slowing his escape from the wolves range, he now accessed the entirety of his speed, proceeding to break into a complete run as he required some way of overpowering the ninjutsu technique. However, not only did he take note of the jutsu still continuing its approach, but he recognized the sounds of quite a few onlookers. 

Sabo had now broken off into an angle of sorts, attempting to gain space between the jutsu and himself as he looked for an opening to make a more decisive strike against the child, finding this to be more difficult than expected considering Suitengu's ability.* - Sun Oct  4 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to listen to the region around him, turning his head back to notice the leave of the wolves. However, Sabo was now met with a kunai speeding towards his position, allowing himself to simple move his body to cross from this angle directly into another, yet, finding his cloak to have caught flame. With a simple motion, he waved it off, exposing his clothing of choice from underneath as he now round the path and approached the child.

Sabo's eyes had now focused in on the child as he  began to near him, figuring that soon, he would quite easily come upon him, and with his motions forward he proceeded to make a single statement. "Surrender." * - Sun Oct  4 04:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) thinks: That took less energy than I expected... - Sun Oct  4 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was still making his approach forward, yet eventually coming to a pause in this moment now as it seemed that he was caught by Suigetsu's technique. For a moment, he believed that his legs were simpyl failing him. Then he recognized the fact that the rest of his body was not within his control as his blade soon left his hand and entered the water.

With this in mind, Sabo soon recognized his defeat, being left without his tool as he recognized the ninjutsu technique, recalling it being used in the event of his capture and the reason he joined the Kenryoku. Yet, with Monohoshi Zao gone, and his own limbs to be rather incapable of being used, a feeling began to grow out over Sabo. A moment of struggle seemed to come across him as he was rather, violently shaking in an attempt to escape.

The rage of Sabo proceeding to overcome his body as he tried to force a single arm to escape the bind and access his pouches once more, and should he escape such a technique, he'd more than likely find his grip resting upon a kunai, which would soo nbe withdrawn, not even caring if he could utilize the rest of his body considering he just needed the one arm. If possible, his face would obviously stretch out into a grimace, showing exactly how he felt about the loss of his most precious tool.* - Sun Oct  4 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) simply observed as the child seemed to produce extra limbs. With the range that Sabo seemed to be in however, he could easily peer into Suitengu's eyes, taking note of the oddity that they had presented, finding this to only be apparent in two others he'd met prior to now. However, as Sabo remained within the grip, he knew now that he was in trouble, even considering his own kenjutsu prowess within a close range, he found that his actions would only produce a turnout that would work against him.

However, he still continued to struggle, attempting to break the connection between himself and Suitengu as a means of backing from his range, stating words that he knew he would eventually regret. "Take your win, it's not mine to have."* - Sun Oct  4 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: That Suitengu boy is powerful. - Sun Oct  4 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) whispers: I will keep in touch with you. - Sun Oct  4 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) whispers: If you wish to know more. You will do the same. - Sun Oct  4 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) whispers: Right...I shall. - Sun Oct  4 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) already surrendered.

And has no genjutsu counter.

This nigga asleep.* - Sun Oct  4 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) thinks: I'll find you again Sabo....even if it takes me another five years.... - Sun Oct  4 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Final shinobi....Surrender now or prepa- - Sun Oct  4 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm good. - Sun Oct  4 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) finds himself drawing out a kunai as he observes the area around himself. The mass of trees and the small building nearby had left him to believe that someone had been here before, but that didn't matter currently. Sabo simply allowed himself to place all remaining focus on this simple tool, considering he had no katana to work with currently.

Regardless of the matter, Sabo allowed his mind to begin focusing on actively spreading his chakra through the extension of the kunai. A simple puff of air escaped Sabo's maw and chakra burst outwards from his blade. His eyes know crossing over the tool and its extended length, seeing that he would need to gain a mastery over this technique should he wish to perform combat effectively.* - Sun Oct  4 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to work with the simple kunai, allowing himself to let his chakra flow directly throughout the weapon, forming an elongated blade out in the open. With the amount of chakra Sabo was applying, the length of the blade seemed to be incredibly different compared to what he was normally used to.

It was rather easy to make this shape with his weapon and chakra combine, finding his experience with the technique to begin growing in this moment. Sabo's progress easily coming up.* - Sun Oct  4 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to stand amongst the trees, actively using his kunai and chakra in a combination together. Effortlessly making slashes back and forth with the weapon, Sabo found himself cutting into the nearby building, casually making slants with the wall and so on. His intent was to simply begin carving his initials into the building, yet, he hadn't realized his destructive power as he seemed to be cutting through into the inside of the building at the same time.* - Sun Oct  4 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed his flow of chakra to end as he proceeded to pocket his kunai, figurin that now he was capable of accessing Amegakure, hoping that he could possibly purchase at the least, a basic katana for his own use.* - Sun Oct  4 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sun Oct  4 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Take good care of it. - Sun Oct  4 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed himself to enter the premises, recalling upon Suitengu's reccomendation. As he approached the region, simple movement of his head and the bones in his neck were quite easily cracking. Soon, his eyes settled upon the situation, and he found himself recognizing not one, not two, but three faces within the region. Two others being unfamiliar to him. 

Once Sabo had come to a pause, he allowed himself to stop just a distance away, making sure to keep out of range of each and every single one of the individuals, assessing their skillset just from how they locked and what they wore. Of course, that still left mystery to what they could do, but he had a general idea now.

Standing there, his hand motioned for the hilt of his katana, actually missing the point due to the loss of the weapon. A grimace crossed his face for a second, but then he allowed himself to return to a lifeless expression, listening to his surroundings as he peered down upon the ever-young Suitengu.

"I figured you'd be here..."* - Sun Oct  4 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as he gestured to Hideki and then to Suitengu, proceeding to move forward. He figured he could trust the child, considering he chose not to end his life in the Private Exams, and hadn't made an attempt to do so prior to then or even now. "I had to. Chasing down people to stab gets tiresome. I even tried taking them on dates first."* - Sun Oct  4 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Sabo...I spoke to him before...He looks like he's changed... - Sun Oct  4 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: - Omit - Sun Oct  4 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded, prepared to follow after Suitengu. A hand raised, as a wave gesture to Hideki.

"A new blade would be nice, expending chakra to create one is incredibly tiresome."* - Sun Oct  4 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: This is plenty far enough. - Sun Oct  4 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: So far, all I know is that one day there yellow, and the next they're purple. - Sun Oct  4 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Other than that, nothing. - Sun Oct  4 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Mine were black at first. - Sun Oct  4 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: When did yours show? - Sun Oct  4 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Roughly a week ago. - Sun Oct  4 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... I see, mine came in when my father had been killed. - Sun Oct  4 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I see... - Sun Oct  4 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed himself to peer into Suitengu's eye, noticing the rings around his eye. For the most part, they were similar to his own other than the extra, and at the end of it all, Sabo could only reply with a simple, "No. Do they represent stages or something?"* - Sun Oct  4 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I can only assume they do. I will tell you how I had achieved my second ring. - Sun Oct  4 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: But first. Tell me. - Sun Oct  4 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: When you look at my eyes, what do you feel? - Sun Oct  4 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I'm not sure...I just feel some sort of connection, like our eyes are tethered together or something. - Sun Oct  4 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You do not feel rage?.. Temptation? - Sun Oct  4 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: No, not necessarily. - Sun Oct  4 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I've seen him. Never interacted with him however. - Sun Oct  4 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: He too, had eyes like ours. - Sun Oct  4 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I see... - Sun Oct  4 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I suspected as much when Edge approached him... - Sun Oct  4 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) listened to Suitengu as he told his story, tensing a bit before stepping back a bit. He could fel a sense of bloodlust coming from the child, but in Sabo's eyes it seemed he was under control for now. His movement was simply a precaution. A simple nod after his story was over and he proceeded to speak. "Nothing outstanding so far, but I suppose my overall, physical performance is a bit better."* - Sun Oct  4 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: That is the same answer everyone else had provided me. However.. - Sun Oct  4 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed Suitengu's change. His eyes beginning to scan over the arms that the child had produced. He recalled these being utilized during their combat within the Private Exams. A simple face of suprise still stretched across his face, finding it to be a rather useful technique if anything. As Sabo observed, his ears listened to them, finding their sound to be rather odd.

"They're...mechanical?"* - Sun Oct  4 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I see....This is interesting indeed. - Sun Oct  4 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I cannot say exactly when I had learn this. - Sun Oct  4 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Though it wasn't too long before Konohagakure had been destroyed. - Sun Oct  4 22:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Ah... - Sun Oct  4 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So now you know. I assure you.. you have something to look forward too. - Sun Oct  4 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: The reason that I'm telling you this, however. - Sun Oct  4 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Is because I want the others of these eyes to be.. extinct to say the least. You are the only one whom I had not attacked for them. - Sun Oct  4 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: So....What sets me apart from the others? - Sun Oct  4 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Because I know who you are. That is the only reason. - Sun Oct  4 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I have a level of trust that the others won't be able to get. - Sun Oct  4 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: ....I see...Makes sense to me. - Sun Oct  4 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Does it?  - Sun Oct  4 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Or was that just sarcasm. - Sun Oct  4 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Yes. - Sun Oct  4 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Mmm. - Sun Oct  4 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You may have noticed. - Sun Oct  4 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: There is a three million bounty for each person with our eyes. - Sun Oct  4 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You can thank me for that, I have had someone searching for any others with the same eyes. - Sun Oct  4 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Oh... - Sun Oct  4 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I've yet to have anyone come to me about it. - Sun Oct  4 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I see. - Sun Oct  4 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: If you come across a man that wishes to kill you over them. - Sun Oct  4 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Just let him know my name. - Sun Oct  4 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Alright. Thanks for informing me. - Sun Oct  4 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I also want you to help me take out the others. - Sun Oct  4 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: And if you agree, I will promise you more progress to your own.. eyes. - Sun Oct  4 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Well, I've nothing better to do, so I'll have to agree. - Sun Oct  4 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Good. - Sun Oct  4 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Taiga, another with our eyes. - Sun Oct  4 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Resides in Suna. - Sun Oct  4 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: He is under careful watch by Hassan. - Sun Oct  4 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Hm... - Sun Oct  4 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I've been trying to think of ways to ferret him out, though it isn't very simple. - Sun Oct  4 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I can see about trying to get him alone. - Sun Oct  4 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Although, I can't guarantee anything. - Sun Oct  4 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Mmm.. - Sun Oct  4 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'll send a message to the weaponsmith, see about getting you a new blade soon. - Sun Oct  4 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Alright. - Sun Oct  4 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Also.... - Sun Oct  4 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: About those...arms. Is it possible you could apply them to others? - Sun Oct  4 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: In what way? - Sun Oct  4 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Like, say I were to lose an arm...could you replace it with one? - Sun Oct  4 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: If you lost an arm. - Sun Oct  4 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I could simply reattach it. - Sun Oct  4 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: It is that simple. - Sun Oct  4 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Of course. - Sun Oct  4 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You'd have to bring it to me before it goes bad and festers. - Sun Oct  4 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I see. - Sun Oct  4 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: But as for the mechanations?.. I do not think I am capable of that. - Sun Oct  4 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Nor do I know anything mechanically wise to do so. - Sun Oct  4 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Ah...Well, thank you for filling me in on these eyes. - Sun Oct  4 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Of course.. - Sun Oct  4 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Should you have any questions that I can answer. I will be available. - Sun Oct  4 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: One more thing that I must ask of you. - Sun Oct  4 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Hm? - Sun Oct  4 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I do not wish Edge to know of any of this information. - Sun Oct  4 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Oh, of course. - Sun Oct  4 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I wouldn't think of telling him. - Sun Oct  4 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Good.. good.. - Sun Oct  4 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded, now turning to make his exit from the alleyway. He figured that for now, he could just remain calm before getting back into the business of killing.* - Sun Oct  4 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'll be seeing you later then. - Sun Oct  4 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Right. - Sun Oct  4 22:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) turned his head towards Suitengu, simply stating a question. "You don't care if I use one of these houses for my training, right?"* - Sun Oct  4 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Use whatever you'd like. As long as you don't thrash the entire place. - Sun Oct  4 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: By that I mean the entire village. - Sun Oct  4 23:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) shifted his visage to Reisen, noticing her as she drew near. For a moment, he remained wary, unsure of what she could potentially be doing until  she had eventually produced a weapon before his eyes. A simple nod as he understood the what she was doing and eventually, he was peering into her eyes. "Not very traditional, but it works as a temporary tool. Thank you."

In a few seconds, his hands seemed to take the weapon himself and stepped back a bit, proceeding to make a few slashes in the air with the makeshift sword, basically testing it out to see if it was good enough for himself to use at the moment.* - Mon Oct  5 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed himself to take a general kenjutsu stance, his blade being hefted ahead of his body now as he looked forward. A state of focus came across Sabo and he envisioned himself in a field of blood. His vision grew red and the grasslands around him was the only thing left, tinted in this red hue as well. The people around Sabo seemed to disappear from this plane, and he grew an expression of bloodlust in his eyes.

A huff escaped Sabo's lips, pushing past to join the outside world and he viewed his own relief as a gas of red. In the same instance of Sabo producing this, he allowed his chakra to burst outwards violently, exposing it to the grassland around him and those that were training and possibly observing. With the introduction of this little flare, the paper blade he now held, gained an extension of chakra which easily increased his reach for attack.

Creating a single step, Sabo actively produced a hard slash, cutting across the length of his own body to perform a downward diagonal slash with his chakra. The end of the paper blade itself remaining free, but the chakra he produced slit into the ground, creating a scar upon the soil left there. Next, Sabo allowed himself to pull back, standing once again in this basic Kenjutsu stance as he let himself continued to access the same technique. Sabo hadn't really practiced his chakra control, but he was however beginning to grow in the usage of this technique.

Continuing to hold his chakra against the blade however, soon, another step was made and Sabo made a diagonal slash to the left, stepping once more to switch up his arc and create a feint to the right before striking outwards to hit a seemingly invisible opponent before himself. A motion backwards and Sabo was beginning to prepare himself to make another jab at making his sword combat even better, even though he was considerably, the best Kenjutsu Practicioner in all of the land. * - Mon Oct  5 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I look at it like this. If i'm the strongest around, you can know -exactly- how to fight me. But it won't mean anything. If I have the strongest sword in the land, you knowing that I have the strongest sword doesnt' make it any weaker. - Mon Oct  5 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: But they could also adopt a way to counter that sword. Knowing you have the greatest sword amongst the land will make others assume you're a swordsman.. and take a long range approach. - Mon Oct  5 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I think it's better for people to not know you and what you can do, rather than have them fear your abilities. - Mon Oct  5 04:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to open the scroll that Suitengu had shared with him. Cascading it open for the world's eyes to view alongside Sabo's, he began to let his vision pass over the contents, whether it be words or images. He was now proceeding to take in the knowledge maintained within the scroll, focusing entirely upon it for the moment.* - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Good. - Mon Oct  5 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to read throughout the scroll, finding his experience in reading scrolls to be rather advanced. However, reading wasn't particularly hard regardless of how advanced a mind Sabo held. He continued to let his mind gather up what information was within the scroll.* - Mon Oct  5 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Hmm? - Tue Oct  6 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Hm... - Tue Oct  6 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to raise his hands as he stood there amongst the group. Recalling upon several of the ninjutsu he'd learned, he allowed himself to focus on the one that seemed most simple to himself, activelly bringing his hands together to form a single handseal, considering that's all the technique had required. This handseal of course, was the bird handseal. As a result, Sabo's chakra proceeded to launch outwards, forcing a barrier of fuuton chakra to expell itself from Sabo's person. However, this was a very thin veil, obviously not effective enough to work against much more than a few kunai or shuriken.* - Tue Oct  6 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to apply his hands to the exact same technique, finding his hands to complete the bird handseal once again with great ease. Afterwards, he allowed his inner chakra to focus throughout his body. As he let himself remain still, his chakra began to thin out, spreading evenly as though it was forming within. Soon, his nose crinkled and he allowed his chakra to propell outwards and access the technique to form his shield of wind.

Once the short range barricade of wind seemed to drop before himself, he found his hands remaining in the formation of the bird handseal. As he stood there, his chakra once again proceeded to be worked up  within his body, filling out his shape and form before eventually expelling itself into the open. As this happened, Sabo's cloak seemed to billow outwards and cascade over and even wider area while his hair seemed to dance amongst the wind in the same instance. 

As Sabo remained standing still, he felt the intensity of the winds picking up around him, even if they had no killing potential, at least not yet. However, while Sabo began to remain there, he observed the area in front of himself as he accessed the technique once again, keeping a hold on the bird handseal as he observed the region in front of himself. His inexperience with the jutsu slowly fading as he continued to release a barrier around his still form.

A simple look of disgust seemed to flare up on Sabo's face now as he accessed the technique once again. The wind proceeding to cascade over his face while he looked onwards. It seemed that he was beginning to connect memories with his training now, for reasons unknown.* - Tue Oct  6 01:47:56 2015

It was simply a sign to represent that this was his home, regardless of whom remained within the confinements of the village. Sabo still continued onwards, his hand resting on the empty sheath he now carried while he looked onwards.

As Sabo came to the square, he looked onwards to those standing amongst the sand, simply letting his eyes rest upon familiar faces and so forth before coming to speak. "I search for Fujitora, who can disclose his whereabouts?"* - Tue Oct  6 04:01:04 2015
