<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: --- - Tue Oct  6 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) appeared confused for a moment, but then recalled she couldn't really fix the problem if she couldn't see it. Therefore, Sabo proceeded to let his hands move towards his own pants, pulling them down rather easily to reveal his blade of skin, which came at an erect twelve.

A blush crossed Sabo's face as he looked to the ceiling.* - Tue Oct  6 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) thinks: It's huge. - Tue Oct  6 21:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded now, showing a face of relief. "Good. So when will it go away?"* - Tue Oct  6 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: Uh. . there's several ways. - Tue Oct  6 21:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: .....I assume...you want me to treat you like a queen? - Tue Oct  6 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) seemed to remain silent for a moment, a sudden wave of heat cascading over his body as he looked down upon Genesis. For the moment, he had no idea what to do, but the feeling that he was getting couldn't be resisted. A simple thought on the idea and he seemed to swallow his pride, as he responded.

"If that's what you wish...Then I suppose I must grant you it, my queen..." For now, he remained still, assuming his queen would take charge in this moment.* - Tue Oct  6 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) gave into the lustful situation, finding his body and mind alike to begin experiencing a newfound bliss that took place off the battlefield. A scenario where blood wasn't needed was even better, at least now. The way he interacted with Genesis only causing him to want to rush into the act even more, purposely doing his best to pleasure the woman, giving off sounds of pleasure and glee as they went with the ritual.

[Blackscreen]* - Tue Oct  6 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) panted like a wild dog as he remained connected to Genesis. His mind was still trying to wrap around the idea of what'd just happened, but he figured there was no point once he'd heard the woman's words. Letting his own lavendar eyes peer into hers, he let his voice escape the grasp of his lips, "It's the best feeling...I've ever had."* - Tue Oct  6 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: Exactly. . . This feeling is like no other. . nothing can rival this. - Tue Oct  6 22:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: I want to be an important queen like no other in history. . . No one that can resist me, and my words. . my word able to sway any, and bring them to their knees. . The knowledge to repair which that has been broken. .  I desire so many things, but I'm so weak all alone. . - Tue Oct  6 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: Little ol' me can't do anything all by myself. . . - Tue Oct  6 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Well...I'll do whatever it takes to fulfill your desires, since you've fulfilled mine. - Tue Oct  6 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) smirked as he seemed to embrace the woman even more, showing compassion for her, even after having just met only a while ago. "Indeed, you have."* - Tue Oct  6 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: We should. Afterall, that was quite a work out... - Tue Oct  6 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: Yup. .  lets shower together? - Tue Oct  6 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I like the sound of that. Let's. - Tue Oct  6 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) stood there underneath the falling waters along with Genesis. Her gentle touch still arousing him to no ends. As he listened to her words, an eyebrow rose as he proceeded to apply his hands to her hips. For a moment, he wasn't sure he had the libido for more intercourse, but he believed he'd muster up the energy along the way.

"Well, now's your chance." And with that stated, he proceeded to plant a kiss upon her lips, attempting to initiate another session.* - Tue Oct  6 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) indulged in intercourse once again, putting in that work to pleasure Genesis as he found his stamina returning to him just so he could finish the job.

[Blackscreen]* - Tue Oct  6 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as he utilized a towel of his own to dry himself. A simple nod as he listened to Genesis' words, eventually letting his eyes rest upon her body. He too, applied his own clothing after doing such.

"Of course, I wouldn't want anyone trying to ruin what we have."* - Tue Oct  6 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Of course. - Tue Oct  6 22:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to enter the mall of Kumogakure as some would call it. For a moment, Sabo was quite calm, a smile that implied he was rather, happy for once. Not producing one of sin as he looked around the area. Yet, when he heard the cries of Misa and the yells of Amon, Sabo was simply set off.

A forward motion and he allowed himself to look amongst the mist that had set within the room. However, he played it safe and allowed his hands to produce a single shuriken, launching it at a diagonal motion to connect with any tables that would be ahead of himself, using his hearing specifically to find the positioning of the room.

After setting up such, Sabo found his legs carrying him from his start position onwards to where he'd last heard Misa, producing a single Kunai as he could hear the voice of a figure behind her as well. Closing in, he allowed his senses to take place as another shuriken was produced, passing from his hand to find place in the second table. As he moved, Sabo was actively planning his action.* - Tue Oct  6 23:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) found his placement now, his ears listening to the sound his shuriken would produce with each impact against the wood within the region. A leap into a sideways landing pose and Sabo was now laying amongst the bench, revealing a simple kunai as he set his plan into action. A simple kenjutsu art being applied to his kunai as the weapon's reach began to extend.

Chakra shot forth, and Sabo found his weapon easily taking the length of the average katana, considering this was all he needed. The sound produced from Amon's yell having only lead him to believe that he'd still be within the same post. Should the bald headed shinobi lack the required skills and reflexes to move, he'd more than likely, be skewered by the Sabo's own chakra and kunai extension.* - Tue Oct  6 23:16:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed his arm to retract now that he'd dealt the blow,letting the kunai leave his grip as he figured that Misa had been released by now and free to movement, however, something had changed within the scenario, causing Sabo to place all focus entirely upon this matter. Prior to the would-be assassination attempt, he couldn't see the figure's approach, nor could he hear them, but a simply smirk drew across his face as he allowed his body to roll, moving himself underneath the table.

In this instance, Sabo wasn't working entirely based off sound, but also the movements of the table, considering the bench he was on prior was connected to the table, as well as the bench on the opposing side. A shift in weight practically being Sabo's savior, and with his drop to the ground, he'd allow himself to kick out both legs, and make a connection with the table above himself, planning to send it in an upward fashion to open an escape route for himself. While he kicked outwards however, he began to apply handseals, preparing them in case.* - Wed Oct  7 01:30:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) felt a shift in the weight that was once upon the table now, finding that the women seemed to leap away from the table. His eyes finding her placement with his own peripheral and eventually his full eyesight, however, the positioning was very vague as he could only barely make out a position. Regardless, his opening was now and he completed his handseals, letting his jutsu take place before himself. In mere moments, Sabo was expelling wind pressure from his maw, letting it guide itself outwards to meet with the opposing figure.

The intent here wasn't really to do damge, but rather, to distance himself from the woman and leave an opening for him to make an exit from within the building. However, he could only watch for the outcome between Kirie and his jutsu, hoping that his efforts were enough to throw her off or pause her advancement of the jutsu enough for a movement.

 Should he be captured regardless of his technique however, he'd simply remain there, still underneath the water as something began to fume within Sabo.* - Wed Oct  7 02:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) raised himself from his position now, finding that he'd hindered the usage of the suiton ninjutsu. As Sabo stood there, he looked onwards, facing Kirie with a face of annoyance. He hadn't cared for whether or not the man was drunk, but he put someone close to him in danger, and Sabo simply allowed himself to express that.

"Next time, don't let him try and rape women and I won't have to."

Regardless of a response however, he proceeded to make his way towards one of the doorways, pretty much letting himself search for someone else that was of importance to himself.* - Wed Oct  7 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to step back, as warned. He then proceeded to observe Misa as she accessed her summoning technique. As Sabo observed, he could only ponder on how her own summoning progressed to such a level. Regardless however, he proceeded to make his way upon the large behemoth of a bird.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) arrived within Sunagakure alongside Misa and her rather large demon of a bird. As he remained upon the bird, he couldn't really see naturally, but his lavender eyes, holding only a single ring allowed him to find a focus within the region. Retaining his hold upon the bird, his eyes seemed to spark, finding a mass of chakra to be speeding towards his position.

Within mere moments, he allowed himself to access his voice, shouting outwards to the large bird. "Hasashi, raise!" The intent to warn the rather large bird and give it a moment to shift its positioning within the air and escape the range of the ninjutsu. Should the creature heed his words they should potentially be capable of dodging.

Sabo only continued to remain still, keeping a hold as he utilized his eyes to maintain a view on the chakra coming towards them, finding the attack to be a major insult within his mind.* - Thu Oct  8 02:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) simply nodded now, glad that the bird heeded his words. And the fact that Misa had given him control over the situation, he simply allowed his visage to lock upon Hassan, recalling the Sergeant from their meeting in Kirigakure, even if it were only for a mere few seconds.

Regardless of the situation, he simply spoke a few words, "We're leaving." A simple hand gesture and the bird would likely be flying out of the region of Sunagakure. Sabo knew better than to act against a demon, especially when there were two located in the same area.* - Thu Oct  8 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) maintained a hold upon Hasashi as they approached the center of Kumogakure, looking upon the rather large gathering. Within a moment, Hasashi had connected to the ground, leaving in almost an instant afterwards.

While Misa and Sabo were left behind however, he fell silent for a bit. Allowing himself to remain standing amongst the crowd now, he simply retained his position, allowing his Rinnegan to observe those for him, instead of using his eyes to meet them.* - Thu Oct  8 02:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed himself to produce a single kunai from within his cloak as he stood there, actively focusing his chakra to flow through his arms, into his hands, and out through his kunai. Soon, a sabre produced itself, shooting directly from his weapon as it connected to the ground. The sound of his chakra blade now humming within the air before being silenced. Within moments, Sabo was easily releasing a connection to his chakra pathway as it seemed to shut down for a minute. With ease, it soon restarted again, leaving Sabo with an active pathway running in the opposition.* - Thu Oct  8 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to access the same two techniques, allowing his chakra to spark in a cycle, actively moving back and forth between blade and body. Soon another sparking chakra blade extended to touch the ground, containing practically no shape whatsoever, although, Sabo did make an attempt to shift its origin points to act as an actual blade, leaving him with a very crude variation of a katana, barely even resembling the thin blade. Yet, his chakra cut once more and it dispersed, soon leaving Sabo to look at nothing. * - Thu Oct  8 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to observe his practices as he allowed himself to shoot forth another section of chakra through the weapon, this time trying to transform its shape within a quick instant. Yet, when the chakra formed, it was more like a blunt shape over a katana as he hoped for. Sabo remained still, finding the use of his chakra to leave him once again as he planned to begin from the start.* - Thu Oct  8 10:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to access the same formation of his chakra, utilizing the kunai as the main extension as he produces the chakra in the general formation of a thin blade. Jutting outwards with a thick base, it soon ends at a rather thin point. Sabo simply attempted to will his chakra to the point that it would focus into a katana as he had wished for. Failing to make the weapon, even a crude form, he found himself once again placing all focus entirely on cutting it off to restart.* - Thu Oct  8 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) maintained the same position and form of practice, letting his chakra take charge once again as it produced itself in front of him. Sabo simply released a single breath, focusing on trying to apply a shape to his chakra. The sad mistake however was that his attempts were futile, causing the chakra's positioning to flow rather wildly. As Sabo remained still however, he found his own chakra reducing itself to nothin, planning to begin once again.* - Thu Oct  8 11:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still applying his chakra to his training, he attempted to stress out the form it took once again. Once the chakra began to ease forth, he envisioned it along the way, carving it down to take place of a katana as he looked on, his own eyes passing the edges of the blade while he contained the same positioning and form of his body, standing proportionate to the edge. However, his guidance was rendered null as the blade came out with crude edges, appearing to be impractical for a sword. With that he simply dispelled the technique, grunting as he did so.* - Thu Oct  8 11:09:26 2015
