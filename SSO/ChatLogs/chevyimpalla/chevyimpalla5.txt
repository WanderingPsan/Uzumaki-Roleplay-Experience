<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you ready? - Sun Sep 27 11:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Erebus, if I may ask. Is Suitengu still inside? - Sun Sep 27 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: He is. - Sun Sep 27 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Could I speak to him? - Sun Sep 27 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: As you please. - Sun Sep 27 11:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you ready..? - Sun Sep 27 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Yes. - Sun Sep 27 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. - Sun Sep 27 12:02:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So how'd it go . . . Taiga? - Sun Sep 27 12:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Edge. .  I wonder what kind of person that man is. - Sun Sep 27 12:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Kilm, want to go a restaurant now? - Sun Sep 27 12:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Sure. - Sun Sep 27 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) bought a caravan to Kirigakure.* - Sun Sep 27 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) decides to begin his day by initiating a short training session. Sabo proceeded to let himself motion off to find himself a villager in need. And of course, he found one. It seemed to be a farmer loading up a cart for the purpose of trade. With a thought in mind, Sabo motioned himself over to them, simply offering a helping hand. Soon, he found himself lifting up heavy crates and placing them amongst the cart. Moving at least two at a time, although he did see how many crates there were and how many carts, expecting this to take quite a while.* - Sun Sep 27 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to assist the various farmers, letting himself work hard to pick up more crates. As Sabo continued to help, he found himself doing more and more with ease. Right about now, the first crate was roughly halfway full and Sabo had no troubles helping with the rest, finding that he was going to need to switch over to the other cart soon.* - Sun Sep 27 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still assisted in the lifting of the crates. With each crate, Sabo made sure to pass a short check over them, letting his eyes observe the locks and what not, making sure they weren't broken and that they'd remain closed. After doing so, he'd go on to place crates in duos on the cart, drawing forth little perspiration upon his forehead as he did so. His stamina barely beginning to deter however.* - Sun Sep 27 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) stayed focused on his training, recalling upon Kenshin's words. He was now practically obtaining the favorable fitness workout from just helping out around the village. Even then he proceeded to find himself getting a workout in his muscles, the tendons and such actively pulling and tearing which would later get some rest for growth.* - Sun Sep 27 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was now onto the final grouping of crates as he proceeded to lift each one individually and place them on the last cart. He had noticed that there was only a single farmer as well, figuring that he was going to need assistance with the crates to move them out with ease. Keeping that in mind, once Sabo had finished moving the crates he allowed himself to take place behind the first cart and heft up its handles, preparing to follow the lead farmer.* - Sun Sep 27 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) pulling along the cart, Sabo continued to watch the farmers movements, keeping on the same path. Yet, it was while he moved forward that he found it to be problematic. His arms struggling to keep a tight and comfortable grip on the wood, and even then, with all the weight he had trouble moving it forward. And thus, Sabo realized that even villagers had better assets than Shinobi. It was possible that he'd see them in a better light now.* - Sun Sep 27 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded onwards, tugging the cart behind him as he attempted to find some solace in his practice. The cart moving behind him of course, but with some difficulty. As Sabo moved through the streets, he did find some resistance in the cart behind him. It was practically a heavy boulder that he was dragging with a single string, and definetly beginning to wear down on him.* - Sun Sep 27 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) stayed on the same path as the villager. His arms working hard to keep the crate up behind himself as he moved onwards. Nothing had bothered him in this moment, other than the struggle he was having. A rage was beginning to build within him but regardless he found himself tugging along, the finishing point in sight.* - Sun Sep 27 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to lug around with the cart, pulling it onwards to the final point. He was obviously close to finishing the deed now, considering where the end mark was. Regardless, Sabo continued to push forward, pulling the card to the end of the road. Eventually his legs beginning to feel some strain as well from the long haul there.* - Sun Sep 27 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) came to the end of the road now, leaving the cart down behind the first. Soon afterwards, he took a sigh and allowed himself to begin his stretches. Soon after he was letting his stride of anger get the best of him, picking up on his actions as he allowed himself to draw his katana. The application of his chakra allowed him to access the Chakra Flow technique, wind encasing the blade and cascading over the edge for increased cutting power.

In the next instant, he found himself making a simple step forward and a downward slash through the mass of crates, effectively cutting the group into several parts as he watched the various vegetables roll out and onto the ground before him.* - Sun Sep 27 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kosami, Fleece(Fleece Johnson the Third) says: Excuse me sir, but do you know where I can get new clothes? - Sun Sep 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: .... - Sun Sep 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Clothes? - Sun Sep 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Go fuck yourself. - Sun Sep 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Get outta here. - Sun Sep 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kosami, Fleece(Fleece Johnson the Third) says: What did I do to offend you sir? - Sun Sep 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Go. - Sun Sep 27 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Fuck. - Sun Sep 27 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Yourself. - Sun Sep 27 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kosami, Fleece(Fleece Johnson the Third) says: No thank you. - Sun Sep 27 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) brandished his blade as he turned towards the child, his eyes glazing over his presence. There was no need to be rash and make an attempt on his life, at least not yet, but he did continue to keep his chakra flowing through the weapon. A single step forward was taken and Sabo proceeded to speak once more.

"Get the fuck outta here before I take your life."* - Sun Sep 27 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kosami, Fleece(Fleece Johnson the Third) says: You go fuck yourself bitch - Sun Sep 27 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) took another breath of air as he watched the random kid run off. Sabo was obviously in a state of anger know, turning once again. He was now facing the boxes again, his blade moving forward as he began to work his arms into the motions of cutting. Sabo was practically on a rampage as he began. Soon he found himself slicing back into the boxes, destroying more vegetables as he went as his muscles tensed and flexed.* - Sun Sep 27 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to find an even more secluded region from the rest of the village, recalling upon this spot from his previous stay in Konohagakure. As he arrived, he didn't draw his own katana, but he did draw a kunai. In the same instance, he found himself applying his own fuuton based chakra to the tool before tossing it into one of the nearby trees.* - Mon Sep 28 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to act upon his ninjutsu, moving to retrieve the kunai that he had thrown. Once he removed it from within, he pulled back and allowed himself to spark off into a short combat scenario, slashing at the air and making several kick tactics as he followed up on the CQC tactics. He was practically prevailing without problem in this situation. * - Mon Sep 28 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to let himself motion around within his position, letting his eyes track over the area around himself. Sabo was easily allowing himself to pick up on his close ranged movements, making quicker slashes with the kunai and using in and out tactics. His body seeming to move in and back out just to make a simple strike, yet leave him open for defense. This of course was working the muscles in his legs and arms, his stamina still hanging on.* - Mon Sep 28 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) stayed on the same course of training, letting himself access the same actions. As Sabo began to make his strikes, his mind switched to the thought of Kenshin, only recalling that he wasn't the only one capable of crafting new fighting styles. Using this as an ambition, Sabo proceeded to make his motions around the area, slashing throughout the air without problem.* - Mon Sep 28 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still continued to access the chakra flow technique as he stepped forward, letting himself draw the kunai upwards once again before proceeding to enter a front. His initial slash being horizontal, which he eventually worked into a vertical plane and then a diagonal. He was definetly allowing his body to apply some work on itself, not even failing in the stamina department.* - Mon Sep 28 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to follow through with his deliver, still accessing his fuuton chakra as he plays his actions out. His body easily making the same movements of performing a series of assorted kicks and slashes. He was practically accessing the innate taijutsu abilities he had developed with his kenjutsu, yet still applying a kunai to his efforts.* - Mon Sep 28 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to cease using the chakra flow technique, but rather, he accessed the bird handseal now as he focused his chakra throughout his form. Sabo beginning to run throughout the forested area, his legs carying him around the field without a problem whatsoever. Soon, he found himself accessing a state of being encased within wind, all while making his run. * - Mon Sep 28 07:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Is it made of a rare metal? - Mon Sep 28 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: It's the first blade I ever got. - Mon Sep 28 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Been with me since the start. - Mon Sep 28 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess I see why it's special to you. - Mon Sep 28 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So you're pretty good at swords then? - Mon Sep 28 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Indeed. - Mon Sep 28 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So...Are you a Shinobi here? - Mon Sep 28 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Yes. - Mon Sep 28 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Genin? - Mon Sep 28 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I guess. - Mon Sep 28 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You look a little old to be a Genin. - Mon Sep 28 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 28 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I wasn't appart of a village before. - Mon Sep 28 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh...Huh. - Mon Sep 28 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Guess that's why I don't recognise you. - Mon Sep 28 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Probably. - Mon Sep 28 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: So where were you before? - Mon Sep 28 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I was a traveler for a bit. - Mon Sep 28 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Somewhat of a mercenary beforehand as well. - Mon Sep 28 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Mercenary? - Mon Sep 28 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You must be strong then. - Mon Sep 28 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I suppose. - Mon Sep 28 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I didn't work alone, but I did alright for myself. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Yes. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: What made you stop being a mercenary? - Mon Sep 28 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: There's not much work now that the war is over and I liked the company here. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Interesting. - Mon Sep 28 23:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You know anyone that's good with Ninjutsu? - Mon Sep 28 23:50:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: He's usually somewhere around the gates or the mansion from what I've seen. - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: What does he look like? - Mon Sep 28 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) casually looks Takeda over.* - Mon Sep 28 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: He actually looks pretty similar to you. - Mon Sep 28 23:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeds to access his summoning technique, performing the handseals before finally splitting his thumb to draw blood. After doing so, Sabo proceeded to place it against the ground, allowing himself to bring forth his summon at the same time. Soon after, raising with the single toad placed on his head.* - Tue Sep 29 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Haul ass? For what? - Tue Sep 29 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: This is the first village I've seen without idiots runnin' back and forth. - Tue Sep 29 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph, understood. - Tue Sep 29 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You need a mission or something? - Tue Sep 29 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I was actually gonna ask if you've got a blacksmith around here. - Tue Sep 29 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Depends if you're asking for a blackmarket type or official Gezo type. - Tue Sep 29 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Eh...I 'dunno much about either...which one of'em could hook me up with something 'special.' - Tue Sep 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Give me time, I'll see what I can do. - Tue Sep 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: In the mean time.. - Tue Sep 29 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as he accepted the mission. Opening it to scan over its details, he gave a simple response. "Will do." Afterwards, proceeding to exit the room to carry out the mission.* - Tue Sep 29 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Hello. - Tue Sep 29 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Hello. - Tue Sep 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: May I ask you for thy name? - Tue Sep 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Sabo. - Tue Sep 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: My name is Rosa. - Tue Sep 29 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: I am pleased to make your acquaintance. - Tue Sep 29 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: ..Right. Same to you. - Tue Sep 29 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed his eyes to look over Rosa, finding it kind of odd how she bowed to him. It was unlike anyone he'd seen before, yet he tried to cope with it for the moment. Rather than giving a response, he simply remained still next to the gate of Konohagakure, his eyes passing over the broad land ahead of himself. Effectively beginning his guard duty purpose as of now.* - Tue Sep 29 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) had observed the gesture from the corner of his eye, only barely capable of seeing such. Yet, rather than respond to it, he only wondered why she remained there. It was slightly discomforting, but he figured she wouldn't impede upon his focus for the moment. With a shrug of the shoulders, Sabo continued to watch the road ahead of himself, expecting them to remain clear due to the sheer power that Konohagakure's presence could emit.* - Tue Sep 29 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to stand within place, letting himself continue to focus upon the road ahead. All the while, he remained cautious, just in case some unknown force seemed to come around. Regardless, he presented a single hand to his sheeth, allowing himself to grip it with that one hand, letting the other move over to the hilt just as a precaution. He was now prepared for any nearing threats of course.* - Tue Sep 29 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remained vigilant, standing with his eyes appraised forward. Only for a moment did Sabo's hands leave his katana, as one drew forth a single kunai. In the next moment, he allowed himself to knick his own thumb, beginning to perform a series of five handseals before applying a palm to the gate next to him. The result ending with a single toad bounding from the point of connection and scouring off into the forest ahead. Sabo keeping his eyes trained upon the frog for a moment as it ran off.

Afterwards, his vision returned to the road, and his hands to the blade. He surely wasn't going to be caught off-guard now.* - Tue Sep 29 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was perfectly fine, remaining where he stood until the flicking action had taken place. Since it was so subtle and small, he understood why he couldn't have motioned from within its range, but his response only ended with him swiveling to face Rosa, and his blade drawing before himself. Considering his skill with the blade, his drawing speed was of no problem, yet, he didn't grow to the point of enacting upon his lust for blood in this moment, no.

Sabo remained with his weapon drawn, only aiming to brandish it within the distance between him and rose as he now stepped forward, eyes locked upon the girl. His ears listening for others however.Now that his blade was exposed, he thought to himself. 'Monohoshi Zao...Clean'

However, his spoken words traveled from his voice box, presenting a killer's phrase. "Again, and I'll have your finger."* - Tue Sep 29 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed the female's expression, recognizing this face across many he'd met before. As he remained, he continued to hold his blade, making it a focus of himself to lock eyes upon her. The situation seeming like a repeat of many events before within Sabo's life. As he scanned her face, he never let his guard drop, only  responding with his own words.

"Because I choose to be."* - Tue Sep 29 02:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rosa(RainbowForce) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 02:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to observe the girl as he stood there. He figured that the girl wasn't so bad now, probably just testing him with the flick. Whether he passed or failed, he was unsure, but as he looked onwards, a blush crossed his face as he watched. However, with the introduction of the her weapon, it cleared. His observations leading him to a conclusion.

"I see. Impressive."* - Tue Sep 29 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) turned now, making his way towards the exit as he brought a single thumb upwards to his mouth. Upon connection, his thumb would be opened and a small bit of blood would trickle downwards before Sabo proceeded to perform a few handseals. Once he neared the door, his palm came in connection with the wall outside of the door's immediate range and proceeded forth. A small cloud of smoke appearing where his palm once, yet producing a single toad from within. This toad, leapt for Sabo's head, planting itself there for the moment as he proceeded to exit.* - Fri Oct  2 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) actively tossed his head in a forward motion a bit as he exitted the building, his toad making its way forth throughout the air. Upon landing, Sabo's eyes rested upon the small creature and eventually, he found himself tracking the movements of the toad. It was now actively searching the area for traps. Sabo simply made his way towards the exit of the village's gate now, wondering what potential threat could strike him. Should there be none, Sabo would make way to Konohagakure once again.* - Fri Oct  2 21:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) approached the area to the immediate left of the mansion within Konohagakure. His eyes proceeded to look around the area, eventually coming across Erebus. Sabo simply shifted his head's position due to the toad resting there a bit as he made his approach. When he was within communication range, he simply opened his mouth, presenting the words he had in mind.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) shot a simple smirk to Misa for a moment before shifting his vision back to Kohaku. Only a moment was needed as he began to move his hand past his own katana, drawing it forth within a short instant. The speed at which he drew was impressive, the sound of his blade simply cutting throughout the air as his smirk seemed to imply rage at the same time. Bloody Rage was progressing over himself as he thought to himself.

'Monohoshi Zao, Dry.'

Soon, his blade was coming into opening arc with great intensity. Without wasting a single moment, Sabo's chakra shifted itself from his person into the blade, enhancing the cutting power he delivered forth with wind. Not even wasting his chance to attempt to cleave through the waste and into the leg region, angling his strike so that, even if Kohaku attempted to move, the blade would probably cut into the leg as well. From the beginning, Sabo was utilizing his strategic mind to take in the area they were within, noting that Sabo himself blocked one pathway while the other was blocked by several figures.* - Fri Oct  2 22:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed as Kohaku utilized the shunshin technique. He suspected such a technique to be employed, shifting his visage around the area to observe those that seemed to look upon the region. Proceeding forward, Sabo kept his eyes on the prize, Kohaku's life. 

His state was a moment of anger, hidden with pleasure, and his legs continued to carry him forward. He'd now disabled his opponent in two ways. Forcing them into the Shunshin technique, leaving them in a moment of stun from the rush, and cutting into their leg, easily preventing the ability to run. 

As Sabo continued to make his way onwards to her, he took into account the positioning of Erebus, and the players that would soon be behind him. A raise of the blade as he now reached her position, and his blade soon came down in yet another cleaving arc, his chakra applying itself once again to the blade to increase his cleaving power, a layer of wind coating the weapon now as he proceeded to introduce his partner to the woman before him.* - Fri Oct  2 23:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) paused his approach. Even with his enrage state, he wasn't stupid and recognized the voice of Erebus. As the woman pulled, his blade paused at the location where his blade would have cleaved into her neck. His eyes averting themself to fixate upon Erebus. Somehow, his expressioend changed from pleasure and anger to one of respect and calm.

In Sabo's mind, only a killer could quell a killer. With that in mind, he simply backed off, sheathing his weapon as he nodded. "Of course...I apologize." With that, he made his way out of the area, simply speaking up to Misa. "I'll be waiting for you. There's much I'd like to speak about."* - Fri Oct  2 23:33:32 2015
