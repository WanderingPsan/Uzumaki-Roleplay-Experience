<br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still continues to make handseal to complete the technique, easily allowing himself to focus on his chakra now and propell it forth as wind through his own maw. Upon completing them, a massive force of wind proceeded to mvoe forward and strike the a single tree.* - Sun Sep 20 01:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) hefted his hands up, accessing a series of short handseals before finding his hand placed upon the ground. A summoning circle placed itself beneath such and a toad in front of it. Immediately after, the toad was clambering to the top of Sabo's head. Once it was acquainted, he would proceed to lift up and begin producing several other handseals before releasing a burst of wind, allowing it to connect with a tree in front of himself.* - Sun Sep 20 08:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to form the handseals for the fuuton technique, allowing himself to focus his chakra into a center focal point. With ease, he found himself proceeding to complete the technique by releasing a large gust of wind directly at the tree ahead of himself. He paused for a moment afterwards, checking the condition of his toad as it gave a simple croak as a reply.* - Sun Sep 20 08:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) picked up on his training once again, his hands coming to handseals as he feels the weight of the toad shifting upon his head with every croak it seemed to make. Regardless he found himself focusing a torrent of chakra into his gut, letting it thin out before pushing outwards and expelling itself in the form of Fuuton to connect with the tree ahead of himself.* - Sun Sep 20 09:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was still in the process of training, following up each shot of wind with another set of handseals for the same technique. He continued to allow himself to shift his chakra into the needed element as he launched it forward and let it crash into a tree nearby. Afterwards letting his hand raise to adjust the position of the toad on his head as he deliver a simple beetle to it and let it consume such.* - Sun Sep 20 10:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was still focused on the practice of his jutsu, allowing himself to form the handseals once again in another attempt to make use of the jutsu. Within the next few seconds an abundance of wind was store within his stomach, which was soon fired off without problem into the distance, connecting with a nearby tree. With that, he proceeded to lift his hands and move his toad to the ground next to him.* - Sun Sep 20 10:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still continued the route of elemental ninjutsu for the moment, his toad remaining at his side as they both locked eyes forward. Sabo's hands entered the same handseal series that he'd done prior. With such effort, he easily finished the technique and allowed himself to send a blast of wind chakra forward, connecting with the tree ahead of himself.* - Sun Sep 20 12:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to assault the tree with back to back wind jutus. With each attempt came another bundle of chakra flowing out from within himself as he allowed it to connect with the tree ahead of himself. Afterwards his eyes shifted to his toad, which seemed to be grinding around in the dirt in search of food.* - Sun Sep 20 15:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) went back on the verge of training his fuuton technique, allowing himself to focus his chakra into the element without problem as he proceeded to unleash the burst of wind forward, connecting it with a tree. Immediately afterwards he found himself looking at his toad which seemed to find a bundle of bugs for himself to consume.* - Sun Sep 20 17:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remained on the same train of thought, yet, choosing a different and more simple technique as he allows himself to make use of the Bouseki Tate no Kaze technique, focusing his charka through his form, and propelling another force from the epicenter to form a shield of wind. His toad seemingly being knocked over by this but quickly recovering and returning to its own productivity.* - Sun Sep 20 18:09:55 2015

His eyes focused in on the coming Amai, taking note of her drawing upon her scroll. With fluid motions, he rolled, proceeding to move his position and enter a stand. It was quite simple how this worked, considering the distance between the two. As a matter of fact, the difference in height applied greatly to this situation as well. 

Drawing his katana, Sabo let his blade move forward to cut through the ink that had formed the two so-called 'Gods' in order to annihalate them oth in a single movement. After doing such, he'd sheath the blade without problem and remain wary of the girl. "Good. Now I'm free to do as I wish..."* - Sun Sep 20 23:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Have you seen Kenshin? - Tue Sep 22 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: No. - Tue Sep 22 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: No. I have not. - Tue Sep 22 20:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Thank you. - Tue Sep 22 20:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) pondered on the thought of Kenshin's words, figuring that now was a good time to spark up his training efforts. With that thought in mind, he simply allows himself to shift his katana's sheath to his back before beginning to set off in a jog around the farms of Kirigakure, his body allowing himself to move around the fields without any sign of exhaustion due to his high stamina at the moment.* - Tue Sep 22 21:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed himself to continue carrying his body around the fields, his legs moving in a pattern of right and left. That exact order remaining in his mind as he moved forth, speeding around with ease. He of course wasn't applying all of his speed as a means to retain his stamina, but he was easily making rounds of the farmyard, passing points with his eyes trailing along the various animals that he seemed to pass.* - Tue Sep 22 22:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still retained the same speed. Short and quick breathes seemed to pass from his epicenter into the outside world as he began to feel slight effects of his jogging. He had planned on retaining the same speeds as Kenshin of course, but the thought of it just seemed to jog his mind as his legs continued to move forward. He had already planned out this excersize, placing at least ten laps of the farm in mind, and right about now he was looking at seven more to go.* - Tue Sep 22 22:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to remain on the same path, running at a steady pace as his eyes shifted between the path ahead of himself, the ground in front of himself, and the animals in the vicinity. His mind staying on the thought of training. As he surveyed the land around him, the muscles in his legs were easily working, tendons being pulled and flexed as he moved on the same track, almost like a train.* - Tue Sep 22 22:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still ran laps without problem, moving himself around the farmyard with ease. Each turn was proving to be quite easy for himself as his eyes shifted from point to point with each passing. He was on the fifth lap, passing through the rather large region, even if it was dominated by the much larger area denoted as Kirigakure. Once he started his approach to the second mark of his sixth lap, his eyes shifted up for a bit, looking at the expansive distance from his location to the farthest wall, finding it to be a great distance.* - Tue Sep 22 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still continued on his laps, passing each boundary now, his eyes now focused back onto the path that he was shaping within his mind. He was practically strategizing on the go, his face remaining stern as he passed. It was obvious that he would have some onlookers, considering it wasn't a normality to find a single man making way at a running pace around a farmyard lest they be doing work. In this event, he passed eyes over Izanami, recognizing her from the central plaza, yet it caused no moment of pause within him. It simply brought forth the thought of why she appeared familiar.* - Tue Sep 22 22:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remained in motion. following the laws of physics as he cut corners, easily pushing himself onwards now. A seventh lap had begun and he found himself trailing through the points, a single arm extending itself forward as he allowed himself to close in with the nearby fence. Upon reaching it, finger tips knocked against wood, each being pushed back with each plank of wood connecting with them. He felt the pain begin to build up, not even caring now as he drove forth, holding the same furious expression as he drove onwards. Regardless, he stayed on the same movement.* - Tue Sep 22 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: People train so hard . - Tue Sep 22 23:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *rubs eye* - Tue Sep 22 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) spotted Izanami's actions from the corner of his eye, taking note of the honeybun. It was a gesture that he didn't understand, but he could see the intent that she had. He could understand nothing of it considering it that he was once against her and her people. However, he allowed his focus to return to the task at hand, pushing himself past his usual limits and crossing the boundaries of each point again to finish his eigth lap now.* - Tue Sep 22 23:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) stilled moved across the farm yards as he let his eyes cross between the points again, just as he did prior. It concerned him where he was going to end up, and more importantly it made him wary of his turns as his shallow breathes grew deeper. His exhaustion now beginning to pass over him as he could see those two laps ahead of himself being completed in no time. Especially since he broke past the ninth just now, leaving him with only one ahead of himself.* - Tue Sep 22 23:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) made his way around the farmyard once again for his final lap, his eyes now picking up from the finish line and passing over the animals as the sweat encompassing his body seemed to sit, remaining calm as he came to his stop and finalized his tenth lap. He was breathing rather hard, yet, he produced a bottle of water from seemingly thin air, similar to Fujitora's sealing, but there was no jutsu usage at all. Sabo simply but the water to his own lips and began to consume it.* - Wed Sep 23 02:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) casually observed the two sparring before allowing himself to sheath his beautiful blade, Monohoshi Zao. His mind simply attempted to slip past, his movements focused on being silent as a means to prevent any force of distraction. He was practically trying to imitate his silent killing technique in this moment, yet without a target of course. He was simply intent on entering the center that practically everyone chose to remain within.* - Wed Sep 23 17:46:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) raised his head, shifting his visage to Mizumi. For a second, he only observed but following his observations, he gave a response. "The name is Sabo. For now at least."* - Wed Sep 23 19:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) exits the water now as he observes Fujitora's leave. The sight of him with Zenaki disgusting him. Not because he found interest in her, but simply because he had expected him to never fall for the enemy. Or rather, his own enemy considering Sabo was a neutral party.

Within a single moment, he began to recall upon what abilities he knew of Fujitora and Zenaki alike, for they had now achieved individual spots upon his list. Regardless, he still turned his attention to the others in the area, simply speaking the words, "Hello everyone."* - Thu Sep 24 22:05:39 2015
