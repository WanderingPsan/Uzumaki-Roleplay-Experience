<br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) maintained his stable state, retaining his visage on the area ahead of himself before beginning to produce another extension of his chakra in the space of air before him. Sabo was easily applying his chakra as he pushed out the weapon. The only problem he found was his inability to shape the weapon into the tool he wished for. His failure to amplify the technique enough to form a perfect blade upset him, and therefore he simply reduced his chakra, leaving just the kunai in hand now.* - Thu Oct  8 11:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remained persistent and pushed forth another burst of chakra, letting it extend from himself and his kunai onwards. With the simply ninja tool as his base of weapon, he found his chakra maintaining a stable path forward. The elongated blade of chakra remaining useful. Yet, he attempted to apply a sharpness to this chakra and simply found himself failing to gain the results he'd hoped for, leaving him to return what chakra he could to his own body in that instant.* - Thu Oct  8 11:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) allowed himself to access his chakra flow again, finding it incredibly difficult to even apply the basic shape and form of a katana as he'd wish. Envisioning his own, original blade, Monohoshi Zao, he found the chakra warping itself somewhat, shifting in the direction a normal katana would retain, but eventually losing shape. A simply nod as he noticed his progress, but afterwards removing his chakra from the kunai.* - Thu Oct  8 11:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I can try. - Fri Oct  9 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  9 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) thinks: Not really. - Fri Oct  9 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed Kaori as she approached, his eyes of lavendar scanning over her form. As Sabo stood there, he was simply observing any abnormalities within her chakra, looking for any deformation in her limbs or practically any weak points in general. Once he'd done such, he delivered a single blink, the single ring he had carrying itself over her legs more specifically.

As he looked on, he understood that she was rather slow, finding it very simple for himself to overtake her position and practically end this situation in a short second. Rather than drawing forth the katana of paper he held in his sheath, he simply allowed himself to produce a short series of handseals underneath his cloak. A moment of preparation took place, and he was only watching now for the girl to come even nearer.* - Fri Oct  9 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) had by now completed the handseals, allowing himself to easily let his chakra access the surrounding region. Even though elemental ninjutsu wasn't really Sabo's expertise, he figured it was best to see how truly lethal this technique could have been. With both the application of his chakra and the handseals completed, Kaori still proved to be too slow in Sabo's eyes.

A rippling through the ground and before she could even meet his point, rock proceeded to pierce tile and introduce itself to the female. Should she lack the reflexes, she'd more than likely find two, rather large spikes introducing themselves to her gut and two on the opposing side of the body, finding the same point of connection.

However, if she proved to overcome this technique, Sabo would take the strike, moving back with it yet proving to be pretty alright considering the females strength.* - Fri Oct  9 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) turned his head back as he heard the words of Kaori. It seemed that the ring in his eye seemed to fluctuate a bit, before eventually proceeding to move forward a few steps. Sabo retained a smirk before lowering his vision so that a shadow would take over a majority of his face, simply stating.

"You can't just hit someone...and get away with it so easily..."

A burst of speed forth and Sabo was within her immediate range, allowing himself to produce a single kunai from within his cloak, introducing it to the personal space of Kaori. At first, Sabo found this as traditionally good fun, considering killing was his hobby, yet with how quickly she attempted to back out he found a build up in anger.

Translating this anger to combat, he allowed his chakra to inch forth from the edge of his blade, finding a rather, elongated form of chakra taking place. Sabo was easily utilizing his chakra with the length of a tanto. Should Sabo connect, his blade would run up through the gut and his chakra, piercing the heart.

"I dislike when someone backs down...after offering..."* - Fri Oct  9 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) casually looted the body as he sheathed his kunai.

"A pity, they didn't even resist...never any fun."* - Fri Oct  9 00:48:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) tossed Takumi five hundred yen. "A good deal."

He then returned his attention to Genesis, wondering how he could coax her out of her current state.* - Fri Oct  9 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) didn't turn in response to Fujitora's presence, but he heard him all the same and even sensed his position, due to the condition of his eyes. However, as he remained with Genesis as his primary focus, he only gave a half-interested answer. "He's...injured...Probably with a medic."

Sabo then proceeded to step in front of Genesis, allowing both hands to reach for her cheeks, attempting to raise his lavendar-ringed eyes to meet the girl's.* - Fri Oct  9 05:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) had normally never felt anything other than a hunger for blood or the effect of one's rage, but as Sabo stared into the eyes of Genesis, it seemed that his killer's instinct and mindset had began to wash away. He proceeded to remove his hands, and apply them elsewhere, now pulling the girl into gentle hug of sorts as he seemed to whisper to her.* - Fri Oct  9 05:08:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) pulled back from the embrace now, finding his actions to be futile. It was obvious that the girl was stuck within a trance, but for what? It was unknown to Sabo. Regardless, he figured it was best to try and guide her away from the scene, proceeding to place a single arm upon her lower back, trying to get her to walk with him, yet not trying to force her.* - Fri Oct  9 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) seemed to apply some more force, merely to support the girl. Her depression seemed to be getting to Sabo, although he figured it was in his best interest to coax her out of this state for her sake, as he guided her away from the space.* - Fri Oct  9 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) seemed to bring Genesis to an open home, closing the door behind himself as he motioned her towards one of the beds, hoping that she'd take a seat upon one. Whether she did or not, he'd allow himself to observe he current state, simply speaking to her, "What's wrong with my queen?"* - Fri Oct  9 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: .... - Fri Oct  9 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) began to pace back and forth now, simply finding it odd of her to be so silent. It was unsettling, and even with how little he'd known of the girl, he felt it was his duty to do everything in his power to keep her happy. Another odd characteristic being applied to Sabo now. It was quite possible that just this girl alone was changing him. 

Yet, he pushed the thought to the back of his mind, finding that there were more important matters to attend to. Gaining a kneeling position, he now sat upon one knee as he attempted to take one of her hands, "Please...tell me how I can help..."* - Fri Oct  9 05:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to observe the situation at hand, simply acting as a guard for the woman before him currently. Yet, he was assaulted, not physically but mentally. As Sabo stood there, his lavender eyes seemed to shift, the ring along with it as sensory allowed him a chance to identify the trick at hand. He understood it was already too late for him to act against the technique, not even resisting, at least not yet. He simply wanted to leave Hideki with the thought that Sabo was incapable of recognizing such, or even escaping. 

His silence remained.* - Fri Oct  9 18:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If people are to find out...Someone that isn't the Raikage is being commanded in the shadows, that shows weakness. Espeically if they find out the person in the shadows is weak and can't defend themselves. - Fri Oct  9 18:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) took into realization that the genjutsu was over, his eyes allowing him to observe the connection of chakra between the two. Had Hideki just released however, he would've allowed things to go smoothly. Yet, he employed a tactic that Sabo wouldn't take kindly to.

He felt a trigger within his mind, finding the result to beat away at his mind, somewhat pushing him towards an unconcious state. In reaction, a birst of spirit seemed to come over himself and Sabo was proceeding to flip the table to his right (left of icon.). After doing such, he proceeded to 'growl' at Hideki and his partner.

"Do it -again- and I'll remove your head from your shoulders."* - Fri Oct  9 18:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed the production of the snakes, finding their introduction to the region before himself to appear on his 'radar' of sorts. Within quick action taking place, Sabo easily produced a single kunai in response, not even wasting his opening to access his own chakra pathway to send forth a rather clude extension of it.

The length of his chakra carried out far enough, at least for Sabo to strike against the blades. WIth ease, his 'blade' of chakra would more than likely sever each snake, if not, each blade at the least. The reaction of Hideki not bothing Sabo in the slightest, finding that the red-eyed shinobi had made a great mistake in his own eyes.

Once completing the action, his eyes shifted from the point forward and on to Genesis, hoping that she would move for her own safety.* - Fri Oct  9 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) thinks: fuck dis shit im out - Fri Oct  9 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) had fallen into a state of unconciousness, incapable of denying the actions of Hideki. It seemed that the ocular ability Hideki held were greater than Sabo's, at least in this instance. Yet, the introduction of the blades to his falling state left him to have no reaction. He couldn't. 

The blades seemed to pierce through Sabo's brittle skin, tearing through muscle with ease, proving that these snakes had blades that Sabo himself would've liked to make use of himself. Yet, the brain had been piereced and the situation was indeed over, his frontal lobe being the first target of the penetration. Within a mere moment, Sabo had passed quite quickly, not even capable of surviving more than a mere minute.

And now from his new position, he observed his body fall, moving backwards to collapse against the wooden flooring of the strip mall. With his observation, an expression crossed the now-turned spirit of Sabo, one of suprise, taking into realization that he had indeed been slain. A moment he believed would never come to him in any event.

However, he should have known that such a thing would happen, it was simply his mistake for beginning to gain trust in people, his visage cascading over to Hideki now as a scowl crossed his face. One of hatred, one of disrespect, and most importantly, one that swore vengeance. Yes, even in the afterlife Sabo believed he could wreak havoc, planning against the world with the strategic memory he held. But, more important things crossed his memory, his body--or spirit-- turning towards Genesis' position.

Another expression, never before seen on Sabo's face had come up. He now looked at the girl with eyes of sadness, observing the approaching hound of a man come across her. He'd failed in his fulfilling his new purpose, rather, his only purpose in life now. Protecting his Queen, his everything, a woman he'd become infatuated with from a mere glance at her soft skin and glowing eyes. Never before seen by the young Sabo.

Then he turned back to his own person, simply stating words that only he could potentially hear. "Just like Monohoshi Zao...I fall." Only afterwards, fading from the area, the chakra within his body passing from himself into the universes everflowing expansive force.* - Fri Oct  9 19:18:49 2015
