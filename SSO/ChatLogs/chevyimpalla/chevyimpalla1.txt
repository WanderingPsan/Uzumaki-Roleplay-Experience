<br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) raised his hands before allowing himself to place the two together. He easily allowed himself to begin perfoming a single handseal: the bird handseal. After doing so he applied a force of chakra, focusing in and out similar to the Kai technique. However, he allowed his chakra to release from hismelf as a wave of wind, encircling himself. * - Sun Aug 30 19:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) approached the training grounds as he saw the fall of the various objects in the area. The announcement on the loudspeakers was odd enough, but this put him on edge the most. As Sabo arrived, he eyed the various creatures around the area, only choosing to draw his blade as he approached.

As his eyes shifted around, he just kept himself on the defence rather than the offence. For now he was just holding his blade at the ready as he devised a plan within his head, taking into account the positions of some of the creatures that'd taken place.* - Sun Aug 30 21:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed as the mountainside was being struck and watched the destruction ensue. Allowing himself to take a steb back, he watched the others movements, his blade staying steady as he let his chakra begin to focus into it. Quite easily, a layer of wind began to coat the weapon and he prepared himself for any force of engagement.

He simply tried his best to stay out of the way of the creatures, and more specifically, Zetsumo's attack range. He allowed himself to make his way over to the side however, hoping to put himself in a much safer position to observe from, not yet closing range with all that was going on.* - Sun Aug 30 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed as the ground near his initial point of focus became encrusted. Rather than keeping a forward motion for it, he simply moved forward yet remained distant from it. His focused had finally shifted back to the creatures as he saw a few orbs coming for himself. 

His blade raised and met his face as he looked forward, keeping his blade at the ready and his chakra flowing throughout it. His eyes zoned in and he found this new challenge now meeting his weapon as he brought it in at an angle to practically disect the orb of 'snot.'

In the next instant, he let the angle of his weapon change as he motions to cut the other, trying to shift his body to make sure the leftovers of the projectiles would miss his form before returning to the basic kenjutsu stance, watching out for any other projectiles or any of the massive creatures approach.* - Sun Aug 30 22:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) sheathes his blade, since he doesn't really need it at the moment.* - Mon Aug 31 01:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remained stagnant, sighing as he was a bit aggrovated with the situation. When Beth's technique activated, he simply opened his mouth in response to her question, only really needing to give a short response. "My loyalty remains with Zetsumo."* - Mon Aug 31 01:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) simply let his eyes rest on Paine's form. A smirk drew across his face as he heard the thought of killing Kronos. If anything, that was simple food to satisfy his hunger to get back at Sunagakure and its inhabitants. For now, he just let a single hand rest on the hilt of his blade, tilting it forward slightly yet letting it stay rested in its sheath.* - Mon Aug 31 02:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) stands at the ready as he unsheathes his katana, holding it steady in front of his own sturdy frame. His position was strong and his katana remained still in hands. A shot of anger rushed through his body, accelerating him almost like a drug of sort as his chakra did the same, however shooting outwards and throughout his blade. 

The weapon began to pulse somewhat, his chakra reverbarating throughout it as it eventually let off a single coating of his chakra layer it, effectively allowing wind to begin encircling it at a rapid speed. With his mastery over the technique, it was actually quite simple but he knew he'd have room for improvement, figuring he could branch this technique off into others.* - Mon Aug 31 18:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to focus his chakra throughout his blade, holding it still in between the both of his palms as he locked his eyes forward. His hands began to carry themselves into the basic motion, letting his chakra flow around the weapon as he did so. His blade easily causing sounds to whir throughout the air around itself as it made its quick and precise slashes, the wind of his chakra further increasing cutting power. The power behind his strikes was of course granting him some ideas on how to improve his technique.* - Mon Aug 31 19:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continues onwards with his practices, easily channeling his chakra throughout his weapon as he allows himself to step forward. His blade easily moved across the open area ahead of himself, creating a simple slashing motion of course. The wind coating his chakra pushing its way throughout the natural current.* - Mon Aug 31 21:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) pausing his training with his chakra, causing the flow of it all to cease in an instant before letting it flourish outwards, making use of the Kai technique while he sheathed his weapon. As he sheathed it, he let the face of his thumb slide across the edge of the blade, nicking it a bit. Afterwards he allowed himself to begin a series of handseals before bringing his palm to the ground, forming a single seal around it.

In the next instance, a puff of smoke appeared and a frog was eventually in its place, Sabo choosing to utilize another jutsu to rid of it. His chakra simply welled up once more as he performed the bird symbol and let his chakra carry outwards, a veil of wind circling around himself to clear the smoke formed even faster. Soon, Sabo was just standing there staring at a single toad.* - Mon Aug 31 22:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continues to keep his eyes locked onto the toad that he'd just summoned. For the moment they were both merely silent, staring back and forth almost as if the two were having a conversation in a foreign language. A language that only the two of them could interpret at the moment. For now he simply looked at it and kept silent, the both of them only remaining in their positions with the toad occasionally croaking.* - Mon Aug 31 22:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to remain stagnant, simply looking at the toad. Sabo didn't know what to do with it but he simply let a single arm move outwards towards it, aiming to pick it up. However, the creature was a step ahead of him, easily using his arm as a ramp to leap up to his head, mounting itself there. 

"Well then..."* - Mon Aug 31 23:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) approached the two that seemed to be located on one of Konoha's various pathways. What they were doing? Sabo was unsure of, but he just remained silent as he recognized one to be Zetsumo. Rather, he also stood still with his toad resting amongst his head.* - Mon Aug 31 23:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) resumed his training as he began to perform a few handseals, eventually making his palm connect with the desk in front of himself. After doing such, a toad was eventually in its place with smoke billowing away from its position. As Sabo observed, he allowed himself to begin charging up his chakra within, performing the bird handseal before a layer of wind coveredh is body.* - Tue Sep 01 21:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) locked eyes onto Zetsumo. Sabo only knew as much as he'd seen and heard about the man, but it was obvious he held great power regardless. For a moment his hand hung low by the hilt of his katana, before grasping it and drawing the blade forth in one simple motion. Moving forward Sabo kept his weapon at the ready, mainly for a defense considering he knew he was at the disadvantage when it came to range and he surely didn't have the speed to close range before a response could be made. Therefore, for now he was just making his approach with his weapon gripped tightly in his hands.* - Tue Sep 01 22:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to move forward, already understanding his speed was harmful to his skillset. Regardless, he didn't let it get to him, simply choosing to focus on the physical combat. His legs carried him onwards and he saw his chance to make his strike now that he'd closed range. Recalling upon the request for killing intent before, Sabo fell into his natural motion and allowed his blade to raise upwards, particularly for the neck.

As his weapon came upwards, Sabo began to focus his chakra, allowing it to move throughout his blade, which was probably expected. With his chakra now flowing through the weapon, a veil of wind took place over it, effectively increasing cutting power in this instance, but he expected Zetsumo would have something to counter his simple chakra-imbued slash.* - Tue Sep 01 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) found his katana being denied by Zetsumo's technique. This had intrigued him, considering Sabo had never really seen anything similar in any case prior. In this moment alone he tried to begin thinking of his own counter, bu that was cut short with the fact that there was now a knee being lodged into his stomach. As a response, Sabo could only release a gasp while his form moved backwards, his katana still gripped tightly in one hand. 

For a moment, he was doubled over, beginning to accelerate his own breathing to recover, inhaling and exhaling repeatedly before eventually focusing back upon Zetsumo once more. His blade was raised once again as he looked forward. He didn't particularly hold any techniques for a situation like this, but regardless he continued to let his chakra flow take over. His eyes weren't set on damaging Zetsumo, no, not at all. He was more or less focused on cracking this shell he was capable of creating.

Moving back inwards, Sabo raised his blade again, his blade moving more swiftly with a ferocious intent. The power behind this strike being more intense as he tried to create a more concentrated flow of his wind. His attack also, was aimed more or less for the mid-region, trying to return the favor, and attack Zetsumo's stomach region with a slash.* - Tue Sep 01 22:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) moves his hand over to its sheath as he places it down on the hilt of his katana. His hand tightly grips the handle before eventually drawing it forth. His hand held it steady until the blade was revealed enough to the point that he could curve it and reveal the entirety from its sheath. Soon, he stood there with both hands tightly gripping the weapon. A sigh left between his lips before eventually his chakra began to flow throughout his weapon with ease.

As he stood there he began to make a few series of slashes, each one arcing in the shape of a crescent as he did so. His movements were somewhat choppy as he hadn't seemed to master the technique as of yet, but for the moment he was doing quite well. His blade whisked through the air, his own wind-natured chakra empowering his attacks as he did so.

While he made his flashy movements, he sat there, allowing his mind to wander off and return to the spar between himself and Zetsumo. It was good, as he actually had an opponent that tested his skills and showed him his own flaws. The ambition he'd gained from the fight drove him to work hard on his technique and think of more possibile techniques for himself to create and develop.

His arms moved in multiple directions, carrying the blade with it as if it were just an extension of himself, which it practically was with his chakra imbued into it. Sabo's movements stayed strict as he let his blade cut through the air, himself imagining invisible targets as he thought of how he could possibly apply his chakra to break through a defense like Zetsumo's. He was basically trying to recall upon the weaknesses of Doton, and which of them he could actually make use of. 

Eventually, Sabo allowed himself to settle and dropped his blade down to his side before letting his chakra extinguish itself. He huffed and puffed a bit, looking around the room before sheathing the weapon. His hands quickly moved into a set of handseals before colliding with the ground, a seal taking place beneath his hands and a cloud of smoke appearing. Once it cleared, his hand had been removed and a toad in its place. Sighing, Sabo began to stare it down, wondering what uses he could find with the creature. Eventually, he spoke up, actually asking it a question. 

"What do you even eat...?"* - Sat Sep 05 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continues to let his eyes sit upon the toad. Sabo knew very little of them, figuring it ate something of course, considering it was a living being. He allowed himself to raise up, choosing to begin a stage of experimenting as he allowed himself to begin opening a bag of chips.

"We'll just see then."

Once he'd popped open the bag he held a single chip outwards for the toad, figuring it would accept at least some form of nourishment, even if it was wrong and unhealthy. Sabo's hand remained extended until eventually a tongue shot out and easily stole the chip from his own grasp. As his eyes fell on the toad once again, he noticed its mouth moving, using whatever it had in its mouth to mash it down and eventually swallow.

"...Not too hard to find out it seems..."* - Sat Sep 05 04:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) awoke, figuring he drifted off into a state of sleep after his interaction with his toad as he figured he spent more time than he meant to trying to figure out the creature. Regardless, he searched around the room and found that it was gone.

"Eh...I can always summon it..."

With that thought in mind, he simply drew his katana, beginning to focus on mastering techniques that he should have mastered a long time ago. His blade remained steady within his hands before he arced it upwards, letting it take a crescent shape in front of his body before his blade eventually set back into its original placement, steadied out in front of himself.* - Sat Sep 05 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to work with his jutsu as he allowed his hands to remain gripped onto the katana. His arms raised the weapon now, his chakra easily flowing into the blade as it began to take light in the room. Eventually the color of his chakra took to the form of wind, flowing in a very tight radius around the blade. After such, he let himself focus in on performing his techniques.

His katana moved from one direction to the other repeatedly. While he made his slashes, he hadn't cared as much for the direction since this was minor swordplay, but he was practicing his Crescent Moon Beheading at this point, making sure his strikes had all been completed in a crescent. * - Sat Sep 05 12:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to hold his chakra within hi weapon, letting it flow throughout without any problem whatsoever. His mind remained focused on completing his attacks without failure. His technique was somewhat sloppy and very choppy, but as he worked on it, he could see himself increasing in skill in slight incriments. The actual motion wasn't the problem, but connecting his chakra with the technique was throwing his focus off a slight bit.* - Sat Sep 05 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued with the two techniques, combining his best technique with one of his lacking ones as he began to continue onwards with his motions.  The blade going through the crescent-like motions without any difficulty as he finally let his arms come to a rest. His chest raising and lowering in quick succession as beads of sweat rolled down his face.

He was tiring himself, yet he hadn't let that get to himself. After about five minutes of resting, he let himself get right back to work with the technique, performing several crescent slashes with ease.* - Sat Sep 05 12:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to let himself extend his practice, guinding his blade throughout the air around himself. His technique remained active, his blade still moving into the crescent before he eventually finished his arc. After doing such, he let himself move into the next action, just repeating what he'd been doing so far.* - Sat Sep 05 13:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) raises his hands as he sat there in the same place he normally did. His body relaxing in the chair of the normally empty office. A single thumb met his tooth and opened it, letting blood seep from within. and draw out over his finger. Afterwards, his hand instantly entered a series of handseals, completing the requirements for the Kuchiyose technique by pressing his thumb against the desk.

The result caused a seal to take place beneath it and a frog appearing above it. As the smoke that came with him disappeared, so did the seal. Afterwards, Sabo continued to look at the toad, eventually raising from his seat and removing a bag of chips from his pouch. Opening it, he set it in front of the toad and let it do with it as it pleased before he eventually moved off, setting himself somedistance away as he began to perform a single handseal.

His chakra flowed fluently throughout his body before releasing outwards, a shield of wind forming around his body as a result, taking up a short radius around him while he stood there. Sighing afterwards, Sabo set himself up for another go.* - Sun Sep 06 10:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to stand there, his eyes focusing in on the toad as it ate away at the contents of the bag. He listened to its various, wet and sloppy sounds as it moved around, trying to get deeper into the bag and past the content of air. After a few seconds he began to focus his chakra throughout his body before letting it release.

The chakra easily took up the form of wind, encircling himself as he remained standing there. The radius around himself was a pure wall of wind acting as a defense.* - Sun Sep 06 12:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to work with his technique as he allowed himself to begin focusing his chakra once more. He noticed how quickly the toad was making way through the bag and figured he'd probably need to give him another or find something else to do with the toad. However, in the mean time he performed the bird handseal, releasing his chakra in the form of wind as it circled around him, shaping the defense.* - Sun Sep 06 14:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remained on the same status, allowing his chakra to build up within him, focusing throughout all limbs in his body before he'd eventually find his hands coming into the bird handseal. In the same instant that he exhaled, his chakra was released. Due to that, a field of wind expelled itself around his body and the sound of him breathing was therefore nulled.

Once the chakra dissipated, Sabo looked down to the toad he'd left with the bag. His sight caught the creature having gone limp. Stepping forward, he removed the bag and found it coming back to reality almost immediately, appearing as lively as ever. Onc he'd done so, Sabo simply opened his mouth to speak.

"You good there?"* - Sun Sep 06 17:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded to himself as the toad seemed to be fine, back in working condition now. Rather than feeding it once again, Sabo lifted it up with both hands and placed it upon his head. It was a resting spot, and Sabo was sure that it would not interfere with his practices.

After making sure the toad was comfortable on his head, Sabo let his chakra become his focus. His hands entered the bird, and eventually, he exhaled. After doing so, he let himself release his chakra in a short burst, a wall of wind taking place up directly in front of his face. Soon it died down, and he had the feeling that the toads grip tightened in suprise. 

But could it even tighten its grip?* - Sun Sep 06 19:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continues to remain standing, his head still stagnant. He still felt the weight of the toad, so he could only assume it was doing completely fine where it was. Inhaling, Sabo let his hands come into the bird seal as he focused his chakra throughout his body with ease. Once his hands connected and the bird seal was finished, his chakra released itself, forming another wall of wind as a result.

Once Sabo completed this technique, he found himself making motions for the door, coming closer to it as he made sure the toad stayed its place. He planned on gaining some more improvement in the technique before exitting, but it would be best if he was closer to the door, no?* - Sun Sep 06 20:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was squaded up with Zetsumo and Co.* - Sun Sep 06 20:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as Zetsumo gave him his chance of making way to the ground. It wasn't the easiest way to get down but it surely was going to be exhilerating. The thought of combat already getting to his head as he motioned forward, gripping to one of the creatures brought forth by his proclaimed 'God.' 

Once reaching the ground, his blade would be brought forth from its sheath and he'd find himself touching down on the actual ground below. His body remaining somewhat close to the demon, yet giving it some space as he wasn't entirely sure of what it was capable of performing. 

Regardless, Sabo allowed his body to move forward towards the crowd of enemies, a smirk taking place upon his face as he was now allowed to unleash his strength. As he converged on various troops, he proceeded to let his blade make work of them, even cutting down multiples with single, wide-spread.

Having no idea of what the masked creatures abilities were, he presumed that it made quick work of the enemy with ease, more than likely use its natural element to shift the earth beneath its opponents to crush them. * - Sun Sep 06 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (honestly shin) - Sun Sep 06 21:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded onwards with his actions, letting his blade carry out the punishment for those that dared to defy the Kenryoku. His eyes shifted between various enemy troops, and of course, along the way he spotted his allies carrying out several Katon-natured Ninjutsu. Rather than staying in range, he moved off to the side really just to cut off a few outliers, should there be any.* - Sun Sep 06 21:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded at Shin's words, following up after the fireball he produced, katana in hand. His grip remained tight and he practically used the fireball to block any enemies view of his approach. Should any of the enemies survive, his body would raise upwards into the air and his weapon would prepare to make its approach forward.

It entered a slash formation, crossing the front of his body as it began to complete the formation of a single crescent. Not only did he perform such a simple slash, but he applied a bit of chakra to add onto the damage he presented to his foes, Basically cleaning up whatever was left open.* - Sun Sep 06 21:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) looked forward as he observed Angetsu. For the moment, he pondered the mans words as he stood there. He was silent, katana in hands as he took in his words.

"You benefit me none, therefore, you are useless to me. Cease and desist fore I wear your spine like a belt." 

With that, he moved forward at a walking speed, formulating a plan as he figured Shin would assist him in this moment. In his head, he was counting downwards for the man, Giving him the option to turn and run.* - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) watched the various ninjutsu be fired off at the opposing forces that seemed to belived they could just pass by without being assaulted in time of war. Keeping his katana drawn, his focus changed over towards them as he smirked, holding such a devilish grin. Had Sabo never been captured, these would have been allies.

But luckily, he was set where he was needed. Where he was meant to be. Moving forward, he brought his blade upwards and quickly allowed his chakra to flow through the blade that stayed in his hands. Rather than stepping in the way of the various ninjutsu, he arced around the force, placing himself at a point where he could view not only the enemy, but the attacks of his allies as he began to create a plan of assault for himself.* - Mon Sep 07 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed the party of troops as he continued on his round about, making sure to carry himself at an angle. It seemed that his position wasn't impeded by anything they brought up, considering they were merely on the defensive. He devised two courses of action. He could stop the offense they were preparing, or remove their primary defense. Either way, neither group would be problematic.

Carrying his body forward, he allowed himself to heft his blade upwards and approach those that chose to hold the wall. Keeping his chakra imbued within his blade he figured that no defense, no matter how big or wide would prevent him from cutting through to the enemy in this moment. Regardless, his blade would more than likely cut down whatever possibly got in the way of his attack as he performed his simple slash.* - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: I'm getting tired, I've been fighting for far too long. I've got plenty of chakra, but I don't know if my body can keep up. - Mon Sep 07 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: (I got like 5 turns left of combat as far as the stamina rule goes) - Mon Sep 07 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to move forward, setting himself past the earth wall. He remained passive however, not initiating combat, yet he was observing the enemy from his position.* - Mon Sep 07 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: I'm ready when you guys are - Mon Sep 07 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: If it comes down two it you two, charge after our main attack, it should distract them. - Mon Sep 07 00:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) focused his chakra as he performed the bird handseal. Upon doing so, he released his chakra and allowed it to form a barrier of wind around his body.* - Mon Sep 07 11:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) cuts everyones head off in 1 slash.* - Mon Sep 07 17:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) moved closer to the girl and her grouping of guards, yet keeping a distance between himself and them. His eyes rolled over her as he scowled. What bothered her, was that this is what they obtained, but he figured she had some importance in Zetsumo's plans, whatever they may be. 

A single hand raised and rested on the hilt of his katana, tilted it forward as the shine of his steel edged forth. Only a few centimeters shown to those in the room however. His scowl remained strong, yet he didn't do anything aggressive. "To see what reason you would be kept alive."* - Mon Sep 07 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) chuckled as he heard the words of Suitengu and Amai. He was glad he didn't suffer that fate, but it did ammuse him that others were still subject to such.

"Wonderful."* - Mon Sep 07 20:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) shifted his eyes over to Paine before looking back at Amai. "It's very obvious what I'm doing here. Standing."* - Mon Sep 07 21:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) turned as he moved to exit the cave now, finding it to be boring within the room now. It seemed that his fun had been had. As he moved forward, he relieved the weight his hand once had on the hilt of his katana, letting it sit correctly in its sheath once more. He didn't seem needed either, and therefore decided to find something else to occupy his time.* - Mon Sep 07 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: Sabo, what's going on over there? - Tue Sep 08 17:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) leapt the fencebecause he doesn't actually know shunshin.* - Tue Sep 08 18:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) placed a single hand on his katana's sheath. "Close-range, utilizing this here blade."* - Tue Sep 08 18:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as he listened to Shin's words, watching his actions for the moment. It was obvious he was to perform a ninjutsu as Sabo proceeded to let the hand that rested on his blade incline forward in the same instance, preparing it for his quick draw. His legs began to carry him forward, following up behind Shin's techniques.

Within a moments notice, a grunt came from his own self as he drew his blade with simple skill and prowess alone. The weapon drawing forward as it cut across the area he believed an opponent would place themself, specifically the side of the initial target space as he believed that one would dodge to the side.

"I assume here...is correct."* - Tue Sep 08 18:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as he listened to Shin's words from a distance. His body was honed to be reflexive. Therefore, when the flames of Shin came forth, he quickly dashed outwards in a lateral motion, his blade still grasped in his hands. As he remained out of harms way, he observed ahead, his blade still kept ready as he also pondered the strategies he could form between the two, had he developed some ranged techniques of his own.* - Tue Sep 08 18:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remained with his eyes steady on the area ahead, never once lookingto Shin's position. He didn't need to. His ears acted as his guide, as well as his peripherals. Moving forward as a follow-up to the technique, he allowed himself to begin bringing his weapon upwards again.

The fireball had passed and become the target his eyes followed. Never where the intended target was to be as this practice was meant for him to discover the opponents movement, and capitalize on such. Believing another point to be above the initial blast, he raised upwards, his chakra focusing throughout his blade as an instinct.

With a quick lateral slash, the wind that enveloped his tool so easily had soon dissipated, his legs returning to the ground as he figured his followups and covers were quite successful.* - Tue Sep 08 19:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) inspected the tree before Shin could create the smoke screen. He only needed to register the position once, considering it was no moving target. Hearing Zetsumo's words, he gave a short response. "Yes sir." However, he figured he could continue his training and keep an ear open at the same time.

Regardless, his body carried him forth as he motioned himself into the smoke along with the tree, fully immersing himself. He attempted to keep his movements silent as he proceeded forward, a slow pace being kept as well. In the current moment he was trying to avoid creating noise to alert the 'enemy.' However, he wasn't the best at stealth and surely could be heard by anyone with some experienced ears.

Upon reaching the tree, his eyes could faintly see the wood, and his legs moved around, carrying him to the backside before his blade had then protruded forth, impaling directly through the tree with ease.* - Tue Sep 08 20:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded, his eyes locking onto the log and then switching to the kunai. His eyes began to track the tool, and his body carried his position over to the log with ease. He was no marksman, but his strategic mind seemed to kick in, beginning to dictate the landing zone of the kunai and the velocity and speed of it.

His mind reacted, attempting to act at the same speed of the kunai, if not faster. as his leg raised upwards and arced forward to press against the external shell of the log. It progressively pushed the object forward, the laws of force taking place to propel the log forward. Assuming the kunai didn't fall short, the log should've intercepted it and then have some distance added on top.* - Tue Sep 08 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) stood at the ends of what seemed to be a crossroads. Some bit aways from Amegakure. His eyes followed a treeline, finding it a bit amusing with how they were placed. Did nature have some sort of enjoyment with placing itself in weird and odd shapes? An answer none would ever recieve. 

Regardless, drawing his blade now, Sabo proceeded to motion forth as he allowed his eyes to rest on the tree closest to himself. For a moment, he let his hand raise upwards, his tooth meeting the tip and eventually drawing blood from it.

After doing so, his hands actively performed a set of handseals before his palm slapped against the tree. A toad then leaped from such and landed upon his head.* - Wed Sep 09 18:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) gained a look of disgust when he noticed Paine smiling. He simply thought to himself how sickening the two females seemed to be making him. Or was it the fact that he wasn't currently making scraps from the lives of many others. Regardless, he scoffed in response and returned his view to Zetsumo, wondering if he'd recieve a response of some sort.* - Wed Sep 09 21:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) recalled upon the toad that sat upon his head, deciding to bring a single hand up and give it an awkward pat to make sure that it remained there. After doing such, Sabo drew forth his katana and focused in on the tree ahead of himself. Eventually, his chakra was flowing across the blade's surface, his body moving forward and completing a single slash against the wood in a diagonal motion.* - Thu Sep 10 00:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to keep his vision locked upon the tree as he brought the blade back close to his own body. He proceeded to step forth, feeling the weight of his toad shift amongst his head as he changed the angle of assault. Sabo's blade turned and performed a diagonal slash in the opposite direction of the original, still connecting the ends of the two together.* - Thu Sep 10 00:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to make slashes in the tree, finishing once again wth a slash through and through underneath the original two. With that, the wounded tree appeared to have an 'S' upon it. After doing so, he allowed himself to lower his eyes to the space available underneath the letter. His plan was simply to keep using his chakra flow to scribe words into different things.* - Thu Sep 10 00:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) kept working with the technique now allowing himself to make two motions at the same time on this side, cutting through the sides of the tree and creating an acute angle when applied After doing such, he put in a third strike and allowed it to create a slash through the middle and combine the two angled slashes to form an A.* - Thu Sep 10 00:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) responded to the wave with his own.* - Thu Sep 10 17:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) had of course passed his gaze over the behind of Misa, but only for a moment. His eyes returned forward, actually having no idea why he was standing here. He proceeded to leap the fence, standing within its boundaries now.* - Thu Sep 10 18:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) performs a Drake-Pose as he looks off into the distance, thinking about how useless his toads are.* - Thu Sep 10 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as he listened to Zetsumo inform him on the task at hand. A single hand rested upon his katana's hilt as he made a short and quick bowing motion. Upon raising, he spoke out. "It shall be done."

In the next instant, Sabo proceeded to face the fence and make his way over it, beginning on his path to the farm. As he moved, he proceeded to begin thinking up a plan of approach with the knowledge he'd obtained.* - Thu Sep 10 20:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) had exitted the primary boundaries of Amegakure as he searched for the farm that held the one named Wilcon. Sabo couldn't help but belive it as an odd name, yet, that wasn't his goal. As he moved, his plan was easily devised as he came across the crossroad leading up to such. Upon arrival, his eyes caught sight of the farm with ease.Taking to the treeline, his eyes locked in upon a figure tilling the fields.

Sabo assumed this man to be Wilcon, his legs carrying him in his direction, yet slowly. The branches and leaves of the tree blocking himself from sight. Along the way, as he remained at a distance, Sabo's katana became unsheathed, held in one hand as he approached. Closing in enough, his speed began to pick up and he came in quicly, aiming to deliver a swift stab to Wilcon and end him with a silent death.

In the next instant however, it was revealed that Sabo's techniques remained futile, the informant remaining resourceful enough to counter-predict Sabo's motions and so forth, considering his log was stuck in a log courtesy of the Kawarimi technique. Regardless, Sabo spoke out, "Your time is due now, you shall perish." Rather than having a fearful opponent, he realized that this man believed himself more skilled, with the laughs rising from him.

Sabo was a bit conflicted by this, but it didn't matter due to the fact that the next instant was entirely fast paced, the opponent utilizing a ninjutsu before his own eyes could acquire sight on the handseals. Soon, a raging wave of water proceeded forth, covering the landscape of the farm as it crossed over. With Sabo's own reflexes, he simply responded by forcing his chakra throughout the blade, cascading it with wind as he proceeded to make a counter. His blade splitting through the middle of the wave and allowing himself passage as if he were a figure of religious belief.

Regardless of the wave, Sabo found that this man had a deadly combination of ninjutsu elements as he attempted to followup the wave with raiton. His lightning rippled through across the water, reaching Sabo's location. Yet, with his speed, he moved in a great lateral motion. A large leap into a roll and he'd reach the outer limits of the layer of water and lightning. 

Soon, they were both silent, the effects of combat kicking in as Sabo broke into a dash moving forward at his opponent, his sword at the ready as waited to close in before utilizing any other techniques. Yet, his opponent seemed to begin moving towards the water once again, utilizing another technique of his own. Rather than moving directly inwards, he allowed himself to draw two shuriken, releasing them both in the direction of Wilcon. However, it wasn't apparent that there was a second one, considering the first obscured it from view. With the angle they both traveled, they'd curve somewhat and the second would connect with the arm while the primary, the chest. Yet, his opponent dodged in the wrong direction, one still planting itself within his chest.

The previous actions had paused Sabo's opponent from acting on his jutsu, but it put him in the motions of performing another. This one caught Sabo off guard however as he already broke into a chase. Soon, the ground beneath himself was being ripped apart by the raiton chakra tearing after him. Soon, he was stunned in place, remaining with his blade in hand. His eyes just remained generally locked upon his opponent, expecting him to capitalize on the action. His hands once again breaking into the same handseals for the technique he tried once before. Yet, Sabo could feel his movements returning and the pain being relieved some what as he watched the opponents hands make serious and fluid motions.

Once Sabo had found his ability to move freely had returned, he broke forward with his great speed, but it was obviously apparent that Wilcon still remained at a higher speed than himself, proceeding to move with ease, making this a game of cat and mouse while he performed his handseals. His eyes followed and his legs moved forward, the katana remaining an outlier in one hand. It wasn't yet needed for himself but he knew when he caught his opponent, it would be at the ready. The game of cat and mouse still remained relative though, but Sabo was easily gaining on his opponent as he seemed to slow down while his hands still remained the same relative speeds.

With such a long input of handseals, this worried Sabo, his body remaining tense while he gave chase as he prepared himself for the worst. Yet, when his opponent stopped on the final handseal, he held it, and made way to the water in a roundabout. Following afterwards, Sabo wondered what technique would come from this, and it was very obvious now. The water below seemed to whip itself off the ground, shaping itself into a swirling whirlpool that raised towards the sky, actively becoming a twister of water with the mouth finalizing itself as the head of a dragon. The amazing sight caused Sabo to stop in his tracks in response. He was close to the beast, but he hadn't wished to remain at such a distance. His legs broke away from the creature, attempting to move around the dragon, yet its head seemed to droop and come down upon his general position. Moving his body quickly, it seemed to lose its head.

Sabo had believed the technique to be a one time use now as he approached on his enemy, keeping the blade raised while he seemed to be unmoving. However, the result of Sabo's earlier mistake became relative in this moment, the head of the dragon bursting from the water between the two on the plain. On a whim, Sabo's blade came across in a lateral motion, his chakra being applied in the short moment as a means to deny the suiton technique from acting any further. All this means is that he severed the head of the dragon within a short instance. At the same time, he stepped forward through the gushing amounts of water, forcing his body to move through as he utilized his chakra to perform a single handseal and release a small shield of wind around his relative form. It's intent to assist him in pushing through, regardless of what it was meant for.

The boundaries were broken now and Sabo stood face to face with Wilcon. The response was unexpected however, the shield disippating and a single kunai meeting the shoulder of Sabo. In that instance, he allowed himself to toss his katana from one hand to the other, bringing that arm upwards in the same action of catching as he slashed downwards. He was sure he'd catch the opponent with this strike, a slash appearing across the chest of Wilcon before he proceeded to back out and create a large distance with his speed. Sabo came to a rest period as he attempted to recover, and spot Wilcon's new position.

His opponent was amiss, and now Sabo found a use for his summon. Utilizing the wound of his shoulder, he allowed himself to place blood on this thumb. Eventually, he proceeded to draw a few handseals forth before placing his thumb to the ground. A single, small toad was summoned in its place as he looked forward. "Search for him. He will not escape." In that instant, the two began to seperate as Sabo proceeded in one direction of the farm and the toad in the other. His eyes tracked around the wet battlefield, attempting to avoid the water for now as he began his search again, keeping silent as he moved. 

In the next instant, Sabo was once again blindsided, his toad meeting his backside with some force. A jetstream of water seemed to be propelling it and Sabo knew exactly where his opponent was. Yet, he was in trouble for the moment, moving forward until the technique came to a stop. Once his toad hit the ground, it dispersed, returning itself to Mount Myoboku. Sabo pivoted, turning to face his opponent again, launching several shuriken in the same instance. As he did so, quite a few of them remained hidden by others. Practically six shuriken all while it only appeared to be three. He didn't have any intent for these to connect, but he surely did plan on using it as a means of distraction.

Sabo proceeded forth, imagining as if the shuriken were Shin's fireball jutsu, his eyes tracking the positioning of Wilcon's body and proceeding to adapt to such. Wilcon moved to the right, so Sabo did so as well. His blade coming upwards as he proceeded to make a lunge forth rather than a traditional slash. His blade plunged into Wilcox, yet the positioning was rushed and the damage became non-lethal, only the gut being pierced, and even then, it wasn't great enough that the combat could end quickly.

Wilcon backed away from Sabo before proceeding to perform a set of handseals. His speed allowing him to keep backed away long enough to complete it. The handseals easily accessed another Raiton technique before a ball of lightning was projected from between both palms in Sabo's direction. A mistake bade by the informant. Sabo's natural element was Fuuton, and realizing this, he applied such to his katana and brought it forth as he cut through the ball, his weapon acting as an insulator in the situation to allow him a moment of closing in on Wilcon. He knew with the injuries and chakra expended by them both, the action would come ot an end soon whether or not either of them liked the outcome.

They'd both come to yet another standstill, but it was soon broke once again by Wilcon, attempting to expend the last of his chakra in a final effort to save himsself, yet Sabo remained unphased. Even with the few injuries he had, he proceeded to walk forth and remain menacing. His eyes remained full of malice and hate, was it for Wilcon? No. It was just something Sabo had always held and never let go. Yet, Wilcon had seemed to be frightened by this, the informant realizing that he was to meet his ends here. "NO!" was all that came from him as he ceased his handseals, seeing that it wouldn't make any difference in the situation.

As Sabo stood a few inches away, his blade came upwards and held still next to Wilcon's neck. Their eyes met and Sabo simply spat into the man's face as he mumbled, "Trash." After doing such, he proceeded to let his blade followthrough and took the man's head, slicing through soft tissue, muscle, and bone, all at once. His eyes looking over the body with a sense of bloodlust as he just wished he could relieve the moment once ago. It was such a wonderful sight for Sabo as he smirked, standing there beside the body. Eventually turning to leave, he grabbed the body and began to drag it back to the morgue for confirmation.

With the task completed, Sabo easily made his way back to the innards of Amegakure to deliver both the mission and the report of his mission. He delivered the body to the corresponding location first, leaving it in the hands of morticians and what not for study and ridding of the body. Afterwards he made his way to find the medics of Amegakure and recieve treatment of his wounds. The entirety of the event having had put him on edge and punishing his skill by half, but now it was over and Sabo had his fill of action for the moment. He just awaited to see what Zetsumo would say.* - Fri Sep 11 01:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) came across a small body of water near the boundaries of Amegakure. His had fell to his blade before he proceeded to draw it forth. The sound of his steel grinding against the sheath, and the sharp sound created when it protruded forth resounded throughout the area before he held it steady ahead of himself. Soon, a surge of chakra shot throughout the blade and his flow remained steady within.

Wind encased the sword and Sabo let his eyes look directly across the water. He proceeded to step forth as he performed a single slash before leading into a series of slashes, flowing wildly through the short space.* - Sat Sep 12 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to make progress with his technique, utilizing the chakra flow in his short slashes as he proceeded to move around swiftly. Twirling and what not, he appeared to be a storm of steel. Even with the toad that sat upon his head, he was moving quite fluently without sending it flying. Regardless, he continued to let his chakra access his blade.* - Sat Sep 12 17:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) still on the verge of mastering his technique, Sabo proceeds onwards with his tactics, allowing himself to focus on empowering the blade with his chakra. His slashes were practically the most fluent that anyone could see, and the way he conducted his movements seemed very simply and light.* - Sat Sep 12 17:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) choosing to cease focus on his chakra flow for the moment, Sabo sheathes his tool, recalling on his technique meant for denying Genjutsu. As he stood there he began to focus on the chakra moving within his pathways.For a moment, it seemed to cut off, like a water faucet. Soon, the flow restarted, reversing its direction however as he accessed the technique.* - Sat Sep 12 17:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continuing with the use of the technique, he allowed himself to focus once again. His chakra seemed to cease once again, pausing within the pathway track before restarting, shifting it into the original direction intended.* - Sat Sep 12 17:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to work with his techniques, allowing himself to cut off his chakra pathway once again, as if he was denying a genjutsu. Had Sabo trained this technique, he would have done such before but regardless, he restarted his chakra flow, letting it move throughout his body just as normal.* - Sat Sep 12 17:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) heeded Zetsumo's words. He'd been aching to get back into the heat of battle ever since he'd gone at it with the shinobi of Kumogakure and Sunagakure. Their troops were nothing to him and such made him want this battle even more. Regardless however, he was prepared, his katana remaining in its sheath but a single hand upon the hilt. Regardless, he proceeded to join the coalition in preparation for the attack. A certain sense of bloodlust rested upon his face, and soon it would come into action.* - Sat Sep 12 19:12:12 2015
