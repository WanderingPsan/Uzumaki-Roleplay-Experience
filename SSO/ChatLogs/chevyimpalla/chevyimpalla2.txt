<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) followed after Shin.* - Sat Sep 12 23:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) followed in Shin's footsteps, stopping a bit behind him. Rather than giving off his usual action-oriented appearance, he let his hand remain at his side rather than on his katana's hilt. His eyes scanned over, understanding that the goal was to practically case the joint and report back anything suspicious. Simple enough in Sabo's opinion. He proceeded forth, keeping at least an eye and an ear open for anything odd. 

"Of course," was all he said in response to Shin.* - Sat Sep 12 23:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) felt a figure force his way past him. For a moment , Sabo almost let his anger get the better of himself, his hand moved towards the hilt of his katana. However, he let his hand stop before reaching it in an attempt to control his anger. He hadn't wanted to compromise the mission so early on, or at all if possible. Rather than speaking, he allowed himself to observe the actions between the two, figuring that both the employee and the strange figure were working together for something.

Soon his gaze shifted from the two individuals to the bag that traded grasps. He wanted to get himself a closer look, but of course he'd need to get it from the man's bag. Moving past Shin, he attempted to make it look as if he was observing something on one of the walls while he whispered. "We need that bag..."* - Sat Sep 12 23:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed the man from the corner of his eye, not really getting a good line of sight of what he was doing. Yet, it was when he spoke that Sabo turned. His eyes observed more intently and he figured that now there was something to be done. His eyes passed over the employee, the cash, and then the man that had just made his purchase. This inquired him, wanting him to learn more about the man and what he'd gotten. He shifted his position, moving closer to the door himself, yet he stopped at the wall, only choosing to press his back against the wall nearing it.* - Sun Sep 13 00:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) with the wind technique being cast in such a short amount of time, Sabo's reaction time was somewhat off. He hadn't expected such an action to come so quickly. However, in response to such, he could only only bring his hands up into the bird handseal, accessing his own fuuton based jutsu. Quite easily, a shield formed around his person as to cushion himself from the Great Breakthrough and the Explosion together.

Once things were clear, he'd attempt to stand and give chase through the doorway, assuming he would be better off considering how distant he was from the explosion.* - Sun Sep 13 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded onwards as he made his way after the criminal. By now, his blade had been drawn as he locked eyes upon the figure. As he moved forward, he allowed himself to break off, moving off to the side in order to approach at an angle. While he moved forward, he proceeded to draw not one, but two shuriken forth from one of his pouches before allowing the two to fly. However, unless the man on the run had the skills necessary, he'd more than likely miss the sight of the second shuriken traveling beneath the first.

Sabo had made his intended target the legs, figuring he could land his mark with his ability however.* - Sun Sep 13 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) slowed his approach with the explosion coming up from the man's backpack. Sabo had wished that capturing the man would've been much more of a challenge, but he seemed to be a small-time crook regardless. Rather than Fixating his eyes on the bag, considering the contents were either destroyed or scattered, he eventually picked up his pace once again until he reached the unconcious husk of a man.

One hand protruded forth and aimed to grip the hair on the criminals head before bringing his katana to meet his neck. Not yet cutting or stabbing, but holding it as a precaution. "Should we turn him in alive?" he said, speaking to Shin.* - Sun Sep 13 01:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'm sure Zetsumo would appreciate that - Sun Sep 13 01:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: But are mission isn't a success yet. - Sun Sep 13 01:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded as he kept eyes on Shin, "Of course." For the moment, Sabo sheathed his blade, hoisting the male up so that he could assist Shin in tying him up for their interrogation.  Assuming this went well, he'd actively make use of his hands, delivering slaps to the criminal as he spoke up. "Wake up."* - Sun Sep 13 01:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) watched as the man seemed to cower in fear. It was safe to assume that this was the work of Shin's genjutsu. Sabo had seen its use beforehand and had even been on the opposing end of it once before. Regardless of such, Sabo seemed to hold a smirk of enjoyment. It benefitted him to see people in pain, whether it be mental or physical. He was one for the bloodlust and action. 

"Indeed. I suppose we shall." With ease, Sabo moved forward, letting his fingers slip between the ropes as a means to get a grip before utilizing such to lift the figure up. In a moments notice, the man would more than likely be upon a single shoulder, opposite of the side that he kept his katana on. "Let's get going."* - Sun Sep 13 02:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sure. - Mon Sep 14 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Let us spar. - Mon Sep 14 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yo. - Mon Sep 14 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: For real? - Mon Sep 14 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Mon Sep 14 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Weird. - Mon Sep 14 19:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's fine... Nothing real heavy. - Mon Sep 14 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps you can test your hand with your shortblade? - Mon Sep 14 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mmm...Maybe. - Mon Sep 14 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was of course knocked away by the technique that Zetsumo had displayed, his body clashing with the person behind her, unless they happened to dodge his body. Upon landing however he would utilize the nearby fence to lift himself from his position and begin focusing on making his attempt at this jutsu.

His hands began to move into the process of performing the six handseals as instructed, all the while his chakra began to build up within his gut. His mind easily relaying the instructions that he heard only moments before taking the strike. In the event of himself focusing, he allowed his chakra to enter the third stage, thinning out to become the fuuton element before he finally completed the handseals in the same moment.

Next, his body willed his chakra pathways to open and release the stored element in the form implied by the jutsu. It progressively moved forward, exitting his innards, yet, stopping short. It was obvious that his skill was no where near Zetsumo's, or practically any elementalist, but he still got the deed done, assuming that he'd put in a lot of work to utilize this technique to the fullest.* - Mon Sep 14 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: such tenacity.. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nodded. "Of course, I shall begin now."

Soon, Sabo moved off to the side to begin his training.* - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: much lightning. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: wow. - Mon Sep 14 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: That lightning, though.. - Mon Sep 14 19:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to begin making use of the technique he'd just learned recently. His hands easily proceeded to begin on the handseals as he recalled upon them. Soon, his chakra built up before he completed the sixth seal. Upon doing so he allowed himself to release a burst of wind in a straight forward motion, completing it with ease.* - Mon Sep 14 19:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) lifted his hands once again as he proceeded to stead his hands out in front of himself. Soon he was performing the six handseals designated by Zetsumo for this technique. Within moments, he was focusing his chakra into his gullet, building up just enough for use of this technique. Soon his hands came to a stop.

In the next instant, his chakra thinned out, shifting itself into the Fuuton Element he'd required for its use. Almost immediately afterwards, he released the technique and allowed the chakra to disperse, moving forward in a quick motion as he made his target a nearby tree. However, it did nothing seemingly as he remained standing where he was currently.* - Mon Sep 14 21:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) nearly began to perform the technique again, but proceeded to access another technique, drawing blood from his thumb with his tooth, soon accessing a set of handseals before summoning a single toad upon his head. Soon after, he began the process for the wind technique once again.

His hands accessed the series of six, his chakra thickening within his gut before eventually thinning outwards, the excess returning to his pathways before eventually a long ranged path of fuuton was released, moving directly ahead of himself to connect with the tree, causing the leaves to move somewhat.* - Mon Sep 14 21:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) began to pick up on his training again, allowing himself to perform the set of handseals necessary. Six in total. Soon his chakra swelled within his gut, shifting to a more thinned out layer as it encompassed the innards, taking the form of Fuuton. Afterwards, he allowed himself to release the technique and let it connect with the nearby tree.* - Tue Sep 15 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: We should go. - Tue Sep 15 17:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: You two should spar. I'll just watch. - Tue Sep 15 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) overheard the announcement and the grouping of people that semed to be nearby. He disregarded their presence however and allowed himself to access his set of handseals again, proceeding to speed through the series of handseals as his chakra flowed into the pit of his gut. Soon it thinned out, layering itself within as it churned into the fuuton release. Once it had done so, he finalized the technique and allowed himself to release the technique, a great blast of wind passing from himself onwards to connect with the tree.* - Tue Sep 15 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) comes through and beheads all of them.* - Tue Sep 15 17:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: omit - Tue Sep 15 18:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) returned to do his training.* - Tue Sep 15 19:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) decided to pick up the slack and get a roll on with his practices. His mind shifting to the handseals for the Wind Release technique Zetsumo had shown, just as his hands did as well. Soon he began to find himself focusing chakra into his gut. The thick mass soon thinning out enough to become fuuton before Sabo allowed himself to expell it from within himself, letting it move forward like one great breathe. The winds kicked up and connected with the tree ahead of himself, causing the branches to move at the least.* - Wed Sep 16 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) continued to follow along the same guidelines, allowing himself to keep up the handseal performance. It wasn't natural to him, but he'd gotten down the basics of it regardless. Soon his chakra within turned to wind, allowing him to release it in use of the technique.* - Wed Sep 16 21:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) believed he should pick up on his training again, deciding that utilizing his fuuton techniques would be a great advantage to himself in this moment. He proceeded to bring his hands together in a set of handseals, performing them for the technique he had in mind. Soon after he completed such, a great mass of wind pushed forth, connected with a nearby try as he stood in place, observing his work.* - Thu Sep 17 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Don't give me a hard time. I'm explaining this to you because you should know, I don't intend to beat you silly every single day. - Thu Sep 17 22:14:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proves to move forward and join the grouping of his fellow Kenryoku. He allowed himself to look amongst them, simply observing what was going on as he looked to Amai specifically, a scowl etching across his face. "She's still alive?"* - Thu Sep 17 22:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: You will not, under any circumstances, pull out the scroll you use for drawing unless you've let me know in advance that you're going to do so. - Thu Sep 17 22:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) observed the great serpent with his very own eyes. As he proceeded to look upon the creature he figured that this was the result of one specializing in the art of summoning. Yet, Sabo's toads were obviously nowehere near this level of prowess. His mind began to addle on the thought of summoning a toad of such a massive size, yet he remained there, silent, figuring he'd ask Hanabi for some tips later. Even Sabo needed help at times of course.* - Thu Sep 17 23:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) settles himself by a flowing river a bit away from Amegakure. He'd now raise his hands and begin performing a couple of handseals before letting his chakra within focus in a single centerpoint. Soon it took the form of wind within himself before he proceeded to open his maw, completing the techniques handseals and releasing a powerful burst of wind in a forward motion, watching the waters split as it moved across.* - Sat Sep 19 09:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeded to start up on the technique again, his chakra focusing directly into the belly in quite a large amount. Soon, while his hands proceeded to pick up on the handseals, his chakra thinned out and eventually took the form of wind. Hands now finished, he released this wind in a forward motion, letting it burst across the waters with ease.* - Sat Sep 19 09:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) motioned his hands into the handseals for the technique once again, picking up on the matter as he allowed himself to focus on completing the six. Soon, his chakra was welling up within and finding itself shifting into the fuuton release. With the handseals now done, Sabo released the jutsu and allowed the winds to propell forward with great strength to cross the river.* - Sat Sep 19 09:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) lifted his hands back into the handseal sequence, his mind focused on the movements of his hands and the connection of them. As he proceeded to stay his place, his chakra welled up into the form of wind once again, this time, the process taking less time as he was now getting into the session. Soon, another burst of wind traveled forward.* - Sat Sep 19 10:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) sparked up his training efforts once again, allowing a finger to graze against a tooth, drawing blood from within himself. Soon, his hands entered a couple of handseals before placing down a summoning seal. Soon, a toad rested in place and Sabo picked himself up, turning as he began to perform another series of handseals. The chakra within himself coming up to par as he released a blast of wind chakra, letting it move across the waters.* - Sat Sep 19 17:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) proceeds to lift his toad from the ground, bringing it to his head as he turns, facing the direction of Amegakure now as he plans to make his return, figuring he was due for some social interaction now.* - Sat Sep 19 22:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hey, Sabo. - Sat Sep 19 22:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Huh? Oh, Hello. - Sat Sep 19 22:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Have you seen Ushi around? - Sat Sep 19 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: No, I haven't. - Sat Sep 19 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sat Sep 19 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Damn. - Sat Sep 19 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Carry on then. - Sat Sep 19 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Eh... - Sat Sep 19 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) figured that with Zetsumo's wishes, he should pick up the slack on his training, allowing himself to begin working on the technique once again. He allowed himself to access the handseals now, focusing his chakra into the belly of the beast. Soon it was thinning out, focusing within his stomach in the form of wind. Soon after, he allowed himself to release the wind, letting it move in a forward, fluent motion to connect with the tree, progressively moving its branches at the most.* - Sat Sep 19 23:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) remains with his hands set and ready, progressing into the handseals once more as he now allowed himself to produce a focus of chakra within his own belly once more. This shifted into the thin winds that were recquired of the technique. With ease he allowed himself to release this torrent of wind, striking against the tree once again now that he released it.* - Sun Sep 20 00:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) locked eyes on his hands now, letting himself look down as he watches his hands move at a pace. He was still getting used to the need for them but regardless, he found himself making them with some ease. Upon completing them, the chakra he stored up in the mean time released, moving forward in a burst of wind, causing the tree in front of himself to move at least a bit.* - Sun Sep 20 00:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) was still on the verge of mastering the technique, allowing himself to get more in tune with his element. With a simple series of handseals and focus of his chakra, he was soon releasing the same technique into the distance as he watched it connect with the tree ahead of himself.* - Sun Sep 20 00:43:44 2015
