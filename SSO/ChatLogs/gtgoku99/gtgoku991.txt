The wheels on the caravan goes round and round, round and round. . .

All through the sannnd!

Indeed, it had been quite sometime -- a few weeks, maybe even a month -- since the young Knight-in-training had seen his beloved Priestess. Both he and Fujiko were a pair, trained together specifically by the Tenryujotei to compliment one another. While she embodied the wisdom and elegance that came with the light, Avrian on the otherhand was presentative of the Light's wrath.

With a squeak, the caravan rolled on through, each rotation crushing the sandy grains on the floor, and making the path all the more easy. It was a few day's of traveling that had eventually brought the crusador closer to his destination -- that of Sunagakure. Sweat protruded from his body, given the shift in climate, one that the young teen had yet gotten used to.

But all the same, such conditions paled in comparison to his desire to re-unite with an old friend, and someone he vowed to protect and serve with his life. Given the third day of travel, at the crack of down, Avrian along with the traveling crew had reached the destination. "Ahoo! Finally, we reached this damn place! Good workin' with ya, 'Sir Knight', heh! Have a good trip in this hot box."

Casually, the crusador manuvered, stepping one foot out. With a crunch, the appendage reached the floor, fortifying his balance and given more than enough support for the next leg to step shortly after. Very little weaponry were on his person, save for a small Tanto on his back, and some bandage wrappings along his arms. Given the heated temparature, the clothing worn were loose fitted, and of course were pretty light in texture to hold the least amount of heat as possible.  They were a few blocks down, but the overall distance was meager.

With regalsteps, Avrian reached the end of the road, only to be greeted by a swarm of shinobi, naturally guarding their home from any invasions. After bowing, the young lad speaks, each word gentle.

"Good evening. . . I believe a young miss known as 'Fujiko' has come to this village? To be granted entrance-- I'd be greatly appreciative of such, yes. I am willing to deal with any of the proper procedures." His mannerism were proper, but his tone was gruff and to-the-point. It gave off an odd tone. . or persona.* - Fri Dec 11 11:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 12:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ||

Indeed. It had been long. . . -FAR- too long in fact. Avrian, despite his stoic facial expression and placid demeanor flicked his eyes up and down. Fujiko certainly had grown, as had he. As expected of a close-quarter based crusador, his both held an athletic and defined appearance to it. It was the consequence of an intense, daily regiment.

Immediately, as the Priestess made her approach, the Knight descended into a kneel. One knee was firmly plantedo nto the ground, the force leaving a depression along the criminally hot sand. His eyes, for the time being, were diverted specifically onto the floor.

"My apologies, my lady. . The temple required that I certify my competency. By the time I had reached Kirigakure, it was clear you no longer in the vicinity. I search for days, and scoured the land. . . Up until I heard word of your location. Forgive me. . ." For that moment, he remained silent, before shifting his gaze upward. Avrian exhales, a hand moving to swipe the sweat that glistened along his forehead. 

"You've grown, I see. Into a priestess who is as beautiful as she is kind." Of course, for now, the Knight never bothers to move -- He was awaiting Fujiko's comfirmation of forgiveness, and perhaps an eventual invitation into the desert-based village. Being out in the outskirts for so long wasn't exactly a great thing. Plus, given the long days of travel, Avrian very seldomly had any time to feast or provide nutrition to his body.* - Fri Dec 11 12:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Hm so thats him? - Fri Dec 11 12:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ||

The acceptance of the apology worked wonders to lift the Knight's spirits. Although, his facial expression hardly showed it, save for a very brief smirk. The shifts in expressions were hardly noticeable, but had they been detected, it was clear that the placid expression was consciously upheld. Regardless, once Fujiko had given the okay, Avrian quickly rose and gave a nod---

Suddenly, the bow wielder had lunged forward, wrapping her gentle arms around his body. Obliging, the crusador's arms moved as well, giving a gentle, warming hug. "Indeed. . .  It's great to be at your side once more, my Priestess. The village, I assume it has been well to you." After a few seconds of gently hugging, he releases from the embrace, and begins with following the female inward.

Along the way, a glance falls onto Bryson. The persona or aura that resonated along the gent's body was all to reminiscient of the common priests that were encountered during Avrian's own tutelage. If not that, then the Tenryuujotei artifacts certainly sported by the proud Christian was a dead give away. For a moment, Avrian said nothing and merely stepped forward, following diligently behind Fujiko's lead. A brief whisper is given.

"Who is that? I was unaware more of our kind had ventured out-- into the shinobi world. . " The tone is inqusitive in nature, and moreso at ease than Avrian's normal tone or speech mannerism. After all, Bryson certainly was no threat, right? Priests had to look out for one another.* - Fri Dec 11 12:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ||

On instinct, his fist clenched, mostly at the comfirmation of a Necromancer lurking in the village. Just thinking about it had Avrian at edge, his hair standing along his skin, and odd goosebumps forming along the male's body. The goosebumps weren't to be taken for excitement, but rather extreme caution, and a flow of adrenaline. There were none in the immediate area, however, beckoning the warrior to calm his spirits and to listen to the rest of commentary offered by the kind and beautiful priestess, Fujiko.

"Ah. . ? Is that so. I'll have to see this for myself. . ." He offers again in the form of a whisper, before attention or visage shifts back onto Bryson. His onyx eyes give a thorough examination to the apparent priestess. After Fujiko had finished speaking, a single step forward is taken. With the fist that had been clenched, Avrian brings the appendage close to his heart, allowing the palm area to press against the chest -- as a form of salute.

"Evening. . Yes, I am the knight-- Avrian. Represenative of the light's wrath, and sworn protector of my dear companion, Fujiko. I hadn't anticipated to encounter a true priest this far out -- save for my priestess, of course. For your aid in protecting and nurturing Miss Watanabe. . . I am currently in your debt." He gives a nod, pupils sparkling along the hot, and vicious sunrays of the Wind Country's desert. It was Avrian's duty to protect Fujiko, and given certain circumstances, he had been unable to do so.

Given Bryson's role in taking over the duties briefly? The knight essentially had given a vow based on his honor to repay it. . And Avrian never broke a vow. * - Fri Dec 11 12:50:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) gives a glance to Koji. No wave is given, but a nod of acknowledgement is bestowed upon the apparent monk. Worrdlessly, Avrian turns to the Kazekage and nods.

The bit about blood and weapon is ignored given that was spawned by OOC trolling. . .

"Ah. And this is the leader? T'is a pleasure. Isuppose Fujiko has already introduced me. But I am a knight of Tenryuujotei -- Avrian. The pleasure is mine." A curt bow is given, before the male fell silent again to allow the Priestess time to speak.* - Fri Dec 11 13:26:20 2015

Indeed, the conversation held before was irritating, and brought Avrian's spirit on a steady rise -- for bad reason. His heart was filled with rage and aggitation, but thankfully the crusador than to express his discontent. Especially as they were within foreign grounds, with individuals who very clearly were capable of enjoying or befriending the nature of a dastardly Necromanceress. 

"Indeed. . . Although, it's best to put it behind us, and to ignore that man from this point. He knows not what he speak. . and his relation to this 'Yukio' fellow means little to me at best. For now, however. ..  I suppose we focus on the task at hand. I trust that you'll be as diligent and competent in this assignment as you have in your previous. . ."

In no time, Fujiko had been his guide, leading the way to the apparent mission site and preparing to grant instructions. Avrian, as per usual, followed from her rear, his head moving in a swivel as they cautious trekked towards an abandoned region of Sunagakure. Each muscle in the warrior's body remained tense, prepared for combat that could very likely begin out of nowhere -- without warning. 

It takes about a half hour to reach the destination at last. On view, there was an eery calm to the surrounding lands. The wind shifted uncomfortable, occasionally whistling or howl. . . For a few moments, you could tell, this was a subtle warning by the demons that lurked. They had no intent on actually dealing with any priests/priestesses -- a class of light warriors that were increasingly becoming more abundant within the sand village. Despite the warnings, Avrian trek'd up, following behind his lovable companion and waiting for her to apply sensory ability.

Patiently, his eyes observed, keeping a steady visage on Fujiko's form as she did her thing. Light energy flaredo n the inside, churning and preparing for activation should the going get tough. Nevertheless, as anticipated, the bow-wielding priestess gestures Avrian forward, and with that. . -He- began to lead, serving as the shield for any potential danger.

In minutes, they were moving deeper into the abandoned space, an area where the sunlight itself seemed to dim. Practically every building in the area had been rundown, suffering from some form of damage -- be it holds in the walls, or cracked infrastructure.  The build up of dark chi grew more potent with each step further into the danger zone before -- 

Swoosh! Bats fluttered, each one sporting beady, red eyes, and oozing with malicious energy. A total of eight were in the pack, and each of the odd creatures fluttered in, baring slimy and sharpened canine teeth. 

". . .! This is bad. . .!" Springing into action, Avrian manuevered, sending a vicious right handed blow. As the punch is being delivered, a golden, light aura of energy hugged the flish around the knuckles, granting an unprecedented boost in energy. The punch slams right into one of the bats -- before combusting, sending out a sizeable explosion. Just like that, half the grouping had been dealt with.

". . .Miss Fujiko! The others are coming!" the crusador declared with a sense of urgency, he couldnt' stop them all at once, even if they weren't too big of a threat. In anycase. . . 

Whether or not they had been stopped, looking further ahead down the road, you could detect a larger amassment of dark, necromantic energy. Although, sensory seemed to be partially jammed, going in an array of directiosn and making it hard to discern the precise location. Had the enemy been preparing for their arrival?* - Fri Dec 11 22:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ||

The two demonstrated great synergy. With ease, the threat had been clearly quelled.He gives a nod, smiling as Fujiko seemed to have been in relatively good health -- both spirtiually and physically.

As usual, Avrian gave the Priestess authority to give commands. As she gestures them forward? The Knight moves to the forefront, cautious advance further. They would be forced to move miles along, with relatively few obstacles arising to serve as a detriment -- the few being low leveled Demons, the likes of which could feasibly be handled by common citizens.

Avrian in particularly dazzled the area with his outpour of spiritually pure chi, each one vaporizing each of the demonic presences that dared step into the way. Before long, both he and Fujiko had reached a fork in the road, which seperated into three distinctive directions or areas. Now at the heart of the problem. . .Being at the center point, the dark energies poured invisibly over their form.

The sensation was gag-inducing, as the horrid scent flared along Avrian's metaphysical 'nostrils.' It surged with a certain level of evil intent that just made the light warrior's skin crawl. . It was so sinister, the persona was damn near palable, or capable of being physically felt.  Despite how un-nerving and fear-inducing these array of sensations felt, the teen remained stoic, knowing all too well that he was to be Fujiko's sword and shield.

For the priestess in question, she'd note a nearly equalled amount of chaotic energy swirling from the trio of directions. But all the same, the one were the screams seemed to be produced from seemed to be near the center-most outpost. Each of the buildings layered around were comprised of an odd, stony material. The tint was orchid, an extremely saturated version of the purplish hue, and also wreaked of an odd, foul, and necromantic scent. . 

Albeit, just like stated before, the center one seemed to be the most notable in this regard. Naturally, all three buildings were worth a look -- but it remained to be seen, what would Fujiko demand?

"M'lady. . . What are we to do?"* - Fri Dec 11 22:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) nodded. Fujiko had given her judgement, and thus Avrian would heed her wisdom and follow through with the commands. As usual, the knight steps forward, being the lead when it came to combative efforts.

They'd arrive at the door, and cautiously he sought to push through. Sadly, things weren't as simple as they seemed, given that the door remained locked. The natural response from Avrian was to punch, and so he thus! Hardened fists ram harshly agaisnt the stony construction,  forcing some dust or rock bits to flow downward, but generally no real damage had been done.

For the next minute, Avrian continued with a high-spirited slug fest, his bones never faultering, and the pain never quite being enough to beckon for a rest. As his patience run thin, the crusador utilizes his main method of combat, the holy energy-based taijutsu blow. A golden viel of light energy wraps around his fist. The heavy handed blow lands, sticking the ethereal substance onto the demonic wall's 'skin', and leaving it there, held in bondage.

Working off of this, a bright flash erupts, white and blinding in nature. As it reaches, the wall combusts, exploding under the might of Avrian's holy energy. Now with the obstacle gone, the knight steps forward, examining the area before giving the 'okay' for Fujiko to enter herself.

The insides was strange -- and probably would be vaguely familiar to sunagakure shinobi that had dealt with a particular Necromancer in the sewers. Indeed, there was a vast staircase, and each individual flooring, a barrier of sorts had been constructed. Unlike the woman in the sewers, this barrier seemed to be enhancedb y tech, with wires moving through the walls, transmuting more unholy nectar.

It's here that Fujiko's sensory abilities would be well utilized..

As she sensed along, the wiring would clearly be funneling large energy sources -- batteries even -- that ran all the way to each of the two buildings from the outside. What lurked in those wasn't quite seen, however. 

In addition, she could feel the evil presence from before growiing more potent, deep within the heart of this strange, elaborate building. What more, there were several other entities that lingered within. Some were mostly human, albeit perversed with demonic energies, and the others seemed to be having their life faded away, their souls consumed for whatever reason. . 

"A barrier of sorts. . Is this a spell?"* - Fri Dec 11 23:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ||

He silently took Fujiko's words to heart. "That would be wise, my priestess. . "

As she pulled back the string and began to channel a light arrow along the bow, Avrian also took his own preparation. As a rookie knight, the teen lacked very little versatility -- as he knew only one legitimate spell to call his own. The right fist is formed and reeled backwards, and in the process, light chi is manifested along the way.

"Allow us to strike this down. . !"

He'd sprint ahead, getting a head start to the barrier while Fujiko continued to build up torque. In no time, the golden arrow fluttered forward, rushing just behind Avrian's form. . . BOOM! A single blow lands, marking the infrastucture. Just as it's glowing, the knight skips backwards, ignoring another flow of light energy to iginite the marked area.

"Here go. . God's Cross!" Notably, the youthful warrior was becoming extraordinarily gifted when it came to manipulating the single spell. His rate of growth was unprecedented, superhuman. And it made sense, given the incentive or motivation he possessed.

Just as that's going on, the arrow launched before whizzes over the knight's shoulder, both of the destructive attacks being more than capable of erupting and breaking the barrier down. Like glass, the dark-magic gate was shattered, giving a brief opening. Fujiko would be able to detect, however. . That this was far from the end. The barrier was already regaining power, and if the two hadn't acted quickly, it would shut before they'd be able to get through.

Regardless, the long-winded staircase would eventually lead to the center point of the mansion-esque building. There were various rooms, some with captive citizens being restained and having their souls prodded with dark magic-- clearly by machinery. The other? Had the crook in the flesh. It was a 'Deathbringer', a type of Necromancer that specialized solely in utilizing blades and close combat.

Dozens of bodies were layered along the floor, drained of their life essence. In this particular instance, the room was glowing, as the villain's sword went to impale his thirteenth victim, no doubt draining the poor soul's spiritual essence, all to be used for his own purposes. For the time being, Avrian and Fujiko remained un-noticed, as the knight suggested they lean downward and hide along the walls.

The only reason visage of the scene could have been witnessed was due to the reflection on adjacent windows. 

At the sight. . .Avrian's hurt hung heavy, and his soul was thrown into rage. A faint vieling of golden energy had shrouded his figure, and began to become more potent. It was only due to the priestess's calming presence to the side that the oft emotional crusador could keep himself in partial check.* - Sat Dec 12 00:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) nodded along. As usual, proper wisdom had been provided. Just as Fujiko was, Avrian remained in a state of adrenaline, excited and both filled with trepidation as this was going to be their first real mission. . . outside of the Temple's guiding hand. 

"So a close-ranged fighter. . A deathbringer. My counterpart. . Fear not, I will show the villain that the darkness will forever pale in comparison to the light. . ."

The teen whispered. Quickly, he'd lift himself up and plow right through the glass door.  . .! "Your threat ends here. Surrender to the light, and your punishment will be less severe. . . Resisting will only make this worse than it needs to be." A single warning is issued. 

Already, Avrian's entire stancing shifted. He obtained a boxer-like formation, although it seemed a lot more graceful, fluid, and open for alternative methods of attacks. Like a lamp, golden energy already trickled from his soul, sprinkling upward like a crystallined dust. A fierce gaze befalls the swordsman who would dare bring harm to these poor souls..

All the same, the Necromancer seemed unconcerned, a toothy grin being sported. His yellow teeth, and jagged fangs being more reminiscient of beast, rather than men. The warrior sported dark skin, and a purple trench coat. Save for some pants, no actual clothes were worn. In addition, the swordsport held a purplish glimmer, as it consistenly oozed unholy energy.

With a twirl, the menace looked ahead, and yawns. "I don't think. . That'll be happening. I wonder. . How will my blade react to taking the souls of two priests? Would it reject it?" mused the fiend.

"I suppose then. . We just may have to find out!" the crusador retorted with vigor. Easily, his body blurs ahead, scaling along the pavement and dancing along the dead bodies that were lazily tossed onto the floor beforehand. It doesn't take much time at all for the gent to reach the target.

Showcasing marvelous taijutsu abilities, Avrian's fists blurred through the skies. Each movement took advantage of the entire body, subtly moving his shoulder and stepping ahead to add more mass and force to the blow. In three seconds, ten seperate strikes had been effectrively delivered, each one laced with holy energy to supplement.

And honestly? The Deathbringer could keep up. Repeatily, the sword slashes, repelling much of the offense, and given the katana's reach, Avrian was kept at bay. The two fierce warriors just kept clashing, only managing to score little blows here and there. 

Clearly. . the cruador is on the losing end, sadly enough. His body gradually is being laced with cuts, some potentially being effected by the toxic nature of the energy. Blood trickled on out, but the adrenaline carried Avrian further, beckoning the priest to continue his calling. * - Sat Dec 12 01:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ||
Indeed, this had been the opening he required. The golden arrow whizzed overh is shoulder, aiming to strike the Necromancer right on the shoulder! The range was too significant, however. No matter Avrian'sconsistent aggitation, the opposing force had been enabled to counter and thus slash away.

The light energy was reduced to sprinklings.

Taking advantage, the Holy Knight pushes forward, sending a single punch!

And you guessed it, it was wrap thoroughly in his own chi, giving a glowing, translucent illumination over the area. As it clashes, the energy tethers itself onto Fujiko's flesh, before a white light overwhelms the entity and combusts. The concussive damage works double time, given the beast's chaotic nature.

As ti explodes, blood floods out, and with a sizeable hole along the Necromancer'sframe, he begins to bled to death. Tired, and fairly injured himself, Avrian limps over to the priestess, a grimace evident upon his features. "Gah. . That was. . a pain. But we managed to get him. . Let us free these people and move to return to a ba--" Cue grunts, cutting cut up by a sword was no fun..

"Oi. . Let's hurry."* - Sat Dec 12 02:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: Good job. - Sat Dec 12 02:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ||
It doesn't take long. The duo moves along the base, freeing those that had been trapped, and even providing some spiritual relief. In the end, however, the long day of work had been completed. Avrian moves along with Fujiko and heads over to the kage for the mission completion.* - Sat Dec 12 02:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: You were amazing back there. - Sat Dec 12 03:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) came back, covered in cuts.

He falls to a single knee, panting profusely. "Oi. . Thank you, m'lady. I am simply glad that that you were unharmed. . "* - Sat Dec 12 03:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: Oh right. - Sat Dec 12 03:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: Bryson can you heal Avrian. - Sat Dec 12 03:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Sure - Sat Dec 12 03:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) looked on with a warm smile.

The healing energies flushed over his form, replenishing his cut flesh. Eventually, the wounds sustained are washed away, leaving Avrian at tip-top conditioning.

"Ah. . Thank you, Sir Bryson."* - Sat Dec 12 03:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) raises a brow.

The young crusader gives a glance over to Chikyu. "Hrm. .?"* - Sat Dec 12 07:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) ignores the temptation of the devil.* - Sat Dec 12 07:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: Hey Chikyu. - Sat Dec 12 07:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) yawns. It was early in the morning, the sudden outburst by Chikyu was concerning. . . Yet the warrior didn't want to impose. Still, curious, Avrian steps forward, keeping his distance.

Considering his two allies had been slumbering, the Crsuader figured 'Why not?'

". . Is there a problem, miss?"* - Sat Dec 12 07:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I love you bestie.~ Lets go and spar. - Sat Dec 12 07:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) shrugged. 

He moves back to his pole and leans against it. His mind wanders back into the skies. "Mmm. . What am I going to do?" He murmurs to himself, going over today's daily regiment.* - Sat Dec 12 07:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: ...Hmph!... - Sat Dec 12 07:30:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) passively looked on.

It wasn't his place to interfer with the affairs of shinobi business. He'd remain silent, allowing Chikyu to exit the area before addressing Kinami.

"What was that all about. . ?"* - Sat Dec 12 08:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) scratches his head.

He had merely come here to find a suitable location to exercise his hand to hand combat -- what had been witnessed was certainly unexpected. Despite the violence, Avrian remained skeptical. . . It wasn't his place to enter in shinobi affairs, was it?

"Ahem. . . It would be wise to let the young lady go. I don't think she finds this amusing," he quietly chimes, before falling silent. * - Sat Dec 12 08:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) exhales.

"You both remain comrades. It is best that you all iron out issues to avoid future conflictions.'

He speaks simply, trying to give some advice.* - Sat Dec 12 08:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I really need work on my ability to move around the battle field - Sat Dec 12 23:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Avrian(Gtgoku99) would have followed Fujiko towards the training field, obviously. He was her protector, and wasn't exactly keen on allowing her to move along this shinobi village un-supervised. Once in the proper area, he looks, examining all of the training devices that had been left lingering. Most were of wooden nature, thus being perfect obstacles or tools to aid in the development of his body.

"I will leave you to work on your bow. I trust you'll gain much from the endeavor. ."Avrian stated gently. He wastes little time, moving to the west, where a punching bag could be exploited.

Avrian was swift to enter a battle stancing of his own. It was a fcomplex, yet fearsome formation that he had began to develop within the Tenryujotei temple -- In many ways, the idea for the stance mirrored that of the Hokuma. Yet while the Hokuma clan utilized their precise chakra for internal strikes, Avrian's hypothetical battle formation would be intent on attacking externally, much like his God Cross techniques.

Having wasted enough time, the Holy Crusader performs a few light stretching exercises, to firmly get the muscle fibers in primedcondition. In no time, the male was practicing his punches, first working with generic, straight forward jabs -- light in power, yet speedy all the same. Each time, there was a level of focus, as his body subtly moved with in unison with the blows, to addo nto the momentum and general force. 

Boom! Boom! Boom! Bang! Bang! Bang! 

Despite Avrian's inexperience, the strikes performed were hefty, and forced the wooden 'dummy' to chip off, wood splintering onto the ground. Repetitively, the same, tired old strikes were slung ahead. It was a mind numbing process, but the priest was adamant on retaining focus, as he'd never really progress unless his mind was keened on determining just what was being wrong -- and searching for ways to improve on the striking finesse.

Naturally, the blows were being switched up as well. No just simple jabs, but uppercuts, elbows, and even knees were added to the equation. The plethora of physical strikes often held particular angles, or methods to obtain added torque. Needless to say, the wooden dummy that once existed was slowing be pounded into a different form, a different shape even as the 'Wrath of God' kept on being delivered without mercy. 

Those with keen perception would naturally be enabled to take notice of a golden vieling of energy that hung onto Avrian's flesh like a parasite. The sensation of it was warming, pleasant, and placed the soul at ease for sure -- as light magic was commonly known to do. But sadly, his control with the chi was less than adequate, and thus didn't quite work as intended. Rather than combusting to enhance physical strikes, the energy meekly fizzled off, leaving very minor burns along the wood whenever that substance was being torn asunder.

For the next half hour, Avrian was mindlessly working with the endeavor. But at last, he takes a break, and turns to eye the beloved priestesss. 

Whizzz!

In came an arrow, that missed the mark by quite a bit. "Close! You simply need to focus harder, M'lady. . . I know you can do it." The lad announces, hoping that the word of encouragement would be enough of a motivator to aid in the woman's quest.* - Sat Dec 12 23:51:24 2015

For a few moments, Avrian resumed with his tireless training. To be complacent would be a sin -- or a disservice even, not only to the Tenryujotei, but to his partner as well.  He's turning, repeatily working on the form and getting the needed muscle memory to push his body into getting used to the certain method of combats.

And as usual, Avrian was naturally adept in performing such. His mind was a unique thing, able to read and perceive the issues almost immediately. It commited more information to memory, absorbing all the attributes like a sponge, and thus better enabling the young priest to develop and improve his skill. Naturally, with the repeated motions, the rear and tear began to effect the muscles, building up the muscle's fast-twitch fibers.

His arms blurred through the atmsophere, again moving so fast that some people may find it hard to perceive. The strength behind the physical blows were true as well, each one leaving deep depressions along the wooden strucuture and burn marks, as the heat from his light chi was enough to force some thermal melt down. Sadly, none was quite adequate enough, leaving Avrian's battle stance continously in the fledgeling stages.

Couple the training regiment with Sunagakure's temperatures, and Avrian was being left a sweatied mess. He turns, once more opting to take his break period observing the priest as she worked moreso on her marksmen ability. It was a pleasing sight, and often made the knight wonder -- had Fujiko even gone as far as to surpass him at last?* - Sun Dec 13 00:50:17 2015

He takes a seat, huffing and puffing while observing the exchange.
