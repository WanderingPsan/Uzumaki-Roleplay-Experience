<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) had to deal with the consequences of having one arm temporarily disabled. His left arm reaches for the Wakizashi behind his waist, said hand was not used to wielding the blade in such a manner. Electricity spans the length of the blade, a faint glimmer of azure clasping onto the metallic surface. It was ironic, Kojiro was devoted to Taijutsu which was subpar, but the Raiton element came naturally to him, almost as if he had a natural disposition that could harness the unruly element to it's maximum potential.

<Hmmm...>

The Yamanshi male makes sweeping motions with the shaft. His sword-swing was unrefined, and it was obvious that he needed to train with it more.

Lightning chakra flows around the base- assuming his aim is correct he attempts to flick the projectile towards the side of Maloth's shin. It was too risky hitting anywhere else, he didn't want to hit his brother and cause collateral.

"I said stop!"
If this was anyone else it would most likely injure, or perhaps even scratch them. But the behemoth known as Maloth, the man who created shockwaves with his fist alone would not feel pain. Perhaps it would be enough to get his attention.

Regardless he makes his way eastward, intent on getting the man to release him.* - Thu Oct  8 19:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) looked at the injured appendage swathed in bandages. His brows furrowed, he hadn't really focused much on the compound fracture. Especially since most days he took a healthy dose of morphine. "Yeah, little guy ... It does..." Perhaps only those who knew him would notice this, but his voice drops an octave.. 

<I feel....>

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) reaches for his Wakizashi, the hilt was held tightly, long enough for his hand to feel the sting of exertion building in his forearm. Beads of sweat decline his brow - his concentration seemed to be on the blade, itself and the lightning that began to spark along the metallic sheen.

However, that couldn't be farther from the case. Despite the man,s exuberance, his feigned idiocy, he was fairly intelligent, more than he would ever let on. "What have I done to get here?" The buzzsaw clutched tightly between his digits hum's, it's essence eventually fading into the ambience of Kumogakure.

Birds flying above the horizon with their elegant wings; villagers going back and forth to wherever, everything seemed to follow an algorithm, so artificial. Much like Hideki his own father was killed, but that was the product of being a shinobi.

The blade he wore on his back was a keepsake, it was the same blade that his father used during his career as a shinobi. He was born with the tenacity of lightning, and was always calm, he always persevered, but now?

Just like everything else he had come to truly know, dead.

Silence.

"Nah, I got this..." There wasn't much stopping him from doing this, he saw this gesture as a way to get what he wanted and if he got it, so be it. Soon, his boxers went with it, and they were hoisted over his head. Fecal matter tinged with urine saturated his hair, and smeared into his scalp.

"Oh god..." The sound of him releasing his lunch echo's through the fabric and he falls to his knees. <Is that corn?>

He holds an outstretched hand, blindly attempting to obtain the cloak.* - Thu Oct  8 23:34:24 2015
