<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) extends his fist for Sogeki to bump, the brief exchange sparking fire in his otherwise listless gaze. He smiles for once, he knew the fate of Kumogakure and knew they would endure no matter the odds - It was their land so they had the advantage.

"If they kill a single Kumogakure shinobi, I want them to be dealt with, and I know you are capable of doing that, all of my shinobi are. We are here ...For our final stand, this is war, but this is no means the end."* - Tue Dec  8 08:15:47 2015

Though, Eiyu wasn't going to go down so easily, nor would he allow his comrades to go down either. He takes a step forward - his elegant robes descending from his shoulders. He leans close to his fellow men and smiles.

"I will show these men and women I am nothing like the Yondaime. You will not fight alone, I will join you, so too will our men. For we are brothers, and we lived together like brothers, we will survive as brothers or dies a brothers. From this day on we are bloodkin."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) mouth nearly fall's agape at the mention of that amount of currency. It was seemingly unreal to even have fathomed, such a vast portion of funds would surely help Kumogakure build it's offensive capabilities, but such a thing would not go without it's own consequences, for one Eiyu was not going to be selfish, he simply took what he needed which was still a decent amount of money that he felt bad about asking for - but he was glad for the Uchiha offering such.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) The only traps that were found were the one's that spawned detonations across the ground. Furthermore, the act of their shinobi working internally was null for the simple fact there were riots just moments ago and shinobi attempting to do away with them as had been stated previously. So it was a a bit far fetched to assume they would have pin-point accuracy furthermore, upon the detection of their troops the very skies darken as a armanda soars above the clouds, much like the Sunagakure shinobi had done, it seemed they were ready. 

In addition, the shinobi of Kumogakure had posted on the cardinal directions , forming north south east and west respectively - Earth tearing palm was used on the rocky terrain to crush any attempts to advance. 

It seems they were not the only ones preparing, and thus when all was said and done Eiyu forms a series of handseals after drawing the blood he needed to.

The smoldering combination bubbles over into a rendition of firery death.

Though at the same time the shinobi organized at the cardinal points which had taken sentry due to high alert amass to form an L formaing which acutally avoided cross-fire. 

The west flank from south respectively all opened this time with a timed rendition of tearing palm combined to level the floor below. While at the same time the birds relealse their payloads sending off another volley of explosive material to the shinobi.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) || Well, any and all attempts to dig in would be met with difficullty for several reasons. They were being constantly attacked and did nothing to ward off their flanks, and yes, it was fair to assume that the clay missles did damage, but now the frontlines task was having the sensors detect it's location, and once one was found a storm of lightning is emitted branching from various angles - and if he was too high up to be reached conventionally then how they hell would he pick out targets accurately and direct them to begin with.

Secondly their attempts to restrict their movements would prove to be a fools folly. Ironically, they'd continue to fire off from their flanks - using whatever means possible to stifle their progress though, the mixture this time was a combination of mud river and fire ball combinations. Whih would you defend? 

Lastly, in the end for this final attack Eiyu motions for one last volley to fall to ensure that the troops there were reminded of what they were dealing with, and yet the balls tumble into their depths and they were once again met with attacks from all sides - would they ignore this too,?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) extends a hand - said digits coils around the base of the scroll and promptly descends into his waist band. When this was all said and done he'd nod respectfully in Menmas direction. Even though Eiyu was the commanding officer of Kumogakure didn't mean he was going to be indifferent towards his men, he cared for each of them, and would do what he could to see them improve.

His eyes flash towards the battlefront, a knot building in his chest, but not out of nervousness, but rather anticipation for what was to become a most interesting development.* - Tue Dec  8 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I will be training. - Tue Dec  8 21:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) continues to wind together a series of handsigns. When all was said and done Eiyu's fingers rapidly contort to adjust to what was to come next. Blood is drawn from his index finger, and after it was strewn across the ground he places his palm against the dirt conjuring the massive beast from within and summoning to the plane of the living.

"Welcome, Mr.Gamaken."* - Tue Dec  8 21:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Are you up for a quick round? - Wed Dec  9 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I could do that. - Wed Dec  9 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Whenever you're ready. - Wed Dec  9 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The first move is yours. - Wed Dec  9 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: --- - Wed Dec  9 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Oh, it's a spar. - Wed Dec  9 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Hm.> Eiyu was able to read his opponent's moves carefully. Menma was fast, and his blade work was finely tuned towards attacking. Though this was not to say Eiyu would be left defenseless against his charge. <There's no way I'm going to be able to manage this in a close ranged battle.> The blade soars across horizontally barely missing it's mark on his abdomen - and really the only reason he had missed was due to the distance he needed to travel in order to get the initial strike.

Eiyu attempts to get distance.

<He's pretty strong.> Knowing full well his opponent would take advantage of a drawn out sequence of handsigns Eiyu devises a simple plan, to use the surrounding Earth, and turn it into mud in the attempt to wash Menma away, or at least impede his progress of advancing.

* - Wed Dec  9 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Hm.> So it seemed Memna wasn't going to be stopped there, and it was obvious at this point he wasn't dealing with just any shinobi. <Can't afford to be lax.> He flies backwards - though extends his right hand towards the ground as a means to slow his momentum - or so that is the impression he wished to give. 

Suddenly, spikes of Earth strike from the Uchiha's from the east, west, and north respectively, though the spears were blunt, and would only smash into him, not impale if he had even hit his mark. 

* - Wed Dec  9 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Damn.> Eiyu knew that he was dealing with a bonifide bad-ass who's strength probabaly surpassed his own. <Hm...> With one swing of his blade there was no telling how quickly this battle would end. Eiyau wouldn't be given much time to react and he knew this.

Eiyu displayed a decent knowledge of Ninjutsu, but now things were going to get interesting.

"Nani..."

He was making his way to him, and in the next moment this battle could very well be over.

<My ace.>

He reaches for a scroll on his right hand before vaulting in the air - the parchment unfurls in mid -air the next thing the Uchiha would see is the imprint of a Lotus flower - and then it came suddenly. 

Dozeans of projectiles striking - though not hitting him directly, this served as a means to constrict his movement as he aimed to also lead these attacks in front of the male and of course the transparent strings were attatched which he attempted to try and die his opponent with.

He intentionally avoided striking him with the projectiles himself, but at this rate he wouldn't be surprised  if he could knock them out of the skies.* - Wed Dec  9 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Damn...> There was only idea that Eiyu had in mind - and he was unsure if it would work or not. Leaping into the air had it's disadvantages for several reasons - you were left open. With no way to evade one would find themselves in a sticky situation. But that was just it, tradtionally, he couldn't evade and would find himself defeated right then and there - unless he made a last second move.

The scrolls were dropped entirelty interupting the full sequence of projectiles, as he see's the ball of lightning home on his position he forms a handsign, and a plum of smoke arises from the smoke - the figure who looked exactly like him reaches for his other half and flings him to the side if it was possible within the time constraints, but without no other wat for the clone to evade it is promptly destroyed. 

<Hnghnh..> Chakra was not an issue with the Minatabi, his reserves were great, but he would still looked fatigued.

<Using Shadow Clone always drains me so much.." It was an issue of stamina. While he descends his foot-stafe across the ground. ".."* - Wed Dec  9 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) wasn't able to fight two of these men at once, and he knew that Shadow clone boasted numerous tactical advantages, but it was for this reason he decided to escape.

He bactracks yet again, his form descends into the ground entirely.

<Too many... >* - Wed Dec  9 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <My opponent is very smart.> Menma was doing well to counter his attacks - and dishing out attacks that had nearly landed the Raikage a trip to the hospital. He wasn't dealing with your run of the mill-swordsman, this Uchiha was the real deal, and as such Eiyu was going to give it his all - even if his arsenal was less than impressive.

He surfaces from the ground, taking careful note of the man clone combo.

"Ive gotten the distance I needed." He throws a pellet on the ground. 

"What will you do now?"

His hands converge chest-level - chakra floods his system.
* - Wed Dec  9 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) is able to evade the first blast easy enough, but not the second. The other lightning bolt smashes into him and is able to render him defenseless for the time being as lightning did well to lock up his muscles.

This was his loss.* - Wed Dec  9 02:16:57 2015

There had been so much fighting over the past few months and it was all over the basis of sovereignty. But now it was requested that they converse with one another to sort ouf the kinks, if only such an action was done before it came to war. The men and women of Kumogakure looked at their esteemed leader - their mouths fell agape as he spoke of accepting these peace talks. Sunagakure was a super power in it's own right, and many peoplae were outraged that he would do such a thing as he could very well perish by their hand.

He addresses the masses before leaving. "I say to you now. Do not fear, Kumogakure for even if I perish, I go in good faith that you will not falter. For we are unified, one may fall but another will rise in it's place. So, the Raikage of Kumogakure abides a place of neutrality is proposed.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) truly desired to see an end to the conflict. Though, he was likewise just as capable as sending a medium to speak to Sanoke. They were like minded in that regard that their trust for one another had been strained. "I will never understand your reasons for putting us in a bad position like that. I wanted nothing more than for the parties involved to comply, but instead I was met with harsh resistance - People died that shouldn't have on both sides, and I apologize as well that we could not dicuss things in a civil manner before coming to blows."

Eiyu glances at the treaty. It looked good, he would supply them with their argicultural goods, and in return he would get metal from their mines. Eiyu signs the treaty as long as it states they are entirely independent, and if so this agreement would be set in stone.

In addition, there is a giant wall covering the circumference. In addition, funds are poured into the sensory division in order to get sensors proactive in the villages protection much like a barrier of sorts that'd simply detect movement in and out.

Whether or not the deal was made with you, a deal was made at Takuma's expense. The fixing of his arm for the prisoners we have.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) wasn't entirely happy for the deal simply because of what it meant. But really, if those were to be consumed were the scum of the Earth it shouldn't have mattered in which manner they went, and it did boast advantages.

Though, Eiyu's prime concern is that it could evolve into just misdemeanor offenses which wouldve been too far for his liking. He pauses - obviously taking the time to consider his options.

She did heal Takuma's shoulder, but she owed him that much. That is what the Minatabi firmly believed, but he rescinds his refusal opting that with this - perhaps there would be a reduction in crime.

Dying in a grusome manner was a decent way to deter would be manslayers.

"Your request is granted for prisoners who are to be executed only."* - Wed Dec  9 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||So Yuriko would have the prisoners she desired, he wondered what would become of them. Their bones snapping like twigs in her maw - . <Nope.> He forces himself to think on other matters. 

Though, he quirks his brow in the females direction. "I really hope that Nickname doesn't stick. I've been looking for someting fierce..." 

While Eiyu continues to mull over the thought of several monikers he couldn't help but feel a tinge of sadness. <I'm going to have to deal with Konohagakure at somepoint, they are going to be trouble in the future. Perhaps I should've just listened to Eiji and wiped Rias off the face of the planet, but no, that is not the way we do things in Kumogakure. We are defenders.> 

Of course such thoughts would be unknown to Yuriko, and Sogeki.

The Raikage had much on his mind, and much to figure out.
"Eiyu-Sama has a nice ring to it." He begins to tread westward-  after-all he was feeling somewhat flustered after their conversation.

"I'm going to go train in the meantime, and work on some plans for the village."

* - Wed Dec  9 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) pauses. This stems from the fear of losing a hand, or leg. But perhaps there was something else that made the Raikage anxious, for whatever reason Eiyu's flaws showed when he was in a casual setting. On the warfront he was a different person - he lead with an iron fist and was confident with his abilities and his men

But outside of conflict? 

His right foot stirs, the rock beneath his feet is kicking over sending small plums of dust over his ankles. 

"Wait, you'll say Eiyu-Sama?" He reconsiders a snicker warping the ends of his narrow lips. 
"Well..." He hesitates again, at this point his constant postering might've seemed out of place. It was obvious he didn't know what to do with her suggestion.

"But what would we do?"* - Wed Dec  9 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) starts to tense up at the slightest hint of contact. Her hand intertwines and he sways with her momentum, or to be more precise he is rocking with her. Following the rhythm. Then out of nowhere his senses seem to open up to the outside world. 

For a split second he is focusing on Yuriko's appearance. For example her heterochormic eyes which was something he had never seen before. Or her which was divided in halves by pink and brown. The dress that seemed to glide from her body to her fine jewelry.

"........." He is frozen. Entranced. Baffled. 

He attempts to pry himself free and bolt out of the immedate vicinity.* - Wed Dec  9 07:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <I really need to work on my agility.. This isn't helping me at all...> Eiyu finds himself caught between a rock and a hard-place, literally. Yuriko was curious, and inquisitive like that of all humans, but he had been told by Sogeki of her demeanor. 

That she was innocent, naive. It would be impossible for someone like her to understand the weight of his problems. <It wasn't obvious...?> 

He clears his throat.
"I don't expect for you to understand my story is a complicated one..." * - Wed Dec  9 08:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It makes me anxious. - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Brings back bad memories. - Wed Dec  9 08:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: She was a fr- ..Hm? - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) couldnt believe what he was hearing for several reasons. For one, Eiyu held the lifeless corpse of his beloved in his arms after she had been decimated. He -saw- the smoke rise from her charred corpse, and caught the aroma of burnt flesh. The last words given before her existence became as meaningless as the ground beneath his feet. 

He had become a shinobi for her.
Built Kumogakure from the ground up for her, all because of her dying wish that played in his memory over and over again.

<Live on.. Love on..> "You have no right to say anything like that." Eiyu responds with a pained voice. "You have no idea what you're saying!" His voice rises for the first time in a long while.* - Wed Dec  9 08:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) adorns a solemn expression as he does his best to push her out of his mind. "Don't.." He raises his right hand in the air so as to express his mood. "Let's change the subject.." <Do you like what I've done, Red? You would be pleased... It's been two years since I've visited your grave-stone.. I'm sorry, but I know it was your wish for me to forget about you but I think I'll stop by one more time..>

This is where Eiyu found himself doing something unexpected. "Thank you...." It was a comment sure to confuse the female, but it meant the world to the Minatabi, perhaps this was in a way reminding him to never forget the fallen, especially if you cherished them, and yes she did have a place in his heart, and would for eternity. 

But he could no longer live in a dream world where he saw her living on. This was reality, an unforgiving hell hole of discontent. Still, he manages to project a facade of hapiness. "Sorry, I just got really worked up, you know?" He scratches the back of his head, a habit he hadn't dropped ever since coming into contact with Suipaku.* - Wed Dec  9 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) watched her carefully. "What's wrong?" Whatever was going on didn't seem natural. Precautions were taken in order to decrease the chance of him being attacked. He could feel her aura and he became clouded by darkness which contrasted his warm one.

<I should stop being such a coward. I mean... I fought Sunagakure and survived, no -we- fought him and survived. We restored Kumogakure to it's rightful place as an independent nation and now.>

Eiyu walks forward, clearly out of his comfort zone. <This was a long time coming.> He reaches for her wrist and then draws her inward - both of his arm wrap around her body.

Provided she allowed it he'd be hugging her tightly. Even if she was crazy, and harboring this demented persona - and quite possibly a harbinger of death Eiyu was finding himself weak and needing to connect with someone on even the most basic level, and a hug would provide him with such.* - Wed Dec  9 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The first thing Eiyu notices is that Yuriko's skin is very soft- though he had been in physical contact with her many times before so he knew exactly what to anticipate. It confused him how someone so powerful - yet so unstable could have traits such as these.

Whats more she even had a human side - or at least a glimmer of humanity that lay dormant within a complex, and imposing woman. To say he wasn't captivated by her would be a lie - but he also knew better and knew that he was letting his mind to go supplement the condition of heart.

<No, what am I doing..> The embrace is held for several moments - his hand loops around her waist enabling him to pick her a few inches off the ground, another thing he had done with Suipaku. 

The root of this behavor would be painfully obvious if anyone who stuck with Eiyu from the start, but no-one really paid attention to him like that. The dislosing of information about someone he tried to sweep under the rug, his affinities for hugs and lifting the person off the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"I didn't know you cared... I am seeing a side of you I haven't seen before... I am starting to think you're beyond dangerous, and it just ins't because of the power you have." His arms no longer were clutching her body so. He eases away, and then heads into the distance - his destination is unknown.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Paranoia was strong in this one - Eiyu came with the intentions to speak to the Mizukage to get a gist of the situation, and he refused to use an interim out of fear that she would think his visit wasn't authentic. So he decides to wander into the hornets nest with no protection, though, he wouldn't use the front door. 

For whatever reason the guards gave him a weird vibe. He arrives in Kirigakure soaked to the bone. Though, despite this he seems to otherwise unharmed.

"Hello." He nods respectfully.
