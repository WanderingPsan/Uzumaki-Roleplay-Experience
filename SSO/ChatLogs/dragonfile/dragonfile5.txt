<br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) nails his hands together and seeks to halt his chakra flow entirely. Once this was done he'd let his chakra rise with the ram seal serving as the medium. Veins tensed from the side of his brow, and his jaw-line clenched tightly it was one thing dealing with low-level Genjutsu to break this, however higher level Genjutsu took more skill. The process of identifying a Genjutsu, and then using said knowledge to break the illusion was a skill that shinobi needed to know. 

However, Hirusho knew that nothing in this world was absolute. The factor that determiend whether or not he could see through Genjutsu required his knowledge as a shinobi and his opponents flaws, ironically the use of the Sharingan allowed him to penetrate through illusions to a degree, that being realizing what was present and taking the time to break the Genjutsu. Ironically, however this also allowed him to improve the strength of his own Genjutsu. It took a lot of skill and determination by his part but it's usage was starting to become easier, and the fundamentals he had mastered were evolving into more advanced forms of illusionary based attacks.

Ushinawa clasps his hands together once more, the handsigns taking shape of the Ram. The condensed chakra ceased it's movement momentarily only to kick-start yet again into a maelstrom of raging chakra. His chakra level was vast for someone of his ilk, but it was nothing special. Veins tense across the entirety of his body as his chakra reacts to the surge in energy output. "Kai!" He'd scream.* - Tue Sep 15 14:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) || It would be obvious to the casual onlooker that he was in his own world of his own conjurations. The difficulty of this technique wasn't really anything to shoot at but it was still an important ability that could not be underestimated. The process of breaking the illusions an opponent could dish towards your mental state was truly something that had to be taken into consideration eachtime you fought. Ushinawa was no fool as to neglect this part of the ninja art, however he also understood it was important to focus on other things. More energy rushed to the fray as he halted his chakra flow only to kick it into gear once more.* - Tue Sep 15 14:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) slammed his hands together establishing a link through his body. The ram seal served as a medium to halt his chakra flow, then, inversly by changing the consistency of it's momentum he is able to draw it to the surface yet again. The process of doing this over and over might have seemed a tad bit redundant but it was the only way he was going to be able to truly master this technique. Still, it was beyond imperfect as this rate and he knew he would need to continue this training regiment if he was to improve anytime soon.* - Tue Sep 15 15:05:10 2015

They could very well be attacked at any second but he was forced in trying to master this technique. <I've still got to try...> He thought to himself as he brought his hands together and sought to break the bindings of his ceasing of chakra only to cause it to rise tenfold once more.* - Tue Sep 15 15:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) clasps his hands together once more doing his best to end the chakra flow in his core. When his system was calm the culmination o his efforts began to bristle to the surface, a wave of chakra drives through his body and roars inside of his being. The result? It was to help erase the vestiges of Genjutsu as it were. When Hirusho was finished with this his hands fall at his sides.* - Tue Sep 15 15:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I am curious, Shin. - Tue Sep 15 15:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) makes his way south without another word. He cranes his head to the side and mutters something under his breath.* - Tue Sep 15 16:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Be careul of some of the people here, boy. - Tue Sep 15 16:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) nails his hands together channeling the chakra inside of his being and morphing it in a way that furthered the process of utilizing Kai. It wasnt as stressful as originally thought as the male was readily apt to producing more chakra as he was a powerhouse in that regard. Still, he had to admit it took a lot of devotion to keep this level of training up daily. Things like this were starting to become bothersome but if he didn't do this then he'd bite himself for not furthering himself later on. His prowess with Genjutsu was slowly growing and it was evident that he would only improve from here on out. He ceases the chakra flow through his form and kicks into high gear by channeling it deep within his core which was able to break Genjutsu should he be caught.* - Tue Sep 15 16:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Mariana, this is my sister. - Tue Sep 15 17:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 15 17:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) looked towards Mariana with his obsidian eyes fixated on her curves. Eventually he was able to snap himself out of it and focus on the task at hand. "So..." His right hand curles into a fist, his left leg drawn backwards while right leg shuffles forward. It was clear he wanted to test out her hand with Taijutsu but  he did wonder if she would even be open to the aspect of trying it.

"Perhaps a quick spar of Taijutsu is on order, then after that... Aiyana.. Perhaps you would like to try your hand, or both, actually..."* - Tue Sep 15 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: You two should spar. I'll just watch. - Tue Sep 15 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I was hoping the both of you would try.. - Tue Sep 15 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: . . .. - Tue Sep 15 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Why the animosity...? - Tue Sep 15 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We're all family... So to speak. - Tue Sep 15 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: It's obvious she doesn't like me. - Tue Sep 15 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That isn't true.. - Tue Sep 15 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: That's what you say. - Tue Sep 15 17:12:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at his sister casually, his eyes narrow slightly as if he was trying to read her facial features, hopefully through how she acted it would be a telltale sign of how she really felt. "I don't think this is the case.. But let me remind you what's on the outside.... Thousands of shinobi ready to fight, and if need be take our lives.... I would think you two would be more willing to improve yourselves considering we don't have any other options."* - Tue Sep 15 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was disappointed in both of them to say the least. Naturally, Ushinawa was a loner by trade but when it came to family, or the people he loved he found that he needed to get involved in every aspect of their lives. It was important the both of them were on good terms because this was essential to team-work. People who didn't get along well were subject to getting themselves killed when tough circumstances maniested themselves. 

The black haired male swept the curls of hair against his scalp before peering over them both with annoyance. "You are not intruding, but you're going to to partake in this, and that is final, and you shall have Mariana for support.* - Tue Sep 15 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) manifested (wtf)* - Tue Sep 15 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: .. - Tue Sep 15 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: How are we doing this? - Tue Sep 15 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "You will come at me with your fists and kicks.. Nothing else is allowed. No Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, or Kenjutsu is allowed. Weapons are not allowed either... This is to help you guys adjust to close-combat because believe or not it matters, if a Ninjutsu should prove to be less than effective you need to know what to do.... There is no other way but to do this, we are shinobi, and because of what we are we're going to have to do things we don't want... Eitherway, I'm not taking anymore time to talk... Let's begin..." 

His eyes scan the two evenly.
"Come."* - Tue Sep 15 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Wait.. - Tue Sep 15 17:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Every action should be backed up with another action. - Tue Sep 15 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Is all i got... - Tue Sep 15 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) takes advantage of the lapse in action. It was not acceptable, they couldn't simply stop, he wouldn't give them the time to plan anything out. His powerful legs accelerate him towards Mariana in a blink of an eye, in the next move his leg was soaring towards her shouler in the attempt to drive her into his sister with the momentum of the strike. Furthermore he was able to hear them speaking even though effort was given to hide it from him.* - Tue Sep 15 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: omit - Tue Sep 15 17:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Hm...> So it they werent going to be push-overs after all. The initial attack didn't do much to disway them in attacking so that was good. Even still, his sister had come with a timely counterattacked that surprised him, and even Mariana had thrown her hand in for good measure. However, as made blatantly obvious Ushinawas reflexes were also pristine, and not only that they seemed to have a heightened quality about them. When he fought them he didnt really look so much at their arms and legs, rather it was the torso. It was their center of movement and it allowed him to predict a strike's trajectory to an extent, though this also meant he needed the reflexes in order to anticpate which he did. The initial strike from Mariana missed it's mark due to Ushinawa quickly racing towards his siter's flank, obviously enabling him to eude her kick aimed or his chest..

With this he twisted on his left leg whilst dragging his right to the side with his shin inverted towards his sister in the attempt to land a roundhouse kick which would send her flying if it hit, inversly all he did was bend his attacking leg after the kick and attempt to shoot it towards Marianas other shoulder, hopefully propelling them both away from one another.* - Tue Sep 15 18:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) didn't enjoy what he was going to have to do next but he needed to teach them that their way of fighting simply didn't cut it. Ushinawa was upset with how they interacted with eachother, it was fine taking time to adjust to someones fighting style but they were bickering much too much for his liking. Perhaps they would've had the advantage to some degree spaced out like this but Ushinawa wasn't going to give them the time of day. 

He instantly takes off for his sister unleashing a number of high and low kicks towards her torso eventually finishing it off with a revolving kick to her head, though not enough to seriously injure her.

Still, his positioning allowed him to observe Mariana while he tried to take on his sister, still with his body in one place he couldn't be at the other.* - Tue Sep 15 18:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: brb - Tue Sep 15 19:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Hmmm...> Mariana was coming in fast and showed no intention of stopping. <Well, then....> Perhaps she thought utilizing her body in a tackle would prove to be something that was wise, but perhaps it was in a sense. Ushinawa had to deal with this pormptly, he-side steps her acceleration and reaches for her wrist as she is about to fall, if a grip is established he twirls around reaching for his sisters collar and then if all went as planned he'd throw them both forward, together. 

His strength was such that he could do that, however, this was only an attempt and he was not perfect. But it would be obvious that he was being careless now, and showing off in the attempt to annoy them.
"Terrible.."* - Tue Sep 15 19:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) fell for the intended leg sweep, indeed now things were starting to get interesting, he crosses his arms in-time to parry his sisters kick before jumping onto his feet. "Very good, I suppose thats what I get for underestimated the both of you.. I guess we're done here."* - Tue Sep 15 19:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You were able to work together. - Tue Sep 15 19:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Right. - Tue Sep 15 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) draws Mariana close before planting a kiss on her lips and tucking his finger into her waist-band before promptly letting it go and make a clapping sound against her skin. "Now you should get to know my sister better."* - Tue Sep 15 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm. - Tue Sep 15 20:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Because... - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I want to get to know my husband's sister. Duh. - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Husband? - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed. - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: We been married for years, and have our own little child.  - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Whose an NPC now. - Tue Sep 15 20:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: ^_________________^ - Tue Sep 15 20:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: I see.. - Tue Sep 15 20:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So you two should get along. - Tue Sep 15 20:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I grow tired of waiting... - Tue Sep 15 20:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: This war has been a long time coming. - Tue Sep 15 20:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whirls his hands together this time doing his best to concentrate on his inner-being. He deactivates the chakra flow coursing through his body in time to kick start it again. The culmination of the differeing energies giving birth to the Kai technique, he was noticing his mastery over said technique was increasing slowly but surely. It was only a matter of time before he would be able to call upon the full ability of the technique which would no doubt help him in breaking Genjutsu, but after he was done with this he'd turn to his family. "We should see how the others are doing."* - Tue Sep 15 20:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Who is this....? I don't recognize them at all. - Tue Sep 15 20:12:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Should probably master our jutsu. - Tue Sep 15 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Which one? - Tue Sep 15 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: ...Well, all of them. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I need to train my sister once she masters the one I gave her. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You've pretty much surpassed me in most aspects of Ninjutsu.. I suppose. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mmm. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I should go train as well. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mkay. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We should pick a more private location. - Tue Sep 15 20:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright, you two should do the training. - Tue Sep 15 20:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I should go to a far away location. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Because, I cannot use my technique around you guys. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's not always viable to be -so- far. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We will be far enough. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But if something happens its best one of us is close by. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Katsune was attacked by someone in a cloak. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Well there is a lot of those running around. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If they return you could be targeted, furthermore, they specialize in Genjutsu which both of you are weak against. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But this person knew what they were doing. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm not weak against Genjutsu. - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You sure about that? - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps I should show you something. - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Come. - Tue Sep 15 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sis, you too. - Tue Sep 15 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's time you see. - Tue Sep 15 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I hope all is well, child. - Tue Sep 15 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Face me, Mariana. - Tue Sep 15 20:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) closes his eyes momentarily, and when he opens them his Sharingan is revealed.* - Tue Sep 15 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I wanted to ask you. - Tue Sep 15 20:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: To fight me with your full strength. - Tue Sep 15 20:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 20:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Those eyes.. - Tue Sep 15 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: My birthright...that i am not worthy of. - Tue Sep 15 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) found his gaze into Mariana's eyes, but also he saw the conjuration of her powerful chakra building - he dashes forth accelerating with immense speed. <That takes a very heavy toll on your chakra...> He skids by avoiding the spread entirely. Now that he had repositioned himself he muttered.

"It's over."* - Tue Sep 15 20:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) the fire burned him entirely, nothing remained of UShinawa he seemed to have been consumed by the raging flames until........ What? "It's over..." He muttered again, he was simply glancing at her, she hadn't done anything since she created the plum of mist.* - Tue Sep 15 20:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Genjutsu... - Tue Sep 15 20:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: They are just staring at each other? - Tue Sep 15 20:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) upon Ushinawa breaking the Genjutsu it would be evident that nothing happened past the steam veil she produced which had already faded. The Fire dragon she attempted to unleash in his direction was never brought into creation, she was given the impression it had due to his Genjutsu, but aside from that nothing else happened. Ushi took the time to accelerate towards Mariana's side with an arm outstretched over his shoulder. 

"You've fallen victim to Genjutsu..."
The funny thing was there was no indication as to when she had been caught, only he knew how, at least for the time being.* - Tue Sep 15 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: :O - Tue Sep 15 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) looked at his sister, perhaps she would've been able to grasp a little due to their lineage. "Tell no-one of this.." Ushinawa knew that what he had just done might've proved to be shocking to his lover but it was needed, she had to know to stay on her toes and question everything. It was ironic because had Ushinawa been someone else he could've used the time she was stuck in that Genjutsu to end her life. "You see..-Wait, what?" He'd inquire to her statement about getting none. 

"Did you have to say that in-front my sister...?"
<It matters little... I will get it..."* - Tue Sep 15 21:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Now. - Tue Sep 15 21:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We should return. - Tue Sep 15 21:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Of course not Ushinawa. - Tue Sep 15 21:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Hm? - Tue Sep 15 21:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Nothing, we should return. - Tue Sep 15 21:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) grabs Mariana's wrist and accelerates at the speed of light.* - Tue Sep 15 21:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I don't know why, because we aren't going to do anything.  - Tue Sep 15 21:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: You better not have me on your control! - Tue Sep 15 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) extends his fingers forth allowing the digits to dance around her outer thigh if she allowed it. "I wouldn't do anything like that.."* - Tue Sep 15 21:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Let me just touch it.. - Tue Sep 15 21:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So you're going to let me have sex with you? - Tue Sep 15 21:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Go ahead. - Tue Sep 15 21:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hn, I don't think you're gonna let me.. - Tue Sep 15 21:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Yes, I am. - Tue Sep 15 21:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) extends both of his hands towards Mariana's inner-thigh. His hands slowly work their way into her folds if allowed - it was something to be felt even through her clothing. His hands were always warm and it was to entice her desire in him, index finger followed by thumb were gently rubbing against her clit, even now he knew exactly where it was positioned.

"Hmmm?"* - Tue Sep 15 21:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) started on her clothing with his agile fingers, they worked on the jumpsuit, slowly his fingers worked on the tongue of her zipper. Her neck was revealed with this action a nexus of branching veins and nerve endings which Ushinawa sought to stimulate. His tongue comes in hard against the side of her neck, he could taste the sweat from their previous activities against his tastebuds. "Hnn..." He'd mutter lightly before mounting her entirely, whilst he went through with this action he was already working on his shirt which he had tossed off leaving only his pants and what remained underneath.
"Take it off if you want it..."* - Tue Sep 15 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) did ignore her bra and panties it was something that caught his notice more than she realized. He also realized she was moist but knew better than to go there now. She did what was asked of her and undid his zipper causing his member to flop in-front of her face. His knees were firmly planted onto each side of the bed near where her shoulders would now rest as he tried to have Mariana lay on her back. 

Then he reached for the sides of her head while she pulled the crown back with her mouth, the crown was the first to enter, the initial entry was four inches in and already he could feel her saliva on his shaft, he'd continue to fill her mouth most likely causing her tongue to roll deeper into her mouth. The build up of her saliva and his bodily secretions created a thick, milky concoction that crept into the back of her throat and lubricated his cock..

But then she took it further by taking it out of her mouth and wedging it between her breasts, the closing of her skin upon the crown numbed his lower-body. He continued to plow the space between her bust, the lubrication of her spittle causing him to move in as easy as slik.* - Tue Sep 15 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) could feel her Mariana's mouth cross his shaft with her tongue, eventually taking in his full length, enough to gag her entirely. His balls were sucked, each respective nut now glistening with a mixture of sweat and spittle. It had created a thin layer of slime over the exterior of his body member making it feel as if it was slightly adhesive. He'd prod his head against the her back entrance, the hole leading into your ass spasms for many moments as he attempts to force his way in, eventually her contracting sphincter opens and he runs his length through her being. It was probably slightly painful because he made sure to enter every last inch of himself into her tight asshole. 

While in the same motion he reaches for both sides of her waist and pulls her in making it possible for her pink walls to struggle against his rod, to no avail he was going to reach her sweet spot, or prostate, the head immediately brushing against the oblong, walnut sized objects which was sure to force several involuntary orgasms through her body, but he did not just stop there. His speed continues to pick up, from once slow push and pull motions to downright plowing, the clap of his wast against her rear and his ball-sack loosely flapping against the impact made the bed rock loudly, he continues to pound her deep even while sweat accumulates across his entire body. 

He shudders momentarily, leaning inward against her ear and chewing on the lobe softly, he was ontop of her entirely at this point, now even allowing her to remain on her fours, she would have her stomach on the bed and that alone would keep her there while UShinawa continued to thrust his member into her insides with no intention of slowing down.* - Tue Sep 15 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) moved with the momentum of his lover, she demanded he slap her ass and he would do just that. His hands leave her waist and is soon coming in hot against her ass-cheeks. He slaps her hard as well, enough to leave a red imprint of his hand against her rump, he continues to batter her back side harshly while driving his length in and out, at this point with rapid intervals. He would not spare her by going gentle, he pounded her with so much force that the support frame for the bed squealed loudly. The gaps in which his shaft clogged her asshole left air pockets which gave off the impression she was farting when she really wasnt. 

"F-Fuck...." He'd state as his hands reached for her ass but the feeling of him inside made him clench her ass tightly, so tight that she'd be able to feel his nails bite into her skin. He continued with this action but not before weaing his arms around her shoulders. Now that he was a close as possible he'd grind his cock and reel it through her with added force. He was being rough with her ass about now but he was sure she would enjoy it, despite it most likely it coming out to be sore in a few hours..

"You're going to cum for me...." * - Tue Sep 15 22:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) |"Fuck, fuck, and fuck..." Ushinawa didn't understand why he was always on the brink of cumming with this Mariana so fast. Well, at least in his mind there was a sense of him being quick even though his stamina in bed was rather astute, the feeling of his bodily juices revolving in his balls and pushing his seed through the tip o his crown at high speed... It spews from his manly entrance and coats her insides with the rich white. 
"I"M CUMMING!"
The buildup of foam and all manner of bodily secretions were strewn onto the floor, and even though he came he wasn't going to stop until his lover came too, he wasn't even close to flaccid yet..
* - Tue Sep 15 23:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was left reeling as well, he crashed to the floor after feeling her with his shaft. He'd have to retreat to the bathroom promptly and blow the secretions of their mutual exchange away as it was simply so heavy for them. When he was all cleaned up he reached for her hand and intended to guide her outside. "Indeed."* - Tue Sep 15 23:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I just want peace, Ushi. And I feel as if Kirigakure is trying to do just that. - Wed Sep 16 00:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: It's a crumbling nation who hunted Doujutsu users like yourslef. - Wed Sep 16 00:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: When was this, how long ago? Who was the Mizukage at the time? - Wed Sep 16 00:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Recently. - Wed Sep 16 00:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Uh, Noriko... Or perhaps Tethys, it matters little... But how? - Wed Sep 16 00:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: The bridges are gone. - Wed Sep 16 00:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I'll send you a bird and tell you if things have changed. - Wed Sep 16 00:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Simple. - Wed Sep 16 00:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Water walking. - Wed Sep 16 00:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: You intend to walk over the entirety of Kirigakure's ocean? - Wed Sep 16 00:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: What of the mines? - Wed Sep 16 00:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Hmm. I'll use kawamiri, and if I step on a mine. I'll just substitute. - Wed Sep 16 00:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: You're really determined to die. - Wed Sep 16 00:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: ...What if there are others like us in Kirigakure no Sato? And we just don't know it? - Wed Sep 16 00:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: They are fools for accepting their fate. - Wed Sep 16 00:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I would've left Kirigakure a long time ago and planned their demise. - Wed Sep 16 00:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: ....So even people with the same eyes, as you and I have. You wouldn't go in there to save them? - Wed Sep 16 00:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I wouldnt risk my life to go into Kirigakure because it's suicide. - Wed Sep 16 00:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: How many people know of your Sharingan...Ushi. - Wed Sep 16 00:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: The fact that I would endanger myself in such a way when the outcome is so obvious- Kirigakure knows. - Wed Sep 16 00:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Then I can see your paranoia for going there. - Wed Sep 16 00:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: What purpose do we have staying with this group. What if Zetsumo knows of your eyes? - Wed Sep 16 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Hm, did my sister tell you I have the same Doujutsu as you? - Wed Sep 16 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: I don't have a doujutsu. - Wed Sep 16 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: The way she was concerned for when I activated it, I could only assume you have the same eyes. - Wed Sep 16 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: What is the name of that doujutsu? - Wed Sep 16 00:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I don't know if Ushi wants me to say it or not. - Wed Sep 16 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: It's fine. - Wed Sep 16 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Tell her. - Wed Sep 16 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Sharingan. - Wed Sep 16 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: It's called the Sharingan. - Wed Sep 16 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: But my question remains unanswered.. What if Zetsumo knows of your eyes? - Wed Sep 16 00:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: What will you do then? - Wed Sep 16 00:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: He cannot defeat me. - Wed Sep 16 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: How do you know this to be true. - Wed Sep 16 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Because my mastery of the Sharingan is on another level. - Wed Sep 16 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: - I'd like to know more. - Wed Sep 16 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I will tell you if you stay here. - Wed Sep 16 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: ...... This place makes me nervous, Ushi. - Wed Sep 16 00:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Hanabi already wants to kill me more than likely. - Wed Sep 16 00:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: She is weak. - Wed Sep 16 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I will not let her. - Wed Sep 16 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I found a weakness to her, I think. She wrapped me around with a white snake. I used my Raiton Flash and she dropped pretty fast. Including her snake that coiled around me. - Wed Sep 16 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I see. - Wed Sep 16 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: But she also produces a weird mucus. - Wed Sep 16 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: I don't know what it's used for. I asked Amai, and she said not to worry about it, but I'm still concerned on the subject. - Wed Sep 16 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Amai also told me that she can have snakes pop out of no where at times. So that's something to look out for. - Wed Sep 16 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: N- - Wed Sep 16 00:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Mariana, I wanted to speak to you in private for a second, Hideki I will get your problem in a second. - Wed Sep 16 00:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Alright. - Wed Sep 16 00:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Your fire technique.... - Wed Sep 16 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I wish to learn. - Wed Sep 16 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Can you teach me? - Wed Sep 16 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Oh.. of-course baby. - Wed Sep 16 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: But first.. - Wed Sep 16 01:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) nods towards his lover, a small smile evident on his face. "Thank you, Mariana, and I owe you..  I will give you something ten times as valuable in the future."* - Wed Sep 16 01:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) opened the scrolls and read the details from the parchment he was interested in how to manipulate your Katon affinity to such a high degree you were able to splay clouds. The conjurations of the allocation of energy created dismal conditions, one could create a storm of such with their innate ability of literally cooking the atmosphere..

 However, it was not only limited to this, one could also use this to cook their targets alive entirely, it was a high level technique one that Ushinawa knew would come in handy. It's strength could not be underestimated in the slightest and he was very thankful he was able to come across this form of information.

"Hm...."* - Wed Sep 16 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: This is... - Wed Sep 16 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Difficult... - Wed Sep 16 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 16 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: You'll get it baby. - Wed Sep 16 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You are very talented. - Wed Sep 16 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: To be able to harness such a jutus. - Wed Sep 16 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe. - Wed Sep 16 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) opened another chapter and scanned the information inside. The concept of condensing ones chakra to it's highest density and then releasing it into one defiant boom was something Ushinawa had worked on for a while. It started with the Great Fire-Ball technique and evolved into this. Now, his was simply another test - something else he could test his hand with, and yet he was sure that he would get the hang of it.

<I see...> There was a general idea he had to keep to, one being that you couldnt' waste all of your chakra attempting to do this technique, you need precise chakra control and while that is something Hirusho lacked, it was something that he'd certainly make up in the future.* - Wed Sep 16 01:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <I see...> Ushinawa thought to himself, it was finally time to test the extent of this jutsu. "So, what I've gathered from this is that the user must store all of their katon affinity inside of their chest and whirl it in a way that can be drawn throughout their body. Then, when the pressure has reached it's apex you are to parse your lips and expel all of the allocated flames onto one place. ...Hm..." 

Ushinawa clasps his hands together and forces the kneaded chakra in his chest to leap into his throat so that when he opens his mouth the forces that were living inside of his chest exploded into a frenzy of searing flames capable of ripping flesh off bone in mere seconds.* - Wed Sep 16 01:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...So no hand to hand combat with Dissida. Got it. - Wed Sep 16 01:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) punces Beth's nose into her cranium. (omit ofc)* - Wed Sep 16 02:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: ? - Wed Sep 16 02:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: all I know is - Wed Sep 16 02:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) stores the allocated chakra inside of his core, the culmination of his chakra and elemental affinity gave birth to a stronger force. He was able to form a ring around his lips and forces the condensed chakra through his maw, the shape of the flame being a Dragon, it's maw was capable of rending through foes at a moments notice. If one was hit with this and lacked the natural defenses to guard against it they'd simply be blown away with the wind...

Katon of this level was nothing to scoff at and his prowess in it's usage and intensity was surely profound. There was only one problem with using a technique like this and it was it's prolific amount of chakra drain even with his control he had difficulty using the jutsu to its full potential because of the difficulty,  he'd certainly need to improve in order to master this most advanced technique.* - Wed Sep 16 02:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) forms several seals in a period of second, and when he is done with this the morphing of his elemental affinity that lay within the foundation of Katon enabled him to venture into the more advanced side of his training. It was admittedly very difficult to balance the forces that be into a mixture that was capable of producing burns over one's entire body. It was even more difficult to keep using this form of intense, flame that really borrowed it's power from the user's own ability to create said flame. It demanded a lot of chakra and that was something Ushinawa didn't have, luckily for him however he did have a modicum of chakra control which helped him adjust properly.* - Wed Sep 16 02:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) formed a series of seals within a short period of time and worked on shaping the dragons maw inside of his gullet. He drew upon his knowledge and over-all ability with Katon to make this next bit come into fruition.. His chakra reserves had taken a big hit due to his continued efforts in trying to master the technique, it was indeed something that Hirusho had to be careful with attempting to master. If he used too much chakra he ran the risk of killing himself potentially and so he had to measure just how much chakra he was putting into his jutsu.* - Wed Sep 16 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: pay attention, Beth. - Wed Sep 16 03:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I need you to do sweep of all shinobi. - Wed Sep 16 03:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Understood? - Wed Sep 16 03:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: my nigga damn - Wed Sep 16 03:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Beth. I don't have all day. - Wed Sep 16 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Speak up, and pay attention. - Wed Sep 16 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: work and more work. - Wed Sep 16 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Yes sir. - Wed Sep 16 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) nails his hands together once more taking the time to condense his chakra into his core. The culmination of his elemental affinity and his chakra allowed him to shape the soon to be dragons maw from the ends of his lips. It was indeed difficult to create such intense flames but he was able to keep it up for extended periods of time, he simply needed to take his time and not over-exert himself from using the technique he learned too many times.* - Wed Sep 16 03:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . While training, I've run into Tethys. - Wed Sep 16 03:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I haven't done anything to apprehend the Kenryoku efforts. - Wed Sep 16 03:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: My loyalty is still with Zetsumo and the Kenryoku. - Wed Sep 16 03:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And the last question. After i've gotten rid of my alter-ego . . . No. - Wed Sep 16 03:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Tethys wanted me to join Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 16 03:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've of course declined. - Wed Sep 16 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He didn't attack me. He left. - Wed Sep 16 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Your Genjutsu will have no effect on me. - Wed Sep 16 03:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But I will tell you. - Wed Sep 16 03:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I collected my sister. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That is when I left the village. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: No effect. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Why is that? - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Because your Genjutsu is trivial. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That much is the truth. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh tht is true it is a weak technique - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I'll just have to creat something stronger for you. - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If you wish to use it. - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You may. - Wed Sep 16 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Even if my jutsu "wont work" Still need to do what I ordered to do. - Wed Sep 16 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Go ahead. - Wed Sep 16 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Why is she still asking about crushes....? - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: God damn, Beth. - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at Beth, his onyx gaze still radiatng their indifferent composure.  "I've been in contact with two people who aren't from this village, one being my sister, and the other being Nigen.. No, I have not done anything to impose upon
the operations of Kenryoku, and I have no desire to and, I have shown the same loyalty that has been shown to me.." He doesn't answer her last question intentially, he'd bring his arms upwards only to clasp  them together ceasing his chakra flow entirely, only to kick it into over-drive once more. "Kai."* - Wed Sep 16 03:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: My personal life on who are my love interests are none of your concern. - Wed Sep 16 03:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: For now you can keep the answer from me. - Wed Sep 16 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Hm. Not sure if I lied or not during the last question. - Wed Sep 16 03:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: *Vacj - Wed Sep 16 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Are you gonna ask me the same questions? - Wed Sep 16 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Such imprudence. - Wed Sep 16 03:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was annoyed with Beth's inquiry of Marianas personal life, he knew why they were doing it. Ushinawa was borderline unruly, he wasn't overtly disrespectful, nor did he create trouble, but there was one thing that he wasn't and that was submissive. He was tired of the constant talk of Beth venturing into the corners of his mind, although ironically he would have allowed it had it not been for one thing. 

Mariana, yes he was over-proective of her and Zetsumo most likely remembered the day they conflicted a bit. The males eyes changed their normal onyx composition, the iris churns into a vivid crimson while three tomoe border his center pupil. 

Just two words were uttered but so much emotion followed it'd be quite idiotic not to heed his tone.
"Move now..." He'd state as he glanced at the woman.* - Wed Sep 16 04:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd be mad too if she was asking me who I had a crush on. How does that help? - Wed Sep 16 04:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: . . .I don't recall asking for your opinion.. - Wed Sep 16 04:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Oh boy. - Wed Sep 16 04:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: She should've noticed that Ushinawa didn't want to say anything about his personal life. - Wed Sep 16 04:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Should've tried not to say anything about it. - Wed Sep 16 04:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: *give me ur blood - Wed Sep 16 04:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) knew that in that moment he could be controlled, it was an easy matter for not only Zetsumo to control him based on his love for her, but also Beth. He glances at the male threshing about with threads, his eyes shooting daggers at his own, he inches forward muttering under his breath before turning west. 

"I never break a deal but it is indeed obvious that you hold the advantage here... I do not wish to remain in this exact location where you can control every aspect of my being, it is about time I take my leave, but I will be close, on call for whatever you need."* - Wed Sep 16 04:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Well question is are they the incest type. - Wed Sep 16 04:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: That wouldbe a plot twist. - Wed Sep 16 04:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Beth. Your job here is done, I suppose. I'll have you screen the rest as they're awake. - Wed Sep 16 04:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Katsune is awake isn't she. - Wed Sep 16 04:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: I suppose, however. . .His weakness is a good thing. - Wed Sep 16 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: The emotional tie. . .It will ensure that he never has a prayer of a chance to catch me. - Wed Sep 16 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Screen me later? - Wed Sep 16 04:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Not you. - Wed Sep 16 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: <*Motions to Paine*> - Wed Sep 16 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Love. Sad how very sad to thinnk I didn't find our sooner. I have been useles sto you Zetsumo forgive me. - Wed Sep 16 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Shidd, I was fina do something.  - Wed Sep 16 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Then it was revealed, in his rage and angst UShinawa would not extend his hand towards Zetsumo in anyway shape of form, rather he would target Beth, and use her reaction against her while giving no clear indication as to what happened. Yes, he glanced into her eyes when he told her to move as to get her to watch her eye-line, with nothing more stated the Genjutsu took effect. If at all possible, she'd simply collapse, even with her ability to sense Genjutsu it had been cast on her instantly adding to the potency of the technique his already strong foundation in Genjutsu had been enhanced.

"Then you understand why I truly hate Kirigakure so... But it wasn't just them, Zetsumo-Sama.. It was practically the entire shinobi world...."* - Wed Sep 16 04:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: ^ - Wed Sep 16 04:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: So if u got kai mastered - Wed Sep 16 04:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 05:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) closes his eyes momentarily, when he opens them his Sharingan is gone entirely. Though, there is one thing about Katsune's observation that wouldn'y yield her results, one being is that she attempted to check for handseals after the fact, furthermore Beth's position was in a way where her body was more or less obscuring her from others.

"I shall abide.. I do request that you leave Mariana be.. I have no intentions to betray you or your people, I wish for Kirigakure to end the same as you."* - Wed Sep 16 05:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 05:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But no, I suppose you wanting to flip the world upside down is something they deserve. - Wed Sep 16 05:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: They butchered an entire people based on a trait. - Wed Sep 16 05:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Two types of people in fact. - Wed Sep 16 05:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: One they could never understand. - Wed Sep 16 05:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I am aware. - Wed Sep 16 05:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Only because they were genetically superior. - Wed Sep 16 05:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: There are lots more people with other genetic traits that aren't doujutsu. - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Why did the doujutsu users specifically got targetted when the others with other types of elements weren't? - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Ignorance. - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Wait. - Wed Sep 16 05:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Because. Genetics aren't as easily stolen. - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: As actual body parts. - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I still would like new jutsu to learn. I've mastered everything at the moment. - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: When I awaken. - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: The booty. . . - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Kekeke - Wed Sep 16 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even so . . . A good enough medic who knows what he's doing can steal genetics as well . . . Just give it time. - Wed Sep 16 05:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Humans are so quick to try and obtain what is not theirs. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But what you will never understand is... - Wed Sep 16 05:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No matter how many eyes you implant, or Dna you attempt to merge with. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You are who you are. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you around. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ushinawa. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Likewise, Kilm. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I suppose I'll have to watch my back from now on. - Wed Sep 16 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Beth's mind is a fortress... - Wed Sep 16 05:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: But my Sharingan could penetrate through even that...... Such power. - Wed Sep 16 05:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) chuckles.* - Wed Sep 16 05:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: In hindsight my actions were.... Untimely... Oh, well... - Wed Sep 16 05:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) brought his hands together and used the condensed chakra inside of his core to expand, the chakra inside of his being ascended to new heights as he did his best to maintain a steady flow through his core. It took a while for him to manipulate it correctly but he was starting to grasp the over-all premise of the technique. One thing about using Ninjutsu is that you had to worry about Chakra consumption which he did often, but thanks in part to his larger than average chakra pools he was able to release a rather decent amount of fire that took on the forms of a dragons maw, it pelted the skies and the high pressure system mixing with the body of flame caused a shower to descend, it was only brief, but it was certainly present.* - Wed Sep 16 11:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 16 11:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at Katsune, and then at Kilm. He folds his arms over his chest and speaks low. It was obvious they knew something was up due to the Beth incident but they most likely had no idea what happened, perhaps Beth didn't even realize what happened to her. He cared little if she was in good spirits or not, her probing the mind of Mariana to such a degree was unacceptable.
"Hello."* - Wed Sep 16 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hi. - Wed Sep 16 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Wed Sep 16 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Kilm, you may want to talk to Zetsumo on Katsune's behalf, she may or may not get in trouble for what happened earlier. I would speak to Zetsumo myself but I know he is disturbed by my presence - at least to a degree. - Wed Sep 16 11:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It seems quite quiet today - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm....? - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He means about the middle finger. - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why would I get in trouble? - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I wonder if the villages have submitted to Lord Zetsumo - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The villages have not submitted, and it is likely they will not. - Wed Sep 16 11:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure how to feel about this war. - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Unfortunate - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hopefully i will be efficient enough to join the battle soon - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The loss of life will be great. - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This is definitely going to be named something major. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure I mind that. There should be consequences for what these villages are doing. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Attacking Zetsumo for daring to retrieve his missing nin, after he gave Sunagakure a fair warning? - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know for a fact . . . If it comes down to it . . . Ushinawa will enjoy fighting against Kumogakure the most. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There's gotta be more to it than that. I feel like that's a front. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It wouldn't have to be so if they would only submit - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed, Kilm. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You have to realize. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We both know what happened there . . . Though i'll say nothing about that anymore. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Zetsumo is a figure. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: People fear him.. They respect him, or they hate him. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have more reason to hate Zetsumo than any of these villages combined. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What's the word I'm looking for . . . - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Their motives are self-righteous, I think. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm looking forward to the slaughter. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Better hope that it'll be slow. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not saying Zetsumo's okay or anything -- only that my conscience will be clear. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmmm - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Ah well - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Basically - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: If they are aware of the stakes - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Why not pacify him - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ushinawa. - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Zetsumo is a harbinger of chaos, if that is what is needed to bring Kirigakure to their knees.. So be it. - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If we have to fight Niza . . . Give me a second to ask him a question before you go off and try to kill him. - Wed Sep 16 11:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: At this point . . . I kinda see that fight coming. - Wed Sep 16 11:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Then what will you do? - Wed Sep 16 11:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: In-time it will be revealed. - Wed Sep 16 12:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Kilm - Wed Sep 16 12:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: This is much like a game of chess if you think about it... You move too early and you will find yourself countered, you reveal your hand, and you lose the advantage. You move too late, you won't be able to move at all. - Wed Sep 16 12:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: When are you gonna grow your hair back - Wed Sep 16 12:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Save Zetsumo. - Wed Sep 16 12:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Either way, He said he only wants to kill Zetsumo and no one else from the Kenryoku. - Wed Sep 16 12:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Zetsumo is us - Wed Sep 16 12:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He can't defeat him. - Wed Sep 16 12:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Na. Not all of us are tools. - Wed Sep 16 12:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Believe it or not, most of us do not exist without Zetsumo - Wed Sep 16 12:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If you wish to pin your existence on another man living, so be it. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I am not as naive as you. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You tell Zetsumo that you are not his tool - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo can use me all he wants but I don't work for free. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I 'really', 'really' didn't wanna be here.... - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wouldn't be here. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Same. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Why -do- you want to be here - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth is there are no better places from what I know. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Isn't this a bit high risk for a mercenary - Wed Sep 16 12:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And for the record I tell Zetsumo all of the time that I'm not his tool. - Wed Sep 16 12:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Very well - Wed Sep 16 12:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Indeed - Wed Sep 16 12:10:40 2015
