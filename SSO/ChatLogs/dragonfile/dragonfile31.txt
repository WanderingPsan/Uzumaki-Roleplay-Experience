<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) extends his arms upwards, the Sunagakure guards would pat him down, and upon inspection they'd notice he had several scrolls on his person. He held no weapons on the exterior ,but it was obvious by the Fuuinjutsu brand inscribed on the parchment that Fuuinjutsu had been used to seal a number of weapons into the scroll.
They resembled the Lotus flower.

But all of it was standard issue equipment for Kumogakure shinobi. 
"There are weapons in those scrolls.. You can take them, but I'd like them back when I leave, please."
He'd state to the guard.* - Tue Nov 17 19:36:19 2015

He looks Hassan in his eyes obivously measuring his stature, it had been the first time he had ever seen him, and he had certainly made a name for himself in recent years. 

One could say that the young male was starting to feel pangs of envy.
"I've come to discuss Kumogakure's status, as you know with the scrolls I have been sending that I was concerned. To put things bluntly, it's simply impossible for the village to go on without a head. It's true that your shinobi are occupying the place, but it leaves the occupants with little to do. The few shinobi that remain cannot do missions, and as such we're finding an increase in poverty, and other unfortunate events."

"I wanted to speak to you personally... But I think it's time a Raikage was picked, otherwise the place is just simply going to fall through, and it will end up being meaningless to protect."* - Tue Nov 17 19:57:39 2015

"I will repay you what I owe, Hassan-Sama.. When I have the means to do so."
<I can't fail.. I won't..>* - Tue Nov 17 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||For miles on end, a voice resonates across the entirety of Kumogakure. The voice is young, but collected which makes the message all the more profound.

"Citizens of Kumogakure.. Shinobi of Kumogakure.. Fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers... I have an announcement to make. My name is Minatabi, Eiyu, and I have something that I wish to say to all of you.. I know these past couple of months have been hell, and with Edge's attack we had nearly lost everything. Our shinobi forces were crippled, our Raikage ran out on us when we needed her the most. But I am here to tell you that it's not over.. It's never over.."

Pause.

"I promise you this.. I promise you that I will never run away when our village is in need.. Even if that means I must die, because I know I will be turned into a martyr- a device where what shinobi remain will pick up where I left off.. You can kill, but you cannot stop us, you cannot defeat us... There was once a proud doctrine of Kumogakure, that we endured no matter what..."

"We gave meaning to the legend lightning being able to strike twice in the same area. Remember my name, because I have just been named the Raikage of Kumogakure. The Land Of Clouds will see life once more."

"Thank you." The mic falls deaf at this point, and there is a settling calm that descends.


The male in yellow, and white silken robes emerges from the depths of the mansion.

This is hurting our economy as you know. Reports indicate these are citizens whom are hungry, and have resorted to robbing in order to make ends meat."

The Minatbi hands Takuma a pouch filled with fifty thousand Ryo. "Beat them, but after you've taught them a lesson give them the money, and tell them there is more where that came from if they wish to become shinobi."

The Raikage turns away into the confines of his office. "Return to me when you've done so."

Please, also take care not to disturb anything in his room, as he is a man that enjoys trinkets."

Eiyu flips a scroll into the air, and catches it with his right hand, the parchment escapes it's confines exposing its confines. It was a D ranked mission.

"I have more when you - Hell, I'll give you and Takuma the other two."
"Haku, after that I need you to teach a clas- .." <Oh, that would've been a mistake.. He's not a peoples person.. You know what..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) continues to work on other material he had been working on. Namely the Finger carving seal. There was something interesting about being able to place your finger against an object and inscribe a message upon it's surface. The heat of the ethereal flame was able to scar practically everything.

Eiyu attempts to show-case his skill by writing his name on a jutsu scroll he had in his possession. "Here we go." He uses his finger to drum up several different shapes but instead ends up ripping the scroll in half.

"Nani!?"* - Tue Nov 17 22:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) takes a scroll out of his posession and goes over the details of Finger-Carving seal. He opens a blank document and begins to trace a giant 'R' onto the surface. The rippling energy that warped the tip of his fingers served as a proper way to construct words in a delicate, but useful manner. 

"Sigh." Boredom settles in as he takes the time to write the words carefully. He didn't really enjoy tucking himself away, hours at a time even just so that he could focus on one concept. One single concept that would prove to be highly useful down the road, but all he really saw it as is redundant. "Bleh.."

The male tips his hat over his head, the neck-strap keeping it tied to his form. "Guess I better get to doing this paper work..." His bandaged hands flip several folders open, and one at a time he begins stamping away.

It was really just confirming a whole lot of formal requets for new additions to various villages.. There was also anothear curious proaposal,but it required a fair provision of funds. "Hm, a Kumogakure mansion...? Oh, even another ..... Proposal...?"

<This is perfect...>
"I want the Kumogakure mansion repaired, as well as the temple, and academy if need be."* - Wed Nov 18 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) glances in the Mizukage's direction. It had been a tough day sorting out papers, and he was more or less tired from a hards-day work. Though, it wasn't all bad, he was able to organize a joint effort with the forces of Sunagakure to help him with this task. Some of them simply hung back, other's helping sort his papers.

It was a productive day.

"Hm, can I help you?" He mutters, while smiling softly under his silken robes.* - Wed Nov 18 09:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) raises his hand. "No, tell me what's the matter, because I was under the impression we were on good terms. I wouldn't want anything to hurt our dealings. What is it that I've done? The only shinobi I have under my employment are -natives- to Kumogakure. I haven't taken any others.. That is truth, I swear it."* - Wed Nov 18 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Kumogakure has no Kirigakure shinobi. - Wed Nov 18 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) nods, and actually takes the time to rise from his seat into a formal bow. "No need to be so formal, Mizukage-Sama. My name is still Eiyu. I would still like to show my gratitude for you helping me in my time of need. He reaches for a scalding cup of tea.

He sips slowly. 

"Would you like some as well, it's Green. No sugar."
He motions his free hand to a pot of brewed water.
The attendants which were equal part shinobi, and office-staff peeked around corners as they understood the importance of this event.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) raises his left brow. This was news to him to say the least. He had no idea that there was a pseudo rulership. It made sense in a way, Ortho obviously wanted his hand in the cookie jar to say the least. Even he helped put the previous Mizukage in power it would mean he would have his loyalty, perhaps even some of his men.

Eiyu sets the brim of the cup on the table - his clumsy eyes rotating into a serious, yet benevolent pattern.

"Long-Term mission..." He looks a bit troubled.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) reaches for the cup of tea, but clumsily knocks it onto the floor, the hot fluid streaking on his lap.
<Nani!?> 

His eyes widen.

<Baka!> 

"Oi, hot, hot, and hot..!" For a second it seemed as if Eiyu was going to roll out of his char, but he thought it best to endure the pain...

He couldn't really do that sort of thing around the Mizukage after-all.

<Great I've ruined my robes...>

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"What a perfect day to start off by training." Eiyu draws forward with both hands coming together. He currently stood on the peak of the area with both of his eyes taking in the sight before him. "Hnn." He reaches for a scroll on his waist and opens the front so that it was facing the sky. From there he brings a Kunai forth and imbues it with his chakra. The formulated hand-signs react to the metallic objects and soon enough they were whisked away into the void at a moments notice.

"Nice."* - Wed Nov 18 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Whatever happened to this world." Uie rests on Eiyu's shoulder at this moment in-time. Both of them were glancing over Kumogakure's mountainous terrain. It was fair to say there were lingering scars on the Land Of Clouds. The repair work wasn't yet complete, and still, even as the process of restoration moved forward the Minatabi suspected it wouldn't be long before it was destroyed once again.

Meditation over events like these were key. You couldnt always think with your heart in these instances, especially when there were other peoples lives on the line. There was a part of him that wanted revenge, and the call for it was strong most days. He had to admit the prospect of bringing on Edge's end would've made him feel a lot better.

Or would it? His death would not revive those who had been killed in the initial battle. His death would do nothing but satisfy a desire to see him deceased. No, the Raikage had to focus on the restoration of his people, and he knew morale was low so he decides to do the next best thing. He would have partial repairs on the Manor itself, but the majority of his revenue would go into the restoration of the Temple.

* - Wed Nov 18 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"So much to consider.." Eiyu glances at the manuscript that had been left behind in his absence. There were lot's of request, but most of them were from the Mizukage himself asking on Hachirou's status. Like hell he was going to fill these out, he knew next to nothing about the man, how could he be expected to fill out tons of information at a moments notice.

"Hmmm...Now, for the design of the temple." There had to be a general idea of what they would be praying to, a form of deity. He had done a fair amount of research into Niza's religion, and found that he would need to piece together more facts before he could do much of anything.

It would be very helpful if there was a priest who could help him, but he didn't know of any that were alive. If anything all he could really do is put a word out that he was looking for any priests who used to frequent Kumogakure, because right now they were few and far between.* - Wed Nov 18 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) practiaces with working with a barrier. He places four tags in total around key positions of the nearest building. When this was complete he imbues the matter with his chakra, and then condenses it to a point where it could be easily sahould the need arise. * - Wed Nov 18 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: Meaning - Thu Nov 19 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Sunagakure's shinobi caught word of an approaching carvan. Their policy on these sorts of things were simply to verify that there were no threats present for the settlement.  Two burly men adorned in flak jackets stopped them on their to the village, they did Henge checks and checked ID if at all possible once everything was cleared she'd be allowed entry.

Once she did make it into the area Eiyu's eyes narrowed. He took her attire, she seemed to have a noir look about her. Something suggestive of a dark, yet composed get-up. His blue eyes pan in her direction.

"Who are you?" He inquires.
* - Thu Nov 19 16:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Hm? Oh, scared.. I guess that is one way to put it." 
More like disgusted.
Kana was known to be a loose lipped radical who only helped herself. The Minatabi had met her before and found her presence less than welcoming. "But my memory does serve me properly." The male continues to watch her movements, not so much because he was concerned of what she would do. 
Rather its the fact that body language was an important way to judge someone's character.

He would look for signs that would help him gain a better understanding of how she was. "You name would be helpful."
"Oh, and what brings you to the Land Of Clouds?"* - Thu Nov 19 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 's left brow quirks noticeably. "Relations?" His voice rises an octave - obviously he hadn't expected such a response. <Hm, hard to get a read on her.> "Well, nice to meet you, 'Supaiku.' He gives extra emphasis  to said last name just because he wanted to make it known he did not trust her. Though this was a natural reaction towards anyone outside of his village. 

"Tell me, have you really traveled all this way in the pursuit of friendship? He crosses his arms, and his right foot commences tapping on the ground.

He looked skeptical.* - Thu Nov 19 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) scratched the back of his head. This is where his inexperience begins to show. "R-right." He stampers. <God, I look like an idiot..> His face flushes a deep crimson, but he fights through his embarrassment for the sake of his pride. "I have one request, and that is do not cause trouble here. We've had enough problems as it is, and I'd like to keep our settlement peaceful, as it's humble servant that is all I could ever want."

* - Thu Nov 19 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looks at Eri dead in her eyes, both of his cobalt optics narrowing tightly upon her approach. "Stop.." He shook his head, and was about to take a step backwards until he heard her speak. <She has taken control of the situation.. Promising no harm will come if she is not harmed.. That leads me to believe she holds sway with someone, or something. Just who are you, Supaiku? Good intentions to be shown, hmph.> 

"Why do you need to know that?" Eiyu was defensive at this point. Like an armored vault he decided to be tight-lipped about Kumogakure's status, as well as his. 

"With all due respect... Who are you to ask all of these things of me?" He states in an offended manner.* - Thu Nov 19 16:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances at his feet. "I apologize.. I'm simply trying to do what I think is right.. Don't hold against me, alright?" Both of his eyes rotate - he looks across her face from ear to ear. <She's really young..> "My name is Eiyu, of Kumogakure." He reaches for a scroll on the back of his waist, his palm runs across the Lotus imprint.

Smoke washes over the immediate area, the mighty shawl of Kumogakure now resting smugly on his cranium.

"Raikage of Kumogakure.. ."
<Nani......?> 
For all of his dramatic postering, he figured out that he must've made himself look like even more of a fool because the Hat was backwards.

<Baka!>* - Thu Nov 19 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) ||"Sometimes one must not lead out of desire, but rather necessity. I guess someone older, and more adjusted to the shinobi world could rule this place more effectively. Sadly, in the end none of these types of people exist. Not anymore anyway." He fixes the position of the hat, his eyes softening at the theatrical  performance Supaiku took on.

"It's just so hard to bite that tongue, isn't it? Then dont. I recognize your disdain in seeing someone like me being handed the mantle of rulership, but what you don't know is that if I don't fix this place, no-one will.. This isn't about power, or putting on a good front for the surrounding villages. This is about the -people- who live here, and as long as my people need me, and I can serve them I will not be stopped. I don't think you understand, and that's okay. But this is my Nindo, my shinobi way."

He smiles authentically for the first time.
"Heh, sorry...Uie did tell me I'm long winded."* - Thu Nov 19 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) closes his eyes in the attempt to calm his nerves.

Like a switch, his colder, and less assuming persona drifts from the confines of his soul-case.

"It's people like you that work my nerves.. You know nothing of what these people have been through, and you're hardly the one who should be the judge of character. Sure, I'm not the leader the people deserve, but I am the one they need." 

"Yeah, I'd like to keep an eye on you so you don't cause trouble, or is that too much Miss Villager Girl?" * - Thu Nov 19 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) raises his left hand once more. "No. Come no closer." He shakes his head to reinforce what he had just said.
"I'm annoyed now.. What is it that you wanted to do here?"
He motions with his free-hand the breadth of space that went on, seemingly forever.
* - Thu Nov 19 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) pauses for what seemed like an eternity.
<Move.. Body.. Move..>
He takes a measured step backwards. "Why don't you listen?"* - Thu Nov 19 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) "....." Perhaps it was his good nature, and the fact that he saw no way beyond this being a cycle of him moving backward, and him moving forward. By even doing so it gave her an advantage over him, his authority had lost it's weight, and he found himself being the same naive boy who tried to take on a responsibility greater than himself.* - Thu Nov 19 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) 's eyes were looking down at her, she was small, but her height could work in her favor for multiple scenarios. Eiyu probably looked like an idiot with his previous attempts of trying to create distance when he towered over the woman.

"Because I dont wish for you to be harmed." He states blunty. Though, with her being so close he was able to catch a whiff of her perfume. The unique musk was very strong to him at first, but he had taken a liking to the smell. 

"Is that what you wished to test?"

<Hmm..>* - Thu Nov 19 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) tilts his head to the side. <She was reading me....> He looks on disappointed, both of his eyes assuming a look of genuine regret. <She tricked me..> "Hmph, and what am I? Do you consider me to be weak simply because I know the worth of a human life? I'm not a scum-bag who takes lives on a simple misunderstanding, or after having been insulted. My memory is also starting to kick in, you're existence has an insurance policy on it. I remember the girl speaking of a partner, yeah, that's right. Even if I did want to harm you, I still wouldnt have done so, but its not for the reason you might think.."* - Thu Nov 19 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) <I really need to work on being more mysterious..> She had read him like a book, cover to cover. "Yeah, let's get going. Where is your destination? I pretty much know the place like the back of my hand."

He motions for her to walk forward, he intended to stand shoulder to shoulder, but that wasn't happening because of her height. "You look as if you're going to freeze to death.." His step quickens, she would probably get sick if the winds assault continued.

"You're right about everything you said, by the way. Minus me being scared." O course his attempt to save face.* - Thu Nov 19 17:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "I know a place where you can get warm." The cold didn't really upset Eiyu at all. His body had adapted nicely over several years of living, eating, and training in the harsh winter-esque climate.

"Oh. I honestly didn't think I'd see a genuine smile coming from you, ever. But yes, that's what we hear nowadays. Though, I prefer this over Sunagakure anyday."

"You're probably hungry? I know the best place."
Hence they move.* - Thu Nov 19 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) had to be careful how he responded with this. Hassan technically gave him the position in a way, and since he didn't want to give the impression he wasn't grateul he though it best to dodge the question partially. "It's an okay place, it's too hot.." 

Most people came here to get a bite to eat, but given the pangs of poverty that had stricken Kumogakure you were met with a lot of people simply trying to collect scraps. 

There was a boy who approached him, he couldn't have been more than five. 'Excuse me, -Reikage.. Do you have mawnie..? I just want something to eat..' 

Eiyu was enraged, his right fist slamming against the desk. "Yes, child." He motions from the table and makes his way to the owner.
"I told you to let the children who come in here to eat. I will not have them starving.."

The man responded with an acidic tone. 'I will lose business, I c-'
"Listen here, take it out of my tab, but you -feed- everyone who comes in here needing food, do you understand?"
'Y-you will go bankrupt..'
"Then so be it."
Eiyu relcaims his seat, but not before the child hugs his leg. 'Thank you!' "Don't mention it." 
He flips open the menu. 
"What'll you have, Supaiku?'* - Thu Nov 19 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) nods his head. "Yes, each and everyone of these people are important to me, especially the children. I envy them, and their innocence.. Some of them don't know how evil this world really is, but I'm afraid there are exceptions to that rule.. The suicide rate has sky-rocketed in the male populace.. By forty percent.. This is in direct correlation to the poverty rate of fifty percent... Hm, as you can see parents are being driven on the brink because they can barely afford things for their family.. But if they are supplied with food, and a means to get back in the game.. Everything will be okay... I don't want a fight with anything, or anyone. I just want my people to survive. I won't allow anyone, or anything to stop me..." 

His eyes were fierce at this moment in time.
"But enough of that morbid discussion. There is plenty to eat, but you'll have to forgive me.. I'm not hungry anymore, still.. Pick anything, it's my treat." He motions for one of the workers to move to his table. "Two sake glasses, and..-" He pauses, obviously motioning for the girl to choose what she wanted.* - Thu Nov 19 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Sunagakure is aiding us, yes. Their shinobi are here to protect, and that is far as their obligation goes." They work -very- fast to fill their orders. Eiyu's sake glass arrive within mere seconds. He takes the first shot like water, not caring for the burn working its way down his chest.

"Why do our numbers interest you?
He doesn't even bother to look at her at this point.
"I'm not going to answer that." There was a tray of riceballs shaped into various shapes with nori wrapped around it's sides, along with the sauce.

"Go ahead."* - Thu Nov 19 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) shakes his head. "The only thing Sunagakure owns is Sunagakure. Though, this shouldn't be discussed over eating. The topic at hand is a sensitive one after-all." He drinks the second glass, his face flushes from the warmth, the burn makes it's way through his appendages.

"You understand, no? I just don't have much to say about that situation."* - Thu Nov 19 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Why?" Eiyu was going to continue to ask questions because he was equally as interested as to why she'd care about this place's well-being. "I suppose I can tell you a bit about Kumogakure, but no specifics... You have to understand that I just find it a bit odd that you care at all really. It's a shadow of it's former self.. What is there to be had about knowing anything about it?"* - Thu Nov 19 18:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No, I understood. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You're here. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Because he's interested. - Thu Nov 19 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Now listen.... - Thu Nov 19 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I came a very long way to speak to you. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: -You- in fact. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I didn't think it would be quite so easy to even -meet- you. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: For that matter, he didn't actually send me. Someone else was suppose to come but ... I sort of got antsy. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Needed something to do and I wanted to see your land. - Thu Nov 19 19:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Plus, I'm pretty sure you would like me far more than the other guy, I'm easy on the eyes. - Thu Nov 19 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) frowned. "You are a beautiful lady, and no, I don't 'swing' that way. You also have a sense of humor which I enjoy. However, I wouldn't enjoy these other 'guys' showing up in Kumogakure..I am glad you showed up, but I know you are very good at what you do. Manipulative. I suppose the male was going to try to intimidate me while you try to use your charm to get over on me?" 

Eiyu chuckles.

"I think I see where this is going.."* - Thu Nov 19 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"......." Eiyu looked dumb-founded. "I don't understand..." His face turned sour within the next few seconds. "Oi, what's so funny?"* - Thu Nov 19 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Yeah, I don't know what to make of you. I know my interactions with you could make you an ally, as well as an enemy. If I refuse to have any dealings with you, and your cohort I'm bound to have problems, no? I will not be bullied by anyone, especially when the -only- real thing I -want- is to protect my people. I have no uses for anything else.. Not from these other villages that breathe down my neck.. Not from these bandits who attack my settlement daily, and the only thing that stops them are the shinobi, and certainly not from shady individuals who attempt to beguile with charm, and cryptic threats from people behind the scenes!"

Eiyu was obviously -very- upset at this point.
"No, no, and no. I don't want anything these people have to offer. Ulterior motives are just so, and I cannot trust those who haven't revealed myself to me. So no. I do -not- trust that you mean well for this village because there is nothing I've seen otherwise that reinforces such things."* - Thu Nov 19 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <This isn't good at all. I take my frustrations out on this girl, and she in-turns tells her partners who take it out on my village.> "I'm sorry." He mumurs as low as possible. The people in the fine establishment went on with their day as usual, almost as if his temper was common-place. "You have to understand my position. I don't know you, and I don't know your people."* - Thu Nov 19 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Like I said I just don't want trouble. I apologize for not being able to help more, but it is as I said, I cannot afford to make enemies...These are trying times and I must be careful of the slightest discrepancy. It's just how the world works, and it is just how I am." 

Eiyu rises from his seat. He shifts the robes onto his body, the combination of white and yellow suited the white haired Minatabi. He reaches for his parcel and distrubtes the allocated funds against the table.

"This should cover the expenses of your meal. I suppose that is all you've come for?"* - Thu Nov 19 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) stops in his tracks before taking his seat. "Go ahead."* - Thu Nov 19 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We'd like to become allies. - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We don't do things like normal shinobi villages. - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Who is we? - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't think I'm allowed to say that for now, I'm not even suppose to be here... like I said. - Thu Nov 19 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'll very likely get in trouble. - Thu Nov 19 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmmm... - Thu Nov 19 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We mainly are a refuge for those who want freedom. - Thu Nov 19 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Freedom from the oppression that the shinobi world has created. - Thu Nov 19 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: We aren't anti shinobi in any way... many of us still consider ourselves shinobi. - Thu Nov 19 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"The shinobi world is a very general term. This oppression you speak of, also is very general. Just who are the oppressors? I see you have that headband, but you call yourself a shinobi because of what? You wish to change the world? Well, to be blunt, and this is just what I see so forgive me if you get offended.. But why do you take pride in that headband when you left your village? Refuge or not, your obligation as a shinobi was to stay? Or is that concept of loyalty gone now? What I'm saying is.. If you aren't even helping your own village, why would you help me, or want help in the first place? Or is this an attempt to restore your village.. I am very curious."* - Thu Nov 19 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||There was a saying real men didn't cry.. Well, Eiyu put that statement to shame at this moment in time. Perhaps it was that he was too kind, or too naive for his own good, but that verse honestly struck a heart-string. Maybe it was because he remembered the destruction of his own village so vividly. The smell of the dead, the look of their indifferent faces, and listless eyes turning gray. Or perhaps the outcry of suffering from the masses. Families running to the deceased, hoping that they could find some form of solace by indentifying charred remains.

*Drip.. Drip* Eiyu is motionless for this entire time. Tears strike the edge of the table and pool there for sometime. He was weeping in the midst of this visitor, in the midst of his own people, but his voice was so strong that those only looking at him would be able to tell he was crying. His empathy for those who suffered was so great he found the need to stick his neck out, just once.

"I ask for a meeting with this man... I need to hear these words from his mouth... But... From what you tell me... You are good people. I do hope this isnt just some attempt to take advantage of my kindness."* - Thu Nov 19 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Yes, that would be nice." Eiyu rises from his seat. "The square is a place that helps calms my nerves. Nature is settling." <I don't have much resources left, and my people aren't doing so well.. Everything needs to be rebuilt.. What if these people of Konoha wish to have their village propser over the skeleton of Kumogakure? No, such thoughts can't be considered. I have agreed to nothing yet anyway.> 

Eiyu looked worried, and he had a lot of anxeity. His concern for his village was so great, and the margin of error so slim, it seemed as if he would burst at any moment.

This was it.

He stares at Eri for a long-time before moving away.
"Let's go."* - Thu Nov 19 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The both of them make their way into the square, but Eiyu was silent all the way there. When they had finally reached their destination he chose to respond to her statement. "I'd like to believe you.. I really would, but I have no way of knowing that. Words can be riddled with lies, promises easily broken through action. Betrayal runs rampant throughout the world.. People would sell their humanity for the sake of money, or power. Both of which seem to be something we need."

He shakes his head. "Will you get in trouble if they found out you were here for too long?"* - Thu Nov 19 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Yes, all we can do is hope. But as far as the meeting, he isn't to come here, or any of his people. I will find a way to go to him. Your Sensei sounds like a good man for punishing you.. You put your life on the line to speak to a person who could've very well had you killed, or worse." He looks her up and down as he say's those words, just to remind her that she was a female without actually saying it.

"You should be aware that... You -.. No, you probably know this already. Here..." He unseals a jacket from a scroll and attempts to hand it to her if she allowed it. "It will keep you -warmer-."* - Thu Nov 19 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) five million Kunai penetrate her from different directions (omit)* - Thu Nov 19 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) chuckles, he knew exactly what Eri was doing. "If I wanted you harmed I would've had it done already, but that wouldn't end well for me either now would it?" It was clear by now the male wouldn't harm her in anyway whatsoever.

He was a kindred spirit, one in a million these days.
He didn't have a hint of malice or corruption  on him. 
In some way's it made him a bit fit for the Kage role simply because he didnt believe in the doctrine for the greater good.

"I swear to you. No harm will come of you within my land."* - Thu Nov 19 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Once upon a time. - Thu Nov 19 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Shinobi used Ninjutsu to defend, not to kill. - Thu Nov 19 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) smiled deeply as she saw her accept his token. "Our past hasn't always been the brightest, there have been times where we've killed eachother - at least in Kumogakure. But I follow Niza's doctrine, he lived his life trying to make an impact on other peoples lives, and he was killed doing what he loved, and that is helping protect his home. I don't know why our village was ever targeted in the first place. Psychoti men going on a rampage of binge killing for just the hell of it.. My mother and father died just because some idiot decided to play the roll of God, though I suspect there was more to the story. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that Kumogakure will not be a traditional village, not anymore. It will be a nation governed with benevolence."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) hands a random shinobi a bag which only seemed to be filled with papers. "You know what I need." The male looks at the tags and vanishes, he shows up by the mansion once more.

"I dont feel like being bothered by anyone so I'm moving in doors. You have two options, one you can head back, or two you can head in the mansion with me until you decide to go. Which will it be?"* - Thu Nov 19 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Would you... like me to come into the mansion? - Thu Nov 19 20:49:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) the tags had been set around the mansion. Eiyu begins making his way inside, it was lucky they were concealed just right. "Just something of note.. It will be impossible for anyone to bother me in the mansion for sometime. I don't plan to surface until I'm needed. You're welcome to come, or leave. "* - Thu Nov 19 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If you leave, men from Sunagakure will escort you away. - Thu Nov 19 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Things were already getting bad when I registered as a shinobi. - Thu Nov 19 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Reminds me of my own recruitment... - Thu Nov 19 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I don't think I should continue asking questions. - Thu Nov 19 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You may get offended. - Thu Nov 19 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: No, you my ask. - Thu Nov 19 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If I am offended I will readily let you know. - Thu Nov 19 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm, al- Good.. - Thu Nov 19 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Your Sensei. Would you kill for him, die for him? Would you die for the Sake of Konohagakure, or kill for it? - Thu Nov 19 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I would do both for my Sensei without needing to think on it too deeply, I already have made the decision to act in that manner. As for Konoha, I have killed for it and as for dying for Konoha... not in it's current state. - Thu Nov 19 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: The settlement that I live at now... I find it to be home. - Thu Nov 19 21:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But that is just me. - Thu Nov 19 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see... That is very eye opening. - Thu Nov 19 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Does it make you think poorly of me that I wouldn't die for my native village? - Thu Nov 19 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But perhaps flawed. - Thu Nov 19 21:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So on opposite sides of the spectrum. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We stand. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I understand the fact that you would kill for your Sensei. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But would you kill an infant to save his life?  - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Would you kill a child for your Sensei? - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You see. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes. - Thu Nov 19 21:28:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) turns to look at Eri, he was shocked.* - Thu Nov 19 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If it meant to save his life, I would. - Thu Nov 19 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I don't understand.. . . - Thu Nov 19 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: That is utter loyalty. - Thu Nov 19 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ...What you call loyalty, I call indoctrination. - Thu Nov 19 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Life is sacred... - Thu Nov 19 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You would defile it on a whim, it's not even selfish, it's just wrong. - Thu Nov 19 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It's wrong to -you-. - Thu Nov 19 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Life is indeed sacred. - Thu Nov 19 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But who is to say that the child's life is more valuable than my Sensei's? - Thu Nov 19 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Exactly, but by killing the child you prove that the childs life is more valuable than your Sensei's. - Thu Nov 19 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I do not believe in the child, the child has not accomplished anything that is worthy of saving their life over my Sensei's to me personally. For that matter the child could grow up to be a great enemy or an evil entity. - Thu Nov 19 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He could also shape the world into a better future.. You would never know, but I suppose I can knock you there. - Thu Nov 19 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: However. - Thu Nov 19 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: How do I make the child's life more valuable in that case? - Thu Nov 19 21:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: There is no right or wrong answer. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Would I kill someone to save my mothers life? No, would I kill the person who destroyed my village, no... It's just as extreme, isn't it? - Thu Nov 19 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I understand. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You and I hold very different philosophies. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Even if that means you're throwing away apart of yourself. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Which your Sensei, if he was your teacher would want to be the last thing on your mind. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes, we do. - Thu Nov 19 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Why would my Sensei want himself to be the last thing on my mind? - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We live in an era of generations, you are his student, someone who he wants to surpass him. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So he teaches you. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He makes you stronger. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But. - Thu Nov 19 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It should be by improving yourself. By killing an infant, or child just to see him safe. - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If he's about peace. - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why would we want that? - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....it's not that he would want that. - Thu Nov 19 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I assume he wouldn't. - Thu Nov 19 21:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So you would defy his wishes for your own purpose? - Thu Nov 19 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You see... at the settlement there is freedom within the settlement itself to believe your own philosophies and follow them. - Thu Nov 19 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yes, and that is selfish. - Thu Nov 19 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: But it is who I am, selfish in the case of my Sensei's survival. - Thu Nov 19 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I am not necessarily selfish in other area's though. - Thu Nov 19 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You have strong feelings for your Sensei. I assume it's akin to a daughter loving her father. It's true, that prospect is -very- selfish. - Thu Nov 19 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But. - Thu Nov 19 21:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Even if that's not what they want. - Thu Nov 19 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Whereas having true love would be understanding the persons wishes, and accepting them no matter what. - Thu Nov 19 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I predict you will have to make a -very- tough choice. - Thu Nov 19 21:40:03 2015

" If one were to pay attention to the shapes on the paper, they all seemed to be formulas in regards to Fuuinjutsu. The collection was large, and the document housed all sorts of information on novice level Fuuinjutsu application.

So if I had told these troops to capture you, and strip you of all your possessions, and question you for hours on end.....? What could you've done? Your behavior wouldn't have mattered."* - Thu Nov 19 21:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: And what you are saying is likely something my Sensei will say too. - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: He might even just do it to teach me a lesson. - Thu Nov 19 21:52:51 2015
