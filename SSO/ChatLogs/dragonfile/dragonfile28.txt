<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shirabafaru(Dragonfile) had ventured through the various prefectures of Sunagakure, finding his home to be nestled through the common-wealth, a non-descript abode tethered skyward by adjacent boulders supporting it's width. Wide eyes marveled the structure that probably took no time to build at all. The people of Sunagakure were the perfect workers. Mason's worked arduously to erect prolific house in a matter of months, something that would take other villages several months - not years. 

It came down to having a superior infrastructure, it's existance nourished by chisel and rock, hammering shapes into orifices - creating, refining.... Now, Sunagakure was a bustling metropolitan - their entire military was similar in this way as well. They didn't breed superior warriors, at least to his knowledge. Sure, you've had several people from the Land Of Wind that were regarded with respect, but mostly everyone he knew had been dead. You were only as important as your next battle, and when you fell you were just another grain of sand blowing listlessly through the rolling hills of depraved soil.

"Tch..." He blows smoke through his nostril's the cigarette's orange glow snuffed out by the rolling of index, and thumb across the base. It burned, enough to make the avid smoker wince. He practices handseals slowly, one after another until his mastery with these arcane shapes were at their apex.* - Wed Nov 11 07:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) stands in the destruction of the Kumogakure manor. Slight restoration had begun, mainly because Sunagakure made the village apart of their own. This sad fact was something that plagued him day and night. Restoration was a tough process at this point as well for many reasons. The first being the lack of Kumogakure shinobi, this made things difficult because there was also a lack of citizens. Since the men who swore to protect them were either dead, or they had fled it left the citizens in a panic. In the end they were forced to go to smaller settlements out of fear they would be destroyed.

"Damn it.." Eiyu bit into the pad of his forefinger, the blood strewn across the ground enabling him to conjure a adolescent frog to do his bidding - or so he thought.  "Listen, I need you to tell me about the condition of the village."

"No, you listen to me, bitch!" The frog shoots in response. "First off, you know my name is Uie... I don't have to listen to you.." The frog was denoted with black stripes running along it's back, and a deep tone of Emerald warping it's body.* - Wed Nov 11 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) brings his hands together and forms a few seals, blood descending across his digits. He slams his palms against the ground, black letterings form a pattern into the ground. Smoke ascends into the air blocking his personal summon from view. 

The pad of it's feet push off of the ground - the leap reminding him of his own training jumping from roof-top to rooftop when Kumogakure was at its prime. Now it was nothing but a shadow of it's formerself. There was nothing he could do, but bide his time for the time being.

"I will think of something.." The creature murmus lowly. "Shut up."* - Wed Nov 11 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) spots the incoming caravan from afar. He eyes it's approach wondering what would posses someone to come to this village. His head lowers a bit - his good eye scanning the interior. There seemed to be a man with a giant sword departing from it's midst. "Oi.. What brings you here?" The Minatabi mutters as lazily as ever.* - Wed Nov 11 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Damn..> Eiyu's eyes narrow some, he wasn't intent on starting a battle with some stranger just yet. Sadly, even the movements of Hachirou he assumed that is what the male came for. "What is it that you've come for?" Eiyu's intentions also become bit more serious. He draws his two hands to his chest, but upon closer inspection they would notice that the pad of his index finger was bleeding.

"Hmmm."* - Wed Nov 11 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) let his body shift into a relaxed position, but he didn't lower his guard for even a second. "Profit.. You've come to the wrong place." He motions with his left arm to the scene behind him. Countless buildings had been destroyed, in the distance one would be able to observe a mass grave of men, women, and children. 

However, it wasn't all bad for the simple fact that Sunagakure occupied portions of the village. <Was their presence by design...?> Sunagakure's intentions were unknown even to him.* - Wed Nov 11 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Don't cause trouble." That ultimatum would be something Eiyu wanted to solidify to all newcomers of Kumogakure. Just because their village had been ransacked by Edge, and Rymei it didnt mean anyone could just come in and stalk those who remained and get away with their lives.

<I'm really the only one who reinforces everything..> Eiyu's gaze never leaves Hachirou's frame. He felt as if their interactions had created a stand-off of sorts, where one person tried to get the feel of the other while trying to remain mysterious enough so that the other person wouldn't understand what they were about.* - Wed Nov 11 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Great, then welcome to Sunagakure. Hm, you never gave me your name." The male walks - his heel strafing to the side so that he was out of the approaching blade wielders reach. "I'm Eiyu."* - Wed Nov 11 21:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) reads from one of the manuscripts that had been left behind - or rather it was a piece of information that hadn't been destroyed. It detailed the process of how one would venture into more advanced aspects of Fuuinjutsu, namely the process of creating seals and storing objects into scrolls. This was a very basic, but essential part of Fuuinjutsu. If the Genin was going to get to the level he needed to help his village he would need to learn as much as he could as quickly as possible.* - Wed Nov 11 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I might as well come with you. - Wed Nov 11 21:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Well, then..> Eiyu continues to read from the manuscript that had been left behind. Several gaps in his knowledge of the proper way to handle Fuuinjutsu left him reeling. For one, the user had to implement their own chakra in a way that allowed them to apply it to the surfaces of other objects.  In theory one could say this was easy enough, however application was a different story. Placing these sort of marks upon these objects was a task that involved time, and relative skill in regards to knowing what you were doing. He was patient, but even now his tolerance for how long all of this was taking was torture.* - Wed Nov 11 21:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) measured the Genin's current standing, although he did nothing questioning why he decided to stop here. It was assumed that he simply wished to have conversation. Neither of them really held an advantage over each-other from these dealings. 

"Nice to meet you. My name is Eiyu.." He gives a double take towards the timid male. "What is it?"* - Wed Nov 11 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||There were a series of hoops one had to go through if they were to restore a nation. The first-step being men, yes, you didn't even need money because if you had enough followers they could simply make it up for it by either making their own tools, and then converting said tools into cash. Or, if you were scum you could attack a rich merchant in the hopes of making it big. It was different in Eiyu's case, he didn't want to take from the less fortunate, and claim their own funds as his, no, he had better intentions than that.

For now he would go to the smaller villages with Hachirou, and promise protection for a modest fee. They stumbled across a somewhat sheltered settlement where the people seemed to be well off. Even those well to do individuals had problems - namely .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) followed Hachirou into his home. The silver haired male descends - the chair was comfortable - and it was a welcome change. The journey on their way to Kirigakure was utterly inhospitable - things were better because it was two, rather than one. Things could've been a lot worse had they ventured there alone.

"Sigh.. So tired.. This is a nice home."* - Thu Nov 12 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances at Hachirou. "Oh, hmm.. That sounds good.. We need all the money we can get." Eiryu stuffs his hands into the Jounin suit towards his breast pocket. He thought of lightning up, but thought against it due to the fact he was in someone elses home. "I've got a few developments I'm working on myself."

Eiryu begins to read on the basics of Fuuinjutsu. He had done so during their travels, and hadn't shown any intentions on slowing down. There was a treasure trove to be found between the lines, he simply needed to continue to study in order to understand.

He begins to take the scrolls out and practice on the objects, filtering chakra through several objects until he found the process to be too redundant for the time being. "Guess I'll try later.. Hm, we should go walking around for a bit, so  I can get a feel of the village."* - Thu Nov 12 01:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) catches the scroll while nodding his head softly in the affirmative. "Thank you, Hachirou." He glances at the scroll, his fingers dance underneath the edges, slowly prying the material so that the words meaning would cativate his senses. Information, and the pursuit of such things made him excited.

"I see." It wasn't an offensive technique as one might be led to believe. Rather it seemed to utilize stealth, and or getting away.* - Thu Nov 12 01:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) bites into the pad of his forefinger - there was a fair amount of blood that stained the floor. Eiyu crafts several handseals in a short period of time. He extends an open palm towards the sediment at his feet - in a plum of smoke a toad arises from the confinues of it's embrace. It's splotched body had a deep covering of green warping it's skin. Powerful legs throttle it's ascension into the air enabling it to perch its small legs on the side of the mountain.

'Hey, Eiyu-Saaaaaaaan. Pops said you better get better at this summoning thing if you want to get better.'

"I know, Uie. It's pretty easy to summon you. Give me a break."
'Sure, sure.' The summon vanishes as quickly as it came.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) had spent several hours planning his meeting with the forces of Sunagakure. The main issue with all of this was that he had no idea what to expect from this overseer. Why did they want to remain here? Most of Kumogakure's forces had been killed, and it was a shadow of it's former self... What purpose would there be in having their man sent here? This made him slightly alarmed, he didn't enjoy being left out of the loop. This was -his- village, no theirs. 

What if they had decided to kill him off and continue on with their lives. <No..Hm...I will do a scouting mission..> Eiyu bites into the pad of his forefinger letting the blood from the tip sink onto the ground, following the sequence of handseal smoke rises from the ground.

"Kuchiyose..."
'Whatcha need, Eiyu-San?'
"Mind doing something for me?"
'Depends, what do I get?'
"My thanks.."
'Gotta do bet-'
"I'll do anything you ask of me at a later date."
'I'll keep you to that promise, Eiyu-San.'

"We'll need to get close to the place I wish to explore.. -Or, that I want you to explore."* - Thu Nov 12 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) begins working on the construction of several buildings; luckily for the Minatabi he wasn't alone, there were several citizens who congregated here for one purpose, and one only. 

Restoration.

Some of the destroyed buildings needed to be stripped of their foundation. Men and women hacked away with their tools of destruction, mallet against wooden skeletons that supported buildings in the past. They were destroyed like nothing and pitched away to be recycled for further use. This process of tearing down buildings that had been rocked by Kenshin, Rymei, Edge, and a mysterious lady were slowly, but surely destroyed in the process of creation.

They destroyed to make room for a better homestead. Wooden pillars with cement bindings now paired several constructs together. Eiyu was tired after many hours of working on the structures, and so he deemed it best that he should rest for the time being, but not before showing off his work to one of his best friends.

"Kuchiyose...."
'Ohhhh, Eiyu-San! Good work...'
"Eh, it's not perfect, but it's coming along nicely... I think when things happen like this, the moral across the village increases... It's really good to see when things go down like this... You're reminded that just because you're a shinobi, it doesn't mean your job is confined to killing.."* - Thu Nov 12 16:29:52 2015
