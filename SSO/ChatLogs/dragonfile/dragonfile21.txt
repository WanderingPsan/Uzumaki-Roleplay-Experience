<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) goes back to his previous task of striking a nearby boulder. It was something the Yamanshi was starting to do on a daily basis. The calcium deposits in his hands were breaking apart and reforming stronger than ever.
Despite the dull pain that racked his body he was starting to feel alive in the truest sense.
"Hrng...."
The behemoth's muscles expand with each-strike, and actually managed to wear the rock down. "Hrngg..." His biceps tighten, a bandaged fist is like a rocket through the sky. The depressions in the rock-face quickly turn into a chasm which was the size of his fist.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) carries her away. He seemed to be looking in the distance for something.
<Hm..>* - Tue Oct  6 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) set Genesis on the bed, his chiseled body running over hers. It didn't take one with exceptional imaginative powers to understand what was going to happen next.

The both of them would lock into an intimate embrace, provided she accepted.* - Tue Oct  6 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) after their exchange, the male changes into a pair of clothing that looked as if it was the same pair from before. Though, he did take the time to wrap his new pair of arm bandages that concealed his battered fists. "You were amazing as always.. But I hope you meant what you said.. We can't risk being caught.. I'm serious, Gene."

A part of him was sorry it had to, but the consequences would be grave if they were caught.* - Tue Oct  6 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) held her tightly, their lips lock and when they part saliva parts in strands. His right hand brushes the side of her face, his hazel eyes looking deep into her own. "Me as well, but trust me.. Everything we do from here on out will be worth it. I only ask that of course you keep this a secret, and if you see me teasing some chick you don't go off on me or anything like that because we must keep the story of what we have now...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Damn.. You had to say that right now, didn't you...?" It would be a lie to say the Yamanshi wasn't jealous to hear that comment, but it was something he had to deal with. His sister also didn't approve of him seeking other avenues of courtship and what he was doing was a bit unorthodox but he had to simply adapt with the world instead of against it. 

Well, at least for now.* - Tue Oct  6 19:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) reached for her hand before it could depart, guiding him to his manhood. Once more he couldn't endure the fact they wouldn't be able to touch. "Fuck it, one last time." He'd mutter. His clothing rotates off of his body, but he kept her hand on his member. His body rolling ontop of hers. -- 

Fastforward.

Round Two happened indeed, is she allowed it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "The fuck?" Kojiro takes a step back. He had no idea what the purposes of those seals were but he assumed it had something to do with Fuuinjutsu, and if it was he didn't want to get caught if she decided to attack. Even though she didn't look hostile, appearences could be misleading. 

After pulling his sister back and shielding her with his back he'd gaze on. --Or well that was before the bird game.* - Tue Oct  6 19:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Nah, no need to be so formal.. I don't care about none of that.. I can tell your parents raised a nice lady, but I had no such upbringing.." His eyes trail from her eyes, and down to her bust. He wasn't subtle about hiding his gaze, and he did it with practically anyone, regardless of he knew them or not. 

Upon noticing his sisters arrival his head cranes slightly, he attempts to make eye-contact. "Everything good?"* - Tue Oct  6 19:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) appeared a bit frustrated. It was one thing to be beaten by his rival, but he the fact that he was bested by Maloth made it sting even more. And it wasn't because he thought he was any better than the man. It was due to the fact that the man was so superior in so many aspects, and the one aspect Kojiro was superior in didn't matter at all. So, Maloth didn't seem to be very bright.. So what? The man could bend steel like nothing.

It left Kojiro in a state of awe as he recounted the man's battle with Kida.
<I will get like that....I will beat them all...>* - Tue Oct  6 19:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <Fuck that...> Kojiro read his body language and could tell that he'd be gone in one blow if push came to shove. "Erhm.." He clears his throat, both eyes eventually softening. He did not want to become a blood-stain.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <Fuck it.. I'm not being a bitch....> Kojiro stares at Maloth. Both of his fists clench tightly, he appeared as if he was conflicted. He was sure to get fucked up if he fought Maloth but he couldn't just bitch out because he was afraid of getting hurt. The man was powerful, that was a given, but his intelligence should have some merit, shouldn't it?

"I'll fight you..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) quickly changes his directy ignoring Cypher's roast entirely. "Fuck you, guy..." He was angry that Maloth ignored his challenge, it was true Kojiro wasn't really much of anything at this point but he was trying to make a name for himself, not only as an individual, but also as a shinobi of Kumogakure as well.

"DON"T FUCKING UNDERESTIMATE ME!" He breaks free from his sister's hold, or at least attempts to do so and charges Maloth, his body was poised for battle and he wanted to engage him with the intensity of the Brute managed to display.* - Tue Oct  6 20:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <Here it comes...> He extends his right leg into the air attempting to strike Maloth's shoulder with all of the strength he could muster. It was a direct attack, not really skillful at all, but not entirely terrible either. His execution was normal, but the speed and frequency were off.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <What?> Kojiro thought to himself. His kick didn't do anything at all, and now he found himself in a stressful situation. Maloth's meaty frame was going to piledrive him into the ground if he remained standing. He quickly moves to the left, negating the brunt of the charge, but was still hit with enough force to be sent flying. His right shoulder met with his opponent's the mometum causing ripple currents off of the ground, a malestrom of sand beating at his heels. 

"RAGH!!" The pain was immense, he could swear his shoulder was broken, or perhaps dislocated.  

He couldn't tell the difference at this point.
In fact he couldn't do anything at this point at all..
Friend or foe? 
None of that mattered.
He picked himself off of the ground, his right arm hanging limply at his side, his eyes shot daggers a cold aura uprooting his casual one.
"I'm going to..."
He takes a step forward....

"RIP YOU APART!" 
 
He charges the male, his hand reaching for his Wakizashi.
"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!" 
The unearthly glow of metal now rushing to impale the males shoulder if possible.
The Yamanshi had lost it.* - Tue Oct  6 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh. - Tue Oct  6 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) there were several things taking place at this point. Kojiro waited for there to be contact in order to launch this attack, and when it was made he was prepared to advance - that is until he saw Maloth's hammer coming towards his frame. This time towards his chest, the massive weapon would've been capable of blowing his chest away in one swing, and ending his life right then in and there. But, he pivots in time, allowing for his already incapciated shoulder to take the brunt, while in this action lighting sparks from the base of his blade increasing it's sharpness, and capablity of cutting. Perhaps if it was able to hit, while in the same time his shoulder is bifurcated. Quite literally in front of everyone his arm is gone from the shoulder down, he is carried with his momentum and literally goes flying eastward.
Silence.
His severed arm lay on the field, dust clouds consuming his person.* - Tue Oct  6 20:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) had actually been knocked out. The behemoths strength was something he wasn't prepared for. Bring in the addition of the hammer and things were simply out of his hands. But alas, he is pulled out of his stupor once more by his younger sister. A single hand presses against the surface of the ground, the surrounding muscle contracting to push him upwards. His right arm was entirely destroyed, bone matter showed through a nasty gash, he simply looks at the wound and shakes his head.

"Urhgng." He reaches for the piece of bone that was protruding, it was a compound fracture, he forces it inside and it seemed to look somewhat normal, but not nearly enough to repair the damage.

"Stop.... Gene..." 

He attempts to depart without another word.* - Tue Oct  6 21:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) walks inside the Ramen shop, his arm swathed in bandages. When he had taken it to the doctor he was told that if he had been hit any harder his arm would've been gone with the wind. Now, it was wrapped in heavy bandages, and said arm would be immobile for months. No hand, no handsigns, his progression would be halted and he was handicapped. 

His face lacked the glow from before and instead he ambles towards the far end of the wall and observes the child, and his company.* - Tue Oct  6 21:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) ambles away.* - Wed Oct  7 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Go ahead and sit with your sister. - Wed Oct  7 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Bring me thee cup of Miso-Ramen, and Sake." Kojiro seemed to be disturbed. If his kin pain attention to their surroundings they would be able to see a fair amount of crusted blood on the floor-boards. The owner of the estalishment was filled with melancholy.

"Kumogakure is changing.... I can't really tell you it's for the better... The Raikage is a good man... Still, benevolence will not save this village from the threats that present themselves.. Someone died in this exact spot, a Kirigakure shinobi who's name I did not know.... The Hokage killed him. What does this mean for Kumogakue? I have no idea."* - Wed Oct  7 17:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I don't want that. - Wed Oct  7 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I just want the both of you to remember to be loyal to the Raikage. - Wed Oct  7 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: No matter what you hear. - Wed Oct  7 17:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) uses his index finger to circle the brim of his Sake-cup. Kojiro's exuberance  was gone and replaced with something cold.

"My friend was attacked earlier, Gene... Seeing as you were present when it happened do you know what happened to him?"* - Wed Oct  7 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: He's fine. . . If I recall. - Wed Oct  7 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I see.... - Wed Oct  7 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: There are too many outsiders here. - Wed Oct  7 17:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: *Sigh* This is going to be a bit difficult. - Wed Oct  7 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: It can be fixed. - Wed Oct  7 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I see.. - Wed Oct  7 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: For now I'll only be able to use my left hand. - Wed Oct  7 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: My feet as well. - Wed Oct  7 17:27:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: We'll pick up everything in a bit. - Wed Oct  7 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) reaches for the Wakizashi resting behind his waist. It was difficult to grasp the hilt seeing as he was reaching with his left due to his right arm being in a cast. It was fortunate that in order to use Chakra Flow he did not need his hands. The unearthly glow of metal was now saturated with electricity. He used the blade like a buzzsaw and chipped away at the rock-face. 

While he did this he was silent.
Today had not been a good day for the Yamanshi, and he seemed to be on edge today. The rising tension even was picked up by his sisters as well, or perhaps not.
