<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) bit the pad of his forefinger, blood trickled from his palms and he began to form the handseals needed to conjure the creature. He looked directly at the floor and slammed his palm into the ground, the top-soil beneath his finger-tips cracked and the noise caused the surrounding snakes to hiss. Even the White Snake took notice of the action and batted his tongue in the direction of the Uchiha. 

<Summoning Jutsu....>
Then a cloud of smoke encompassed the cave but Ushinawa was able to see right through it, at his foot lay a regular snake, nothing that he could really identify as he knew so little about the creatures.* - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hn... - Mon Sep 21 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) slashes the pad of his index finger with a corner of his Kunai. The pain in his finger meant nothing with the ability that came with it. <Summoning Jutsu...> Several handseals were woven sequentially, one following the other. He slams his hand into the ground and watches as black letters expand into a helix. He pulls his right hand away to reveal another rather average looking snake which coiled around his leg. 

"Yesssssssss...~" 
"....Get off me..." The summon would promptly vanish before Ushinawa was at it again.* - Mon Sep 21 20:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) uses the open wound and splatters it across the ground, the creation of handseals quickly followed the splotches of crimson that were strewn across the field. His chakra reacted as he thought it would, his efforts were rewarded with the conjuration of a small snake that ran underfoot. It seemed to dislike anything human as it promptly scurried away.* - Mon Sep 21 20:28:35 2015

Ushinawa folds his arms over his chest, his blackened irises seeking understanding through the concave structure they were currently in. Sound resonated in a lasting echo, stretching off of the walls and amplifing it's power throughout. "I could have killed many.... But I chose not to, it is simply the way I am..

Now is the time to go into hiding, this is why we do what we do.." Ushinawa bites deep into the pad of his index finger again, strining together another sequence of seals and forces his chakra through the ground, hopefully bringing the serpant to life, and that is what he saw, a small creature that did not use it's words to communicate simply slithered by.* - Mon Sep 21 21:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) used his teeth to dig into the pad of his index finger, droplets of blood decline the base of the wounded appendage. Through the crafting of seals and the correct partitoning of his chakra he forces said palm ont the ground. He channels the force within his being, along with the blood-price to rip away some distant snakes resting place and bring it in front of him. It's slitted eyes, and pronged touch outstretched getting his smell once more.

Upon closer inspection it seemed to be the female snake he had conjured previously.

"Yesssss~" She'd coo again, her frame coling around his ankle and then weaving across his navel.

Once more the annoyed UShinawa mutters.
"Get off me.." She promptly departs into a puff of smoke.* - Mon Sep 21 22:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) slashed his index finger with another Kunai, the blood running down the course of his wrist. He strings another set of handseals in rapid sucession, from there he attempts to refine his chakra and spread it through the ground, the black symbols crawl along the ground and he is able to summon a snake at his side which promptly flees.* - Mon Sep 21 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) bit the pad of his index finger, the swelling appendage brought on a modicum of blood splatter. He'd promptly nail his hands together, individual shapes and forms gradually rising - all for the intended purpose of summoning a snake. His right hand slams into the ground beneath his feet, black lines proceed to expand over the area. Smoke rose into the depths of a cave to reveal a midnight black serpant with yellow eyes and narrow slits coming between them.* - Tue Sep 22 11:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wandered through the Land Of Rain for weeks. With Zetsumo dead, and his army dying off it was only a matter of time before the nation itself fell. Luckily he did not put all of his eggs into one basket, he ironically planned to dismantle the Zombie's reign himself. Ironically, the Speedstar known as Kenshin vanquished him before the Uchiha could make his move. "I suppose it's all the same." 

There as an lady, somewhat favoring his own mothers facial features that beckoned him over. She smelled of carrion and despair, it was easy to tell that she was on her way out. "Young-Man... Did you work for Zetsumo-Sama?" Hirusho replies with the nod of his head in the affirmative. 

"I see..." Her arms moved forth, swathed in bandages and numerous scars ran across her visage. "This nation... It's people.. We aren't all bad... We're just living, surviving... Just like the rest of the shinobi world.. You could say Zetsumo was evil, or say he was their savior for if it was not for him... They would'nt have been unified... I can see your future, what you intend to do is to bring peace... No matter what...."

Hirusho seemed to be unimpressed by her added foresight. His Sharingan's dull crimson washed over her forum gaguing her every movement as he did expect to be attacked, but no such action ever came. In-fact she seemed ot be almost relieved that he had shown himself, and even opted to interact. She continues to speak, her words muffled by pain and her past which was long lost in the depths of her mind.. 

"Everyone deserves to live in peace.. But it won't happen unless... PEople die.... You will die, and I will die... Everyone who lives in this world will die, but shouldn't they go peacefully? Yes, I know your journey has only yet begun.. I've woven a series of robes for decades.. Never feeling that it was perfect, or feeling anyone was worthy to wear them. BUt I can sense it deep within, you are different from the others... Tell me.... What will you do young-man? Now that Zetsumo is gone what is your next goal?"

Ushinawa draws his hand forth, a sack of ryo decends into her lap. With his free hand he draws across the side of her face, and responds in the softest manner possible. "To destroy the Gezo...."

Her mouth falls agape, her eyes driven into a frenzy. "-Then...... Hm....Child.. I want you to wear this... I want you to be my hope, whenever you don these robes it will remind you of why you live.. Of why you fight. I suppose an old lady like me can finally be at peace."* - Tue Sep 22 13:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Still.. I suppose there is still time for me to increase the speed at which I summon these infernal creatures.> Ushinawa was at it again, quickly attempting to craft handseals and drawing blood from his palm, then slinging the crimson across the ground. His lifeforce upon the cracked earth serving as a medium for the contract to be summoned from time and space and have it's presence drawn to it's summoner. Ushinawa draws away from the smoke and eyes the snake at his flank. There was nothing special about the snake, and it didn't even speak to him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) goes through the methodical cycle of weaving a few signs together. Once complete Ushinawa forms a ring over his mouth and condenses the Katon affinity in his core through his neck and out of his mouth. The expansive wave mixes with the surrounding oxygen and flashes spordically. The large body of crimson strikes a nearby tree and simply blows it away with the wind. 

He tries to follow up with another ball of fire but is met with a delay, it is something that could lead to his end on the battlefield so mastering the ability to fire off one jutsu after another was going to center his training regimen. This was just the start of what would be a very difficult concept for him to truly understand, but much like everything else it would take effort, something he had in abundance.* - Tue Sep 22 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) makes his way through the crowd. The village was still in good shape even with the recent demise of Zetsumo. Though his concern didn't lay with any one individual save one, upon seeing Mariana his eyes widen, and he makes his way to her. His arms were open as he intended to pull her into a hug. "I like your outfit."* - Tue Sep 22 15:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) noticed her curves through her clothing, his hands inch towards her hipline, his warm yet firm touch most likely connecting with the sides of her stomach that were exposed. His lips brush against her's, his mouth opening and tongue making it's way towards her mouth. If she indulged him in that way they'd most likely stand lip-locked for quite a while. 

Bad bitch indeed.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at the incoming Gezo official. His eyes perhaps checking to see if what he saw previous still remained, at a moments glance it appeared Ushinawa was doing something casual. Nonetheless, the development at hand meant that he'd have to go to Kirigakure, and soon. "I suspect I'll be on my way."* - Tue Sep 22 15:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) forms the Snake seal, followed by the Rat seal. His right arm extends forth, hopefully ushering the snake forth. Only it failed, and in-fact it failed to such a degree smoke tore through the area but he was forced off of his feet onto the blades of grass. His ass cushioned the fall, and with the dull thud of his failure came his anger. 

It wasn't anything major, he knew it would take a bit getting used to. Besides, he was a novice at summoning in this regard, but the fact that he was trying meant that he was sure to improve if he worked hard enough. <Now, for the second time..> The two seals were formed yet again, and through his outstretched arm a single snake flew forth, acting as a potential bind should anyone find themselves caught in it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) formulated the seals needed to bring on the jutsu's activation. "Remember this." He'd state. "When using fire you have to condense the chakra inside of your chest, and then knead it to it's most potent form possible. Then, once you've done all that you need to release the flames into a content burst of searing heat that can kill if someone found themselves caught. It is a fairly simple technique provided you have nature transformation down."* - Tue Sep 22 16:22:24 2015

She also saw Hirusho, Ushinawas original name and Gintoki. They were a family, but Misa was kidnapped, he'd see how they were ripped from their arms. He'd fastforward to the time he unlocked his Sharingan, writing into the childs mind what happened. Not only this, but also the death of his brother Gintoki. The images, no, the memories he had projected were given in an instant and would most likely prove to be very scary to the lad. Ushinawas right hand casually extends ruffling the child's hair. "Family is everything." He'd turn to Koeki, and mutter.
