<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Why? - Tue Sep 29 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: He was disrespectful, and rude. He talked down to me like I was some baby. - Tue Sep 29 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I asked him to take care of Katsune for me. - Tue Sep 29 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And I'd take care of Kilm. - Tue Sep 29 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You honestly think he'd do that for you? - Tue Sep 29 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It was a favor, and if he does it. Then I will return the favor. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So I suppose. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: This means you two no longer have ill will towards eachother. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I still want to kill him. Don't get me wrong. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I see. - Tue Sep 29 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: . . . . - Tue Sep 29 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Where is Kilm now? - Tue Sep 29 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Don't know. - Tue Sep 29 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Would you spar me, though? - Tue Sep 29 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Don't do anything yet. - Tue Sep 29 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 29 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was profoudnly shocked by his two tomoe coming into play. Ushinawa had to give him credit for unlocking the next stage. Hideki had trained well, and it was only a matter of time before he was able to reach this stage. "Impressive, Hideki, and not that I know of, but.... It seems there are more of us than we thought of." Ushinawa reaches for his Katana and extends the blade towards Hideki's arm that reached for the Gunbai, the other for his left thigh. 

"Still, don't get cocky.." Ushinawa's Sharingan had yet to be activated.* - Tue Sep 29 23:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Hideki had improved considering what he had been known of before. Ironically, so had Ushinawa in some respect. He found himself getting stronger as the day's went on, powered by the need to achieve the next stage in strength. Hideki dodged his attack which was impressive to say the least, but the male had to adjust to Ushinawa's speed which was great. Take into account the Uchiha's reflexes were also refined. If the snakes intended to make contact, their heads would've been gone in an instant, while in the same motion he is able to parry the blow and extend his blade towards Hideki's torso, and the other at his Gunai, this was made to force him back if he could manage.* - Wed Sep 30 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Wow.. He's fighting me with intent to defeat me. Never thought I'd see him like this..> Hideki's speed was truly something to marvel at, and Ushinawa knew he was no push-over. He raises his blades in the air with Hideki and attempts to make a lunge against the beings frame. Though, he was careful where to strike, he didn't want to maim his cousin, but he did want to defeat him. Following up to this he attempts to kick him in the fact, the initial sword blow leading him upwards, and then the real attack would be revealed through his kick.* - Wed Sep 30 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) due to Hideki side-stepping, Ushinawa would have to avert his blow. But it was avoided leading him to attacking once more, but, no, he could not attack Hideki at the moment. Raiton Chakra was building, and the Uchiha had seen this technique before, if he did kick the man he would've been struck. Instead of doing anything he dashes back and waits for his opponents next come.
"I think . . .That could've ended very badly for me."* - Wed Sep 30 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You haven't answered my previous question. - Wed Sep 30 00:25:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ...Yes. - Wed Sep 30 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He was killed by Kastya's sister. - Wed Sep 30 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So. - Wed Sep 30 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Fujitora mentioned Ko-Ko to be in the same clan as him, that means Fujitora also has the ability to unlock the same eyes as her... - Wed Sep 30 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: She did. - Wed Sep 30 00:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at Marissa, his Sharingan was active, three tomoe's shifting towards the woman's gaze. His intent was -very- cold, and she would no doubt be able to pick up his aura. "Move." He'd state.* - Thu Oct  1 19:41:00 2015

Veins popped out of his forearms, his temple, and his blood began to boil. "What the hell?" His pace increases and soon he is by her side in an instant, his right hand gliding across her cheek as soft as a feather. "Mariana....." He whispers. 

"Love... What happened?"* - Thu Oct  1 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) went deaf to the world, the only thing visible for the moment was his wounded wife. Bandages swathed over her form like some loose fitting cloak. Her wounded body has been something the Uchiha knew he would see at somepoint, but didn't know that it would be at the hands of Tetsujin. "That..... Rabid dog is going to be put down....." Ushinawas hand retracts, the veins in his palms surfacing once more as he clenched his fists with so much force blood was drawn and cascaded onto his wounded wife.. 

"Heiwa..." He was close to letting his son see what this world was truly about. He wanted him to see what it was like when someone you cared for was hurt, and what that feeling would do to you.. Your concern for their well-being quickly turns into wrath for the person who caused them suffering. However, he was going to let Mariana have her decency, no child should have to see their mother in such a state. 

"Turn your head, Heiwa.. Your mother is injured..."* - Thu Oct  1 20:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) turn towards the male who attempted to headbutt him, his ebony features focused onto the perpetrator. His full lips are parted by his tongue, a sliver of red flesh sweeping his teeth. Once he was done clearing his mouth, his hazel irises constrict, his broad pectoral muscles shifting, a nexus of veins running over his chiseled form.

"That wasn't polite, but I will forgive you.."* - Sun Oct  4 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) rests his -massive- arm on Storms shoulder if allowed, perhaps the weight of his arm would cause the male to stumble, not because of his physical strength however, it was moreso the result of it's girth.* - Sun Oct  4 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Storm(Sisbro55) says: Oh, my names Storm. - Sun Oct  4 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: She enters the caravan*_ - Sun Oct  4 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) opens his mouth, exposing his toothy grin. His pearly whites were sharp, and to such a refined degree it was almost unsettling. "Nice dog ya got there... Say..." His voice trailed off as he imagined having chow-mein with a side-dish of dog legs.

<Oh shit...>
It was obvious he was lost in his thoughts, but he was able to recover quickly.
"Where can I get one of them?"* - Sun Oct  4 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Storm(Sisbro55) says: --- - Sun Oct  4 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) chuckled. His dark skin was saturated with crystals of sweat. He raises his head upward slightly, allowing for his neck to rotate slightly. Storm would no doubt catch a glimpse of his hazel iris, with the pupil in the center, it was dilated due to the over-hanging sun. 

"The fuck?"
He'd shake his head in the negative.
"You gonna fight me for wantin a dog, bro?"
<Did I make it that obvious I wanted to eat his dog?>* - Sun Oct  4 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Chill the fuck out. - Sun Oct  4 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) blood was drawn as Storm intended. The rich crimson fluid ran down the appendage, but alas the sight of his blood didn't have the intended effect that Storm wanted. "......Yo, what...... The.....?"

Then a change, his mental state was flipped on it's head. Seeing his life-force ebb from his veins, to feel the sting of the blow from Storm's attack. He warned him to chill out, and now he couldn't be stopped.

"I"M GONNa FUCKING RIP YOU aPaRT YOU SHRIMP DICKED FaGGOT!" He aimed to punch him in the face, and the torso with all the strength he could muster, which, admittedly wasn't much.* - Sun Oct  4 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) was able to match Storm's speed. He underestimated him in that regard so that when he ran away from him, Kojiro attempted to strike him while he did so, with his full strength in-fact. He was attempting to strike the lad's unguarded face, if his blow was allowed to go through Storm could be sent flying to the ground potentially.* - Sun Oct  4 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Fuck up.." Kojiro's fists were rushing to bring Storm under another barrage of savage blows. They were attempts, but he wasn't going to let up. Especially when his opponent was being so rambunctious. No doubt, if Storm didn't have the defensive faculties to resist his previous blow, he might've been stunned a bit slightly. Kojiro was no Hercules but his punches were not to be underestimated. "Fuck... Fuck... Fuck... Fuck....! Once I fuck you... I'm going to make your dog fuck you next!" 

It was clear he had lost all sense of reason.* - Sun Oct  4 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <The fuck is this shit?> Kojiro looked at the defeated Storm, a look of anger clearly riddling his features. He reaches into his pants, and unsheathes his ball-sack from the depths of his clothing, and then as he stood over the defeated Inuzuka he descends, his wrinkled nut-sack clashing against his opponents forehead. 
"GET SOME!"* - Sun Oct  4 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <Nani?!> The tissue immediately swells. His knuckles did a fair job of bruising the area, a small ripple started with his butt-cheek, the epicenter expands causing him to tumble forward, his already damaged frame yielding to the strength of his opponent. "Hrng....." He grunts as the ground splays. 

He lies in the makeshift crater.* - Sun Oct  4 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) Niza's speech worked to calm his nerves but Kojiro was compulsive, and highly reactive to those around him. The fact that Bernadotte vomitted on him yet again made him beyond livid. The fluid slid down his chest, and through the waistband of his boxers. The last piece of clothing he had on his body hand been stained, save his arm banadages. He wanted to slam his knuckles against the bridge of Bern's noise, but for this one he showed restraint. 

He takes off the last article of clothing on his body present and cast it aside. His man-hood swings valiantly across his hip. "Move.." He mutters as softly as possible.* - Sun Oct  4 05:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) dodges that shit and moves away, as it is assumed that he can, no contact was made, but from being attacked from randoms, having his clothing sullied, and generally annoyed it was clear that he was going to have to get serious. Lightning takes over his form, and his reflexes and strength rise tenfold, and he reaches outwards in the attempt to punch the lady in the face with the veil of lightning saturating his frame.

<Raiton No Yori..> He'd think to himself.* - Sun Oct  4 06:09:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) formed a fist and began to assault the mountain. His left fist was sent crashing against the stone at his side, then his right fist followed through. The initial collision tore into the bed of skin under his knuckles, blood pours from the area that was starting to rend. Ironically, there was no signs of stoppong for the young male, he did pause momentarily to wrap handbandages around his hands. He takes off again, the acceleration continues to build towards critical mass. The pain was starting to take a toll, but in all honesty all of this served a purpose, and a vital one.

In order to become stronger one had to desensitize their body. It was a process that was gradual, and it was a difficult one. There was only so much the human body could tolerate. Mental strength and physique were all factors towards the pursuit of trying to break the next plateau. In order to inculcate the proper mindset for training one's body they had to endure. That is what it all came down to.

"Heh..." 
Kojiro pulls away with his fist in tatters. Bandages no longer swathed his forearm, they were but threadless masses now. He looks on to see the faint marks on the surface, the marker of his presence upon the mountain's exterior were the faint marks of vermillion strewn across the rockface.* - Sun Oct  4 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) stood at six foot two so the fact that Amon stood over him was yet something else that the Yamanshi could hold against him. It seemed that the man wished to defeat him in almost everything that they did, even when it came to their training regimen. Well, Kojiro wasn't a sissy-bitch, and although he intended to stop he sure as hell wasn't going to do it now. In-fact this seemed to spark his initiative, more blows were driven into the rock-formation. 
The stones carved into his knuckles and splayed the remnants of skin into his bandages.
