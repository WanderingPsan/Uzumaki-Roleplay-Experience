Hirusho was able to tell that it had hit him on some level but as stated before he wasn't aware of the scale.

The wind comes in hard at this point, pushing in tumbleweeds and kicking up pebbles, dust trails into the skies and for once Ushinawa is pleased. The black haired teen of Kumogakure walks forth with intentions of leaving the area entirely. But as he makes his way out of the area his gaze rests upon Beth. It was obvious that he didn't like the girl, especially after what she did to Mariana. "I do want you to know this much, however. Fuji and I used to be great friends, or so he thought.

Still, he disliked to see Katsune put in a situation like this, not because he favored her over the others but because she seemed to be the most human out of the lot.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wondered how long it would be before Beth was at it in-some way. It went without saying that things wouldn't continue how they were with people arguing as if they had they luxury to. Ushinawa didn't really mind it as he kept to himself but even he found himself getting pulled in at times. To make matters worse he was sure that Kirigakure was goading him about the Kiba-Blades that had been stolen from him. Their messages really only proved to encite his anger but it was clear that they wanted something, something that he wouldn't rightfully give. It wasn't even so much that he knew what it was, truth be told, rather it was the fact they wanted anything at all. They had gotten what they wanted, what more could they ask for? Oh, yes, there was always more with everyone and while the teenager again didnt care for it he found himself dragged by its pull.

Slowly, his brows tense and the veins on the sides of his temples pop in unison. His Sharingan picks up several chakra signatures and he gagues their intensity, to barely a wisp to a literal fountain of azure. It was odd seeing how they reacted in this form, and it took time to adjust, time getting used to using his Sharingan regularly, it always consumed chakra and stamina but he was dealing with the strain of his eyes like it was a simple matter.

<Hm...> There was still so many unanswered questions he had about everyone, even more so about himself. He wondered just how much the Gezo knew of his doujutsu, or others doujutsu. He wondered how long they would sit on their gilded thrones and throw people sticks to gnaw on and hopefully seek recognition. It was disgusting in it's own right to be played like this but alas every chess player, or individual had a board to play, and their pieces.

"Hmmmm... I wonder how long they are going to stay on that island of theirs."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) chuckles lightly as he saw how quickly Hideki was defeated, and although Zetsumo angered him with his comment of his kin being less than impressive it was true. However, Hanabi had made her first mistake, using several jutsus in a setting against an unknown opponent was sure to trip them, but Ushinawa had not only seen this technique not once, but twice. He takes a step forward, glancing at Hanabi's eye-line casually. "You are quite a repulsive creature, how about going up against someone who could keep up with you?"

He'd inquire.* - Wed Sep 16 18:36:22 2015

In reality perhaps a scene of Hanabi talking to the others was taking place, but, in reality if she didn't have the mental fortitude she'd be blank-facing into space.

It was fortunate that he had someone like Mariana to center his emotions when he felt things were becoming a bit much. He calmly makes his way to the lady in question and wraps his arms around her body. From there he draws her into his chest, close enough to pick up her scent.* - Wed Sep 16 20:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"No tears here, no emotion..", he mutters the statement low, just enough for her to hear. His warmth that he offered to her was very different from what it usually was. He found himself able to return to some form of normalcy when they were together. "H-n...." He smiles lightly while letting his arms tighten around her frame, while her chest remained his left hand ascended and cuffed the back of her head.

"Don't worry..."* - Wed Sep 16 20:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Mariana was certainly nothing to underestimate, as she took her first steps his Sharingan was already hot onto her person. Her movements came in quick and controlled, she was a very skilled fighter that couldn't be underestimated. Still, there was one thing that Mariana would have to account or and that was UShinawas visual prowess, that is what enabled him to react with his reflexes almost as if he could predict her movements. "Direct attacks like that..." He moves to the side as her second blow comes in before drawing his blade from his sheathe in one fluid motion.

"Will have no effect." He intends to slap the blunt end of the blade across her ass with both shafts, if it connected it would most certainly sting unless she had naturally defenses against his attack.* - Wed Sep 16 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: ^ - Wed Sep 16 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What kind of spar.. - Wed Sep 16 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) the idea of being precognitive in battle is something most shinobi yearned for. To be able to anticipate one's movements before they even knew what they were going to was possible with the Sharingan. Ushinawa observed the incoming kick that was sure to collide with his body if he did not move. Quickly, his tomoe revolved and provided the image of her strike, the trajectory of the swing and all.
<Fast... Precise... Impressive...> The Uchiha had nothing for praise for his lover but he wasn't going to go down that easily. He moved even before she could clear the attack and reappeared a few feet away with a maelstrom of leaves spiraling around his person, he'd resheathe his blades and look onto Mariana with his crimson optics. 

"Come..."* - Wed Sep 16 20:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <What is that conjuration of chakra taking place in the base of her fist?> Yes, nothing was hidden from Ushinawa's gaze, before she prepared to drive her ist into the dirt he glances into her eyes before shooting upwards, yes, he had literally jumped into the air whilst distancing himself from his love. While in the air he knew he was subject to being attacked, and because of this he would move promptly with his handseals. 

When he was finished with this sequence he'd force Mariana to move.
<Fire Style: Great Fire-Ball Technique....> Just like that a roaring orb of crimson flames descended onto her position but not directly where she was, rather it was directed towards the various debris and damage she had caused.
She would no doubt be unable to pursue striking him or she would have to face his flames.* - Wed Sep 16 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) landed onto the ground with embers brushing past his facial features. "I apologize, I simply thought you wanted to fight me when I am at my best...." Still, it should be taken into consideration he never explained the process of how his Sharingan was able to draw people in with just eye-contact, and for good reason it was to make sure people didn't do what Mariana did now. But it was fair to say she would be able to gague he was stronger with his Sharingan active. He'd promptly deactivate it and simply smirk in Mariana's direction.
"Sure....." He reaches into his back-pouch where his action is concealed from her but inside of his palm? Several shuriken.* - Wed Sep 16 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) |"Of course... " Ushinawa finds this spar to be something he enjoyed rather greatly. It was unfortunate that his lover was trying to throw into the towel, ironically that was something that simply couldn't be allowed. "You know it... I do wonder how strong you've come, and it is smart that you have those Kunai....Because..." Ushinawas hand flings the projectile forth with a fair amount of speed backing it, but the thing was that these projectiles were illuminated with flame! Yes, to flaming shuriken made it's way for Mariana's shoulders, left and right respectively....* - Wed Sep 16 21:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"..." Ushinawa knew he was going too far, his lover was indeed very angry about having her arm slashed with the searing projectile. Though as she threw the Kunai he unsheathes his blade in a fluid motion deflecting not only the initial Kunai but also the second shuriken, however he wasnt fast enough for the last one that bit into his forearm.. Blood trailed down his wrist and he displayed an indifferent face, he was in pain, but he simply didn't give any indication he was.

"Very good....." He mutters  before plucking the metallic star out of his body. He'd quickly make his way to Mariana with concerned optis narrowing onto her injury. * - Wed Sep 16 21:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) arrives.* - Wed Sep 16 23:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) snarled under his breath as he observed Hanabi's deed. He had warned her once before to leave him alone, but she never really listened to what he had to say. Due to her fighting style he knew it would be foolish to attack her with Taijutsu as her underlings would be quick to defend her, so instead he unsheathes his dual blades in a fluid motion and aims to carve moderate lacerations into her skin, not enough to maim her entirely, additionally his swords were imbued with flame so if the snakes did appear they faced the prospect of being burned if they did not adjust to his fighting style.* - Wed Sep 16 23:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) withdrew from Hanabi momentarily, both of his arms curve downwards allowing for the flame to die down and the blod that kept on his blade to stain the ground beneath his feet. He'd blur towards Hideki and glances at him while still training his attention on the surrounding development. "I warned you, now back away from him."* - Thu Sep 17 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "You've poured your filth down my Kin's throat, you vile abomination... What have you to say about what you've done.. You have no consideration for what you were doing..." Ushinawa wouldn't do anything else to harm Hanabi, the sting of steel ringing against her flesh would've been more to encite enough agony.

"Undo what you did, now...."* - Thu Sep 17 00:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This was all my fault.. If only I was stronger.. And not so careless. - Thu Sep 17 00:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: You son of a bitch, you did do something to him! Why?!  - Thu Sep 17 00:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wished that he had not cut into Hanabi for one reason, and that was so he could beat her into the ground with his fists alone. "You've got a-lot to answer for... His not prey that you can stalk and change him at a moments notice... Do you think I will tolerate you abusing him in this matter? Does he look like that one lady whom you speak of going into her ass? No, he is not one of your boy-toy play-things, and I suggest that if you wish to remain whole that you do not touch him again .  . . Because next time I'm going to make you scream..."* - Thu Sep 17 00:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Believe her? That bit--... what did she do to you again? - Thu Sep 17 00:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: SHE BLEW HER LOaD IN HIS MOUTH! - Thu Sep 17 00:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Some sort of fluid she had in her mouth, she basically forced me to swallow it. - Thu Sep 17 00:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I'm not taking that. - Thu Sep 17 00:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: - - Thu Sep 17 00:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) |"No..." Ushinawa muttered. He had -zero- intentions of killing Hanabi but he was certainly going to make her pay for what she had done. Slowly but surely he made his way to the wounded female. "Mariana, heal her wounds .. .Please... I am not finished with getting every bit of information from this harlots mouth."* - Thu Sep 17 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Could I knock her out? - Thu Sep 17 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...Do I want to test it now.. - Thu Sep 17 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Or later.. - Thu Sep 17 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Ushinawa is maybe high or drunk or retarted as fffffffffffuck. - Thu Sep 17 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: He wants me to heal her? Fine. I get a chance to get closer to her. One punch. Dead. - Thu Sep 17 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Yo.. - Thu Sep 17 00:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"Thank you, Mariana. : He turns his attention to Hanabi, his onyx orbs carefully reflecting each detail of the beast that stood before him. Her form reminded him of a beast who had been wounded and was reaching out for help, only it was Hanabi who was the cause of her own suffering. "You owe him answers... Tell us what you've done.... You are like a predator who preys upon the weak, sadly you will find that I will not tolerate such things... I'm sure Zetsumo will not be a fan of what you're doing either....." * - Thu Sep 17 01:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) |"I see.." Ushinawa had kicked himself many times over for not knowing such an essential skill, but it seemed that fate was in his favor, or to be more precise, Hideki. The young-male offered an olive branch in the form of a technique. "I suppose I should begin then..." He forms the ram seal and attempted to focus his chakra into the soles of his feet. When he had done this he parts his hands and extends his foot against the fence at his back.. <Nani?> 

His foot simply brushed off the side of the surface like nothing at all, and even though this was something that truly annoyed him he would use this as a learning experience as to what happens when too little chakra is used in the attempt to adhere on a surface... <I see... If you add too little then you will simply fall, too much and well.....> He glances at the fence again once more forming his hands into the ram seal.

From there he channels the chakra in his core to his feet, a few moments pass as an azure aura took possession of his sandals. <Let's try this once more....> He gets a running start and manages to make it to the half-way point before the fence splinters through his foot-falls, an erupting chasm of wood splays forward forcing him to raise his forearm to shield himself from the debris... <Too much and you just repel yourself... But... If it's just right...>

He takes several seconds to partition his chaka corectly. The nodes at his feet reacting well to this change, it was a stark constrast as to what he felt before... He gives himself a running start once more and this time he makes it all the way, but now that he stood on the top he needed to cease his acceleration or he'd simply fall off the side, to compensate for the added momentum he activates Suimen yet again and descends the other side of the fence gracefully.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glanced at Hanabi with fire burning in his eyes. He was tired of the condition that his cousin was in, he had no control over this transformation and it seemed as if it was killing him. There a force the young woman would be able to sense, it was dangerous and the implications of his presence here did not bode well, as it seemed he was waiting for her show. "If he dies..." He cuts off his speech mid sentence to emphasize how dire this situation really was. Instead of speaking his left hand ascends to the Katana dangling from his hip, his fingers collapsed around the hilt and then clench with so much strength the blue veins under his demis were clearly seen.

"Fix him.."* - Thu Sep 17 15:15:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) squinted a bit harder after noticing the ripple pattern on his eyes for a second time.. In addition there was a weird chakra clinging to the suface, in all honest Ushinawa was not certain what it was, nor did he care as it wasn't his business what traits this child had inherited from his parents. He did note the other body of chakra seeping out of the kids body however, even with his Sharingan tucked away he remembered every iota of information. 

He'd bring his left hand and rub the exterior of his chin. Onxy optics narrowed at the individual in question, it was intense but it was not hostile in the slightest. In-fact the boy's isolation reminded of a younger Hirusho. 

However he assmued it was neglect on his parents part.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Most of the nations were isolated, or so he was led to believe. He wasn't sure about Konoha and Kumogakure, or Sunagakure for that matter. Like rodents they all seemed to truncate inside of Kirigakure, perhaps a common meeting ground was indeed in order, and if Niza was as noble as he was led to believe it would be fair. Still, Zetsumo's inside did save him a great of trouble, he was right in not going to Kirigakure, especially alone... But perhaps... Somewhere close enough to Zetsumo would suffice.
"I will ask them to go to Konohagakure.. The Land Of Fire..."* - Thu Sep 17 18:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) nods promptly - That was acceptable in his eyes, he trust that Mariana would be fine. Not only because he thought Zetsumo had more pressing matters to attend to but also because Mariana was truly explosive. He had often been killed many times as a youth for surprising in her in a lewd fashion. 

He was glad he'd be allowed passage because he knew Niza would never pass unless he could get through.. This was the chance he was waiting for, to challenge the Raikage for not only his wealth, and power, but also his men which would greatly bolster Zetsumo's fighting force, at least if all went as planned in this duel.

His lucid aura clung to his being, which was a testament to his annoyance at the Kumogakure, and the shinobi world in general. "Hear me well.." He mutters as he walks through the streets his sandals kicked up a modicum of dust, and uprooted pebbles at his feet. The chakra within his core became profound, the elevation of his Katon affinity finally reaching it's apex.
"Katon....."
Following the string of seals he forms a ring around his lips, a formless ball of fire was manipulated into a Dragon's maw that struck the base of the mansion. It's entire structure would be tested against his fire, but alas no such thing be it wood or steel would resist the billowing flames. Innocents, men, women, and children - if they were in the way the died.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) quickly unsheathed a Kunai with an explosive tag, and threw it in the boy's direction. He not only understood the handseals, but also ascertained the technique due to his not so subtle screaming of the composition, addtionally this -smoke-screen would play against him as Ushinawa moved -way- faster than an average Genin. He'd form the tiger seal whilst it was on his way to the lad while accelerating to the side, the result? To have his own jutsu detonate in his face, literally.* - Thu Sep 17 19:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) read the fire ball-jutsu rushing in, roaring flames tearing forth and if he was hit? Indeed, it would be bad.. However, his reflexes and speed were on par with a Jounin, and as such as he moved he whisks together a series of seals. In an instant a literal wave of lightning was meant to catch Haru and tear into his being, enough to punch a hole through him, but he was not aiming for vitals, simply to put him down with a serious injury. <Begone...>
Indeed he was too quick for the man's flame, but could Tatagami outrun his lightning?* - Thu Sep 17 19:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Will of fire or not it didn't matter what the boy did now. .. His wounds were serious, but not enough to kill him at least not yet. If he pushed himself he would in-fact bleed out, it was time or him to save his energy as he too would be claimed by death if he squirmed around too much.

"Hmph.." He glances at the male casually, with the illuminating qualities of his gaze, he quickly accelerates and ends up near his flank.

Yes, all it took was a glance and he'd feel as if his world was simply closing on him, even forming the handseals for Kai would most likely be a difficult endeavor, and while this happened he aimed to exploit his back, his sword coming together in a fluid motion and attemted to send his blades into a male's neck, a soft spot of the human body, it didn't matter how much you trained it, much like the eyes, however with his came his prowess with the Sharingan, he intentionally missed his jugular, and instead aimed to seriously injure him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) His ninjutsu was fast, but not nearly enough to stop him entirely. His Sharingan allowed him to anticipate the jutsu's manifestation as it was coming in. Either-way his intentions went on as if Yan's Doton affinity had did little if any. But now he was annoyed with the males display of might in this situation..
Still, he wasn't out to kill Niza entirely, this was him taking back something he felt belonged to him, though, ironically he had no intentions of keeping it for himself. With this he'd begin his acceleration towards Yan, it was obvious that UShinawa showed no intentions of holding back at this point.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||The acceleration was a ruse on Ushinawas part and there was no indication as to what was happening was a Genjutsu, mainly because all it really did was give him false perceptions of the fight, Usniawa eluded the rocks once more, but in reality he was making his way towards the Summon in question. This trance like state was all he needed out of Yan, his true target being Niza...

<Repulsive beast..... But I will need him...>
"Conjure the beast once more.. We are leaving.."* - Thu Sep 17 20:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) Ushinawa was putting himself at risk for this but he wasn't going to let Niza get away from this. He condenses the chakra in his chest and attempts to manipulate it in the form of a Dragons maw, his attempted escape, and mortal wound as well as the lingering flames would prove to put him in a very bad way..
<This is the end...> He'd chant as a -massive- Dragon's maw attempts to implode on the escaping mans being. 
"Do not summon the creature..."* - Thu Sep 17 21:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||The Sharingan allowed him to observe Niza's movement, and it was a very mpressive gesture. However he had jumped high and Ushinawa timed on his descent, it didn't matter how fast you were when you jumped into the air because you were still left a sitting duck. Handseals were woven in spite of this, he knew Niza wasn't at one percent intentionally through this and this is what he aimed to do. He aimed to time his descent with the crafting of his neck jutsu, with the sole intent of splaying the wave towards Niza's blind spot and frying his synapses for a prompt knock out if it, it was him attempting to maximize the full power of Jibashi, but of course one had to account for his armor and troublesome fur, but this is why Ushinawa aimed at the head but still his jutsu acted in a way that it produced a wave, but by the end of this he deactivates his Sharingan.* - Thu Sep 17 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <It seems that I will have to take the risk...> Ushinawa muses to himself as he prepares to embark on what would be one of his boldest moves yet. He knew Niza wasn't one hundred percent, what with this injury but neither was UShinawa, believe it or not it was a bitch to use this much chakra and he hated himself for his earlier move. But he couldn't worry about that now, the Sharingan returns on his visage while he readies his blades, whilst in the same motion he pulls his blades out of its sheathe and attempts to add further injury to his neck by the swing of both blades. He aimed for the same spot and ventured deep, this is what he hoped would put the nail in the coffin, although not literally. He just needed Niza to fall, but the man was fighting for his life, still, with this attack he timed in tandem with his Sharingan he wondered how the man would react after being previously stunned somewhat, and taking into account of his position.* - Thu Sep 17 22:19:31 2015
