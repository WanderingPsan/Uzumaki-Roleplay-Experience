<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Come. - Mon Oct 12 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's go train. - Mon Oct 12 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Got it. - Mon Oct 12 14:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You going to train the water jutsu? - Mon Oct 12 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 12 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I'll do that right now. - Mon Oct 12 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I've mastered the other jutsu you've taught me, however. - Mon Oct 12 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 12 14:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll practice my earth jutsu. - Mon Oct 12 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Suiton..> Nozumi slams his hands together and works on concentrating the chakra inside of his stomach.  He could feel the energy inside of his being rise with this acceleration of chakra, and it's strength was vast.  Seveal waves of Suiton infused chakra slam into the base of the mountain compressing large amounts of land against eachother. Nozumi wipes th ends of his mouth and drops to the ground, using his left knee to support his body and keep himself upright.

"Okay, let's try this all over again..." Yes, it was true that his chakra wasn't as refined as it should've been, and as a result he had trouble using high powered Ninjutsu such as Exploding Water Shock-Wave." <LEt's do this all over again, heh...>

Nozumi is at it formulating handseals yet again, then, he opens his maw and saturates the ground with his chakra that was now enveloping large amounts of the battlefield. Nozumi was going to need a break after this rough training session so for now he allows his pools recover, and so with this he collapses on the ground and let's the day go by until he can do it all over again.* - Mon Oct 12 14:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you master the jutsu I gave you . . . I'll buy you two popcicles. - Mon Oct 12 14:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Thank you, Sensei. - Mon Oct 12 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I will do my best. - Mon Oct 12 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct 12 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's what I want to hear from you. - Mon Oct 12 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fills my heart that you're doing your best. - Mon Oct 12 14:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) pushes himself off of the ground. Sand had already begun to cake under his finger-nails from having to work through these arid conditions. However, for all intents and purposes his body was adapting well, and thanks in part to his mastery over the jutsu he found that it was easier to use said technique consecutively. <Suiton...> The chakra inside of his core was being channeled carefully, and with this both of his cheeks protrude as he does his best to bring the jutsu into fruition .

Gaint waves of azure dance on the battlefield, cascading waves over-lap into countless, smaller, although equally powerful torrents of compressed fluid. <This sure takes a lot of chakra...> Nozumi thinks to himself. The Uzumaki is still doing his best to force the mixture at a higher frequency, outputting most of the water that he could manage.

<Come on....> He formulates another seal, that being Snake, and he is able to create yet another torrent of explosive water that crashed onto the sandy battlefield which could quite possibly topple over anything it came into contact with. Yes, this was a truly difficult task to work on, and in theory he could master it he just needeed more time to adjust to the highly draining jutsu at hand.

He collapses again and takes some much needed time to rest. <Yes...I can feel at this rate I'll actually be able to master such a difficult jutsu, I just need more time, and from the looks of it I'm going to be here a while..>* - Mon Oct 12 14:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Wow, that's not that bad. - Mon Oct 12 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Of reusing words - Mon Oct 12 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) formulates the snake seal, the matter inside of his chest is condensed to such a high degree that it is nearly impossible to tell that something was not coming. When he did open his maw several waves surged, the ripple currents were formidable and were capable of catching people off guard, and potentially drown them had they not been careful and moved out of the way. But due to the spread of this technique it was highly unlikely that an opponent would be able to dodge such a technique unless they had expert evasion skills.

This technique did have immensive offensive, as well as defensive capabilities, but the Uzumaki wondered what would happen if the opponent was able to endure the currents, and attempt to hide in the depths of the make-shift ocean for a surprise attack. <I'll have to work on my senses next.. I can't have myself falling victim to an attack like that or else I'll be in trouble...> 

Once Nozumi took note of this he was back-at it again. The male clapses his hands together and the chakra is once again building inside of his torso. It was a blessing that he had some form of impressive chakra-pools or else he would've been unable to use this technique twice, back to back.* - Mon Oct 12 14:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: For another go.. - Mon Oct 12 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||Nozumi had a lot to consider now. Kilm had some very good points about how he should view the shinobi world, it was a truly terrible place in which people perished everyday. There was a constant struggle of ethics, everyone always that themselves to be right, only for another person to contest their way of thinking, and living and attempt to impose their will onto others. 

Countless died because of the lack of understanding between shinobi. Humans were truly a complicated people, and their make-up consisted of several factors that were not entirely understood. Even for the genius of Konohagakure ,the Yellow-Fang, he still had much to learn.

<I will remember everything you've taught me over this short period of time... I truly want nothing more than the world to be a safe place where men, and women can live in harmony and understand eachothers feelings, and we'll only get there with people like us helping others one step at a time... Now for me to take my first step, not only as a human-being of planet Earth, but as a shinobi of Konohagakure No Sato!>

Veins appear on the side of his temple, and he works to channel the various chakra nodes inside of his body to work in tandem. When this was done he could feel the tightening of massive energy well in his abdomen. <Come on....> Nozumi opens his mouth at the last second unleashing a massive torrent of watery swells meant to encompass targets in it's massive embrace. There was so much mass carried behind the body of water that he had to crane his neck upwards in order to truly see it. 

The sound of crashing waves rocked the Land Of Wind. Nozumi looked on, a look of genuine determination. <I promised.... I would help others, and by this they will help me... It is my greatest desire to see that we all understand eachother one-day... So I must thank you for this lesson, Sensei... I don' know where I would be without you...>* - Mon Oct 12 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Finished The earth shadow clone. - Mon Oct 12 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So. - Mon Oct 12 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: -- - Mon Oct 12 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I should get to work on that D rank genjutsu. - Mon Oct 12 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: You work fast. - Mon Oct 12 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright . . . Learned this genjutsu. - Mon Oct 12 15:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) unlike Kilm Nozumi wasn't able to master techniques so quickly. For him, he had to take the proper amount of time to study the smallest detail, break it up into a series of steps and try to replay it perfectly. This process was fine when it came to low-level techniques like Kai where one only had to cut their chakra flow and restart it. This current jutsu was more complicated, and required more time to master it.

Chakra control was paramount for this jutsu, and that was something Nozumi did not have. He used a lot of chakra trying to use even basic techniques, and that was something he'd put an end to once he had more time to train. <Let's go....> "Ha!" Both of his hands slam together, the snake seal coming into view. Massive amounts of chakra swirl inside of his body, and the elevation of his chakra could be felt by sensors in the distance. 

<Now... It should be....> Seveal maelstroms are created, the whirlpool-esqe formation changing once it changed it's shape into the form of several waves. This time he even manages to cause the ocean to ascend the mountain he stood behind. * - Mon Oct 12 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see that it's hard for you to learn that jutsu. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's why I'll buy you two popcicles by slightly improving it instead. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Which you already did. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: It is... But I'm not going to quit. - No, Sensei, I -will- master this. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I know I can. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's good. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Determination and motivation is very good. - Mon Oct 12 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Yes, if I'm going to live up to my name, and yours... I will need to be determined. - Mon Oct 12 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) had this shine on his face that read of intense determination. Kilm had been correct in his observation that Nozumi was amped by even the slightest improvement. It showed that even a difficult technique like this was possible to learn provided the person had the proper facilities, and will. 

Nozumi had both, and that much was certain because he did not miss a beat. Both of his digits contort at this moment in-time, the weaved seal allowed the male to venture into his chakra reserves. Now that he had tapped into said power his elemental affinity takes over. 

"Suiton... Exploding Water Shock Wave!" The rushing swells were the first thing he noticed, then the pillars of water that spawned from his mouth, it's shape rising to touch the heavens, or so it appeared. In this state it almost seemed as if the wave suspended itself over nothing, and in this state of stasis he admired it's beauty. The formless mass was a bottled storm, it left him awe stricken.
 
<Ugh.... Heh, looks like I have to back up what I say..> Nozumi is knocked out his ass from fatigue, he is now looking up at Kilm, and he gives a thumbs up promptly. "I'm okay, Sensei..." That was the truth, but he was now drenched in sweat, and it was obvious that he hadn't worked this hard in a long, long time. "I just need a break..."* - Mon Oct 12 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) recovers his energy after a brief, but refreshing break. He could now work on the jutsu without risk of collapsing on the floor exerting his chakra. The blonde haired boy is working to craft a single seal that was brought chest level. For whatever reason utilizing this jutsu was a bit painful, he could feel his tissues ache with uncertainty.  

But no amount of pain was going to distract him from what he needed to do. To be honest Nozumi had a lot of work to do if he was going to reel mastery of this technique in. Even now his chakra reserves were not one hundred percent, he was tired, and he didn't want to kill himself over training. He too was losing a bit of his drive, but he wasn't going to stop because of it. He knew there would be intense effort, and intense reward.

Whatever you did, you had to reap the consequences. He wanted to become stronger, that much is apparent, but he didn't know how to go about it all the way. It was a blessing that Kilm had decided to take him under his wing, he would have time to truly prosper, but right now he wouldn't think of that as his next task was to master said technique.

Both of his hands come together, the suiton based chakra combining with his spiritual energies. Large amounts of water that take the forms of waves topple over themselves and were meant to sweep away anything in his path.* - Mon Oct 12 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <I guess I'm going to do this all over-again.> Thus begins another attempt in trying to master the jutsu at hand. Utilizing the Suiton element was different from the others, water was fluid, and formless. It was honestly one of the most versatile techniques because of it's ability to defend, as well as attack. It's real weakness was doton, but it did put out fire rather easily.

With this in mind he imagines a large body of fire making its way towards him. Swifly he forms a seal and unleashes a torrent of water into the way of the make-shift flame. He imagines the flames buckle from having been tested against the waters. When all had died down in his mind he observes his water veering off into the horizon.* - Mon Oct 12 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This genjutsu is hard. - Mon Oct 12 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Gotta improve it a bit. - Mon Oct 12 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Then I'll master Fire Dragon Bullet. - Mon Oct 12 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I learned Fire Dragon Bullet. - Mon Oct 12 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: --.... - Mon Oct 12 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I'm still struggling currently. - Mon Oct 12 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I believe that you'll get the hang of it. - Mon Oct 12 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Keep going. - Mon Oct 12 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) was going to be a this all day if he had to. There wasn't going to be any sort of end to his training until he had mastered. He forms the seal necessary to activate the jutsu, but he was slowing down. The jutsu was complex, not so much because of the concept but the chakra it took to create it. This wasn't something that you could keep doing in the hopes of mastering it, you had to make sure you were careful about your chakra consumption, and everything.* - Mon Oct 12 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) started training his jutsu again. Nozumi was feeling a tad bit demotivated. This strain on his body was starting to add up. This much effort for something that he wouldn't be able to use regularly was upsetting him, but it had to be done. This was very difficult for him to sustain but he formulates a single handseal, and then a massive wave of water rushes from his mouth and crashes into the rock-face with immense force.* - Mon Oct 12 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You going to keep training Nozumi? - Mon Oct 12 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 12 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 12 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll go to the square. - Mon Oct 12 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be there if you need me. - Mon Oct 12 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) No, he wasnt going to give up at this point. Kilm was going at it pretty hard, and Nozumi promised that he would master the jutsu. He didn't want to be regarded as a failure by his master so he planned it out to where he would improve. These improvements were strict devotion towards complete, and utter mastery of the jutsu that had been passed down to him.

He slams his hands together and uses the chakra in his body to ignite a waterfall of raging intensity meant to chip away at any foundation that presented itself in the vicinity.* - Mon Oct 12 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I did my best... It's close, but still not perfected... I'm sorry, Sensei. - Mon Oct 12 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No worries. - Mon Oct 12 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll buy you ice cream for your efforts. - Mon Oct 12 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||"Thank you, Kilm. Heh." Nozumi's right hand reaches for the cone, the chocolate went well with the sprinkles, the cold cream only made it better as he ate it. Delicious indeed.
"It's good.."* - Mon Oct 12 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Oct 12 18:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I honestly forgot about it. - Mon Oct 12 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) "Got it.." Nozumi reaches into the weapon holster on his right thigh, and then tosses a Kunai towards the real Katsune. While all of this was taking place he thought it best to run forward, he wasn't going to use ninjutsu because the one technique that he knew was too destructive to use during the course of a spar. In his other hand he pulls together yet another Kuani.

One thing was for sure, even though none of his actions were impressive it was clear he was motivated to win.* - Mon Oct 12 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <This isn't good.> Nozumi notices the incoming feet, but it was too late. He is caught flat-footed, the ladies heels dig into what she thought would be his face but his right arm raises to parry the strike, though given the lack of his physical power he is thrown backwards. His heels clipping against the settlement as he attempts to slow down his momentum. 

"Wo..Woah!" When he regains his foot he accelerates, his left hand reaching into the confines of his waist-band, parchment was scattered, a hand pressed against it's surface.

Smoke rises off of the ground, and soon several shuriken - about four in total are thrown towards the real Katsune. Two of them towards the clone.

<Guess it's around that time I get serious or else I could break a bone...>
His cobalt eyes narrow tightly.
"I've got it.."* - Mon Oct 12 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Damn..> No time to move, and even if he used the jutsu like he wanted to it would certainly prove to work against him. <Water is weak against doton, it's unfortunate I didn't come with a plan.. But... I guess all I can do now is ride the storm..> There was no way to defend against this at this point, he is carried away with the torrent of mud.

"Erugh..." * - Mon Oct 12 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) is dragged out of the raging torrent of mud, his body is slammed against her heel, and then thrown violently to the side. <Ugh..> His body wasn't really able to deal with direct hits, especially when her hits were as hard as they were. His eyes couldn't even keep up with her speed at all. 

He is seen skidding across the ground, eventually coming to a stop until he is laying on the ground, stomach first. He struggles to his feet, but it should be noted that he was pretty beat up, and his robes were in tatters from being dragged across the river of mud and then pitched to the side.* - Mon Oct 12 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Taijutsu's not my strong suit so I thought it'd be okay to just do whatever. - Mon Oct 12 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) |"Yeah, I'm fine... Sorry for being such a disappointment..." He is now standing, his hands on his hips, a soft smile across his narrowed pink lips. Both eyes are on her fists, apart of him was thinking she'd strike him again, and if she did he probably wouldn't be prepared, but given her tone, and body language this was the end of their spar.

<I didn't stand a chance...>
".It's not problem, I wouldn't want you to go easy on me because you thought I was weak."* - Mon Oct 12 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) had to admit there was truth to what she was saying. He could come up with a plan with different scenarios, but none of them worked if his opponent was leagues ahead of them in every other aspect, and in this case it was true with Katsune. She worked wonders with Ninjutsu, and athough her Taijutsu might've not been as refined she was fast, almost too fast for him to react at all. 

"You are really strong.. But no, it's no fun, especially when I don't have the strength to match you at all really...."* - Mon Oct 12 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Does 'he' spar with you? - Mon Oct 12 21:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) looks at the ground. "It would change the tide of the battle."* - Mon Oct 12 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: Did I just make a pun unintentionally? - Mon Oct 12 21:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No reason. - Mon Oct 12 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Because I'm from Konoha, right? Well.. - Mon Oct 12 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) uses his fingers to clear his vision from the over-lapping strands of blonde hair resting over his scalp. ".Don't keep me in suspense, Katsune-Sama..." He smiles softly.* - Mon Oct 12 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's because you're weak. - Mon Oct 12 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: ..... - Mon Oct 12 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) noticed Katsune's gesture, his head hanging a bit low. She had really done a number on his feelings, yeah, it was true he had a lot to learn but she crushed his spirit and seemed to be happy about it.

"Yeah...." 
He turns away, obviously confused and wondering if he had done anything wrong to make her react in such a way towards him.

"Katsune-Sama, if I offended you in anyway, I'm sorry...' 
He walks a bit faster, into the interior of the village if allowed, he wouldn't let her see the front profile of his face, that was for sure.* - Mon Oct 12 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) took note of her position in the air, he didn't really understood how she did such but he wasn't going to question it. The hairs on the back of his neck raise slightly however, her aura has unsettled him, and it is showing through his demeanor. 

Instinctively his left hand raises onto his chest. He could feel his heart beating through his chest, and the nexus of ribs that declined his torso. "Yeah, I'm weak Katsune-Sama, I will admit that. You can look down at me, and I probably deserve that, but to me... You and Kilm are like family to me, sure, we've hardly known eachother but I've come to think of you guys are like a part of my extended family.. So to hear you call me weak... I'm doing my best with what I have, okay? If I'm not the ideal student Kilm wants then I'll just leave and go back home and you guys don't have to deal with me anymore..."

His hands are now in his pockets, and he is walking a tad bit faster.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm....? - Mon Oct 12 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) looked like hot shit, his clothes were caked with mud that clung to his hair. His robes was in tatters, his cheek-bones had lacerations running over them; he takes his left hand and reaches behind his back - with an audible clang his back-scroll falls to the floor. 

His collection stood before him, chakra filling the chasm beneath the paper. Formulas incscribed into the lines for further use. While he seals away his ninja tools his gaze averts to Katsune's back every now and again. <Strength is not everything, and weak is a matter of perspective... What I lack in physical power I make up in conviction..>

He shakes his head slightly, attempting to get her words out of his head.
"*Sigh*" He stands up, and makes his way to the stand. He buys a change of clothes before turning to look in her direction.

"With all due respect, Katsune-Sama.. You are wrong about me, and I will show you...In time."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) reads over the contents in Kilm's scrolls. The ability to convert your chakra into something tangible like a wall of water that was something that he desired greatly. There were gaps in execution, everything always plays out so well in theory, but fails when attempted at least once. <So, this seal..> Nozumi forms a single seal his body reacting to the sudden influx of chakra, although he feels the sensation of something building in his chest he calms is chakra flow.

The technique subsides, and his system was normal once more. The problem he found when using really any jutsu was the phase where you were about to release you were found with mixed results. <I see... So rather than precise control you're attempting to expand your chakra outwards, the technique relies on mass, and this mass will serve as a offensive, as well a defensive barrier.>

Nozumi seems to be in another world for the current moment, no longer bothered by the events in the past. Information was something the male had a keen interest in, and while he seemed harmless enough it went without saying he was still a shinobi from Konohagakure No Sato.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <No matter how tough.. I must stay the course...> Nozumi stumbles across the arid desert for hours. His sweat pores expand, liquid cascading across his body like a covering. "Thirsty..." He collapses onto the ground - he could feel his brain pulsating with the heat of the sun's power beaming upon him. His left hand clenches the grains, blood seeps from the underbelly of his nails.

<Get up...>
"No..." He mutters to himself. "No, no, no...." Every iota of his body felt like it was going to be set ablaze. So intense was the shroud that he actually blacked out for a moment, for the longest period of time all he could see was his home, and the rubble that surrounded it. His parents surrounded the rubble, pieces of their bodies scattered around like leaves..

"I cannot yet go.." His extends his right hand into the air, a single brown leaf rushes into his grip, he turns it over to the horizon, and frowns.

"I will find you, Hideki-Sama, I promise, and we will clear your name... I swear it..."* - Mon Oct 12 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) reaches for a scroll on his waist and unseals large portions of wood onto the floor. Secondly his tools came - the clang of metal striking the concrete was enough to make him jump. He had been worried about a lot of things, and the destruction of his village by the hands of some mysterious entity left him with nightmares. Not all was lost however, he was thankful for the fact that the Mizukage gave him a task that he would be able to work on.


He takes a large shaping tool and fashions the wood into something he could manipulate. First came the hatch that bordered the door, the hinges would have to open and close otherwise it would be perfectly useless, and getting Yoshiko's body inside of that coffin would be impossible. He continues with his next action by working on the back-panel where one would rest as they were lowered into the construct, lastly once all of the components were completed for the device he beings them together with metal rivets.

The task took a bit of work, but he was able to finish up rather quickly which was in part becaose of his refined intelligence. * - Tue Oct 13 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Damn it, it's still needs more work..> There was a lot of work he needed attending to. He found that his initial design failed due to improper placement of certain nails. It was frustrating to work with material so brittle, but it would have to make due for the time being. The dimensions were crafted carefully, their unique shape would hug the young woman's bodice. 

"I hope you find solace in the purelands." Now began the task of setting her inside. It was a fresh kill, but it wouldn't be long before rigimortis set in. THe muscles would become brittle, and the bones would snap, eventually her face would decay entirely. This was the sort of thing that bothered Nozumi greatly, he had a fear of seeing the dead.

It was true he was a shinobi, and he too would be expected to kill should the need arise but it was truly repulsive. <God..> More time was taken to conform her form into the wooden planks that were now toppled over her, he secured the fram with more metallic rivets.

The fragments resisted his attempts, but with all of his combined effort, and a little abit of TLC he is able to construct a fairly decent device made out of the wood he had previously sealed. It was then when he did this task he is reminded of Heiwa, and more importantly of Hideki's leave. <Oh god...> He freezes a bit, but quickly recovers in-time to finish the task at hand.

<I'm going to hve to look for the boy.... His ... His only father figured abandoned him...> Without getting sidetracked for too long he looks at his work which in all honesty wasn't the best but it was spur of the moment, and spur of the moment things like this were often difficult to tie down without work.* - Tue Oct 13 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) turns to face Lulu after she manages to catch his notice. "Oh, hey there." He waves in her direction, and said gesture is followed by a smile, he could see the red garnish touch her face, and that she seemed timid. "Need something?"* - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: What about a kid Mizumi? - Tue Oct 13 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||"Thank you.. You look nice as well." Once again his smile returns, although it is a tad bit stronger. His gaze locks with hers, his eyes were of the deepest blue which carefully observe her movements.

His aura and over all demeanor was benevolent.

"Do you need help with anything?" He inquires?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||"Well, I will help you in anyway I can." He chuckles lightly. Just like any other male he was obliviious to the fact that Lulu had any feelings whatsoever. He assumed that the young lady simply had a task that he could help with. His right hand reaches behind his head, golden hair brushing against the edges of his fingers. 

"But you have to tell me what it is first..."* - Tue Oct 13 01:09:07 2015

I'm new here more or less, and I'm sure they want to know where I am at all times." He turns to face the Mizukage, his toothy grin revealing his white teeth.

"Is it okay with you?"* - Tue Oct 13 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) unseals a wooden pole from a scroll. The wooden base is secured wth twine, and then a metallic hook with razor sharp teeth. He hands her a rod before doing the same himself. He completed this rather quickly because he was very good with his hands.

"Now, my father taught me a trick, and that is to let the hook sink, and then remain as still as possible... Too much movement will scare a catch away, and it'd be better if we had bait, but we don't... " 

He casts the line into the water and awaits for it to be bitten.
"So, everything okay with you lately?"* - Tue Oct 13 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) "Perfect..." Nozumi is somewhat saddened by her response, but only because his life had been so different. "I'm a little jealous of you.." The line quivers just like that and he begins to reel the line in.

"My life has been anything but.. I'm glad you're doing well though.. If only everyone was as nice, and as understanding as you are." He takes the time to look into her eyes, his gaze following hers onto his lips.

"Oh, do I have something on my face?" He questions innocently.* - Tue Oct 13 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) is nervous initially after seeing her move forward. He wasn't sure what Lulu was doing, but he soon see's her close in. They were so close he could feel her breathing, and watch for the rise and fall of her chest. His heart quickens, and his face begins to tingle.

"Wha..?" 
He turns his face to the side before contact is made. His eyes averting to the floor. "Wait... Don't... Please.. I've been through a lot, and I don't mind helping you, and becoming your friend, but I can't.... We can't..." He reaches for the fishing rod again.* - Tue Oct 13 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I'm sorry. - Tue Oct 13 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) "Wow.." Lulu was persistent about this that much is certain, and had Nozumi been anyone else she might have succeeded  in her attempt, but the male wasn't going to let this happen. She was able to touch his hand, and goose-bumps popped, his skin feeling her warm touch against his flesh.

He watches her lips close in and he slowly takes his hand away before leaning back. "I'm not ready for anything like this... Please... Let me just help you fish... I think you're an amazing woman, but you don't know me or who I am, and I don't know you either which is why I'm telling you to stop... Lust can be controlled.."* - Tue Oct 13 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lulu(Reesespuffs) thinks: This is driving me crazy. Hes so durn cute..I just want to wrap my body around his. - Tue Oct 13 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||"Look.." He reaches for her hand, his eyes staring into hers. "I'm sorry, and I think you're a good person. I don't want you to think that things between us will be different because of this.. It's just that you could imagine what I've been through and ... I will be honest when I say this, but I need you as a friend because you really seem like someone I can trust... I won't abuse you , and I'm not the kind of man who just fiends over sex..
