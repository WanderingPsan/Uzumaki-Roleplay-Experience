For now, I shall let my cousin recover... I know he will, he is going through something I did as well, and it will make you stronger in the end, Hideki..

"You aren't to leave Kumogakure.. I know you are enraged about Hanabi- " Mamoru took the words right out of his mouth. He simply didn't have enough resources to combat this threat, and Ushinawa wasn't going to allow him to step into a situation he couldn't handle. They shared not only the same objective, but the same blood, and as his relative it would be an injustice to allow him to seek revenge at this point.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"Thank you.." Ushinawa does a somewhat formal bow, the Genjutsu at this point would've no doubt been broken.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "I'm okay.." Ushinawa mutters. "You didn't give me shit for the time you attacked me, and left me practically dying in a ditch. I will take back what is rightfully mine, and I don't think there is anything you can do to stop me." Ushinawa allows for a windmill to come into his possession as well.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) observed the appendage Ikaro extended. <This is very weird.. Is this some sort of trigger for Genjutsu...?> Indeed, Ushinawa thought this was the case because his Sharingan allowed for the same thing, but alas, since there was nothing to be seen for the moment he deduces he is simply trying to make a point. But it's still safe to say he hadn't dropped his guard. "Begone..." He strafes to the side in mere seconds, allowing for the Shuriken to seek his person. The speed was impressive but nothing that should concern the Hogo too much. However, it's formation was a bit unique.* - Tue Sep 29 20:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "None of your concern.." And that's when it happened. Ikaro had been careless about dodging his projectile. He acted almost as if Ushinawa's being didn't matter, and neither did his attack. This sort of treatment towards an opponent couldn't be tolerated. Ushinawa was indeed frustrated about the events of the past, with Tethys attacking him, and then some other masked individual also attacking their village, and then had the nerve to use hydrification while in their midst.

<Something is up...> He glances at Ikaro carefully, as it was revealed another Shuriken had been concealed in his shadow, if he had the senses to observe this it would've been useless.. However, as it seemed to leave entirely he forms the tiger seal causing an explosion of debris to rain from behind the male, although Misa would be able to see this perfectly.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) if Ushinawa hadn't had his Sharingan activated, perhaps he would've fallen for the ruse of the smoke. But alas, he saw Chakra and it's manifestation of such, so, as he saw the stream of fire making it's way towards his person he promptly strafes while forming handseals of his own, as he timed his acceleration on it's depature, he intended to use the smoke to his advantage. 
<Check mate..>
He'd think to himself as several handseals later he attempts to have his Jibashi slam into this foe.* - Tue Sep 29 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We are a family of incest bastards, remember this, Misa. - Tue Sep 29 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wasn't going to allow Ikaro to beat him, though he had to admit he was truly starting to become troublesome. Ushinawa didn't expect this at all, and because of this he knew he would have to deal with them all very quickly. The clones of course, were going to be a problem, and Ushinawa only had the advantage of knowing where the real one was thanks in part to his Sharingan. But alas, there was a problem, and one he knew that the male was aware of. Elemental Bunshins only had a modicum of their conjurer's power... <Damn it...> Ushinawa evades the stream of fluid that he saw Tethys use once before, he was aware of the danger and was even aware that Ikaro might've been abel to manipulate it now that it was on the ground as Tethys did the same with Zhen... 

<Fire Style...> He brings his hands together and spouts a highly ball of fire from his maw that took on the form of a Dragon's head, he sought to sweep all the clones in the fire, and while the ball of flame took it's course he sought to reposition himself on the field, using the cover of the roaring flames to do so.* - Tue Sep 29 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) Ikaro's reflexes were indeed impressive. He even took care of the fact that his flames was coming right towards him. However, there was one fact that he would soon see that he didn't do as well as he thought. For one, Ushinawa could observe the building of chakra in the base of his finger-tips, it was different than the other techniques he had used in the past. Water Trumpet's manifestation was totally different, and so because of this Ushinawa knew that something else was coming.

<It was worse off that Ushinawa -knew- that he wouldn't use such a technique like this and possibliy get himself swept away as he knew Ushinawa was indeed capable with Ration. But now, it led up to this, the point at which Ushinawa was able to elude the bullet, although barely with this information, and Ushinawa didn't use a sword at all. Simply a ball of Lightning that expands very quickly towards the person who was near him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) eluded the clones advance entirely. Ikaro was truly a force, and his prowess couldn't be understated in the slightest. <That's the same thing Blue Fox used against Zhen... This man is truly a superior fighter up close.....> "Perhaps.." Ushinawa mutters, as he forms two seals, and splatters the remaining blood of his tongue biting into the flesh of his forefinger. 

<It's time...>
Several snakes with blades ranging from it's fangs tore for the male. Ushinawa wasn't going to risk getting destroyed at close range... He was going to make Ikaro work for a strike against his person that wouldn't end well if he was hit, he knew that much...* - Tue Sep 29 21:33:39 2015
