<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) noticed that the armbandages around his arms did cushion his hands, at least to a degree. He didn't have to worry about totally obliterating his hands entirely, but he was still subject to breaking his arms on this rock if he went at it too hard. He was careful now, he could feel the numbing of his wrists, the pulse of pain that racked his appendages, the pain was a constant. He was sure this was creating hairline fractures, the only advantage to this is when he rested the bond would repair itself, and the binds would become stronger. So, in a way he had to break himself in order to develop into his full potential. Beads of sweat traverse his body, a wild decline of fluid seeping from his pores. His breathing elevates, and he notices the lactic acid buildup in his muscles manifest in the form of dull aches.* - Sun Oct  4 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) pulls his hands away, the tattered appendages releasing the restrained fluid. White bone-matters shown through even the bandages at this point. "Fuck.." The muffled outcries that wanted to erupt from his lips were muted by his desire to 'one up' the man who imprinted his fist across his ass in the literal sense. His hazel eyes rotate, his neck cranes, a soft smile takes possession of his visage.
"Heh..." Then his arms fall at his sides limply.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <I reached my limit, any longer and I woulda......> He looked at his hands. It was ironic that with every beat of his heart he felt the response of pain racking his body. He manages to nod, a small gesture but one of approval. He opens his mouth to speak, a small laugh managing to bounce off of his vocal cords. Though, when he was slapped he nearly tumbles over but quickly regains his standing.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: You right, I was agreeing with you. I just said. - Sun Oct  4 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I thought you were a Kumo shinobi. - Sun Oct  4 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) watches the medical shinobi intently. His explanation was acceptable, but there were still many gaps. Well, at to Kojiro he saw his leaving as a sign he truly felt that the male was attempting to find a solution to the villages disarray outside of Kumogakure. 
<None of my business in the end..>
"I hear you."* - Sun Oct  4 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides, Hideki will just keep attempting to lash out for me, and I at least want to punch him once to the point where it hurts the most. - Sun Oct  4 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Haven't talked to Hideki much. HE seems troubled. - Sun Oct  4 09:38:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm.. - Sun Oct  4 09:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) could swear the Raikage was hiding out from his people, but in the grand scheme of things this didn't matter. There were various training logs scattered about the arena and they were all about to get broken into. The male started with the first log; he drove his fist into the first stump hard, and fast but he did not have enough strength to bring it down entirely. He kept his barrage of high impact punches against it's base, but noticed that it only did so much. Really, all he could manage was getting it to a point where the tethered timber rocked back and forth. He continues this process for several hours, one punch, followed by the next and even kicks for good measure. It was a tiring thing to do but his body was already starting to adapt to the strain. Firstly, with the mountain's themselves - punching the exterior and then switching to the training logs enabled him to refine what was lacking, and that was his form. Raw power was something that he lacked, and because of this he needed to practice on being able to use the knolwedge from his previous battles and apply it onto this training dummy, which he did. 

He pulls away from the pile of wood, it's surface had truly been tested this day, and so had Kojiro's.* - Sun Oct  4 14:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) ||So the task began with Kojiro having to deliver wood throughout the village. It was something he didn't want to do but it had to be done for the sake of Kumogakure. The smallest task was vital, it reminded him of ants, although small they all worked as a cohesive unit to get things done. So as he hauled timber across Kumogakure he had a smile on his face.

"Here you go..."  He drops the collected wood at the first drop-zone. There was an old fellow present who seemed to be revamping his house. Or perhaps he was starting from scratch, there were portions of the abode that was just the insides, that being the skeleton. 

He was thanked for his service and went to the next drop zone. This time it was a simple request, just a few logs that needed to be delivered to the local inn. They used the materials as scrap so fires could be started with ease. Kojiro gave the man wood he had requested and went about his day.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) clenches his fists, and then he releases the tension. His arms raise slightly, both legs shifting forward. His eyes narrow, at this point Amon was more than a comrade, he was a rival. Even though his male counterpart was superior in Taijutsu for the moment this didn't stop Kojiro from trying. 

"Here I come..." 
He runs forth, his left fist extends forth, his target was the bridge of the males nose.* - Sun Oct  4 19:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Woofh"* The sound of air forcefully escaping Kojiro's lungs left him feeling winded. He was fortunate that he extended his right arm in time to parry the brunt of the blow, but he wasn't strong enough to stop it's advance entirely. He is forced back, and stunned by the man's swing. What should've turned into caution after being hit so hard turned into anger. 

"RaGH!" Kojiro promptly drives his fist towards the males chest, and then follows up with an elbow strike that was aimed at his jaw-line.* - Sun Oct  4 19:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) wasn't as capable as his opponent and it was starting to show. Kojiro simply didn't hit hard enough, he was forced onto his knee. "Ragh,, Ragh!!" The only thing keeping him from being knocked on his ass entirely was his temper but even that went so far. Blood was cascading across his body and forming a small puddle at his feet. 

"FUCK!" He roars, he is sent flying through the ground, and it still momentarily. <I wasn't even able to guard against one blow...>* - Sun Oct  4 19:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) lurches forth, blood riddled vomit spewing from his mouth. He is currently on both knees at this point, he takes the time to wipe away the blood tinged waste from his lips and struggles to his feet. Only to collapse once he was able to do so. "Fuck this shit..." He'd breathe heavily, lids close momentarily.

Kojiro pushes himself off of the ground, his powerful arm muscles giving him the lift he required. <Doton?> The male snickered internally, had he known any such techniques he'd be at liberty to help, but he did not possess the Doton element, and for obvious reasons he deemed it an inferior element. 
"Heh." He rests against the rock-formation, using it's erect stature to lean his back against while sitting.* - Sun Oct  4 19:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) lowered his hand onto a Kunai in his weapon holster. The metallic tool was over-come with Raiton based chakra increasing its cutting power-ten fold. Kojiro observed the currents that rippled across the frame, his grip becomes tighter over the blade handle. He brings his arm backwards and then flings it forward, the sharp blade end was capable of cutting through solid rock but with not much force backing it all it managed to do is rend the outer layer.* - Sun Oct  4 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) channeled the remaining chakra into his palm with the Kunai clenched tightly within his grip. The shimmering blade buzzed softly, energy uncoiled from the tip, he extrends it across the ground enabling him to rip into the outer-most layer with ease. He continues to cut away at the ground fragments, lacerations continue to formulate over the tiled floor and break the tiles entirely. This was good training, and it was nice to focus on something besides Taijutsu like he always had done.* - Sun Oct  4 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) didn't see the female approaching at first, if she observed him hard enough however she would see a Kunai imbued with lightning ripple across it's frame. "Hmm.." His eyes narrow as he looks at the illumination his Kunai created which brought Lyala's shadow into view.

"Hmm, sup.?." The lightning dies off and he watches her carefully.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Are you going to make the first move? - Mon Oct  5 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) ||"Y-.." Kojiro glances at Genesis's hand, her warm appendage actually shocking him out of his conversation. Though, his hold over his hand tightens, he smiles lightly. "What's up?" He turns to face Amon, elbowing him in the shoulder. 

"Yeah, helps me calm down."* - Mon Oct  5 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) whispers: You alright, sis? - Mon Oct  5 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: Ye', I'll check it out. - Mon Oct  5 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Ready? - Mon Oct  5 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: Ye'. - Mon Oct  5 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) smiles, they had reached their destination, and it was a place that the Yamanshi frequented. He reaches for a towel, and dips it into the stream that had been refined through a nearby formation of lava. Small bubbles ripple across the body of water, bubbles fissure softly, it seemed almost as if it was -too- hot. But alas, Kojiro disrobes, the only thing present on his skin were his briefs, he had to be modest around his little sister.

"Kay.. So just slip right in... Oh, she doesn't like being held like that." Kojiro descends into the depths of the pool.* - Mon Oct  5 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Be chill, man.." Kojiro's body glides across the water. But not before pushing his buddies shoulder softly, his body is like a trout through a one way stream, he swims to his sister and swirls around her back. He whispers in her ear. "Take off your duster but leave the rest of your clothes on."  

He cuts in the middle, hopefully putting his friend and sister at a distance. "Play nice, we're here to enjoy each-others company, sides I wanted to talk to you guys about something serious."* - Mon Oct  5 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) extends his massive arms into the air almost as if he was trying to reach the heavens. "*Sigh...* Well, despite me acting like an idiot sometimes. I'm starting to notice this village is a key interest point for outsiders. I've seen a lot of people asking for the Raikage for training. I've seen a lot of questionable things that I don't entirely agree with. I think, at least in the Raikage's case he is benevolent, and that's good and all, but it's getting to the point where people are going to try to take advantage. Not only that, it seems there are some wild cards here. Hideki being one, I like the guy but he is just dealing with hell. It makes him come off as hostile, and sure he's stopped us before but I want us to be ready for anything. That goes double for you Gene.. You know your training is going to be rough...." 

He pauses momentarily to allow his words to sink in.
"I think.... If something bad ever happened to the Raikage we'd be in a very bad way, and even through Niza-Sama's benevolence we're put at risk from people on the outside. He is naturally trusting, and I'm naturally xenophobic."* - Mon Oct  5 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I'll be honest. - Mon Oct  5 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I don't trust ... - Mon Oct  5 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Practically anyone here. - Mon Oct  5 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) glances at Amon carefully, this wasn't like how he looked at him before. This was the look of serious contemplation what he was speaking about was dangerous, and if there were lingering ears he could be in store for a world of hurt. "I don't we're going to change him... But if things continue... Well, I shouldn't say this but...." He ceases his movement inside of the warm waters and inhales deeply. "I know that you can't change people, but I mean.. Things are okay now but.. If this keeps up, especially during a time of great stress there could be talk of a......"

He whispers the next words.
