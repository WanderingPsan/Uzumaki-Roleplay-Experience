<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glanced at Hanabi momentairly before bringing his hands to his sides. There were indeed many applications to this technique and it was implied that it would take a bit of effort to truly master. Ironically, this was something Ushinawa knew, he devoted many hours to not only training physically, but also mentally. 
<I see....>

Ushinawa claps his hands together taking the time to form the correct seals with added finesse. Then, he attempts to conjure the creatures through the depths of his sleeves and shoots them between the slit of clothing. The creatures did not appear at all, their lack of presence was due to the fact that he performed the jutsu incorrectly, or rather he didn't partition the correct amount of chakra.

He attempts to weave another set of seals that matched the same pattern that the young blonde attempted to weave. One snake trickles from the base of his sleeve and runs down the length of his robe, it's own shape attempting to constrict its surroundings, but other than that nothing else happened.* - Sun Sep 20 22:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... - Sun Sep 20 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: Ew. - Sun Sep 20 22:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Nani!?> Ushinawa's eyes cross momentarily, the blood in his heart began pumping a bit harder. Then, like a raging river it came, the buildup of blood in his loins, and now a trickle of blood that left his nostrils. It soon became a raging fountain of force actually able to lift him off of his feet. 

"ERGH!!!"
He rode his nosebleed into the heavens.* - Sun Sep 20 22:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: .....Please get a room. - Sun Sep 20 22:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glanced at Suitengu, and read his look of disgust, admittedly he was a bit ashamed he managed to fly into the air in that manner. He quickly regains what was left of his composure and picks himself off the ground, blades of grass tuck into his clothing and leave marks on his robe. His eyes veer into Mariana's,and then a smile. It was something he rarely did nowadays but when he did he found himself truly happy.

"I agree.." He kisses her softly before retracting and refocusing his gaze to the boy in the distance. "You alright?"* - Sun Sep 20 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I should be asking you that. - Sun Sep 20 22:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) laced his hand through Mariana's the young male was not really offended by the boy's lack of response. Due to how Zetsumo treated him it was expected that the child seemed a bit reserved, and in reality so too was the Uchiha. It was fortunate for him that he found anyone to take a liking to him in the first place.
Still, it wasn't time to press the issue, Ushinawa matches the lads silence with his own.* - Sun Sep 20 23:05:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) vanishes from view, his speed a mere blur, he activates Shunshin and accelerates clear across the area.* - Mon Sep 21 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) simply waited, seconds turned into hours and eventually Ushinawa found himself focusing on other things. The insects burrowing at his feet, the crashing winds against nearby trees. It was all so peaceful, a stark contrast as to what happened earlier this week. <I lose myself in thought much too often...> Then, from out of nowhere he notices a unique chakra signature. Initially he tenses up and reaches for his blade but upon closer inspection he notices Seisuke's conjuration splay it's wings revealing the child who promptly stepped down.

"Hello, child."
* - Mon Sep 21 01:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) knew what the look in the boy's eyes because it was the same with him. Not the literal composition, the unique shape pattern running through his sclera was unique in it's own right. The look that Ushinawa saw was one of depravity, the feeling of loss in this world often had it's way of changing what a person truly was. Such things were not hidden from the Uchiha, he too had faced hardship, especially when his brother died in response to the Raikage's incompetence. Ever sine that day he swore there would be a day where things would be different; he would usher in the new-age where there was true peace.

Only it was the opposite, and now it seemed this child would be another victim. "I suspect.... Something tragic has happened.."* - Mon Sep 21 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) eyes widned at the boy's comment. He didn't expect for Zetsumo to fall so quickly. He was known for taking on all of the shinobi nations with the aid of savages, killing the Mizukage of Kirigakure, and even establishing his own empire. His power was truly immense, and his importance on this village couldn't be over-estimated.

But now he was as important as any other corpse.
"Zetsumo is dead...."
There was silence for a brief period of time, enough for him to sink in the fact that the male was truly gone. 
"I'm sorry for your loss.."
In reality he didn't care for at all for Zetsumo, he simply felt bad for his child who would no doubt come to hate the people who did this to him. * - Mon Sep 21 01:27:40 2015

* - Mon Sep 21 02:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) brings his hands together, the timing and execution of the single seal was done rapidly. The stream of chakra running through his body ceased, only to kick into over-drive once more this time like a raging tempest. He does his best to get his chakra running through his core yet again, this time it coming through him like a powerful wave. His control over chakra, and this jutsu in general were increasing rapidly, it was no wonder that he found himself inclined towards Genjutsu, he was fairly talented in it's usage, or at least he thought as much.* - Mon Sep 21 11:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) stops the flow of chakra through his body. Much like the other times he employed this jutsu he attempts to apply an even stronger wave of chakra through his being. The result of this would allow him to break Genjutsu should he find himself captivated by it's presence. There had to still be some level of understanding, namely, how would one even know they were in a Genjutsu in the first place? It was fortunate on his behalf that he had the Sharingan and was able to recognize Genjutsu easily enough.* - Mon Sep 21 11:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) there was yet more Ushinawa needed to do. The fact that he hadn't yet truly mastered Kai was something that was going to bite him in the ass later on. It is why he took the time to carefully go over the Genjutsu disappation technique. <It is still imperfect....> He intends to cease his chakra flow, then in that same movement he forces an even stronger force to arise, the culmination of said forces making the energy within his being to rise exponentially. * - Mon Sep 21 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) cut off his chakra flow yet again, at this point it was assumed that he would've been able to do it rather quickly. When this was done he'd form a single seal and attempt to force chakra hrough his being. When it reached critical mass the chakra began to rebound through various nodes of his body. The excess chakra was simply filtered throughout his being. <Kai....> * - Mon Sep 21 11:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) forms a single hand-seal once again trying to do his best to disrupt his chakra flow. The ceasing of the energy through his body took several moments to achieve; once this was done he took it a step forward by kicking the celestial energy spiraling through his body into over-drive. The end result? Well, the allocated chakra would potentially break any Genjutsu that had been cast at him, or at least that was  his intent.* - Mon Sep 21 11:50:36 2015

The three tomoe in his eye cemented  onto the group, followed by the single pupil in the middle, he took a mental record of their chakra signatures so that even while even if they concealed themselves in the future, he would have a gist of who they were. 

He takes particular effort to scan Muhhamed as it was verbatim to except the oldest shinobi within the group to not only be the strongest, but also the more experienced one.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: We leave. - Mon Sep 21 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Got it. - Mon Sep 21 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not want to remain out in the open. - Mon Sep 21 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) looked at Hanabi, his eyes venturing into her gaze. He awaits to see what would happen from there.* - Mon Sep 21 15:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hmm. - Mon Sep 21 16:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Oh? - Mon Sep 21 16:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Because the Gezo told them to. - Mon Sep 21 16:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well sucks to be them haha. - Mon Sep 21 16:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And Amai knows about my transformation. - Mon Sep 21 16:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'd assume she does. - Mon Sep 21 16:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm very well then. - Mon Sep 21 16:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Does anyone have enough provisions for the journey> - Mon Sep 21 16:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It will be a long one at that. - Mon Sep 21 16:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I do. - Mon Sep 21 16:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You two might want to stand back a bit. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) does as he is instructed.* - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And by stand back a bit I mean be careful of the snake. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hold my hand. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Okay baby. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) 's neck cranes upwards after his crimson optics were met with the behemoth. It was practically one of the biggest summons he had seen, and it was no doubt very powerful. Still, he knew better than to show any-type of weakness towards the beast, it was a predator and he would not be it's pray. In-fact he remains utterly calm even in spite- of it's massive size advantage over him. He was truly in his own element, even with the threat of death looming over him his gaze flickers towards the beast, his will unwavering.
<You will not touch, Hanabi....> He thinks to himself. 
However, he knew better than to anger the beast, after-all they did need his help.* - Mon Sep 21 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) allowed himself to be drawn into the void. Hanabi seemed to be in her own element at this point but even he thought she was slightly intimidated. Manda was no doubt a very difficult person to deal with, and he knew just by their brief interaction he would act on his impulses to destroy them should Hanabi prove to anger him, or disappoint him about a feast. Nonetheless he simply observes what is taking place; several snakes slip through the cracks and surround them. Ushinawa's gaze tethers onto the White-Snake Sages being.

Silence.
He does not speak, it isn't his place to.* - Mon Sep 21 17:06:20 2015
