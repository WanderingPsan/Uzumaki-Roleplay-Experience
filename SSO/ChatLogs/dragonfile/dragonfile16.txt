I will not say this again. End this, or I will not stop until one of us is dead."* - Sat Sep 26 04:58:14 2015

I'm telling you I don't want a fight but if that's something you require then I suppose I will have to simply heed your request. Do what you will. . But I'm not like the other's I'm not afraid of you, and I know you wouldn't have done what you did right now unless you were sure you had to. Don't get in over your head for no reason.."

The male is obviously ready for Tetsujin's offensive. However, he wasn't going to be the one to make the first move, and it would be obvious why if his opponent decided to attack.

"I will not come.. If you wish to fight, you will come to me."* - Sat Sep 26 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Pussies. - Sat Sep 26 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"Then have all three. That is none of my concern. What is my concern is you attempting to kill me in my own village for something that was not even known. Yukio-Sama's status was unknown to us all, no-one was lying to you. I understand you're upset but I'm telling you there's no reason for you to be. No-one has done anything to impede the freedom you speak of."

He continues to observe with his Sharingan active, reading his opponent's chakra flow, the make-up of his body while in this state. He heard Niza's words well when he told him that his body was made of steel, yet, there was a plan, and a back up-plan. His hands present themselves in a fashion that would help the male greatly should push come to shove. 

For now it was both of them simply postering.
"Enough, let us end this. I know you have more important things to do than to try and cut down a Kumogakure shinobi in his own village. Unless you do not, in which case. Come, Tetsujin. What else do you have to prove?"* - Sat Sep 26 05:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wasn't going to let his guard down simply because Tetsujin reverted. He continues to observe even the smallest of movements, his chakra signature as well for any signs of company in the distance. This brute was known for killing Urek, and many others so it went without saying that he was quite literally one of the strongest beings known to the shinobi world. 
Crimson eyes track even the most perfunctory gesture.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) probably couldn't make up for the over-all distance entirely but he did his best. With his Sharingan active he could see that a counterattack was on it's way towards his comrade, Mamoru. "Look out.." He'd accelerate his hands moving at a rapid pace, although, ironically, no handseals were needed atll. His intent was to cancel the male's offense with a fierce reply. Should he attempt to fire off the fire-ball lightning would attempt to slam into his body. But alas if he wise he could move, this was simply to put an end to things as he wasn't going to allow a fellow comrade to be attacked, but he didn't want this to get any worse either. 
"Enough..."* - Sat Sep 26 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "Such terms aren't used for shinobi of Kumogakure. If attacked we will defend our own, clearly you've been given example of such." Ushinawa again averts his gaze towards the male's eyes. However, he doesn't make a move there was no reason for him to go any further with his offensive because everything had ended.

However, the question still remained.
"Who are you?"* - Sat Sep 26 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was quite done at this point, if his opponent truly wished to use Kirigakure at this time he would counter with his own jutsu within his arsenal. Handseals were once again at the ready, this time a massive ball of fire was released from his maw, except this was no ordinary ball of flame, it's size expands into a Dragon's maw eradicating any vestige of the cumbersome mist.

"He moves with immense speed now, no longer waiting for the male to finish what he was doing.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) |There were numerous things going on at once, as per-say Ushinawa looked into the masked man's visage for a reason. In-fact if all was said and done the events leading up to this would've been a simple farce, a series of events meant to conjure the male into a sense of security, only to find that things were not so. He didn't listen to any of the orders and quite frankly Ushinawa didn't care, he simply was attempting to deal with a disturbance.

If not, well, due to the momentum of the jutsu it's epicenter wouldn't have been as damaged as the rest. This was a plan just in-case the other events from before didn't pan out, if possible from his position he'd simply leap backwards onto a nearby cliff, using it's postioning to ascend the swells. * - Sat Sep 26 06:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: How nicely. - Sat Sep 26 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) bites into the pad of his forefinger and forms a series of handseals. From there he slams his right had into the ground and awaits the results.* - Sat Sep 26 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well... - Sat Sep 26 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I've been doing a lot of fighting lately. - Sat Sep 26 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You know how it is. - Sat Sep 26 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "Hakaze.. I see.." Ushinawa seemed to be somewhat impressed by the makeup of the snake in question. It's white coat was something he hadn't yet seen before. "Is he or she strong?" He does the same thing she does at this point, using his already wounded finger to serve as the medium, and then handseals before sending his palm into the ground and summoning another creature.* - Sat Sep 26 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "I see, and in what way is she useful then.. Don't get me wrong, I understand the importance of the summons, but I get the feeling she is a bit different from the rest..." The snake he had conjured previously vanished, and so he uses the remaining blood seeping out of his gash after formulating handseals in the attempt to bring on yet another Snake, or at least that was the plan. <Hmmm....> "Why did Klaus kill your first snake?"* - Sat Sep 26 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I'm surprised a snake would put his life on the line for her. - Sat Sep 26 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He must have truly cared. - Sat Sep 26 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I instructed him to protect her. - Sat Sep 26 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Though, knowing her she might've had s-.. Oh, that's why... - Sat Sep 26 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I did not want anyone touching what was mine. - Sat Sep 26 16:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: .... - Sat Sep 26 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) did his best to shrug off Hanabi's comment. He assumed snakes also ventured into said cavity, although he did curse himself for saying that near the child. She had been so quiet the whole time he had forgotten, hopefully her attention was elsewhere. Still, this doesn't stop him from sweeping more blood from his wound and formulating even more handseals with the intent of summoning yet another snake. "You are.... Erotic..."* - Sat Sep 26 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am~ - Sat Sep 26 16:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) attempts to cover Hanabi's mouth before she could go through with what she was saying. "My child..."* - Sat Sep 26 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"Okay, okay.. I understand.. " If allowed he'd ease his hand away from her mouth, and attempt to place it by his side. Only to glance at his son once all was sai and done. "Come here, Heiwa.."* - Sat Sep 26 16:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Have you been working on what I've shown you? - Sat Sep 26 16:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) reacts on impulse and attempts to seal her lips with his hands again. "Stop.. I don't want my son to be exposed to such things."* - Sat Sep 26 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||<Damn.. I wish this snake would understand I'm simply preserving my child from a pervert..> Ushinawa was almost to the point where he wanted to flash his Sharingan against the attacking snake but it was assumed that would be excessive. Besides, Hanabi didn't really know anything about having a child so it was expected that she would continue on, or perhas she simply liked to get the best of Ushinawa.

"Baka...." He'd mutter before attempting to retract his hand. HE drew his son a bit closer to his body as well.
"Don't listen to her nonsense."* - Sat Sep 26 16:40:32 2015
