<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So then what is the solution.. Forgive me for saying this. - Wed Dec  9 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But why does it sound like you've given up? - Wed Dec  9 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Because i've seen almost everyone I love and care for die and be incapable of protecting them. - Wed Dec  9 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I, unlike some, have been lucky to find someone else to love. - Wed Dec  9 17:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: *Nods* You are a noble woman, and you have my respect. The best of luck to you, and your family. But.... If I may say something... - Wed Dec  9 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Go ahead. - Wed Dec  9 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) raises his arm in the air and flexes so that his bicep was sticking out - which ironically wasn't much of anything. His left hand reaches for the fabric along his sleeve and hoists it upwards. The Kanji determination was eteched into his skin.

"I really shouldn't be lecturing you as it seems you've been through a lot more than I have in my years, but I just wanted to let you know. I too, understand the pain of loss, it's why I do what I do, and while the war on Sunagakue is over, and I dislike them for their actions, I can say I like you. "

"But my advice to that is you need to see that family isn't just your immediate one.. If you settle now you might lose much more in the future." 

"Just my personal view on things, and you can take it with a grain of salt... " The Raikage chuckles - whatever rumors they shinobi world said about him being a fierce combatant didn't seem to be the case, and in a way he seemed to be rather harmless, even naive.* - Wed Dec  9 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Eh...my family is huge... - Wed Dec  9 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But I understand you. - Wed Dec  9 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: My name is Lera by the way. Hassan, Lera. - Wed Dec  9 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I am Eiyu, of the Minatabi. - Oh, so it seems I was wrong, I apologize. - Wed Dec  9 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I didn't know you had a large family. - Wed Dec  9 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Most of Sunagakure is a nephew, niece...cousin...*sigh* - Wed Dec  9 17:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I can't even count them anymore.. - Wed Dec  9 17:53:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) takes a step back just the name was encited fear.* - Wed Dec  9 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hassan-Sama is the one who gave me the title of Raikage. - Wed Dec  9 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I see. - Wed Dec  9 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He was adamant on. - Wed Dec  9 17:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He's also very deadly. - Wed Dec  9 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I was sad to see him go...but he wouldn't have wanted anyone to get depressed about it. - Wed Dec  9 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Eh? yeah, he was pretty strong. - Wed Dec  9 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm sorry for your loss. - Wed Dec  9 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I only beat him twice. - Wed Dec  9 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: --- - Wed Dec  9 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: To think at such a young age she'd rival her father. - Wed Dec  9 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: To think Sunagakure could create such fearsome warriors... - Wed Dec  9 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Though. The first time he gave me a wicked scar. - Wed Dec  9 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: First time I got injured in a fight that was. - Wed Dec  9 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Went eight years without ever getting hit... - Wed Dec  9 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <HEHEHEHEEHEHEHEH> The inner pervert in Eiyu began to bleed out. <I should ask her what other scars she has. Kukukuku~. Right, that's a good way to end up dead. I have to remember that....> 

Eiyu remains professional attempting to make it seem as if he was observing the scar, but in reality was observing her skin, and this was just an innocent impulse he wasn't a dog about it..

"You went eight years without getting hit...?" He pauses - letting his comment mull over in his head, while Lera was speaking of combat Eiyu was thinking of being hit in another form.

He pauses, utterly frozen by the prospect.
Though, he recovers in stride.
"-Wow... You're quite the shinobi."* - Wed Dec  9 17:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) shakes his head. "Fuuinjutsu. I was Heiwa's Sensei in that regard for sometime, but it seems he doesn't need my help anymore considering he's the Captain of Kirigakure's Genjutsu and Fuuinjutsu division."* - Wed Dec  9 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ahhh...Fuuinjutsu. - Wed Dec  9 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Eh...I'll probably pick that up one day. - Wed Dec  9 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It can be used for good.. - Wed Dec  9 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Or.. - Wed Dec  9 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) recounts the day Suipaku had a seal placed upon her abdomen. It was the seal that would spell her death, or would have had she not been impaled by Edge personally.

Eiyu tried to read the formula but it was too complex, he obviously blamed himself for her death.

"Evil... Much like all things in the Ninja-World." His aura changes, she had obviously unsurfaced emotions he pushed to the side for the longest.* - Wed Dec  9 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Eh, sorry. - Wed Dec  9 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Not trying to ruin the mood. - Wed Dec  9 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Just things can be a little depressing, Yknow? - Wed Dec  9 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah I know. - Wed Dec  9 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I've been hit by seals before as well. - Wed Dec  9 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: They're quite nasty. - Wed Dec  9 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Oh...? - Wed Dec  9 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: What did they do? - Wed Dec  9 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Always my right arm as well...don't know what it is. - Wed Dec  9 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Stopped me from using my arm. - Wed Dec  9 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: .... That is pretty nasty... - Wed Dec  9 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: There offensive capabilities for Fuuinjutsu are endless.... Which is why, in the end Fuuinjutsu can be considered one of the more dangerous professions... But not everyone can do it considering one has to be fairly intelligent, and a genius is only seen once a generation.... The seal she's talking about is above my ability, but even I only have a novice level understanding. - Wed Dec  9 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Seeing as shes from Suna... - Wed Dec  9 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Well, I prefer a more straight forward method myself. - Wed Dec  9 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I never want to only have one arm in a fight. - Wed Dec  9 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Eh. I managed. - Wed Dec  9 18:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ..Who did that to your arm? - Wed Dec  9 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The first time it happened I won. - Wed Dec  9 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The second time it was a draw - Wed Dec  9 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Shin and Fujitora, respectively. - Wed Dec  9 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It was only in a spar. - Wed Dec  9 18:08:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances at Yumiko. "How is Heiwa?"* - Wed Dec  9 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Stressed. - Wed Dec  9 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes, he seems to be a very troubled child. - Wed Dec  9 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But. - Wed Dec  9 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: That just means he has a heart, and even though he may have knocked me out. - Wed Dec  9 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He is a good kid. - Wed Dec  9 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But I must take my leave. If the Mizukage wishes to speak to me in the future. - Wed Dec  9 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Dealing wit-please don't remind me of being in jail. Not one of our finest moments. - Wed Dec  9 18:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Likewise. - Wed Dec  9 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I could not have Ortho kill. - Wed Dec  9 18:14:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ah...Ortho...he did try to kill me once as well. - Wed Dec  9 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Not in my village. Not on my watch, but for what its worth you- - Wed Dec  9 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He did? - Wed Dec  9 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Due to a misunderstanding in the end... - Wed Dec  9 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yeah. - Wed Dec  9 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He almost killed me too. - Wed Dec  9 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: He thought that me, violet, Kirie and some other guy had tortured him. - Wed Dec  9 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I saw his scars... THey looked pretty real... - Wed Dec  9 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: That is why he hated Kirigakure. - Wed Dec  9 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Ironically...I wasn't even on this continent when this 'supposedly' happened. - Wed Dec  9 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: He wasn't tortured, at least not by kirigakure. - Wed Dec  9 18:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Or maybe I'm mistaken on the last bit. - Wed Dec  9 18:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He was manipulated in the end, so I suppose you that isnt far fetched. - Wed Dec  9 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Violet was...kind, one of the kindest people i'd ever known. She would never had any part in it. - Wed Dec  9 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Kirie only did something if it benefited her or Kiriagkure...torturing Ortho had no benefit at all. - Wed Dec  9 18:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looked at the two. It did seem Kiyoko was in a daze. Eiyu nods respectfully.

"You have a fine family, Lera-San. Then to Yumiko. "So do you, don't forget to watch over that friend of yours. Oh, and he was buried in his homeland, far as my knowledge."

From there he Shunshin's into a nearby tree - and is impaled on impact. 
<Heh, good thing I'm a clone.>* - Wed Dec  9 18:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) bites into his forefinger and performs a series of handsigns. "Summoning Jutsu." "How you been, Gamakichi?" The toad looks at him, and crosses his arms. "I've been fine, what do you need? Tch, what's to say I need anything why don't we just talk?"

"Now, say... That's pretty interesting seeing as you usually want us to fight..." 
"It's not like that.. I'd like to think our relationship has grown in recent years, but I wanted to speak more specifically of what has been done. You know, the Mizukage is dead, and Kumogakure has recently recovered from a war. Our shinobi are in good spirits, but I fear something is coming.... Something big, the likes of which I haven't seen.... It's been far too quiet over recent months, and I don't like it...."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I will support you, in whatever choice you make. I don't favor Konohagakure either, and her rule is.... Questionable at best... But if you -kill- her... Sunagakure is going to flip, now I realize you don't care. - Wed Dec  9 19:34:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) nods respectfully, he was very careful about how he spoke, he knew her tenacious attitude coupled with her immensive strength as a shinobi. One wrong word could spell disaster.

Which isn't far to be honest, Kumogakure's Chuunin exams will be a bit different from the rest of the worlds. Though, I must say that..... There were promotions due to the handling of the war."* - Wed Dec  9 20:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glanes at Menma. "I can have a compound built into Kumogakure, and it can be your family members only. If being a Chuunin is really what you desire -  I will accelerate the process - Though I would like to inform you it is rather dangerous."* - Wed Dec  9 20:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances at Dahyun in the distance - the male seemed to be an introvert, but nonetheless there was ample room to bring him out of it. "Front and center." He speaks with authority, but alas the Raikage is known as a goof ball - which makes for conflicting behavor. Though, the more loyal members understood his quirks making him a respected member of Kumogakure, and what with the resistance he gave Sunagakure it was quite honestly one thing he had became famous for.

Or rather, it was his shinobi. "Please." It was obvious he was speaking to the male. <I have something planned... The Knight Of The Round Table seems to have it's perks....> 

"I do have another question, however.... These Knights, are all those seats taken by people...? Or are some currently open?"* - Wed Dec  9 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"No problem." He says in response to Takuma's inquiry. Then, to Menma. "Even Niza's spot?" He hesitates - thinking of what other short-cuts could aid him in becoming a Knight. Nothing for now, at least his shinobi would get to know eachother a little better.

Lastly, to Dahyun. "I am the Raikage, I think whatever I have in store might just be a bit more important than that."* - Wed Dec  9 21:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) chuckles. "I am Eiyu." However, he didn't take Ziare's hand for one reason, that being Fuuinjutsu. He was calm, and harbored no ill will towards him, or his company. But his warm aura was more than enough, and put him at ease that there wouldn't be any problems.

"I'm Eiyu of the Minatabi, the Raikage of Kumogakure. Hm, and no need...For a hanshake.."* - Wed Dec  9 22:04:48 2015

trap. "The years have not been well to Konohagakure." This was not an insult directed to the Jounin adorned male either- rather this observation as in general..

His disdain for the nation that attacked his homeland was real, one would wonder what his purpose was in the first place.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The Raikage of Kumogakure addresses his men. "It is said that the bravery of men comes out what they will do in battle - or in situations where their life is in danger, It is also said those who live in a stupor of cowardice thrive on situations where they are the one's in control. We an see evidence of this now. In the past the Land Of Fire was quite possibly one of the stronger shinobi nations - but now they live in the shadow of Sunagakure. They claim they are independent, but they are not. I do not want you to forget the events the led up to this. I don't want you to forget that Hassan did control this village, at one point - and while I respect him, and his name for bringing out of despair - I cannot forgive Konohagakure's actions."

He continues - the crowd is adamant in their admiration , though not everyone supported his views. "I don't propose conflict with the Hokage. Rather I propose we denounce their leader as the fake that shit is. She is not for the people, she is for herself, and in the end those who attempt to satisfy their own desires are much too selfish to govern anyhthing."

"Let us remember this day."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) chuckles. "Work? What do you speak of? What is your craft?" Rotori would've most likely observed that while some of the inhabitants were as listless as drift-wood large portions of Kumogakure were always active. There always seemed to be people watching from all directions. 

"Where are you from?"  * - Thu Dec 10 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Of course." Now that Eiyu was starting to get an understanding of Rotori's history he could commence. In recent months the male no doubt saw several additions to Kumogakure - outposts were scattered everywhere with fercious looking shinobi keeping tabs on everything, and now a giant wall connected through the branching mountains had been constructed.

The once push-over nation known as the Land Of Clouds was being restored to a position that rivaled that even of the great tryanny of Niklaus, although Eyiu was very edifferent.

"I'll have you do some basic missions for the time being. I have to apologize, I didn't take you for a shinobi." He takes his gloved hand and places it against a piece of parchment, once unsealed several articles are released from their confinements revealing the missions that needed to be done.* - Thu Dec 10 18:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) observs Rotori's departure. "Likewise." Of course the Raikage could've given him a more meaningful task, but this was to build humility. During his years as the ruler of Kumogakure he often assigned his men to sweep the steps leading into the Manor - it became some frequent that they started to memorize subtle details like how many cracks ran through it's surface which was now no longer the case due to him revamping most of the village.

"Tch, you're no fun, Haku-San.."The Raikage was still at it again being his normal childish self which was weird for someone like him. It just went to show that he still had a part of him that was human - and even war didn't change that. 

The truth was that Eiyu cared for everyone in Kumogakure, even if they didn't care about him and Haku was no exception.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Tch." He looks about his group of shinobi. Dahyun was a curious character - she didn't enjoy confrontation - and it can only be left to the imagination what she would do if she was hard pressed in battle. Menma was an intelligent mastermind, and an avid Kenjutsu practitioner who liked to keep to himself largely, and he was probably the most respectful out of the lot. Haku was an isolated soul, not much was known about him other than being a bad-ass, and an occasional pranking candidate - though Eiyu stopped those types of stunts when he became Raikage.

Sogeki was a savage in his own right - equal to none. Eiji was probably one of the most talented individuals Kumogakure has ever seen, he utilized carrots in such a manner that he was not only able to fix the Land Of Clouds hunger problem, but also clear away a-lot of the stigma of Kumo being a weak village. 

Lastly, Mitarashi was a reserved soul. Though, Eiyu owed him a great deal and respected him for his part in the war - all in all the dark skinned Mintabi couldn't have been happier.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) cranes his head to right - full of frustration. "You know.. That nickname better not stick, Tease-Kun will give the impression that I am... Well, not awesome." Eiyu begins to poster - obviously thinking of his merits in the future. <Now.. Let's think of some awesome titles.>

<The White Flash of Kumogakure? No, that doesn't pay homage to my heritage.. Uh.....................> 

Though, Eiyu did manage to catch sight of the duo snuggling.
<It seems the prospect of Haku getting babies in the future isn't such a far fetched idea... Does this mean I will be a god father? Hn...>

Eiyu claps his hands together. "Right, right."

"Let's start this exercise."* - Fri Dec 11 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oooooh right, I forgot I promised to call you Eiyu-sama in public. - Fri Dec 11 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmph. It hardly works now since everyone know's that you've said that.. But I guess I will have to endure the laughs until I find a better Moniker. Who's ready to learn...? - Fri Dec 11 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: Well, I should go now. - Fri Dec 11 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) notices Menmas grin. "B-...Baka!" He raises his right fist into the air as a means to express his frustration. "I will show you why it's never wise to laugh at your Raikage...! Observe my ultimate move, stand in awe as I show you true power!" 
<Right..> Eiyu bites into the pad of his forefinger letting the blood flow through his index - then he drags it along his palm before thrusting it to the ground.

"Kuchiyose No Jutsu!" Inside of the mist a small oragne frog with slitted eyes looked up at him.

'Say, got any snacks for me, Eiyu-Chan?>Gamatatsu cared little for anything else.

"Damn you, Gamatatsu! Why do you come at times like these!?" Eiyu was obviously flustered by this blunder.

"Don't laugh, I command you not to laugh!" 'Silly Eiyu-Chan, you can't do that and you know it.' "Yeah, you're right.. I'll- Yeah...... That sounds about right..." 

"Menma give me one hundred pushups for laughing, and you aren't going anywhere either!" He points in Dahyun's direction. "You will all be training."* - Fri Dec 11 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: I hope she does not mention anything that happened a few days ago. - Fri Dec 11 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *? - Fri Dec 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 's right eye began to twitch. He was obviously perturbed about this whole situation. The Toad picks up on it and begins to chuckle - though in the end he knew that this would end with a scalding lecture by Gamakichi. 

"Hmmm..~ I'll be sure to give you a nice -snack- when I call upon you again. The summon returns to its home - Eiyu walks makes his way west. 

"Chakra control. Namely, if you're able to complete this you'll be able to walk on several services including water."* - Fri Dec 11 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"That is good. I'd expect no less from you, Menma." He walks forward taking his place by Dahyun's side in his explanation. "If I am missing anything feel free to fill any holes, Menma." Eiyu walks forward, and keeps on walking and in-fact he was surmounting the mountain leading up to the Manor with ease. The faint azure that clung to the soles of his feet was nigh fiery - his chakra was fierce and any sensors would be able to sense that his pools were vast.

Still, all of this could've just as well been ignored. "Let's begin. Typically shinobi have a hard time focusing their chakra to one finite point of their body. Even in combat Jounin have trouble doing so - Chakra Control is something that is vital in the shinobi world - Though it is something that those with bigger pools may have a problem with simply because they don't meter themselves because they don't have to."

"What you're doing is attempting to focus the chakra to the soles of your feet, and when you've done so you want to ascend. Keep trying to walk, but there is a catch.. Too little chakra and you will not stick at all, too much and you will repel yourself off the surface you're trying to cling to."

"To help in this scenario it'd be helpful for you to perform the ram seal and focus your chakra to your feet. Though, in the end, Dahyun. Your trials will require you to surmount the entire mountain."

"This will be your first training session, and test. Can you do it?" Eiyu kicks off of the wall before somersaulting to his previous position.* - Fri Dec 11 01:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Very good, Dahyun, but you must continue to practice. Shinobi constantly perfect their jutsus's in order to hone them into more devastating combos. Though, I won't lie, what I've taught you isn't really going to damage anyone, but you never know when it'll come in handy." 

"Oh, and as far as your hunger problem is concerned I can buy you something, have it put on my tab too. The Kirisaki are known for making the best carrot soup." Though to some, that might've sounded like the Raikage had awful taste, but they just didn't know how delicious them shits were.

"I think you'd like it." He smiles before turning to Haku in the village square.

"What's up?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: That is exactly what I mean. - Fri Dec 11 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Go to the prisons quarters. The prisoners who were going to be executed are in their holding cells guarded by several Kumogakure shinobi. They've been alerted to your presence so their won't be a problem getting in or out." 

He nods before pivoting east.* - Fri Dec 11 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O--hm? Thank you, Eiyu-sama.~ - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "N-nani!?" Eiyu is reeled by Dahyun's momentum. <I guess someone's hungry.> "How long has it been since you've eaten?" He chides.

Sooner or later they would be gone entirely, unless stopped.
<I guess I forgot to mention their soup is very spicy, but I guess everything will be fine.>

Eiyu actually found himself attempting to keep at a running pace in order to keep from tripping over his own two feet.* - Fri Dec 11 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: Damn. Your chest though. - Fri Dec 11 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "The Kirisaki special." He corrects Dahyun on the low, though there was no real need for such the only diffence between carrot soup and the special was that one was very hot while the other is mild. His hazel eyes take note of the male's form, though he surmised that she had genuine intentions to pay her back, her returns her comment with a smile of his own. His eyes always seemed to be cut low, almost as if he were squiting, but not actually doing so.

"What kind of leader would I be if I expected my shinobi to pay -me-?" <Then again taxes are a thing, bwahahaha!> He chuckles.

"No, no it is fine." Their soup arrives, the rich orange broth had noodles bubbling over - but the practically over-bearing spice was complimented with the somewhat bitter taste of carrot yet still maintaining it's balance with a decent helping of sweet pork added for measure.

"It's my treat." Eiyu also notices Takuma and tries to force himself to revealing his secret. <I wonder what Takuma will do when he finds out I sealed all of his underwear...> "Hmmm.. Dig in?" He directs to Dahyun. 

"Oh, by the way, Takuma.. Since you're now my Special Jounin... You know you gotta have a bump in difficulty in regards to your missions. I have some for you right now, provided you are interested."* - Fri Dec 11 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "HN!?!"! Eiyu leans his head in to the point he practically headbutts Dahyun. <The hell, how are they a guy?> The guy didn't know what the hell he was hit with but he had nearly fell out of his chair. This was because of the simple fact that he thought he had such a good read on people, but he really didn't. 

"Damn..." Eiyu tips the bowl of soup into his mouth, letting the broth run down his lips, while at the same time unsealing his collection of hentai by mistake.

"No- no....!" He sets the bowl down and begins to seal the contents before handing Takuma his missions scrolls.

<That did not just happen....> Though, as for the spice Eiyu didn't really seem to even notice, he had eaten it so many times and it was simply delicious.* - Fri Dec 11 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) leaps over the table. "Ohhhh no!" He is now right by his side attempting to wipe the mess from his clothing and turning over his skin to make sure he is alright. 
"I-.. I'm so sorry.." He looks somewhat disturbed by his previous action. "I hope I d- I'm sorry.. I just-. . You just surprised me... You can't just tell a guy that and expect him not to be surprised, and I can't spar right now, Takuma.. I just burned one of my shinobi!"* - Fri Dec 11 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) had ruined a good meal - one second Dahyun was pulling him to the ramen-shop so they could dine. The next Eiyu spills carrot suit all over him due to his genuine surprise over the matter. THough, all in all all it could've been a lot worse. 

"Well, I didn't expect that in the slightest." He scratches his head.* - Fri Dec 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The outposts go crazy - several shinobi pick up activity towards the Northen front of Kumogakure. The Guard themselves resume a firm yet unhostile stance, they are presumably at the ready.
