"Baka! Why would even come at such a essential time like this!? Don't you know I could be killed!? I - Guh... Just go home." Eiyu turns around.

I have a friend who would like to meet you.. I am the apex fighter, the guardian of Kumogakure, and you will get a beating of your life!" Eiyu formulates several handseals after biting into the pad of his forefinger.

"This is the strength of the Raikage. I have a no equal...!" 

He presses his hand on the ground, conjuring a summon from the void once more.

Only, it was the same summon, the idiotic toad known as Gamatatsu was summoned yet again. "Say, Eiyu-San, about those snacks?" 

"B-Ba-Baka!!!!!!!!!!"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looks at Ortho in his eyes, his cobalt gaze softening as his words hit another string. He had heard many times before how he was unfit for being the village leader, and how his kindness would lead to its destruction. He had heard all of it countless times, but the devout pacifist ignored their comments, that is until now. He knew it was a nation with a rich legacy, and that he wasn't fit to don the robes, let alone rule a nation.

"Yeah, you're right, I'm not a fit for Kumogakure. I'm young, and have problems getting the other shinobi to listen to me. But unlike other people I lived the hell of Kumogakure being killed off one by one. I pooled into my own funds, and attempted to get the place repaired. But most of Kumogakure is wiped out, I'm trying to keep it from turning into Sunagakure, and you have no idea how hard that is. So yes, I am not the Raikage Kumogakure deserves, but I am the one it needs... Because even so, I am not like the Raikage before, I will not run when my people are in danger, because those are the people whom I live for. I don't know your story, Ortho, all I know is you tried killing off people in Kirigakure, and that was an act of aggression. This isn't me rambling, I'm trying to gain an understanding of your intentions. Where are these people that will lead Kumogakure out of despair?! No-one! THey've either died or left, and I'm left picking up the pieces so don't judge me... Because you have no idea what it's like on your own... I've played nice with both Sunagakure, and Kirigakure because I want to be left alone. But I find it funny that you say all of these things about me when you've yet to stop in Kumogakure recently, and see the work I've put in with these people. My personal feelings are the reason why I'm Raikage, because I refuse to see anymore children starve, anymore wifes widowed, or any men broken by the loss of their mate. To hell with everything else!" 

He pants heavily after giving his speech.* - Thu Nov 19 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"No, you aren't wrong. Like I said to your student, we have differing ideals. I told you were killing men, women, and children because of a misunderstanding of five hundred thousand ryo. If that's the case I can give you that right now, and you're right about me in the fact that I shouldnt have judged you. But what else do I have to go on? I'm nothing? Sure. I'm nothing, and it doesn't bother me. I am foolish as well, anything you want to call me.. But I know one thing for sure, and that I have love for my kinsmen..." 

Eiyu rubs his temples as he is racked with a massive headache. "You can call me what you like, and I'd probably agree with you.. Even so, I agreeed with the others when they said you need to be stopped, but not in the way you might think. You see, I am a pacifist, and I don't believe in killing at all. Your student isn't as slick as she thinks herself to be.. I know she was Shady from the start, but even so I havent touched a hair on her head, and havent mistreated her because I don't believe in that. Look at at it this way.

"I have two villages telling me something about you, even if I try to dispute it without aid I am trapped. This is me being honest. I used to resent you for a long time, not truly understanding why you did what you did, if it's a dispute about money like I was told then that is just wrong, but I know there a two sides to every story. Even still, you don't know my story either, so I guess in a way we are both wrong? You want to know the real reason I deny everyone who tries to give me aid, its because Kumogakure is grabbed by the balls. Sunagakures forces are in there by force, not on my request. They come with the notion to protect, which I will admit is a promising offer, but you're fucked when you look at the details. Namely because... During this moment in time, if Sunagakure was ever upset at Kumogakure they could have it wiped off the face of the Earth like nothing. Because Kirigakure and Sunagakure are allies it leaves me on the outs. Lord-Hassan even told me I answered to him, and when I said otherwise I was simply brushed off. Yet, I endue all of this, I stay within my domain, and the efforts to see you captured haven't been a goal of mine ever since I got power. I've been restoring the place, slowly but surely. I am a noble man, and my work speaks for itself. The hunger rate in Kumogakure has been slashed in half, and the people who are still in poverty are finding a means to work again... Even while Sunagakure is there, we're growing.... I dont see anyone as an enemy, the only people who I see as an enemy are the people who would kill the innocents of Kumogakure. I say this in all honesty, Ortho.. You are not my enemy, nor is Kirigakure, or Sunagakure. But if anyone, at anytime ever tries to kill my people, I will do everything I can to stop them. Whether it be Sunagakure, Kirigakure or even you... For this is my Nindo, my shinobi way, and if you don't like what I have to say, I suppose there's going to be a battle.. But I meant -every- word I said, and your student knows that...You should too. The fact that she's alive say's it all."* - Thu Nov 19 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) blinked several times. "W-Wait, I don't understand... I- No strings attatched, yes, but why would you help us?" He thinks back to the man's comment where he spoke of Hideki, and Ushinawa and how they were all fairly close, and they were shinobi of Kumogakure. <So his reason to see us prosper is because his roots essentially span there.. But I still don't understand why these villages want him gone..>

"I would, but I don't get it.. I need to understand.. What's the real reason why Kirigakure hates so much?"

<Have I been decieved from the start?>* - Thu Nov 19 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) Where you thought one evil was great, a greater evil loomed behind that one's shadow. Ortho was -created- the way he is now by the events he had been put through. He had been tortured by the Mizukage in a horrific manner, and only managed to make it out by a slight error. He was taken aback by the disfigured appendage. "They did that to you...?" He finally understood why Ortho was driven the way he was.

He -hated- these people for what they had done, and the present Mizukage was thriving off of the fact Ortho had reason to hate the Land Of Water. Eiyu looked as if he had fallen ill. "I trusted them.... I wanted to believe in what I've been told... I even helped the current Mizukage... How could they keep the truth from me like this?"

In a way, Eiyu's wanting to stop the root of all evil was misguided. He had been fooled by the powers that be who were probably using him now. This made him feel as if he couldn't trust them at all, he had been made a fool of for the longest and he didn't even know.

"I will denounce Kirigakure's actions..." It was a gesture that was sure to get him assassinated by the powers that be, but he didnt care. This was on principle. "Everything good I've said about them in the past.... I take back...."* - Thu Nov 19 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) shakes his head in the negative. "No, no, and no... The Mizukage has amassed -great- power in such a short period of time. He was able to obtain even my own summoining style, and employ's strange Hidens... He is -very- dangerous. Even so he has most certainly swayed Suna to follow him.... In his attempt. They are too strong, and too many, but if I am the party that disputes those claims it should tie their hands."* - Fri Nov 20 00:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) nods his head, he finally understood why Ortho was doing what he was doing. It was for his family, his legacy, he didn't want it to be tarnished, and lived with them in mind. "I can understand your reasoning for wanting to fight alone, but look at the bigger picture. It's true, these men were great, and so are you by following in their foot-steps, but dont fall down where they have. I assume they are dead... You live for them, and they are in the past, but your past, present, and future stand by you right now.

He points to Eri.
"She loves you more than anything in the world. More than life itself.... She told me she would kill anything in this world to keep you safe. Rather it be man, woman, or child... If you die, you will doom her as well..... You know this, correct?"* - Fri Nov 20 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "I cant allow you to throw your life away... If need to I will make up some sort of fix. In the end you accept this, only because there are no other options. Kumogakure doesn't support Kirigakures actions, and if Sunagakure disputes it I will simply be stripped of my title of Raikage. The people will accept my choice, even if those in the Land Of Wind do not."

He walks forward, a giant crimson scroll imprinted on it's exterior, his white hair sways elegantly in the wind.

"I will make your case. But I will do it on my own, without anyone else present, no. I know what I will do, I will call a Kage-Summit."* - Fri Nov 20 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) says: The Mizukage won't dare attack me in front of Hassan. - Fri Nov 20 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) "Unacceptable.. Intolerable..." The Raikage glares at a parcel in his hand with Ortho's face on it. "I dispute all of these charges against this man. I have found there to be many discrepancy's about his status. "Fill a message to the remaining Kage of the shinobi nations that we have to speak on this, as well as any other manners. I will put a stop to this violence once and for all. Our true opponents are living it up while we sit here and kill eachother."


Thus, the birds were sent calling for all of the Kage's to a meeting in Kumogakure in one weeks time, the request also asks of refraining from attacking Ortho's following until these discussions were over, and done with. It was the first of it's kind, but it was needed for the sake of stability.* - Fri Nov 20 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The tarps leading into the eatery flung open. The white haired Minatabi was reading a book that was covered EcchiEcchi adventures. <Guess I better pick up where I left off with my dealings with Ortho, and Supaiku - Oh, Misana-Chan, arent you very endowed.~> The male didn't happen to see Eri until he actually sat down.

"Er.- .... Nani!?" He quickly shoves the book into his suit. "I wasn't doing anything!... Er... Hey..." He was obviously very embarrassment.* - Fri Nov 20 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Whew....> Eiyu's embarrassment would be placed on the back-burner for now. He was thankful that he wasn't noticed, and opts to wait for her to realize he was in the vicinity. Now that he was sitting across from her, the male promptly reaches into his bag to recieve a pen. He opens a scroll, and begins writing inside of it, the pattern was akin to Fuuinjutsu yet again. 

<Hmm. Interesting..>
"Man, I guess shinobi do live casual lives here after-all.." Eiyu begins to smile as his thoughts venture to his own home in Kumogakure. <It's good to know that I'm not the only one who needs their own free-time, and even though I'm on business... This could prove to be very fun..>* - Fri Nov 20 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) chuckles lightly sending both the pen and paper back into their respective compartments. "I came on business, but I also have a suggestion for you, as well as Ortho when he returns. You see, there are some shady dealings happening in the Land Of Water. I was told the truth shortly after my arrival to Konohagakure. I was informed the reason why Ortho killed those people was because of the money involved. Upon further research on the matter I've come to the conclusion that it was a lie, they were lies.. I've seen proof of Ortho's pain and suffering, I have also seen the suffering he has caused, and while we do share different ideologys his actions were not without merit."

"But to put things bluntly... Your Sensei is an inch from dying, and he's aware of this. He wishes to fight alone, but I have a better method on how to go about this.. Because at this rate... He will die.. I've told him this, and he knows.. He agreed.."* - Fri Nov 20 17:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Yes, it's a matter of he said she said. Only when you split the events down the middle do you find the truth." If Eri cared to observe his face he had dark rings around his eyes. "I am also fairly tired.. It seems caravans don't know the definition of a gentle ride.... *Yawn* .. - But back to the topic at hand. If the Mizukage discovers you live here he will most likely round up his shinobi, and request some from Sunagakure, and they will try to tear this place down until they find you.... I don't think they will show any quarter.. We are out-manned, and out-gunned. There is a means to protect yourself, but I fear this one is just as risky, but all goes as planned you'd be safe, and wouldn't have to deal with being hunted. I plan to have an underground facility built in Kumogakure, I also plan to request that the Sunagakure shinobi present leave. Though this may take quite a bit of time, and a silver tongue. Diplomacy isn't my forte'."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) clenches his teeth at the mention of the Kazekage owning Sunagakure. "Lord-Hassan doesn't own my nation; he is there to protect it, but we shall see if he heeds my request. If not, I will know that he was just attempting to use me as a mouth-piece. I am not letting the Land Of Wind dictate the proceedings of my nation. It's unethical for them to do what they are doing, and I won't stand for it at all. Should they attempt to force me into submission, and I say attempt because I won't be bullied. If worst comes to worst... The Summit will be called off, and I will find another way to stop them."* - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Well, I'm going to denounce his -claim-.. Oh, no, I called a Summit, I know the Mizukage will attend, but I'm not too sure on the Kazekage. He seems as if he will not be bothered by anything, or anyone." Eiyu's hands rub the top of the desk, it's rough gradient reminded him of Hassan's rigid nature. It gave him headaches to the tenth degree how someone old enough to be his great grandfather could be selfish enough to claim his nation. Misfortune had smiled upon their nation once, and he began to doubt if Edge was the only one responsible for the attack on his home.

I'm going to give a speech to the denizens of Kumogakure on the subject of how we are an independent nation." Eiyu swings his legs away from the table and stands on his own two feet. "If they don't like it, too bad." His right hand balls into a tight fist with enough tension to cause the bones to shift slightly.

*Pop* "Well, it's fine.. I guess I should've taken the hint when Hassan said I answer to him. Things are going to change from here on out."* - Fri Nov 20 17:48:22 2015

They also guard the Mansion with relative ease, but as far as telling them what to do.. It's a no go.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Never tell anyone. - Fri Nov 20 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"I suppose you are right.. They are gone... No, don't worry.. I won't tell anyone either.. But I think you know why Ortho showed me what he did, and told me what he did." Eiyu begins to drink from a bottle of water, his eyes still registering low.

"He trusts me, and I don't intend to ever break his trust, because it's like a mirror with these sorts of things, once shattered it could never be put back together again."* - Fri Nov 20 19:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I need to speak to him about the situation at hand... Do you know when he'll be back? - Fri Nov 20 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I do not. - Fri Nov 20 19:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: My shinobi will grow restless if I am gone for too long. - Fri Nov 20 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm, do you mind if I wander around Konohagakure for a bit? I actually wanted to know what differences in our villages were. - Fri Nov 20 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm sure he will be here soon enough.... Oh... I mean... sure... do you want me to come with you? - Fri Nov 20 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes, like a guide. - Fri Nov 20 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Though I suppose since I'm on business... I shouldn't go out looking casual. - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Right... - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) seals them away.* - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Me being seen with a kage will draw attention to you and then me, they will wonder who I am. - Fri Nov 20 19:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: And I like my face, I don't want to have to change it. - Fri Nov 20 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I understand. - Fri Nov 20 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) follows suit.* - Fri Nov 20 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) exits the shop with his old sandals in hand. He'd toss them into the nearest waste-bin and proceed to make his way through what seemed to be the center of most foot-traffic. 

"Hn.." He spots a blonde haired woman in front of a statue which he assumed to be the previous Hokage.

<She looks a bit different... From the others..> There was no need to define what the male meant by different, as it would be obvious once someone took the time to understand how he worked.

"Hello..There."* - Fri Nov 20 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) had been surprised by the females snide nature. However, Eiyu was able to find humor in this situation, mainly because he didn't expect for anyone that looked like her to come off so blatantly cold.

He carefully considers a response . <Let's see if I don't mess this up.. I must present myself in a correct manner..>

"Nothing I simply wanted to introduce myself. My name is Kumogakure, and I'm from Eiyu." He nods respectfully in her direction.

"Whom might you be?" 
<Wait, what did I just say....?> 
* - Fri Nov 20 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Too busy staring at her tits. - Fri Nov 20 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||<N-..Nani? Where did I-.. Oh, damn it!....> "R-right... That I did.." His gaze pivots from her body, the accentuating curves were enough to entice him at first, but now he was left with his feelings hurt, and it showed. 

<These women in Konohagakure are just as mean as the one's in Kirigakure...>
"I apologize for intruding." He mutters lowly, before commencing on his journey throughout the village.

<It won't happen again, trust me...>
* - Fri Nov 20 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looked to the Magician, and then to Eri. They seemed to be going at it to a degree. The tension was kept civil for the time being, Eiyu had his fair share of arguments but he found that among women it was fair worse. Only because men usually were obvious about their disdain, but he couldn't get a read on Eri at all, let alone Asteroth.

His interest in the lady spanned a line of innocence. He had no ulterior motive other than hopefully expand his network of contacts, but given her demeanor he assumed that to be impossible. He also thought against his previous action of moving, it would be rude to do that, not to mention he was curious as to how this would all play out.

"..Seems every important figure is dying in odd ways...Unless they are from the Land Of Wind, of course."

"Death is unfortunate, no matter the person... That much we can all agree on, no?" * - Fri Nov 20 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <I don't like the aura of this woman...> Eiyu's eyes narrowed intently on the female who now stood by the vending machine. "Seems we do not share the same view-points." <Hm, she's quite the inquisitive one.> "Well, for one Kumogakure isn't in the best state right now.. So I've come looking to buy things.. But of course I came up empty handed because Konohagakure lacks a lot of things, namely blacksmiths."

"Things of that nature." He almost flinched as she slammed the book on itself.* - Fri Nov 20 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Logically speaking, that'd be correct. However, someone as intelligent as yourself should know it is harder than ever to enter that village without a long, and drawn out process."

Eiyu shifts his weight from one foot, to the other. "Can I ask you a personal question? Were you offended by anything I did because I'm getting the impression that you simply do not like me, for whatever reason."

His gaze ceases it's intensity, a hand reaches up to scratch the back of his head. 

* - Fri Nov 20 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: He's really bad at this. - Fri Nov 20 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looks at the ground, he found her gaze unsettling for many reasons. "I was just attempting to make conversation.. I guess maybe it will take some getting used to.. I haven't yet anyone like you, and I don't think I will find anyone like you outside of this village."

"Even though you're a stranger, you're still a human-being, and because of this fact I am interested in you.. There aren't many people in Kumogakure, and so when I meet someone I try to talk to them as much as I can and understand them, see what they are like.."

He manages to look in her general direction, but avoided her gaze entirely.* - Fri Nov 20 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) had been -crushed- by her words. He thought his etiquette was better than most, and he hadn't done that out of disrespect for her but it was that was nervous. "Well, I-.." His voice trails off as he see's her getting closer. This was a precaution on his part, but he preemptively walks backwards in order to save himself from the closing proximity between the two. 

"You'll have to forgive me... I have an issue with people getting close to me who I don't know.. But my name is Eiyu, and it is nice to meet you." He looks at the extended hand and shakes his head.

He dabbled in the arts of Fuuinjutsu, and knew in some instances all it required was a touch before you'd see your maker.

* - Fri Nov 20 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Nah, just me.." Eiyu looks around a look of confusion on his face. <Then he is reminded of the fact that the lady didn't know either of them. "She's just someone I met earlier. I have to return to my home soon, I can see that me coming here this early was a bust, but things will be better from here on out." He folds his arms over his chest.

"I might go to Sunagakure, but.. I don't know."* - Fri Nov 20 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Wanted to shake his hand but not mine. - Fri Nov 20 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: I guess I will inform him of you coming by... - Fri Nov 20 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: Thank you. - Fri Nov 20 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm. . ? Odd then. You are quite friendly. - Fri Nov 20 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I just like to express my form of empathy.. It's important to understand peoples emotions. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Because it makes you a better person. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oi. . .So optimistic you are. It's cute, I'll admit. But foolish all the same. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That way of thinking leaves you susceptible to being hurt. - Fri Nov 20 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'll gladly take any form of heartache is given to me, if it helps relieve the pressure off of someone else.. - Fri Nov 20 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's just how I am. - Fri Nov 20 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If people actually took the time. - Fri Nov 20 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: To hear one another... - Fri Nov 20 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Maybe there wouldn't have been so much violence, and death. - Fri Nov 20 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . . .Gah. You remind me of a priest. - Fri Nov 20 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ....hahahhaaah. - Fri Nov 20 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looks around the vicinity. "-. Wait, me a Priest? Why thank you- Wait, why are you laughing... I haven't done wrong to anyone when I could help it."* - Fri Nov 20 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I think Priests are fairly spot on in terms of their ideology, they aren't selfish like other people, and instead work to help. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But I haven't met a real Priest. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Well, Niza-Sama was one. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yukio too, but I never met him. - Fri Nov 20 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) appeared genuinely offended by the ladies comment. "Holier than thou, are you kidding me? People who are benevolent don't presume to judge over people.. They simply want to make the world a better place. My way of life is cute, but me finding this path certainly wasn't... You say this, but you seem to be on the opposite side of the spectrum, thinking your'e better than everything, and everyone? You want to laugh at my life!? Simply accepting death as it is is a weak willed concept bred by people who either are too apathetic, or want it to happen!"

"I just don't understand how someone like you could be so twisted. You're beautiful, and intelligent, but you're so offensive it's disgusting! How do you even . .  . How . .? " He seems to have tired himself out from all his screaming.

"Why would someone like you be so . . .Uncaring? Cold? Has this world changed people so much?..." His head descends once more.

"I might've been wrong about my comment, but what I said still stands.. I aspire to be great like them, and I won't let anyone's snide remarks deter me from my shinobi way..."* - Fri Nov 20 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...Wow, compliment the lady and then insult her two seconds later. - Fri Nov 20 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Bravo. - Fri Nov 20 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Amegakure...that's good. - Fri Nov 20 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) was just a kid, and an ungraceful one at that. What he lacked in grace he made up with passion. "Then from what you're saying... You're no different from them because your attitude is the same.. I guess maybe maybe the world is just full of hypocrites. People often talked down things, yet rarely took the time to look at themselves. 

It was a curse of humanity.

Upon seeing Ortho, however, everything changes. His visit wasnt in vain, and he was happy that his travels weren't confined to meeting some rude ole' hag who thought she was the next best thing.

"I would like to speak to you when you have time."* - Fri Nov 20 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ..Hmph. .. -Oh, yeah.. Now would be fine, I can't stay here much longer... Duty calls.. - Fri Nov 20 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) whispers: I've known her for a while now. Back when I first got released from prison. - Fri Nov 20 23:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) shakes his fist in their direction. "Oi! What're you doing!?"* - Fri Nov 20 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Think I'll just skin him. - Fri Nov 20 23:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Good, I am your new Raikage, my name is Eiyu.. I ensure you everything will be okay from here on out, but I have a few tasks I need to get done. You will be given three scrolls that detail what needs to be done, they are all D-Ranks, I wish to see how you fair in these tasks, as you improve so too with the tasks I entrust you with. Do you understand, Eiji?" The male promptly extends three scrolls that had his seal imprinted on them.

"Keep a log of all the missions you do. Detail what you felt, as well as the people around you. It's good to measure one's feelings against your own, you will learn empathy." 

"But these are basic..Here."

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) offers but a nod of his head and dispenses the currency that was owed to Eiji. "Very good.. There will be even more tasks that need to be completed, but that will be for a later day, now I am curious about -you-. Namely, what is it that you do, and in your words define what a shinobi means to you." 

The Raikage motions behind himself towards the building in the foreground, or what used to be. Kenshins attack on the Land Of Clouds wounded large portions of the village, not to mention Edge's crusade. But alas the bits and pieces of broken Earth were being pieced together, slowly but surely the damage was deafened.

Workers labored arduously on the manor, restoration had finally begun.* - Sat Nov 21 01:10:24 2015
