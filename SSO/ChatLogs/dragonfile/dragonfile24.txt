<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) made his way upwards, eventually ending his soujurn at a non-descript house. Clean windows, and a door that seemed to be so clean it was polished, it all stood out to the Yamanshi. It is everything he wanted in a house, and he wondered what kind of family lived inside. "I envy... It......" Chakra crackles around his sword, his left arm flexes, a fercious swnig aimed at the door. 

It carves into the wooden panel, splinters splay into the foundation but he continues onwards, charged by his discontent with this world. It was truly over for someone like him, his rage fed into his desire to see this world changed, a world in none could tell the victors from the losers.

A world of peace.


A world without the Gezo.* - Fri Oct  9 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Fuck it..." He turns away from the house he had destroyed. He didn't know who owned it, and quite frankly he didn't care at all. "I'm willing to do whatever I need to if it means getting what I want." 

The male turns, his eyes scanning the tumbleweeds running over themselves, cracked rock formations, and the gray curtain that hung off of the skies. 

He was at a loss.

<So much bull-shit...> 
He didn't know how long he could keep this ruse up, but it was something that truly bothered him. He had to act like an annoying brat so the others would ignore him, or discount him as something whimsical. If they only knew his plans..

If they only knew what he had done.
"Idiots.." Yes, they had all been idiots, even Niza-Sama was thought of as idiotic, perhaps even his sisters. He had manipulated them all to get what he wanted in the end.* - Fri Oct  9 00:17:55 2015

It was enough to knock him off of his feet and send him flying through the air with Niza's body clinging to his form.

However, he wasn't struck by Kenshin directly. Several ribs had been broken, his other arm had been broken and it felt like his other arm had been torn off, but alas it simply snapped in another area.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) had broken several bones, he really should've been taken out of the fight but there was no way for him to go down now. At least not without being hit directly, telling an enraged man you didn't kill someone was fucking unless. That shit never worked, and it was something the Yamanshi couldn't stand, but if there was one thing about being enraged, it was that your focus was on several other factors. You didnt notice the smallest details, and it was one Kojiro sought to explot, in one swift motion he aims to pull out his sword and slice Kenshins head off, even with what happened to him, he still remains standing till the very end.

"DIE!"
He took note of the syrup trap and attempted to time it with this.* - Fri Oct  9 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) couldn't dodge this at all., he is pretty much killed with his comrades, the mountain face tumbling down, even if Kojiro could manage to slice into Kennshins neck, which he intended to do it probably wouldn't be enough to kill him before he blew up.

He is killed instantly.* - Fri Oct  9 02:00:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <No.....> The ground was shaking with such intensity that Kojiro felt that this was truly the end. Rock formations that had been set ablaze tumbled, Kenshins illuminated body igniting energies around his form, possibly with enough force to kill him instantly. He had never felt anything like this, such power, and all of it to destroy his home. He had just spoken to Niza, and Yukio about this. He had just finished speaking to them about why some people needed to simply die, and now this. 

His home.
His people.
They were dying.....


His family.
Friends...
Everyone.. He had lost it all, and now he too would lose his life. 
That was until Yukio sprung into action and produced the prolific hands of God that descended upon the ground. Shileding him from destruction, and a most terrible end. But a lesson had been learned here, and an important one at that...
There was no peace, and the only thing people understood was revenge, Kojiro was changed this day, in front of his corpse
His broken body was filled with hate for the man who destroyed his home, but more importantly, hate for Kirigakure.* - Fri Oct  9 02:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) gazed at both Niza and Yukio, a glimmer of humor in his eye. Blood trailed his mouth from the internal injuries, he had sustained too much damage, and as a result he wouldn't survive. He had done what he could to protect his family, and he had failed. He had attempted to show them they way, but alas, he could not.
Everything was in vain, nothing had purpose, and as the world closed in around him he could tell this was the end.

"Heh..." He'd mutter weakly, looking around to see all the damage that had been done.
"I warned you.... I told you..... This was inevitable... There is no peace, no solace. We're all doomed to die, no-one gives a fuck about us....... Ditch your useless teachings, and get revenge for what has happened here....." His eyes trail to Gene.

"I love you protect your sister, protect your brother........ Do what I could not...."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) looked at the remnants of the Hokage mansion, and simply frowned. There was destruction all around, and all of it was undeserved. The village at this point was nothing more than a venting device where brutes possessing power beyond his wildest dreams took Konohagakure, brick by brick. Too many had already died, and now, Nozumi was left picking up the pieces. 

"What to do...?" 
He looks around, paper over-flowing everywhere, and the smell of decay pushing into his nostrils. "Well, this is just rancid..." He begins by organizing requests, and missions that had been undertaken, but never truly finished. This takes several hours, and once he was once he could feel pain welling in his lower-back.

"*Sigh"* 

"Now, a far as the rest of the village is concerned..."
He directs his cobalt gaze to the roof, beams of golden light penetrated it's being. 
"The mansion too, huh?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) looks into the males eyes, flame sparking from his eye-sockets. Yet again it was like he was testing him with the flames intensity. He raises his left hand above his eye-line, hopefully saving his eye-brows from being melted off.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) would lead by example where the others did not. There was talk of shinobi from Konohagakure No Sato abandoning their home, and that was something that truly bothered him. It was something that wouldn't have been tolerated had their been a real Hokage or sense of leadership. He is seen hammering a nail into a plank, and then sealing the edges together with an agent that would most likely bind them together.


Ironically, the scrolls on his waist seemed to house all the tools he needed.
"Oi... Oi..." He drives the hammer against his index finger by accident.
He sucks on his finger promptly before turning around.
"OH!" His face turns red from embarrassment .

"I didn't see you... There.. Hello, hello." 
He bow's, and then with narrowed cobalt eyes he scans the woman, and the tanto resting on her shoulders.

"What are you doing?"* - Sat Oct 10 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: I'm really not going to get anything done without the proper funds. - Sat Oct 10 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: If you're a Konohagakure shinobi I'd like to warn you that it's not safe to be out of the village like you are, and if you are not ... I really don't know why you'd be over here at all. - Sat Oct 10 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Hostile, but still ..Hm..> Eyes that rivaled the most flawless of sapphires come into focus. Two pupils now reading even the smallest movement the female did. He smiles warmly, he found it was the best device to put people at ease. The smallest of gestures could turn hearts, and make even the most difficult person at least consider a mood change.

But alas, as Nozumi surmised everyone was diferent.
"It's simple really.. I'll simply rebuild what has been broken..."* - Sat Oct 10 01:21:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) countless scrolls could be seen on the males person. There was a glimmer in his eyes that was simply magnificent.

Eyes twitch, getting a lay of the land. The male is driven, that much is certain, a hand is raised towards the clone's, their being upon this land no doubt would have to consist of someone who was providing them with chakra.

He was nowhere to be found, and nothing lasted forever. 

The parchment comes to life, countless plums of smoke tangle the Land Of Wind.* - Sat Oct 10 01:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) flowers native to his lands home were clutched unevenly in his grip. The knots in his throat tightening like a fist against his trachea. 

"Hello."

Countless scrolls were drawn on his waist, all of them matching the same crimson pattern. His white cloak was emblazoned with crimson flames, the ripple pattern coming together through the golden finish.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) "Oh...? This?" He opens his mouth to speak - his voice a tad bit calmer than it should have been in this situation. "It was my fathers."Such a bland explanation or something that meant the world to him. Brows furrow, he is immediately on the defensive. 

"It wouldn't fit you though..."* - Sat Oct 10 01:59:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) looks around the area and takes in the sight. Everything was so different, the adobe based buildings, to the arid heat. <I don't think I came prepared...> He smiles to himself, his right foot shuffling forward which uproots a content storm of sand, the depressions of his foot-falls even proving to shock him.
<I've heard rumors.. I've read countless books...>
His right hand raises, gaps of light slip through his finger. 
"I guess it takes a bit..... I haven't been anywhere this hot before..Uhm, what's your name?" The question obviously aimed at Sanoke.* - Sat Oct 10 02:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) nods, some people naturally held a sembalance pride that they held onto. Sanoke seemed to be such a person, in all honesty Nozumi understood, and actually admired the gray haired shinobi to a certain degree.
"Nice to meet you. I'm Nozumi."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) looked at the rock formation no longer caring for the others he had met during his stay. Quite frankly he was annoyed to hear that the village he lived in for so long was to be taken over by a foreigner, but he could do very little to change that. Several factors were taken into account when becoming the Hokage and Hideki didn't meet those qualifications. Perhaps there was still some merit for his stay here
. 

"Sigh.."
His training would not be fruitless, there was still time for him to improve his techniques without having to deal with looking after the children. Jutsu formulas written upon scrolls were unfurled and extended.  * - Sat Oct 10 04:32:38 2015

Yoshiko seemed to be the black sheep, they had to have met her somewhere else, they didn't trust her with Hideki's nephew, who had to be the child they were standing next to.

"I'm his babysitter."
"But uh, I was going to say usually a Queen, or King is soon as someone who's rule is absolute.. Konohagakure had a council, and each head was a collective. I don't know if you know anything of our history, and quite honestly I don't think you really care..To make matters worse... Ugh...." 

He pauses.
<It doesn't matter what her ideals are, if the people see progress they are going to bend at the knee... That makes me the village by inheritance, but I don't really know what's going on anymore....

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: You want to go somewhere with me? - Sat Oct 10 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Sure, buddy. - Sat Oct 10 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You're my babysitter after all.. - Sat Oct 10 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: How is he going to forget that? - Sat Oct 10 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) extends his arms, if the child allowed him to pick him up he'd do just that.* - Sat Oct 10 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) whispers: The things I'm going to do) - Sat Oct 10 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) sets the child down on the cold, and forgiving pavement. Tears came to his blue eyes, he didn't know what was happening anymore. His village was on the brink of dying, and strange developments were taking place. The kind hearted male was not prepared for the worlds woes, and the consequences that followed his recent demise. 

It would be a lie to say he hadn't thought of the same. To move on from this pile of rock was like moving away from an old lover.
"Child..."* - Sat Oct 10 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) "It's okay." He smiles, the tears ending their descent as time goes on. "It's okay to cry you know..? It just means that your still human, emotion still lives within you.... " He points towards his chest, and then the childs. "*Sigh*" He was so frustrated with his life, and didn't know how to handle it, the Genius of Konoha, the Yellow-Fang was at a loss.

He reaches into his back-pouch, and hands Heiwa a booklet on the history of Konohagakure. It was detailed about how they were once a proud nation. It spoke of Zetsumo, and his assault on the citizens of the Lad OF Fire... It was detailed about a man na
ed Jak who also destroyed Konohagakure, but even with all of this lose the people remained.

The flames that were meant to snuff their existence reforged them, and made them stronger than ever.
"Never forget that just because fire goes out... Doesn't mean a new flame will spark in it's place."* - Sat Oct 10 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: When I look at you... - Sat Oct 10 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I see your parents... - Sat Oct 10 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: That fire.... - Sat Oct 10 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) shakes his head, a bandaged hand makes contact with his hair if allowed.

"No, I did not know your parents, nor am I speaking literally... But.. Both your mother, and father made you, and you are both of them at the same time... You loved them, and they loved you... They are gone, yes... But.. In a way.. They live in on you, and the others who care about you... I assumed you are a boy who's loved very much... I can see it because your heart is still kind...."* - Sat Oct 10 08:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) understood the childs words. His mind was still a blank canvas, but he could already see where other's had influenced his actions. There was a part of him that felt bad that such a child had to go through this, but on the flip side he was thankful that he was strong.

Not a lot of children would be alright with both of their parents dying.
But who was to say he was truly okay?
"I beg to differ, young-man... I think a kind heart is what this world needs the most. You can force a child to put on clothing, to go to school. You can try to force a man to act a certain way, but in the end he still has his free will to decide what he wants to do. No-one has the right to impose their will onto another. To suggest such would mean we think of ourselves above humanity, and that is simply not possible... We aren't gods... If a fire is fed too much fuel, and not nurtured properly it will expand out of it's domain and consume everything."* - Sat Oct 10 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Do you think I hate the entity that did this? It's as fruitless as hating a lion that killed a human being. - Sat Oct 10 08:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Nature... Or perhaps not, I do not know. - Sat Oct 10 08:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: If one wanted true change. - Sat Oct 10 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: They would realize being a shinobi for one village is simply a means to an end. - Sat Oct 10 08:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Yes, I wanted to become Hokage at-some point. - Sat Oct 10 08:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: . . .It really is bigger than Konoha. - Sat Oct 10 08:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: In order to stop all of this... - Sat Oct 10 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: We all need to underestand one another. - Sat Oct 10 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..And if we don't? If everyone keeps dying? - Sat Oct 10 08:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Empathy. - Well. - Sat Oct 10 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: People will die regardless.. - Sat Oct 10 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Sickness... Other accidents... - Sat Oct 10 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: But. - Sat Oct 10 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: What would you do? - Sat Oct 10 08:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Do you think any human has the capacity or right to govern another? - Sat Oct 10 08:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: This is a product of men attempting to lead others. - Sat Oct 10 08:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps not the beasts attack. - Sat Oct 10 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: But the wars. - Sat Oct 10 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ..The right should rule. If one side finally won. - Sat Oct 10 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If there was just one person in power..there'd be no more contest. - Sat Oct 10 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There'd be no more wars..or death needed. - Sat Oct 10 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: So it's about winning now? Only the strongest prevail? - Sat Oct 10 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Natural selection... - Sat Oct 10 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Er. - Sat Oct 10 08:55:28 2015
