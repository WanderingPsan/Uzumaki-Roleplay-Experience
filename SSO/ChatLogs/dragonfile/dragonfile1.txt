<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Because Senbon's were fast moving projectiles that were smaller than it's partner weapon's UShinawa had to be careful. Instead of attempting to dodge the initial salvo wihile staying within his spot he knew that he'd simply have to move.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "I know.." Ushinawa could test his opponent with his words but he knew better than to actually -let- his guard down. The young-lady was smart enough not to let his words get her emotions running and he noted it. Then the next barrage came and he was left with no other course but to move out of the way of the other barrage. He dashes to the side of course while resuming his stance, but if she took notice it was obvious he was progressively working his way to her with his movements. * - Thu Sep 03 15:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <She's mixing in strategy with her assault and timing my pacing.. That is very good...> The first two came in hot and he quickly flips on his instep and accelerates to the side so that when the other one's came from her mouth they'd simply fall behind. He was no longer running at his casual speed but instead utilized the speed at which he did when he was in combat. His-foot-falls tore the sand under his heel into a frenzy of dirt and when he ceases running if all went well he'd be at her side with his hand resting on her shoulder.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at Orakuru with his hands tied together into a content dome. He observes his compatriot and wonders what it could be that he wished to talk about. 

"What is it?"* - Sun Sep 06 13:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) found it odd that Orakuru mentioned that, it was certainly a driving force but for what exactly? He ambles a bit closer wondering what he could've meant by such a thing. It was true, family ties made you stronger but when they were broken it made you hate even more.
"What're you getting at?"* - Sun Sep 06 13:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at Orakuru slightly surprised as he never really gave him his real name. His words did alert him to something was quite off, not to mention he was acting quite odd for a matter of fact. "I think I understand where this is leading.." He states, his body gently shifting to face the hedge of the door wherein he attempted to exit the building. 

Which was done in one motion thanks in part to his ability. However his peripherals were working in spite of this.
"You attempt to trim loose ends and you will find that more sprout in it's place. It's just the way the world works, although I don't blame you for trying."* - Sun Sep 06 13:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) stops entirely, his head cranes to the side and he found himself at a loss of words. He was right, they were family but they were also shinobi. Ushinawa's paranoia spawned from his difficulty in life in general. He had to deal with the destruction of his brother at the head of the tyrant known as Klaus, and although he did not draw the killing blow he might as well've. 
"Clan...?"* - Sun Sep 06 13:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) smirks.* - Sun Sep 06 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at the woman towards the south, and then back to Tethys. Eventually his gaze resting on Nigen, it seemed all he was doing was watching for the time being.* - Sun Sep 06 18:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Don't say it. - Sun Sep 06 18:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) gaze no longer retained it's obsidian composition, three tomoes rapidly swirling in the neuxs of his eyes, in both of his hands the legendary Kiba-blades at his waist. "Try me."* - Sun Sep 06 18:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) Tethy's might have been fast but he made his first mistake when he attacked in the first place. Or well, his adjustment of attacking. There was a problem with his flow and this was his undoing. In order to dispatch the Kunai he would have to keep his arm in the air and either-way it didn't determine his attack speed.
Because the moment he did this UShinawa was already on the attack, it was the consequence of him trying to attack two people at once. Nor did it determine his over-all speed in spite of this, his actions were readable by his sharingan at this point and the fact that his opponent thought it best to run directly through him was foolish, an expansive wave of lightning from all cardinal points simply cut through the skies like a knife, above, below, to the sides there was nowhere he could possibly go.

He made sure to distance himself as well.* - Sun Sep 06 18:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wasn't going to play his game of cat and mouse and deal with him the way he wanted. He obtains even more distance than before but not before stringing a series of seals, instantly leaves swirled around Tethy's head, as that served as the trigger, inside of his minds eye he attempts to bestow his worst nightmare upon him. No indication was given as to where he was looking as well. The strength of the Genjutsu however was further strengthend by the use of his Sharingan.* - Sun Sep 06 18:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) couldn't believe the Land Of Wind was truly defending Tethys in their own right. It was kind of ironic actually, as when they were on the brink of destruction it was by his hand they were able to survive by the dumping of his men into their nation. But they were little more than parasites truth be told, he cared nothing for Chiyari's words as he only stepped up when it was obvious one man would fall and the other wouldn't. Now they huddled around in worry about their precious nation which was threatened to their face they were nothing more than cowards with headbands and even he didn't know why he wore it. 

Regardless he continues to accelerate with immense speed clearly outrunning even the Ninken before forming handseals and allowing a wave of lighting to rush from the base of his finger-tips, the arch was indeed wide and due to the fact he faced a different direction and Tethys legs did not work aniticpating and dodging were next to null. 
However, if it hit it would no doubt strike his head and abdomen but it wasn't enough to end his life, he understood the males importance.
He would need to be stunned however.* - Sun Sep 06 19:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was playing it nice but Tethy's simply pusahed his hand, he responded with his own in kind of releasing a pyre of flame to warp the wind barrier and increase the intensity of the flames tenfold, he positons himself away yet again as it seemed the male wanted to push his luck.* - Sun Sep 06 19:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) sinks into the ground from here. He was made to be out the villain when his people had literally purged an entire clan based on what they looked like. He wasn't exactly even doing this for himself, rather Zhen's sake but it seemed his hand would no longer strike.
* - Sun Sep 06 19:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) swiftly heads into the hospital and ascends a series of steps until he recognizes a familiar chakra signatures, well two of them. The radio com alerts the men around the interior of Sunagakure. Their numbers were in the thousands.
"Move." He mutters as he pushes opens the door, he is followed by five men on a stretcher and they all prepare to head out.* - Sun Sep 06 22:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Fuji..> "Just have the remaining force attack who's left...  We aren't going to go the route their men are reported at.. Im sorry but this will be your last stand." He speaks into the com and really his men and women were up to their own devices but it would be suggested that they would leave. It was a different matter to confront a force he hadnt entirely conflicted with. He cared nothing for this nation , especially after their true colors were shown when push came to shove. 

He wasn't going to get caught flat foot-footed inside this nation because people were on a power-trip. He sinks into the interior but and scouts ahead, using  his ability to detect underground at a level where he couldn't exactly be reached conventionally let alone detected.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) makes his way away from all of this it was clear that that the Mizukage was up to something. "We're leaving Konoha once more." He states, of course he gives time for the people carrying the lady in white to move her. "When you Kirigakure shinobi burn in hell for your crimes it will be by your own hand... The consequences of genocide will follow -all- of you. But alas, if you have no hostile move to make then there wont be a fight. In addition it's forgiven but only if you allow us to speak to the former Mizukage, and if that happens... Maybe I'll decide to give you what you want."* - Mon Sep 07 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was able to read her movements easily with his Sharingan, he strings together a series of handseals in time to release intense flames towards the base. He waits it was in turn flipped in a manner of seconds as the flames were not only superior to the projectiles but also to the wind, and in-act it actually increased the potency to a degree. It was recast back at it's sender with a purpose.* - Tue Sep 08 00:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) took advantage of the fact the Mizukage was currently fighting an opponent in a heated battle, almost as if his focus were on him alone. True, he had a couple of people to back him up but he was closer. Zhen would no doubt be able to see the chakra well in the base of his blades, he didn't need to say anything. 
He was so focused on himself that he failed to realize that he was still a factor, as per-say he drove his blades in a vertical fashion allowing the lightning to jump off of the base but the spread of the technique closes in on the male from practically all sides of his being.

Of course he got some distance so as not to be caught up but the premise of his attack still went through.

* - Tue Sep 08 00:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) could already see that Tethys had dodged his attack by jumping into the air, but when you did that you left yourself open, Ushinawa simply formed handseals in the process of avoiding Koeki's impact radius in time to fire a blast of lightning at his flank. But of course his own radius was larger than expected.* - Tue Sep 08 01:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) there was a number of factor currently going on at this point. For one an ally of Tethys was able to conjure a projectile in a matter of moments and launch it at him with immense speed. The thing about this was shinobi were bred to have situational awareness not to say they were perfect but this object was certainly in his parallax. It would have been a different story if he had hit him from behind, he was able to move out of the way in-time to avoid it and due to Yan's previous technique the Kunai of Koeki's was disrupted. He knew why the Mizukage wasn't attacking either, not with chakra heavy techniques and it was because he didn't have much left.

Though upon his accelration he could see colored speckles on various locations. They matched ...Dravaes chakra signature.. 
He was moving quite fast however and possibly avoided them latching onto his form and this is when he tilts the kiba blades in the Mizukage's direction once more, an expansive ball of lightning raced towards his person* - Tue Sep 08 02:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) (*Koeki watched as her attack was avoided, Koeki immediately reacting by attempted to lean back. Of course, with the way she was positioned and the attack speed of her opponent, she wouldn't avoid the strike completely. As she leaned back, she'd be struck in the chest, though probably not in the area her opponent had intially intend.

Without much hesitiation, she rolled back unto the ground, aiming to gain some distance. 

She haulted herself with a skid, only to notice clumps of what she believed to be iron sand falling upon her being. *)
(*Shizan, Nigen His pitch had bounced around from medium to higher octaves.

"That's enough. This fight at first had some sort of appeal. Now it's simply how many of you can attack all at once. Of course, that's not necessarily a bad thing. In another situation, I'd be all for it. If you all are so afraid that you can not allow your Mizukage to fight on his own, he's already admitted defeat. Honestly, why would he need the help of his men to fight two unkown shinobi? It's pathetic, if anything this should be counted as a loss! Do you have no shame?!"*)* - Tue Sep 08 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Hadn't initially been located by Tetsumi's iron sand. The mixture would've piled over him but he was able to distance himself with his speed, and whilst using this in tandem with the fact that the Mizukage was currently bounded and was still stunned from using Shunshin he'd strike by formulating handseals together and forcing lightning from the basin of his finger-tips in the attempt to strike Tethys where he was. He was prepared for the consequences, he had been attacked twice and had started neither of the altercations. He aimed to put a stop to it here.* - Tue Sep 08 03:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) Tetsumi potentially made it worse for the Mizukage as iron conducts electricity .  * - Tue Sep 08 03:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||The Raikage was able to negate his jutsu, something that had really shocked him because he expected for Tethys to perish right here. It seemed he was safe and Ushinawa would not get the kill, he simply gazes at everyone he was one of the few who observed the bugs and took the time to avoid them even moving out of the way. (Stated in previous rps)

Nonetheless it was looking as if it would be Tethys and Niza versus himself. He clutched onto the Kiba blades with his tomoes scanning the male up and right. 
"Move aside.. ..."* - Tue Sep 08 03:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) had seen the Mizukage the entire time, his Sharingan allowed him to see chakra, even on a microscopic level and he aims to dispatch it through the Earth if the Mizukage was truly coming he would find lightning permeate the ground he was under with immense force that was powered by his raiton process..

<You've underestimated my eyes for the last time...>
Of course he distances himself as well.* - Tue Sep 08 04:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) felt the hand grasp being, and there was to be a level of surprise to it all. He was expected to go down in an instant only certain factors had to play. Ushinawa was tired there was no way to ignore that fact but there was one thing as well, his tiredness came from fatigue and he could feel his muscles burning, however in Tethys case it was slightly different, he could tell his chakra was barely living within him and it was getting dangerously close. That was from his previous observation now, but Ushinawa still held his blades at the ready and much like chakra flow he could produce the same effect while he rode his descent as this was dependnt on a Doton varation and not actual Taijutsu ability and of course the bolt of lightning followed through the base and the Kibas were one of the sharpest blades in the world couple it with his Raiton ability it was an easy matter to say his technique was inferior but he aimed low nonetheless.* - Tue Sep 08 04:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||The Mizukage couldn't entirely attack him while underground (dual-caster or transitionist) However, Ushinawa stopped dead in his tracks and collapsed. It was because of Dravaes bugs.* - Tue Sep 08 04:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) responds to Dravaes touh and grabs his hand breaking the fourth wall in the process. "Don't.. Let them suffer.."* - Tue Sep 08 06:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) lead Dravae's movement up to the finale, as he reaches for the blade and does as instructed something weird would manifest itself. The way he was holding the blade outwards exposed the tempered metal but nothing more than that. Ushinawa side-steps as smooth as silk while unsheathing his two blades in a fluid motion.
"I'm sorry... But..... You've doomed your people....." The crossing of the blade through his chest cavity splayed into his lungs if it hit. Still, none of his vitals were hit so wouldn't die right away, but in another motion he quickly raises both of the blades back to sever his arms if connected.

"You were like a brother but you betrayed me and now the last thing you will see is your death......"* - Tue Sep 08 07:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||That is where Dravae underestimated Ushinawas ability, he had planned for this but he didn't want to bring this jutsu out until his bugs were revealed. There was nothing hidden from his eyes now, he had already seen practically every jutsu Dravae had done. He honestly felt bad about what he had to do but he would end it here. Before the bugs could reach him or his partner they'd simply be burned away, the blades were literally on fire and it was a weakness to these bugs. Orakuru mentioned fire being a weakness before and this would lead to the downfall should this final blow connect, a single stab wound directed towards the base of his heart.* - Tue Sep 08 07:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at the corpse and simply shakes his head. "You were supposed to be different.... Sleep... Now.." He sheathes his blades and makes his way out of Konohagakure No Sato.
"They will think Kirigakure did this for the time being but we should go now."* - Tue Sep 08 08:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: So it would seem Dravae met his untimely end. - Tue Sep 08 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: I wil lget my possessions back one way or another. - Tue Sep 08 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: Did he? - Tue Sep 08 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Mhm. - Tue Sep 08 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: You're a fool. - Tue Sep 08 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Why? - Tue Sep 08 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: You could have retreated.. - Tue Sep 08 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: You were heavily outnumbered. - Tue Sep 08 13:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) whispers: And so the test of time begins.. - Tue Sep 08 13:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) knew what Nigen was trying to do but he wouldn't lose his temper over something like this. Instead, he would simply recast his own verbal attack with just as much acid that was used against him.
"Give it a break, Tsuki certainly did...."* - Tue Sep 08 13:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: Hm, nothing but muscle..... - Tue Sep 08 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: That's the key... - Tue Sep 08 13:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) turns and makes his way for the gates. "I must find Zhen so we can all plan our next move.. He's close..."* - Tue Sep 08 13:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) doesn't touch the body as he assumes it's a living bomb, the insects that moved about its body were now only droven my instinct because he was deceased, they were no longer directed and became -almost- harmless. Still he carries him far away on his broadsword.* - Tue Sep 08 14:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) slinks underground real deep like.* - Tue Sep 08 15:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) takes a step forward with his hands at his sides, he simply shakes his head in the negative. "Do you have any idea what you've done?"* - Tue Sep 08 16:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||The Raikage, the leader of the nation hidden in the clouds was to face an old rival, and a friend. The two of them grew up together and lived off of eachothers strength. This was until the untimely death of his beloved brother Gintoki. Hirusho spent all this time fostering hatred for Klaus and the powers that led up to his younger brothers demise. Now the centerstone of Kumogakure stood before him and he wanted to prove that his strength was superior over Niza's, he would show him why he had trained so hard for this moment. He intended to make sure he would win this challenge, both of his onyx eyes changed their composition, what was revealed in both eyes were three tomoes dancing around his crimson iris.


He prepares for combat.
"Come then...."* - Tue Sep 08 16:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <So it's begun...> His Sharingan was able to read his opponents movements and his reflexes were enough to further grant him the ability to time a perfect counterattack. He splays to the side while unsheathing his blade in a fluid motion and aims to drive the blunt end of the blade towards Nizas skull. "You're going to have to fight me with all you've got.." The other shoots for the back of his head in the attempt to make him lose his sense of balance.
It seemed he could use two swords at once.* - Tue Sep 08 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) carefully observed Niza's movements. He was skilled in the fact that Hirusho couldn't simply take him for granted. His prowess with the Sharingan was just a tool but it was up to him to make this work. He alters the trajectory of the blade while it is parried and twists to the side in order to avoid the next blow. This time he directs two sword swings towards his opponent, however this attack couldn't be blocked, it had to be evaded if the user wanted to get away without consequece and it was because he was on fire.* - Tue Sep 08 17:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) the armor was something he hadn't anticipated, the fact that he found his elemental affinity useless against him was something he couldn;t fathom. <How!?!> But alas it was too late, the head of Niza was currently descending against his form and he feels his form sliding back, he seemed to be stunned by he impact. 

<Damn it....>* - Tue Sep 08 17:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) the events would've transpired according to Niza's bidding. There wasn't really much he could do at this point. He had been stunned and couldn't react to his attack in this state, of course it went without saying that the wrist hold went through. He was thrown onto the ground and crashed into the laminate floors.

He pauses momentarily waiting for the next salvo. He had taken quite a bit of damage and couldn't take alot of them in rapid succession . His hands were held upwards into the air seeming as if it was some sort of guard.* - Tue Sep 08 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Niza backed away out of his willingness to have UShinawa simply submit, and his hands in the air served no real defense against his attack, at least not physically. However it was fortunate that he had did so because in the moment he backed away an expansive ball of lightning raced for Niza's postion. He aimed for the head over-everything else,  it seemed that anything else would simply be negated at this point, still the behavior of the lightning ball seemed to be a bit larger than it should've.* - Tue Sep 08 17:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) took the time Niza used to shield his eye-line to use this move. It was risky but he had to make sure to push him back, he forms several handseals within a short period of time and forces a condensed stream of Raiton based chakra towards his opponents head again. The scope would've been a bit more intense but it had no piercing power at all. Nonetheless if it connected with his head it would still effect him.
"I won't lose....."* - Tue Sep 08 18:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) twisted whilst on the ground and struggled to his feet, in a fluid motion he unsheathes a pellet and ignites it inside of Niza's face. The purple mist spreads and if he inhales he'd find that it had been a poison bomb. He timed it for this moment and hoped he would fall for his tactic.* - Tue Sep 08 18:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Your flame is inferior..> Ushinawa forms handseals because of one fact, he could see his chakra builiding and when the flame began to apex on its brink fire met it as well, however his prowess in Katon was profound, he aimed to blast the flames towards Niza in the refined space, of course due to the nature of flame the places that were not covered could possibly be scorched but if not he could possibly over-power it and have it turn on him anyway, nonetheless the mansion would burst into flames.* - Tue Sep 08 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) the flames were starting to travel through various pockets of the room. Niza attempted to bypass the ignition and of course his speed was enough to allow him to do so. But his current path that he was on was surrounded by the flames he currently ejected, if he was correct that is. He was aware the male was very powerful in Taijutsu and knew that he would attempt to reach out to him yet again, even with the transormation his Sharingan in tandem with his reflexes allowed him to foresee a glimpse, a split second passed and he was cuffing his hands together one more time, he positoned himself at Nizas flank and attempted to empty the lightning towards his head at pointblank, however it would not kill if it hit.* - Tue Sep 08 18:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) couldn't evade the jutsu, no there wasn't enough time for that. Niza was adjusting to his fighting style and it showed. He quickly rebounds off of his last attack and slams his arm against Ushinawa, this would've had enough power to knock him out entirely had he not brought up his arms at the same time in the attempt to deafen the impact. He skids rapidly across the ground obviously wounded by his offense... Flames continue to spiral but all he could see were the robes, all he could see was the title.
"No........"* - Tue Sep 08 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) feels the control over his neck leave him, he sputters violently against the strike to no avail, he is stunned and cant really stand on his feet anymore. He collapses into a heap.* - Tue Sep 08 19:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) stabs him in the neckand runs away.* - Wed Sep 09 15:01:45 2015
