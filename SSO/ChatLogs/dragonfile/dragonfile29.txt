<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) flinched from the impact of steel against rock. It wasn't so much that he was afraid, although at times he did fear Hachirou's tenacity. This time he flinched out of instinct, he didn't expect him to weave his blade through the ground the way he did.

"...Hachirou, I know this to be true because I live in a situation like that. Our greatest armies have -fallen-, Hachirou... But there is a reason Sunagakure is able to stand tall despite countless failures in the past to destroy them. For one, they are strong, but they harbor a strength that rivals all the power in the world. That being will... Their entire village could be birfucated, and they'd still remain.. Their Kazekage wouldn't have left like ours did.... Going against a force such as that isn't just foolish, it's suicide."* - Thu Nov 12 16:52:54 2015

If Sunagakure were to kill me no one would know. More importantly, no-one would care. Do you understand?" His cobalt eyes narrowed - he had been upset by his comment, obviously. "I know what I need to do, but it requires time.. I can't just force my way into the ranks of Kumogakure without bringing attention to myself....

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) waves in Hachirous general direction. He would see him off until he faded into the obscurity of day. He didn't know where the man's next destination was, but Eiyu knew where he was going.

Nowhere.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <During the course of my unfortunate demise.... I need to leave a message for those in Kumogakure... I am just a lowly Genin, but I managed to stay loyal to my village. Sure, one could say I wasn't presented with the same difficulty as those shinobi who had perished, but I intend to save my people... I refuse to watch this place die, or become something it's not..> Eiyu weaves another set of handseals after slashing his palm with a Kunai. 

He channels even more chakra through the summoning jutsu. Through the ripple of time and space, a frog is conjured from the depths of it's home - and conjured onto the plain of humankind. "Welcome, Uie.. I need to you to do a favor for me.." 'Yes? Eiyu-San?'

"Let me tell you something.. I know we've gotten to know eachother for a while now, but I haven't told you everything... I fear that I may not have many moments left on this world, and because of this I-"

Uie's powerful legs reel skyward, and slam into Eiyu's face. 'Shut up, Pops wouldn't like that kind of talk, and I won't tolerate it either! You know, you humans are so dumb, if you feel your life is in danger why are you preparing for the end? It's never over until you're dead, and you seem to be perfectly fine.. Stop feeling sorry for yourself, seriously! I'm sick and tired of it... Your village is destroyed, so fix it.'

"..." Eiyu let the frog remain on his face, it's legs perch, leaving visage, and instead standing tall on his shoulder. 'I will help you, but you've got to get this morbid talk out of your head... There's so much you don't know what you can do... You've been gifted the unique chance of being able to communicate with us.. We're here to -help-.. Well, I am.. Pops.. Not so much, depends if he likes you or not. Kekee'

Eiyu looks onto Kumogakure listlessly. The backdrop was surrounded with Sunagakure shinobi. "I .... I will usher this nation into greatness.. I swear on my title as a shinobi.. This is my Ninja way... I will become the Raikage!"

* - Thu Nov 12 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) released his hold over Uie letting him return to his home. Eiyu had different plans for the Frog, but currently he needed to attend to other matters. "Hm.." Eiyu does his daily rounds of the village. "Everything seems to be in order." Fuuinjutsu was on his mind again, he couldn't seem to get out of the mode of thinking of different combinations for new techniques.

"Let's see..." Eiyu opens a scroll, and attempts to seal a Kunai through the parchment. It ended in failure, but he knew why nothing happened. His understanding in it's usage was increasing everyday. He wasnt limited by his ignorance any-longer, he was coming a long way.

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's not that...I simply don't understand why you'd be subservient to another when you could become a partner to that selfsame individual. - Thu Nov 12 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: You may come here...I simply don't understand is all. - Thu Nov 12 20:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) extends his left hand into the air, catching the first scroll, he manages to catch the second with his right, but the last scroll smacks him square in the face. "Oi..." He crouches and then picks up the last scroll before reading them over.
"I understand, and thak you again, Mizukage-Sama."* - Thu Nov 12 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'll get on it right away. - Thu Nov 12 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: From today on, you'll be a shinobi of Kirigakure no Sato. I expect you to act accourdingly and represent our village to your fullest. - Thu Nov 12 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I will do so, Mizukage-Sama. That is my promise to you.. I am a man of my word. - Thu Nov 12 20:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: C'mon Hachirou. - Thu Nov 12 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) makes his way to the Mizukage's mansion - both of his hands taking possession of a broom. He uses the device to collect the dead leaves that had allocated on his doorstep. There also seemed to be saliva on the steps this was probably due to idiots who decided to launch their spittle in random places. You would think one should know better than to sully such an important area, but then again he wasn't in Kumogakure, besides everything was in better condition here than it was his homestead. "Hmm..." The mission was very straight forward so after he was done sweeping the steps he decided that he was going to move onto the next mission.

The next task that Eiyu had to attend to was filling a hole. The chasm was fairly deep so the boy reaches for the nearest spade, and begins filling the contents with dirt. He started with slamming the base of the metallic head into the sediment. Uplifting the fine grains, and letting it roll onto the floor before tossing it over his shoulder.. "Wait.. Shit.. I'm supposed to be filling this.." He slings the dirt back into the pit after realizing he had nearly worked against himself. He didn't want to be out here forever , but those missions were very time consuming so he moves on.


The last mission was escorting some elderly hag to the local inn they had in Kirigakure. 'Oh, thank you for your help...' The woman's wrinkles were a testament to her age, she looked like a skeleton, and her long, alabaster hair painted her to be some sort of ghoulish looking creature. In all honesty, Eiyu was slightly disgusted but a mission was still a mission. They had reached her room, and she kicks off her sandals. 'Well, you've escorted me to my home, but how about 'escorting' me to the bed?~' Eiyu looks at the lady like she was insane. "Nani!?" He runs out of the room and makes his way to the Mizukage's manor. <Hell, that was pretty bad....>* - Thu Nov 12 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) rests his left arm against the tree. Leaves leave their bindings and flutter onto the ground. Eiyu crouches, and collects  the blades of grass  overturning the blades in his hands. "Destiny is a weird thing, isn't it.. Uie?" He was getting used to his company so much that he was starting to forget he needed to summon the creature. 

"Right..?" He bites the pad of his forefinger letting his life-force splatter on the ground. Several handseals craft themselves subsequentally, and then he is seen slamming his hand into the sediment. The build-up of chakra reaching through his appendages surge with a tempest. Soon, Uie's body is seen skipping through Kirigakure.

'Hey, Eiyu.. What's up?' 
"Let's talk about things."* - Thu Nov 12 22:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) scratches the left side of his cheek - he noticed the males silence at this point. Eiyu was the one asking questions, and he didn't want to give the impression he was just here to pry. 

The male looks about lazily with the thought of getting to the point where he could simply leave, and do what he wanted in regards to his own village..
"Lovely weather..." He mutters, obviously pressing the subject of small talk, but avoiding anymore questions about Takuma directly.* - Thu Nov 12 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) |"Hn?" Eiyu notices the male continue to stare at him - it was almost as if he was sizing him up. "Hmmm?" Eiyu's gaze descends - his vision finding it's position against the boy's eye. It was now mutual, Eiyu continues to look into his eye's wondering what the male's intentions were.

"Something wrong?" He inquires? 
The male was currently wearing a Spandex Jumpsuit, and had a back-pouch positioned on the back of his hip, the waist-strap following the entirety of his waist.

"..?"* - Thu Nov 12 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Sisbro55) says: Hm? Nothing of course. - Thu Nov 12 22:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) for those with refined sight, a small bulge could be pulsating through Eiyu's clothing towards his torso region. <Damn, that tickles..> He pokes the protrustion, and it vanishes in a plum of smoke. "Sigh... You'll have to forgive me, but I usually read most of the time now.. I'm not one for conversation.." 

He opens the crimson scroll, and reads the details inscribed. The manuscript was obviously dated, but the information that lay within it's fold was valuable to the Minatabi. "Hn..." His brow creases, frustration setting in as usual as he did his best to concentrate.* - Thu Nov 12 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Sisbro55) says: It's cool, what's up with the buldge? - Thu Nov 12 22:38:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) dashes backwards, his heels clicking against the concrete. "No.. I'm under orders not to." His eyes narrowed a bit more - he was no longer casual, just like a switch he seemed to be very alarmed. 

* - Thu Nov 12 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Sisbro55) says: Under orders from whom? - Thu Nov 12 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <That was a close call...> Eiyu watches Takuma depart. "Right.." He states, although he was partially annoyed by the males response.* - Thu Nov 12 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: NIGGUH - Thu Nov 12 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) continued with his Fuuinjutsu training. There was still more he had to do, and yet he felt as if his understanding with all things sealing was increasing rapidly. This was mainly in part due to the fact that summoning Uie incorporated sealing.  He was also able to get his hands on various manuscripts detailing the proper way of utilizing Fuuinjutsu, so that there was no question about sealing objects into scrolls.

Though, most of what he had learned was basic, and that was perfectly fine with him. You needed to build up a strong foundation in order to dive into advanced topics, it was also ironic that even though he was only able to summon a juvenile frog he felt as if he had only reached the proverbial 'tip' of the iceberg in terms of application.

Uie mentioned his father many times before so it was known to the Minatabi that there was more than just one, and in-fact it was obvious they were many. Much like other animals that existed, these creatures also lived in small hierarches, but thats where the similarities ended. His summons could not only talk, but also were able to do various tasks that even he was finding difficult to comprehend. Uie was an apex scout, mainly because most people didn't expect for a creature to be sentient, and actually retain what they said, or even really notice him for that matter. He was just another fixing on the ground, something that could be over-looked. Only, he wasn't.* - Fri Nov 13 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Okay, it's time to get serious." Eiyu had a number of jutsu formulas which he had created over this brief period of time. His first problem, however, was that applying these seals to inanimate objects was difficult. He likened the process of trying to bind something miniature to an even smaller plane confined by an inkling of chakra.

 Scrolls were obviously larger than a simple seal, but it was more or less it was difficult to store other objects into matter. He had seen the process done before, and it was fair to say it wasn't -as- complicated as he would've come to expect but it wasn't a cake walk either.

Initially, he is just weaving his chakra through the parchment, attempting to filter his essence through the folds, and then imbuing them with his life-force alone, Tethered with his chakra he begins organizing the objects into the document. First a single Kunai is transferred, and then a shuriken.* - Fri Nov 13 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Fri Nov 13 15:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) decided that it'd be best to summon Uie again. "Hmm.. I've gotten a lot better at this sort of thing.." Eiyu brings the sharpened edge of the Kunai against his forefinger, he slices horizontally letting the rich crimson flow. From there he formulates a few hand-gestures, but then quickly slams his palm into the ground. There didn't even seem to be a delay in response to his conjuration. 

Time and space was a complex concept, and Eiyu seemed to be able to use it on it's most basic level. For now, what he did sufficed for what he wanted. "Hey, Uie.." 'Sup, Eiyu-San.' The Frog's eyes were a bit dim, an indication that he was relatively unhappy to see his conjurer.

"Well, what did I do this time?" The creatures tongue descends, it's elongated pink sliver flies into the air and catches an unsuspecting fly. 'Well, - Oh, that was just awful!' Screams Uie.

Eiyu looks on humorously. "What's the matter..? I thought you liked those flies."
'Well, you thought wrong... I want some real food, something you've denied me for quite-sometime.' "Well, I guess we can go to a local diner inside of Kirigakure.." The two make their way into the eatery and sit patiently. No less than five minutes passed when they were approached with the owner of the establishment. "What'll you- What the hell!?" 

The owner was statuesque, a partially balding, but lean stallion - pale, but otherwise seemed to be in the best condition of his life, he couldn't have been over fifty. But when he saw Uie, he acted as if he was a child again. "What the hell is that Frog doing in my diner!?" Uie responds with, 'Tch, I'd be careful... My Pops wouldn't like you raising your face like that.' 

"Sigh, just give me a bowl of miso ramen, and.....?" His blue eyes pan towards his friend. 'Steak, I want a large steak. Kobe-Beef.' The entranced male runs behind the counter and begins whipping them up some grub. Eiyu takes his time to read from the fuuinjutsu manuscrips.

 When their food arrived, both of them commenced eating, although Uie, obviously couldn't take a bite out of the creature, he simply ordered it because he could.. He wanted to feel like a human, just for one day. It was fair to say the adolescent was envious.* - Fri Nov 13 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) motions lazily towards the boy. "Oi, I don't think this is the best place to sleep."* - Fri Nov 13 15:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) wasn't going to over-step his bounds, and make physical contact in order to wake him up. For now he simply stands, awaiting to see if the boy would come out of it.* - Fri Nov 13 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Kids probably dreaming of being a super-hero...> Eiyu reaches into his back-pouch, fingers searching through the various objects in his possession. <Found it..> His hand collapses over the object, what he had in his hand was a rock, but not just any ordinary rock. 

It was black, oddly enough. "Oi!" His voice rising an octave higher than usual, just to get his attention. He throws the rock on the side of the chair, hopefully the noise of the object clinging against the surface of wood woke him from his slumber. "...Get up..."* - Fri Nov 13 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <The hell.....I'm not gonna touch him..> The male calmly walks forth with the intent to retrieve his rock. When he does so, he shuffles it into the confines of his back-pouch, but then he has an idea. He uncorks a bottle of water and lets it flow on the boy's eye-lids. It was -very- cold, and should he still remain dead in his sleep Eiyu would count this as a loss for him and return to his previous position.* - Fri Nov 13 16:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "I have to give you credit, kid... You're good at what you do.." Which seemed to be sleeping at this moment in time. Eiyu was able to deduce that he was fairly young as well, he couldn't have been more than fourteen?

 He would've honestly expected this from an old man or even an old woman, but to see it happening to this boy at such a young age? Hell, people would mistake him for dead if he ever matured into wearing gray hair. 

"Sigh.." For now, Eiyu glances at the Fuuinjutsu manuscripts, and he also begins charting his chakra in different directions. Upheaving different formulas across the parchment, the medium gradually accepting the tokens he had offered it which was mostly Ninja tools. 

He glances at the male ever so often looking for the rise and fall of his chest, just to make sure he was among the land of the living.* - Fri Nov 13 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: .... - Fri Nov 13 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) doesn't bother trying to wake the kid for now. Eiyu had other matters to attend to for the time being. One concept that he was finding increasingly difficult was the fact that in order to use Fuuinjutsu properly you needed to take the time to develop the seals.

 These seals were unique in their own way, for instance you couldn't apply the same generic seal that you would use to store material, and then turn it around and then attempt to do something like sealing an organic being.

 In-fact, with the basics at hand, you -couldn't- seal organic matter at all. <Hmmmmmm......> Yes, that was a challenge, it was different from elemental jutsu, and different from Taijutsu.

<Sigh..> Eiyu formulates handseals once more, incorporating the needed gestures to facilitate a change. His bloodied palm that had been wounded from a previous encounter served as a medium. The creatures identity, which was of course known to Eiyu, would be unknown to the rest of the world. 

'Hello, Eiyu-San." "Hey, Uie...Wanted to ask you a question.. Do you know what any of this means?" He'd display the manuscript to the creature. 'Does it look I know?' "Nah, you're right, I fucked up big time for the time being... Thanks anyway." 'Don't mention it?' The creature is gone, as quickly as it came.* - Fri Nov 13 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) works on several sealing formulas, he was rapidly pacing himself for what was to come. He needed several hours in seclusion in order for everything to go down the way he wanted it.

 These concepts took immense focus to ascertain, and it was best that he wasn't bothered, at least not now. So he stood in Kirigakure, in some remote building away from others.

 Jutsu formulas were written everywhere, the Minatabi experimented with practically anything he could get his hands on. Sealing metallic weapons into scrolls, harnessing it, and then unsealing it so that he knew what he was doing.

The process was methodical, it was also -very- tedious. He didn't enjoy having to seal objects, and reseal them just to see if he had completed it correctly. Sadly, this was the only way it was going to go down.

 It took hours, upon hours on end, filing away several amounts of information, and then storing it for later use in his memory. He was likened to a well oiled machine, taking the necessary time to complete a task at hand.* - Fri Nov 13 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Fri Nov 13 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances at Ortho through the corner of his eye. "Hm? Hello?"* - Fri Nov 13 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Die.. - Fri Nov 13 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) had to admit that he was pretty tense seeing Ortho's arrival. It was fortunate that the man's demeanor wasn't inherently hostile.
"Hmmm... You from around here?" He inquires, and the only reason why he asked such a question was because he was not native of Kirigakure. Eiyu was from the land of clouds.* - Fri Nov 13 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You could say that. Came to catch a quick nap. - Fri Nov 13 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: That's what the other kid is doing.. He's been here for... - Fri Nov 13 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm, I'd say about a day. - Fri Nov 13 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Why? Why? Why!? None of this is making sense anymore!" Eiyu's anger was rising by the second. These concepts of Fuuinjutsu, and their application were growing more obscure by the day. He was making some progress, but he was still finding it difficult to advance.

 Namely, being able to seal multiple objects in one scroll. He could tell he was losing his motivation to concentrate. This sort of thing was adding up against him, and he needed to figure out the source of his emotions.

Blood trickles onto the floor. He begins to formulate seals, one following another. Once he was done with this sequence he slams his palm into the ground and summons a Uie, one of his greatest friends. 

Ironic that he was a Toad. "Listen... I need to speak to you about something... I don't know why, but I feel conflicted.. I'm upset for leaving Kumogakure, but in the end I had no choice. My hand is being forced.. I can't even hand out missions, or defend my village if need be. Sunagakure has practically taken it over, and I don't know what to do...."

'Well, Eiyu.. I don't know why you're asking me, but.. It seems like you already know what to do. You shouldn't be so quick to second-guess yourself. You said you wanted to help your people, and you haven't abandoned them... For the time being there is only so much you can do, and the other shinobi in your village aren't handing out missions.. Just do not forget where you came from.... I know it's hard. But you gotta give it a year man, a year of loyal service to Kirigakure, as long as your home isnt involved, and then go... Notice how I'm not telling you what to do, this is what you've said already... You just need to stick with it."

The male's head lowers, Uie was right.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) strolls into the immediate vicinity with a manuscript's parcel open. Several details were written down for ease of use. Eiyu had made illustrations of the hand-gestures needed for summoning, as well as making an illustration of generic sealing. His mind was increasing, expanding with the techniques that he had been shown, and better yet it began to show. The constant hours of creating seals, only to throw them away, and then rinse, and repeat the process.

The only thing he disliked is that it was starting to become redundant. Utilizing different jutsus in different combinations in unique ways. Though, one had to admit the amount of difficulty this took to commit to, it a great amount of mental resources to keep this kind of thing going for too long, and Eiyu was starting to feel mentally drained.

"Sigh...."* - Fri Nov 13 21:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: Oh, you tried killing him? What did he do? - Fri Nov 13 22:42:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) brings his hands together summoning a creature from the confines of the void. He begins to refine his chakra by manipulating it in a manner that would allow him to snatch the Frog from it's current location, and bring it in front of himself. The juvenile looks up at it's summoner, it's eye full of keen interest. "What're you going to do today, Eiyu-San?"

"I'm going to try to master this Fuuinjutsu thing. I've made up my mind, and I've devoted enough time into my craft to where I feel like I've come a long way. I'm very happy to say this is only the start of what's to come from me.."

 The male begins to chart off different Fuuinjutsu formulas, his hands working masterfully with what he had in order to work on differing concepts.

He continues to rush at a break-neck pace. The combination of artful mastery, and the will to want to improve was making the Mintabi feel accomplished with his life. He wasn't just wasting his time doing nothing in this village, he was trying to become the best he could be by surmounting the obstacles that had been stacked against him, and there was nothing that was going to stop him now.

He continues to work carefully on the various concepts he had at his disposal for the time being. * - Sat Nov 14 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) works in-depth on several jutsu formulas. They weren't all together complex, but it wasn't a cake walk-either. the difficulty level reamined in the middle, still, it was something that the Minatabi could deal with. <Hmm...> He begins to weave more concepts through the parchment, sending rich, azure energy through the folds, by forcefully extending it through and out he is about to funnel his life-force through the medium.

Several projectiles are sealed into the scrolls wtih precise control. Eiyu's skill in this sort of thing was gradually increasing. He had a growing understanding of how to use summoning properly, ironically he had only just reached the tip of the iceberg as had been explained before. It was only a matter of time before he mastered Fuuinjutsu, that is all he needed, time.* - Sat Nov 14 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Hmm..." Eiyu shifts into a regular fighting stance typically unaware of what his opponent had in store for him. He unsheathes a Kunai from the depths of his back-pouch, and tosses a Kunai- with a smoke-bomb tethered to it's frame into the air. 

With his free-hand he reaches for a nearby-scroll, his fingers slip into the parchment dexterously, the fabric peels back slowly, he was ready to unseal it at a moments notice. "Hmmmm." 

He also takes the liberty of dashing backwards. He'd use the smoke-screen to conceal his movements.* - Sat Nov 14 01:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <I win..> Eiyu thinks to himself ignorantly. There was a surge of chakra taking possession of the parchment he upturned. He attempts to fling it in the general direction of the lad's legs, the strength of the throw wasn't really anything. He wasn't even try to maim the boy, but projectiles held that kind of danger, still, he would not have any life threatening injuries had it went, but of course it wouldn't have hit at all. Eiyu notices the lack of any real movement.

<I guess ... I fucked up....Ugh, I should've made the preperation first.. Now I'm fucked, essentially blind..> He wasn't even -aware- of his target going underground.* - Sat Nov 14 01:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) didn't have a clue where his opponent was, and moreover the smoke began to clear. Either his opponent was very fast, or there was something he wasn't understanding. <Let's see here..> He begins to take his first step, that is when he spots a most unique detail. Jirun -popped- out of the ground first, something obviously alerting him to this weird change, only to follow this movement by the extension of hands. 

He dashes backwards, his opponent's grip missing him by mere inches. While in the same movement he bites the pad of his forefinger, and forms several handseals, one after another. 

"Kuchiyose.."
Smoke fills the area.
'Why did you summon me, Eiyu-San?'
"Well, I need you to be my eyes in-case I'm attacked from my blind-spot.."

The toad mutters in response. 
"Sure.."* - Sat Nov 14 01:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <My opponent is smart...>
Eiyu runs forward, his frame sliding to the left. He accelerates towards his target while reached for a second scroll. "Don't underestimate me." Uie dashes slings across the ground as well, both of their forms coming together to form a zig-zag formation. 

<There...> His hands brush against the scroll on his waist, the unsealed material coming to life in the form of ninja stars that aimed to slam into his legs, around four in total, while the Frog attempts to latch onto the males face from the air.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Yeah, it's clear that I'm not going to win." The frog vanishes in a plum of smoke, after seeing his opponent remain like a statue in-front of the attack he projected he deemed that his further attempts would be fruitless. The lack of penetrating power from his implements were simply disheartening.* - Sat Nov 14 02:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: The Mizukage doesn't seem to bright. - Sun Nov 15 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: However, the Mizukage is a good man.. I don't mind fighting the Gezo, but I don't wish to bite the hand that feeds me.. Well, it was more or less him taking a chance. - Sun Nov 15 18:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: The Kazekage. - Sun Nov 15 18:22:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why is the Kazekage? - Sun Nov 15 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Why would Sunagakure allow that? - Sun Nov 15 18:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: It's strategic. - Sun Nov 15 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So, he currently has... Sunagakure, Kirigakure, and Kumogakure under his belt... - Sun Nov 15 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But why? - Sun Nov 15 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: He's planning to declare war on the Gezo. - Sun Nov 15 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: And all those people will die - Sun Nov 15 18:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: And prepare. - Sun Nov 15 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) nods. Eiyu was starting to come to terms about how bad things truly were. He knew that a storm was coming, he just didn't know in what form. For now, the Gezo was at the top of the food-chain, but considering the villages current state it seemed as if his progress was going to be hindered. Large portions of the Land Of Mist had been destroyed in a horrific attack.

Eiyu rubs the side of his temples softly. "I will have to become stronger, smater, and more adept in battlefield scenario's.. This is going to be very challenging..."* - Sun Nov 15 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But I will prepare. - Sun Nov 15 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Thank you. - Sun Nov 15 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I will not keep you any longer.. It's time I resume my duty of making my rounds of Kirigakure. - Sun Nov 15 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ouichi, Ryutaro(Jjking217) says: Stay safe. - Sun Nov 15 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Thank you... - Sun Nov 15 18:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Likewise. - Sun Nov 15 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) turns away from Index intent on resuming his position towards the square.
"You seem to have many more enemies than I. But I guess through our mutual understanding your enemies are now mine.. Have a good-day.."* - Sun Nov 15 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Mizukage-Sama.. - Sun Nov 15 18:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I apologize for me not being there during the attack, although I suspect there is very little I could've done. - Sun Nov 15 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: However... - Sun Nov 15 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I completed the mission by fighting that male over there- Wait, did I already turn that mission in? I can't remember. - Sun Nov 15 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I was to spar another shinobi in Kirigakure. - Sun Nov 15 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I've done so. - Sun Nov 15 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very good. - Sun Nov 15 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I didn't get my reward for it. - Sun Nov 15 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Anyway, after that... and dealing with a giant tailed beast. I'm going to go lay back down. - Sun Nov 15 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Yes. A giant, beastly slug... - Sun Nov 15 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That attempted to destroy the village. - Sun Nov 15 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That Ortho and his friends stole and now the GEzo is after us. - Sun Nov 15 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: It's for that reason.. - Sun Nov 15 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That we will be destroying Ortho. - Sun Nov 15 18:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Would you like to test this? - Sun Nov 15 18:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) reaches for a single scroll on his waist. <Conflict... No matter the era..> The parcel opens and a Demon-Wind Shuriken is seen in his grip. The projectile is seen flying from his grip, given further acceleration by the spinning of metal through his digits. Upon it being released hopefully it would slam into the ground, in front of both parties, equally. There was a single tag on said projectile - Eiyu formulates a single hand-seal igniting an explosive process.

Hopefully the shock-wave alone would be enough to stop the advance of both parties. 

"Forgive me for doing this, but now is not the time to fight. We aren't enemies of each-other.. Mizukage-Sama, forgive Hachirou on my behalf, and Hachirou... Let's end this, but in a peaceful manner. There have been enough lives that have already been lost, no?"

Either way the explosion wasn't meant to harm either of them, rather he simply wished to push them away from one another. "I will gladly accept any punishment on his behalf." Eiyu walks forward.* - Sun Nov 15 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) couldn't work against his orders. If this was simply a spar he had no intentions of getting further involved. But what he did not wish to see was the loss of someones life, for now he remains standing, eyes measured carefully towards the happenings of this bout. 

He looks unhappy.* - Sun Nov 15 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hachirou, you alright? - Sun Nov 15 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yooo. - Sun Nov 15 20:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Toudou, of the Shishigami Clan. - Sun Nov 15 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see... Does that make you a clan of prominence here? - Sun Nov 15 20:59:05 2015
