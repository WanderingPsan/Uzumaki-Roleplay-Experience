He remembers the day Edge attacked where the Land Of Clouds did not let a single ray of light descend onto the masses. 


Perhaps this was the reason why Eiyu was so enraged.
"You fight... Even when the odds are stacked in your favor.... Even when the odds seem that they are against you... This is your home, this isn't us being in another village. I want you to look at the corpse...... I want you to look at the child who lost his life today... I want you to realize that could've very well been anyone of you."* - Fri Nov 27 06:48:19 2015
