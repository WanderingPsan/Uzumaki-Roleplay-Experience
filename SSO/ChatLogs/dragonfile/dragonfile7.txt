<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) noticed the Fuuton jutsu coming in hot, and simply couldn't react in enough time to save his sister. This was indeed very unfortunate, as her death, if she did die would be the result of something more sinister down the road. Sure, he attacked Niza and left him seriously injured but he saved his life, he never expected Tethys to show up and kill his blood-relative. Never in a million years did he think he would have the nerve to approach his village. Still, with his approach and handseals and creatin of his clones it was fair to say this amount of foresight would grant him a counterattck, and a most deadly one. He forms handseals in tandem with the gale and formulates a massive ball of fire that developed in mere seconds, all the while he slings westward, due to the enhanced winds he was capable to produce a far stronger form of his attack.* - Fri Sep 18 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was livid at this point, the chakra signature from afar was indeed his sisters. He knew she had been damaged by the clashing however the extent was unknown to him... <You think you can attack my family..... Potentially kill my family.... Then leave? No..... I won't allow it....> 

Then came the ample amounts of steam that billowed from the impact of the Suiton infused chakra and Katon attack that had been infused with Fuuton. Ushinawa's eyes were able to track Tethys's movements, or rather his faint shadow, even in the mist. 

<It's time...> He accelerates quickly with his hands converging upon themselves at a moments notice. Tethys would no doubt sense a following of chakra manifesting in the angsting Uchiha's soul-case, but.....

<DIE!....> The Lightning that flame from the base of his finger-tips made it's way towards the male's flank, perhaps he thought it would hit him but in the end it was all a ruse. With his Sharingan he was able to time his movements and act accordingly, Tethys was never that fast, and with that the surrounding rock-formation collapsed and rained upon the Hozuki, the make-shift rock-slide would indeed be a problem...
<I will use whatever is around.... If I must...>* - Fri Sep 18 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "s Sharingan was indeed powerful, the steam was starting to rise and Ushinawa could already tell something was coming. Thus which in itself was a counter to his own, once again the Black Blade conjured a storm of fuuton enhanced chakra, and once again Ushinawa was forming seals to respond in unison. Thus, a ball of flame that took on the form of a Dragon's maw tore through his current position, and Ushinawa attempted to take advantage of the narrow space Tethys was trying to escape through... Up? Down? To the side? 

<Fire Style: Dragon Flame Bomb!>* - Fri Sep 18 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) deactivates his Sharingan, he wasn't able to keep this sort thing going too long, at this rate he'd have wasted all of his chakra. <Two is my limit....> He thinks to himself. Still, he cursed Tethys for being so powerful, he was able to observe the intensity of his jutsu and all them consumed -massive- amounts of chakra. He was breathing hard from using a few techniques and the man had nearly conjured an ocean in the blink of an eye, twice. 

<I will not..... Forgive this......> His robes descend, his right knee pressing against the dirt.. He did his best to regain what little energy he had.* - Fri Sep 18 02:28:41 2015

His hand slowly rotates towards the male, the pad of his index coming to a stop. "There have been reports of unruly behavior  from shinobi of Kumogakure at   the Ramen-eatery. They consume too much Sake, and it is starting to give this natio na worse image than it already has.... Clean it up... Kick those people out..."

"There have been an influx of serious injuries happening throughout Kumogakure, the medical is strained and they need all the help they can get. Your task is to help them with aiding the injured..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||There really wasn't a way to justify what he did. Sure, if he had used a less imposing technique the result might've been different although not really. Tethys sought to divide his sister in two pieces with a powerful fuuton jutsu. Ushinawa had nothing in his arsenal that could counter him the way he did without that jutsu... 
"...It... He would've killed everyone... I didn't intend for you to get caught... It isn't your fault, as your older brother I'm supposed to protect you, and I failed... I'm sorry...."* - Fri Sep 18 18:59:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It is evil, no? - Fri Sep 18 19:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Or perhaps in your eyes. - Fri Sep 18 19:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But not mine. - Fri Sep 18 19:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) turns away from both Mariana, and his sister. His prolific robe dazzling in the headlights of the mansion, a lucid aura over-took his being. It was good he had his back to them, they would not see the tears roll down his cheeks... They would not see his pain, they would never see it. He didn't mean everything he said, but he couldn't break character, he couldn't stop playing his role.... It was all for the greater good.
<Just a little bit longer..>* - Fri Sep 18 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) attempted to freeze emotions at the creation of foot-falls. He couldn't deal with the position he was in, of course he didn't want the individuals of Kumogakure to perish. Deep inside he cursed Tethys for what he had done, he wasn't aware that the man would step into his village and cause chaos.. It was true that he defeated both Niza, and Yan easily but he did -not- want this.... He only became Raikage to prove a point, but he found it was much more than just being the villages keystone... He had inherited the will of those before him... However, he shouldered a darkness that even he tried to avoid. 

His shoulder flinches at the touch, his head cranes in Mariana's direction, a glimmer of his onyx iris' would be noticed. Then, a faint smile.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) felt the warmth of his wife's kiss upon his cheek but it was dulled by their bickering. Ushinawa doesn't even bother to turn around.
"If you haven't seen it now.... I've changed....."* - Fri Sep 18 19:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) knew better than to speak to his sister with such fire. He hated being stern,and he truly believed in her, both Mariana and Aiyana were very precious to him. They were the only things in this world he cherished besides his son, and closest friend, Zhen. But if he had learned one thing from this world it was to not force others to feel what you feel. Ushinawa was given this life due to his actions and he wouldn't allow anyone else to be affected by them if he could help it.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Mariana, you simply do not listen. - Fri Sep 18 22:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: What? I'm just telling him to speak up. - Fri Sep 18 22:37:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was annoyed by the random man's appearence in his village, it was thought the blockage around Kirigakure wouldn't allow randoms to show, but since he was wrong he'd simply take matters into his own hands. He walks forward, his aura reading nothing, save annoyance. If he was a shinobi of Kumogakure it was even worse that he reused to answer, twice. Not only from Mariana but himself as well, such actions could be at least seen as insuborindate, and Ushinawa was not one to play games.* - Fri Sep 18 22:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Twice you've been asked for your name. - Fri Sep 18 22:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But you are a shinobi of Kumogakure, so you will answer me. - Fri Sep 18 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I bear no name. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm, well you see.. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Shinobi from Kumogakure, rather they be man, woman, or Ninken are given names. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Then with said names. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Comes identification numbers. - Fri Sep 18 22:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So, lets start this over. - Fri Sep 18 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I bear no name, for my journey only started here. I did not go through your mortal affairs of educational system, for I am not of the mortal breed. - Fri Sep 18 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Just... leave him alone. - Fri Sep 18 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) simply glares at the man's eye-line, he was obviously not humored by this act. There were indeed holes in this man's story, things like this simply didn't happen, and mortal affairs or not if he was a shinobi of Kumogakure he would have a name. Such ideologies were not taught among their ranks.
"Deception."* - Fri Sep 18 22:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I share not the art of deception. I am merely misunderstood; fore I am not a follower of your judicial system for shinobi ranking. I bear not a name; fore I had no maternities to label. I commit no sin of trickery. - Fri Sep 18 23:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) had no idea what was going on, and quite frankly he didn't care. He didn't need to hear the words of those he didn't know because he could steal information at a glance, or well, it took a bit more effort but he didn't mind it. His hands raise to form the ram seal, but ironically, it was already too late, the forming of the handseal being a form of misdirection. His sole intent was to lull the warrior into sleep so he could simply steal the information once he fell asleep, or at least that is how he planned things to go down. It all started when he averted his gaze into his eye-line, his previous action, ever since then ......

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) whispers: Jut let him go... - Fri Sep 18 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) No, the Uchiha's Genjutsu would not trigger unless eye-contact was made, however this wasn't the point. When a point of view is not specified by default it would fall upon the trigger. He moves forward after placing him in the Genjutsu, his objective was to steal the information he needed out of his mind. 
Who was he? 
What was he doing?
What was his purpose?
Three questions that should've been easy enough to answer. In the same motion he unsheathes his blade, the unearthly glow seeming to be like a mighty saber. "Let us see what you know."* - Fri Sep 18 23:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Ugh.... Ushi always. But he looks fine. - Fri Sep 18 23:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) pretty much knew at this point that the jig was up. Erebus could not be a shinobi of Kumogakure for several reasons, one being that with his first answer. Shinobi had names, they had purposes, and they were loyal to a degree, or at least these were the fundamental's taught in the academy. The fact that he knew none of these proved that he was not from here. Still, Ushinawa didn't care that he wasn't, he didn't even care how he obtained the headband. 

"Prepare a caravan." He'd mutter low to the collection he had obtained while under Zetsumo's command. Though these were his own forces, at this point the male would've been knocked out cold and Ushinawa would've simply paid for a caravan to him to be sent to Kirigakure. 

"Guard the gates, anyone who steps into Kumogakure who's suspect, kill them.."* - Fri Sep 18 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) has a bird sent to the envoy. "Let him return. I must take a trip out of Kumogakure anyway.. Mariana, our services are more or less being requested. Prepare something light, we will most likely not be staying long."* - Fri Sep 18 23:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) throws a windmill shuriken towards the oncoming Hideki, he smirks however as he had already dodged the shuriken, however he was aware that at times shinobi used metallic wire to guide it's influence long after it has been thrown, it is why he postions himself to the side, so that if this really was the case he'd be able to see it coming.* - Sat Sep 19 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) if Hideki had enough prowess to veer into the surface of his technique he would notice something sinister, a second windmill hidden within the shadow of the first. <What will you do now?> Ushinawa cared little for the Genjutsu, as he remembered where Hideki's original position was and he knew this jutsu himself.* - Sat Sep 19 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) unsheathed his own Katana with the grace of someone trained well in the art he was about to adjust the trajectory of his attack before he was stopped by his younger cousin. "I suppose.. Though, I'd lik to remain here, in addition this will help you become a better fighter, isolated or not. It is your move."* - Sat Sep 19 01:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Impressive movements.. I suppose his strength with using Sharingan does not help with his over-all speed, this much is obvious, however it his reflexes that have jumped, I wonder how decent he is with Genjutsu.> Ushinawa side-steps the initial swing, his own blade coming in hot, he attempts to land slice Hideki's shoulder horizontally, although not deep enough to inflict serious injury, this was a spar after-all.* - Sat Sep 19 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <So he intends to counter me with my own jutsu.. Impressive, Hideki, is what I'd normally say...> Hirusho forms several handseals within an instant, after he was finished with the sequence he opens his maw and formulates a giant ball of flame meant to blow him away if he stood his ground, this of course would also cause the surrounding flames to buckle.* - Sat Sep 19 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <...Nani?> Ushinawa questions what had just happened, He didn't expect for him to fall victim so easily, and perhaps he didn't. Nonetheless he'd dash westward with immense speed to see what had happened.* - Sat Sep 19 01:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Hm, he used substitution jutsu, very good, Hideki..> Ushinawas onyx gaze narrowed intently, eventually coming across the male attempting to use his enviornment as a means to trip him up. <So, the ground... I see...> He rebounds the lightning, and the projectiles would'nt arrive towards their target because Ushinawa was already on the move, and in that instant he aimed to exploit the blindspot of his opponent..

<But your Sharingan... Just isnt strong enough..> 
If all went as planned he'd rocket his leg into the back of his fellow Uchiha training partner with the intent to send him -flying- into the chasm in the ground he created with his lightning.* - Sat Sep 19 01:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) simply shakes his head in the negative. It seemed that some of these people enjoyed patronizing Hideki, and that was something Ushinawa disliked greatly. However there was still no time to talk about his disdain as he was curious to see where Hideki planned to go, he did mention training and if that was the case he'd simply take off with the find.

But not before giving his two cents on the matter.
"I hope you're all ready in-case Kirigakure attacks..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) noticed that with his Sharingan his powers were growing. It seemed to be something subtle at first, it started with being able to see chakra in different colors. This helped with seeing through low-level smoke screens that were not laced with chakra. The second tomoe helped with him having a sort of precognitive ability, being able to mimic certain movements to a degree, but lastly the third tomoe seemed to be all of those things but then increased exponentially. It even came with the added ability to veer into someone's gaze and lock them into a stupor of the users imagination.
