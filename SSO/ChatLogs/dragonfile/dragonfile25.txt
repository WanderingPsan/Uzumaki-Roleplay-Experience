<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You use the ram hand-seal and then stop the chakra flow in your body . . . Then use a stronger force to disrupt the chakra of the genjutsu user who is using a genjutsu on you. - Sat Oct 10 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll give you an example. - Sat Oct 10 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: In the meantime . . . I'll practice a certain technique. - Sat Oct 10 11:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||It was easy enough, ceasing your chakra flow from the inside and then kick-starting it at the last second. It seemed the ram seal served as the medium, one couldn't simply expect to break Genjutsu without the help of the ram seal, at least not yet. <So..> Nozumi's hands come together, and just like a switch his chakra flow ceases, only to jump-start at the last second enabling him to kick into high gear again. The energy inside of his body builds and is filtered through every-crevice of his being.
<Nice...>

Now it was time for the second try. He brings his hands together and the chakra flow through his body is cut once more. <I see...> It seemed he was already getting the hang of this, his abilities in learning new techniques and obta	ning mastery over it was something that he was even surprised with at times.
But much like any other person who was cerebral there were a serious of steps one had to go through before they could even attempt such a feat.

In Nozumi's case he estimated that in order to use Kai he would need to focus elsewhere. One would think this sort of tactic to be full-hardy, but it was actually helpful.. His concentration on other things, while still trying to bring his chakra flow to a stop was very helpful. The next step came when he attempted to form the ram seal as instructed. In order to do this it would have to come through as one burst of chakra through his body.

<One more time...> He thought to himself as he froms the seals. The process of thinking through this technique finally coming together. His chakra level fades, and is simply kicked into working order through his hand-seal. Now, with his chakra spiking he is able to bring on a form of where if he had been caught in a Genjutsu it could possibly be broken.* - Sat Oct 10 11:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Wow... Kilm is powerful as well.> Nozumi stood in awe to see such a prolific technique cast out in such a high volume in a manner of seconds. His prowess with Suiton couldn't be over-stated, to put things lightly the scale of this technique was truly amazing. It was something that Nozumi would have to emulate as well, and to be honest he had no problem attempting to do so. This was all a test of wits for him, a challenge that would take time, but those were the best ones.

<I see...> Nozumi condenses the chakra inside of his chest which is followed by the snake seal. The suiton based energy building inside of his core naturally expands through his body and was about to venture outside of his mouth before he vomits the mixture entirely. Literally, he vomits all over the field, it seemed he put a bit too much effort in his attempt.

<Well, no matter.>
He wipes his mouth, the after-taste of rancid food now filling his tastebuds <This is just awful..> Once more he forms the ram seal while forcefully expanding the suiton inside of his chest, it is driven inside of his gullet and he releases in a small wave. This was nothing that Kilm could do, and only really managed to wet his feet literally. <Well, I messed up again...> This wasn't a hit against his pride, not in the least - this technique was very powerful and the proper time would be given in order to increase it's intensity.

He follows up with another training regimen, the chakra inside of his body building to it's apex. The snake seal converts this energy into a tangible force, pain builds in his neck, and torso as well as his gullet. The internal pressures were something he just had to deal with, a fair amount of water spews from his chest and tightens once the pull wave rebounds. 

<Pathetic...> There was no real power behind the technique at all. Trying to maintain this type of training was difficult because of his chakra reserves as well, they were not endless, and because of this Nozumi starts to feel the impact of such. He felt as if he wanted to drop on one knee, but his will to see this through kept him up, and he would remain this way until he had this technique underwraps. 

So, he begins by forming the snake seal again, the over-all consistency of it's flow was lacking. Someone of his skill-level couldn't really produce the massive waves that Kilm could produce but at least he could emulate the results somewhat. The chakra inside of his chest expands once more, it mixes with his Suiton affinity, and a massive amount of water is spewed.

Still... It was not enough, there was a level of mastery one had to commit to when they were attempting to master this. For one, there was the matter of keeping his chakra consumption down because this really did take massive amounts of chakra. He was lucky that he did have some vitality against this which would suit him nicely. Still, his execution was subpar and he knew he would have to try all over again.* - Sat Oct 10 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh . . . Strange. - Sat Oct 10 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <II'm not going to stop here... I know what I am capale of and I'm going to finish it until I drop.>  Nozumi was fairly sure that his body would only carry him so far at this point but it didn't really matter to him, he was going to master this technique, and it was going to be something that he regarded highly. His hands shift into the snake seals, the condensing of water in his gullet was something knew Nozumi couldn't handle. 

He opens his maw and releases a stream of water from his lips.

His muscles began to sting at this point, and it was feeling like he was using too much chakra, but several hours later he is back at it all over-again. The build-up of energies inside of his body spiking to a wall of water which he releases through his mouth. He continues to hold the snake seal strong and wasn't ging to be distracted by anything.

Now, another handseal and a line of water instantly crawls out of his mouth and onto the field. Should anything be caught in his life of fire it would prove to be truly unfortunate because this time a fair amount of water did travel from his lips and onto the sand riddled training field. <Hmmm.> He stood tall, and full of pride over his victory.

This was no time to celebrate though because he still hadn't truly even gotten ver the basics of the technique. The foundation was vital for a greater understanding in what one was going and perhaps Nozumi would have a better chance if he continued doing what he was doing. He pushes the material from his maw intent on using it like a wave to sweep whatever is at his feet away.

More time was needed in order to truly master it. The massive build-up of chakra in his chest spikes quickly. Then, when it is raised to its most condensed form possible he opens his mouth ad direct his maw in-front of his being. This has the ability to sweep up whatever matter could possibly be in the way in the course of his attack.

<Sigh...> He is quite honestly very annoyed at this point beause he hadn't truly even gotten over the basics. The snake seal is formed through the touching of his digits against his palms. The condensed material is pushed forward with immense force capable on pushing whatever or whoever was in the way at the time. This was an imperfect form of Kilm's jutsu but it stll served it's purpose. <<Guh...>

He had about two more tries until he was ready to give out. The chakra inside of his being is put to the limit. The sution affinity in his chest growing bigger once more. Now that he is able to emit the high impact blast of water from his lips he aims at the nearest mountain with intentions of stiriking whatever got in his way.

He clutches his hands together for the last time. The chakra inside of his body becoming bigger with each waking second. He is able to transfer a large portion of water from his chest, and through his mouth. This was a difficult task but he had done it skillfully.* - Sat Oct 10 12:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) condenses the chakra inside of his gullet refining the chakra to it's highest density possible. There was a certain threshold he would endure, and at this moment in time it was stressed to it's limit. To further compliment the process he forms the snake seal, forcefully causing his chakra to reach critical mass.
 The massive ocean that leaves his maw continues on a steady course of destruction, uprooting a large amount of land in a manner of seconds. <Ugh...> The blonde haired teen drops on his knee, entirely winded by the ordeal.

<I'm still not done yet...> He stands, using his forearm as support which enables him to stand tall. He builds the chakra inside of his core, and then attempts to release another wave of liquid from his maw. The massive wave was tethered through his chakra signature and was capable of cutting through rocks like it was nothing.

<Due to my inability to properly manipulate Suiton chakra.. I'll have to .. Try something else...> The wave was a tangible mass of massive energy. * - Sat Oct 10 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) next came the task of trying to usurp the control of Genjutsu over his body. He was a genius in some respects. The process of utilizing Ninjutsu on the spur of the moment after only seeing it for short period of times was something he was getting used to. Granted, this was not the case for advanced techniques but, it did help him with basic techniques. Much like Kai, the process of cutting off one's chakra flow only to kick it into over-drive tenfold, hopefully pushing away the casters Genjutsu.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) |Now was the time to put all of his effort into his training. Not just because it was essential in order for him to pave his way into this world, but also because he knew that the world would only become stronger with him. He understood the need for others to help him achieve his dream. He had left his native village because he knew this dreaam would not be realized until he mastered every bit of what was available to him. 

This required constant self-training, as well as training with others. Nozumi opens a scroll, and then fills the contents inside with his energy - once it is sealed away he smiles gently, his blue eyes taking note of the compressed energies building within the nexus of the parchment. It was constant, in order to master this art he had to train it constantly. Constant training of said techniques came with it's pro's and con's. Yes, he was improving in several jutsu's but he still needed to net-work. 

He spent a large portion of his time moving to Sunagakure, and he didn't see Kilm like he had wished. * - Sun Oct 11 01:46:40 2015

Empathy was an important concept, but it was lost upon most individuals. 

On the flip side, if Nozumi stood in Konohagakure, and Sunagakure was the nation in disarray how would things have been? Most likely they would understand why he was a bit upset by Koji's comment.

"Outsiders? Upset?"
So, they didn't know the situation either.
"My people were killed by a giant-beast... Our shinobi fled, and our citizens were ripped apart in seconds. Our entire village stands on bricks aside from a few houses, and this man is getting annoyed by refugees?"

Nozumi folds his arms over his chest.

I've been searching for him for quite a while ever since he returned to Konoha... I'm not going to leave my home even if it is destroyed, but I intend to see the people back that made the nation great..."

He cuts his speech short, no-one cared for those without power rambling off at the mouth.  "My name is Nozumi..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Work...>Truly, it was hard to see any progress being made in ruins. The blonde haired male had to deal with disadvantageous circumstanes since the beginning. Tears leave his eyes and descend his cheek-bones. The sand at his feet was met with moisture, small dots scatter. 

He raises his hand preemptively, attempting to collect the tears but he found that he could not. "You know... I had a dream when I was a little boy... I know it's stupid telling you, but I think I will because you do seem like you care... I had a dream that one day shinobi wouldn't be identified  by their village, but rather a purpose.. One that could be considered unifo-..."

He drops to his knees.

Koji had already left.
He didn't think anyone else was present. 
"I'm sorry...." 
He looks into the Horizon, looking for that one leaf to descend into his barren palm, to see the silver lining where there was none.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) closes his eyes - both of his hands reach to sieze his head.. His chest tightens, and with the tension in his body comes off as dismal. One that was not met with any amount of success. His hiatus was as fruitless as the Land Of Wind itself. He was starting to even look like it, the region of his robe that exposed the torso had been ripped. Sweat clung to the back of his neck, ruffled hair stood on ends.

He didn't look like the youthful Nozumi that had left Konohagakure in search of information.

Now he looked hollow, sick even.* - Sun Oct 11 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) shook his head lightly. The boy drags his forearm across his eyes, clearing whatever moisture might've been building in his tear ducts. He turns around, both of his cobalt eyes resting over Gojiro's form. 

"Yes.." He mutters softly.
"Thanks for asking.." His eye-line promptly averts to the floor, his bottom canines dig into his lip.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) motions with his left hand for Heiwa to come closer.
"I brought you a souvenir.."

Nozumi mimics Gojiro's action with his right hand, forming a fist, and then extending it, all the while his narrow smile became visible.

"Yeah.."* - Sun Oct 11 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Sunagakure. - Sun Oct 11 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) hadn't really purchased much of anything to be honest. Just a snack, and some books that the child would be expected to finish before the day was done. <I'm happy you're still okay...> 

He drops the gifts into his small hands. "I will offer whatever money I do have to the villages funds..." 

His face cranes towards the sleeping Hideki, and the other male in his company who seemed to be his right hand.

Of course he had to rufffle the boy's hair like he always had done.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <The first book was a nothing more than a coloring book, something that was far inferior to his intellect. He hoped the challenge of coloring would be enough to get him started on the pages. "Use these markers.." He hands him several markers which were all white, but simply had a color strip around it's head in order to illustrate which color spectrum it was associated with.

The only thing being these weren't drawings, but words. Incomplete words at that, and the markers would have to serve as the medium for illuminating the details. In order to find the correct color to bring the words into creation they would have to answer basic questions.. 

They were incrementally increased in difficulty.
Five words.

The other book was a pamphlet on how Sunagakure's abodes are created.
Yes, Nozumi was intelligent, and as such he could gague levels of intelligence based on brief interactions. 

<We'll see if he figures it out..> "Hrng.." He sits on the ground. "Sit. We'll eat here..." From the confines of his back-pouch he extends a bento-box towards Heiwa along with a pair of chop-sticks.. It was filled with shrimp, alond with spring-rolls and sauce that had a bit of kick to it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) forms a single handseal, forcefully expanding the chakra in his core. When it was refined to it's highest point possible his chakra spikes through various nodes in his body. Cheeks bugle outwards as a wave builds, the stored chakra is spewed onto the ground. Several waves rise - the crushing waters crash into a nearby mountain which burrows several holes into the base. <Hmmm....>

He watches the large body of water eventually ebb away. "Sigh." Progress was surprsingly slow all things considered. It was difficult for someone with decent Suiton training to utilize this technique. Quite frankly he was surprised that he was even able to use it at all, but the yellow fang of Sunagakure.

He had to take the time to form the Snake seal once more. The chakra in his chest tightening with each second. His maw releases a literally wave of waves that were so vast they cast a shadow over the ground. It's momentum carries it for quite a while.* - Sun Oct 11 14:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) silently continues with his work. Several items were line in front of him, he draws his chakra through, and infuses it through the parchment. Several layers forcefully expand and retract in tandem, the manipulation of his chara bringing objects through time and space at a moments notice. Several jutsu formulas were now present on paper, and he unseals them. Kunai, shuriken, and poison bombs are taken into his possession. 

Then he brings a screen into view, cuts it into a square with his Kunai, and then molds it's shape with one of his cutting tools. He fuses several coils together with flame, and then brings the circut forward. Clips it to his ear after shaping it through careful manipulation.

The reactive device responds to chakra, and it's manifestation. The color coated nexus enabling him to gague chakra-levels, and observe individual chakra signatures. He smiles, the device was still not finished.* - Sun Oct 11 15:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: That's disrespectful to your father. - Sun Oct 11 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: He'd do the same thing~ - Sun Oct 11 15:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) started to meditate over a hill. The sand was like fire against his skin, the land of wind was truly something. The darkness and still air was enough to make him more than pleased. To hear the birds flying over-head, their yellow beaks opening to play a tune that trained against his ears. To the insects that crossed over his clothing in this current state. He was calm, and Nozumi was certainly inclined towards remaining calm under most circumstances. There were exceptions for everything, yes, but he had adjusted well to every instance of struggle that had been presented to him.

He mulls over the events that happened prior to his return to the Land Of Wind. <I understand..> He nods, even though the Sunagakure shinobi did not give two fucks about the position of Konohagakure he understood. Empathy was shown where it shouldn't have been shown. It was true that these shinobi had their own problems to worry about, but what they had to realize that his struggle was theirs.. The human struggle.

It transcended villages, and human beings in general. Concepts such as morality, and benevolence were above everything to him in the end. But of course this was something the other nations would never realize. They would never come to an understanding without being shown the right way. That is why Nozumi left the village he was born in, left the people he was raised with, and the life of a shinobi for the time being. He was -still- a shinobi, but this task he had decided to take on was something he'd need the help of everyone. It was why he was venturing to these other villages in the hope someone would listen to him for even a second..

It was true the Uzumaki did not have much to offer right now, but he was learning. * - Sun Oct 11 15:50:36 2015
