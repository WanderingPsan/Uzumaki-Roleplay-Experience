He pauses.

"I will not make an act of violence against you. Had it been anyone else, you would have been erased from existence, but I know of the crimes Edge had commited to, and I used to hate you for a long time. You were the cause of so much suffering, and you left us in a broken condition where we were nothing but a laughing stock."

"But I also realize that I have no desire to end your life, nor do I want you cause problems. I wish for you to make a statement to your people, and -beg- for them to forgive you. Next, I want you to allow me to place a seal upon you in the future to ensure that you never leave again."* - Sun Nov 22 07:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The prison was built for efficiency - the plans followed a strict design that was approved by Niklaus. The light of day did not touch a single window-pane, the light of day did not escape the structure. The atrum was the only solace the prisoners housed which was fixed with a small window in which the depraved could look out of.

Sunagakure shinobi made their daily rounds, as Kumogakure obviously couldn't defend their own nation at this point. 

For now everything was calm.
* - Sun Nov 22 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Most of the guards had been trained to handle obvious intrustions. This was unconventional, and because of this it left all of them ignorant of what was going on. Their routine, much like most things followed an algorithim. Some came and went while other stayed.

The main gate was guarded by a Kyodai-Senseu wielder, and the other one seemed to be an elementalist. Both of them kept things light, as they relied on mobility, and while things were usually quiet they remained vigilant.

* - Sun Nov 22 07:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The guards look at them like they were insane. "Ey, shaking down some of the people for food? They are literally giving away food to everyone who needs it.. The hunger in Kumogakure has ended." Truly, this had become fact in the Land Of Clouds. Thanks to Eiji's, and the labor of his entire clan they were able to fix the hunger problem entirely, and it spread like wild fire.

Even that might have been fine and dandy, but the fact they didn't realize everyone was hungry was also another discrepancy. For one, that was the only thing they talked about in the past, and how Kumogakure was going to die out. But now, with the addition of Kumogakure's agricultural task force all of that had ended.

"Uh, we can take those prisoners to their holding cells. What's their destination?" They'd inquire.* - Sun Nov 22 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) *Just proof im not bsing*
The food crisis in Africa----Kumogakure has been resolved!

Carrot soup and carrot stew has found itself into the bellies of every single individual in Kumogakure, somehow.  Members of the Kirisaki Clan of Kumogakure have solved their village's hunger.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||If this was not a big thing, not everyone in Kumogakure would've been fed but alas, there was still no reason as to why the guards would be overly inquisitive at this point. "Sure, I was testin ya anyways. Bet you were trying to get me off my post so you could snitch." The specimens were now inside of the first layer of the prisons security.

Still, the construct was a living and breathing entity. There were wheels spinning in motion almost all the time, and the creatures would have a fixed interval of time which was unknown to even them due to never being inside. Yes, that was the problem with just observing the exterior, you lacked a total understanding of the internal components.

For now, though, they wouldn't be disturbed.

If Baylea's body was there - they would eventually come behind it. But not before hitting certain checkpoints, you see, this wasn't just a place you could walk in an out of. Certain members had keys to certain things, and access to certain jails. Take for example, had it been a warden this might've proved to be  advantageous.

* - Sun Nov 22 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Good plans often go off without any real problems presenting themselves, and this was in-fact a very good one. There wasn't really anything that could go wrong, other than a few shinobi doing their rounds at the back. Yes, it was a facility that was heavily guarded, but they hadn't set off any alarms, and the ruse of being a janitor worked in their favor.

Only, that the jail handled waste product by dispensing such things in a chute which made their job all the more easier. This was yet again another discrepancy, the guards had noted this strange behavior, but didn't act on it.

They had no reason to, he seemed to fit the part.* - Sun Nov 22 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Things went off without a hitch, she would no doubt recover the body and wouldnt be disturbed from here on out. Ironically enough, once she pulled away, and the body was checked (if ever) it would cause an internal alarm. Something that caused the others to talk among themselves in worry. They would be asked questions, did anything look out of place?

Perhaps the guards would remember the comment, or the men noticing the Janitor. 

Though they would -never- know who was responsible for this. IF anything they would tigten their security in the future.

What purpose was there in some dead body anway?
Oh how ignorance was bliss, and the shinobi of Sunagakure bathed in it today.* - Sun Nov 22 09:18:56 2015

This whole thing mess was fifty percent of her doing, and she wouldn't even stay to pick up the pieces. If the Raitori wished to be selfish she would find that her name would be worth little in this world, and that her actions would be exposed, not to just Kumogakure, but to the whole world.

Eiyu takes the mantle once more, his form settling into a chair as he speaks into a mic. "I'd like to inform Kumogakure of a certain visitor." He forces himself to pause as a means to contain his fury, he clutched the beacon with so much strength he felt as if it was going to bend in his hand.

"The Yondaime, the same person who left us to die in the past. I've come to relay a message to you all, I have not taken her life. I have not thrown her in a jail-cell either. But I want you to know something. She has brought great shame upon us by leaving once more, refusing to pick up the bits and pieces of the past before her. If she wishes to stain our legacy with her cowardice, let us do the same"

The denizens devote a whole campaign against the former 'Yondaime.' Her name would be mentioned with outfits of laughter, they would make action figures with her features stretched to the limit of ugly. They would make novels dedicated to her entire life.

'Vagabond-Slut' Was her new nickname. Of couse you had some true loyalists wanting to end her life, and seek her head, but Eiyu denied them the chance.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) sends his canines into the pad of his index finger, after drawing the amount of blood required for the sacrifice the Minatabi forms a few handseals. "Summoning Jutsu." His right hand rails into the sediment activiating a helix of cryptic seals - the rift of time and space rips the Frog from it's home and transports it in front of the duo.

"I must consult someone." He posters for dramatic effect.

Gamatatsu's small frame smiles, it's slitted eyes shifting uneasily against the sun.
"Oh, Eiyu-Cha, did you get me any snacks?"

<Baka........He's still over my limit, and to think he couldve been the deciding factor... But I suppose their strength will have to be enough. I have faith in their ability, as the Raikage of Kumogakure that is the one thing I must have.... Faith in my shinobi to get the task done.>

"Eiji-San. The mission is a go." He ignores the Toad for now.

This mixup could prove to be catastrophic if they were sighted by any sources. Their presence in the Land Of Grass had been under benevolent pretense, and their actions were an act of a earnest mistake.

Though, Eiyu hadn't really gathered that from them. He initially assumed that Takuma had simply been heavy handed and caused the mission to go south, but he had informed Eiji that he was to be the squad leader so this bittter-seet moment was his down.

"You are dismissed." He pays them what is owed and shakes his head in disappointed.* - Mon Nov 23 03:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) took a step closer towards Takuma, and reaches for his collar. He'd reel him in so that their foreheads were touching, provided he didn't resist.

"I don't know."

His grip over the males clothing eases.
"But I do know this, if we continue to have failures like this Kumogakure will be seen as something it's not.. Do you want Hassan coming here looking at everything we do? Do you know on how much thin ice Kumogakure is resting on!? On how much thing ice I am actually resting on!? When you go, and do a mission you aren't just doing it for the hell of it. You're there to get it done, and you're there to do it perfectly. No exceptions, if you fail there are consequences. But you stay on the mission.... You do whatever is possible to ensure it's going one hundred percent. You, and Eiji did not do that today! Did you expect for me to thank you?!"* - Mon Nov 23 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 's hand retracts, he nearly falls over from this unexpected attack, but finds his footing. He simply looks into Takuma's eyes, the male had spoken what he thought to be truth. They were strong, the finest of Kumogakure, yet.
"Yes, you are strong... Your strength puts you far above your peers in every respect. I haven't seen such raw power since the destruction of Kumogakure, and while I don't compare your power to that incident, what I'm saying is.. "

"Even with all that power your -actions- proved to be a detriment" He glances at Eiji next.

"You would give your life for this village? I get that, I would too.. But that's why I'm the Raikage, so you won't have to. I would protect every man, woman, and child who bears the insignia of the Cloud village... You want to take a shot at my -strength-!? Yes, what you see in me is probably a childish weakling who probably couldn't even defend myself, but that's where you're wrong."

"I've strived for the Tenacity Of Lightning ever since our village was ripped asunder....It's why we must continue to show restraint in these difficult times... I don't want you to change into something you're not... You killed a child......! That is something you will carry for the rest of your life... Their smell... The look on their faces as they perished, the lack of color on their features.... Those who show now empahty for the fallen are doomed to the same fate Edge is! I don't want you to be like that! I've given so much for the Land Of Clouds, and I ask for nothing in return... I simply wish to see all of you thrive!? Why is that so difficult for you to see!?"

Tears were now visible in his eyes.
"But we must not over-look what we've done... What you've done... !"* - Mon Nov 23 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Wind style great breakthrough hits him from his flank, the wind pushing away the obtrusive mist like nothing. Two scrolls come unhinged from the males side, within an instant hundreds of weapons ripple towards him with fercious intent, some had wire attatched to their frame as a means to hit him from behind, a few others had tags that went off, he didn't even need to see the male, quantity was quality of it's own, and he attempted to just end it right there.

For good measure windstyle air bullets were released in a rather timely wave. The Mintabi streak trecks backwards after all of this.* - Mon Nov 23 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Just because he had eluded a group of shinobi doesn't mean he would get away, especially since Sunagakure shinobi were now on alert, and there were several shinobi trained onto his location. Kirigakure No Jutsu was an infamous jutsu wherein the person attempted to conceal their person with the use of an chakra infused cloud of Suiton chakra. Though, this was easily countered by elementalists who employed different jutsu.

The bane of Shunshin no jutsu is that unless you were very skilled in it's usage, you could not use it consecutively.Of course this fact would also make dashing away as the male hoped nigh impossible because of one reason, if he was not exceptionally fast he wasn't going to get away with it.

You had sensors, elementalist, kenjutsu users, and medic's all stationed inside of Kumogakure No Sato. This petty act was seen as much more because of the implications that followed. 

Water natured chakra moved underfoot as a means to catch someone off-guard. While in the same instance a blade of air flies through the midst as a means to sever the man's ties on the ground level, in the air three giant fire balls ripple skybound. Below shinobi employ Earth style tearing palm.

What would be done now?* - Mon Nov 23 06:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The concept of what was a hero, and villain were often confused. The lines of what they were was no longer defined in black and white. People often killed entire armies on things they assumed to be justice. Take Kenshin for example, he thought he was ridding the world of a great evil, but instead he only made matters worse by attacking. 

Niza was dead.

Eiyu begins writing down his entire life, starting from his childhood, along with a verse he had finally completed. 
He had dubbed it..
"The Nameless Heroes"

"Here they stand
In a world of great sorrow.
In a world of lost values.
Here they stand
In a land of great beauty.
In a land of hope.
They who watch from the shadows.
Here they stand
In a paradox of painful joy.
In a sea of confused waters.
Where the titans walk among the dwarves.
Here they stand
In a place they can't seize.
In a place they can't exist in. 
Through time they see.
Through ages they form.
A myth they can't unsee.
Here they stand.
Among history's greatest.
Among history's nameless.
In unwritten times they be.
In unreveiled events they do.
Here they stand
Among thieves.
Among gods.
Among ghosts.
The last men standing.
The last men hoping.
No songs to be sing.
No stories to be told.
Here they stand.
World's fearless warriors.
World's nameless heroes.?"

Being a hero wasn't about becoming famous, being a hero meant doing what you had to do for your village. True shinobi did not serve their nation to become famous. They were the foundation..

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I do the odd job from time to time. - Mon Nov 23 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Tch, just be straight forward. What kind of 'odd' jobs? - Mon Nov 23 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Anything the general population doesn't want to. Whether it be fixing things, bounty hunting, you name it and I've probably done it. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Much like a shinobi does. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Fixing things, now that is intersting. - Mon Nov 23 18:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I'm not the best at fixing things, but I've done a few house repairs before. In terms of bounty hunting, I'm pretty straightforward. - Mon Nov 23 18:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I can do that. - Mon Nov 23 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) throws a sack of money in Ichiro's direction. 
"If money is the root of all evil, does this mean I still cannot trust you? Will you go back on your words, does this paint me a coward to give you this with the pretense you will not harm my people? No, because I've had two failed assassination attempts."

"What if someone else offers you a million to take me on?"
The Minatabi smiles wryly.* - Mon Nov 23 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: You represent Kumogakure. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: It's bad for business. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Good.. I'm glad that you are a Noble man. But you must also realize your life-style is also... - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Very risky. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Say. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I could go a few rounds. - Mon Nov 23 18:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Nice. - Mon Nov 23 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You may start if you wish. - Mon Nov 23 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Fast..> Ichiro was able to close the distance in mere seconds. Due to the fact Eiyu was caught off guard, and he was only at fifty percent of his capability he is caught with said punched, and knocked several feet away only to implode into a plum of smoke. 

Upon noticing that his Kage-Bunshin had been away with the male makes his way to the fight in question. "You are truly talented.. I can see that I too will have to be careful. You are someone whom is not to be underestimated." 

Eiyu unclips two scrolls on his waist that had a Lotus sign imprinted on it's surface.

"But let's see how fast you can dodge."
Smoke fills the area - something was coming.* - Mon Nov 23 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Boom." The Mintabi mutters for dramatic effect. Projectiles are released in a rather consuming wave. However, their over-all potency is cut in half, due to this being a spar. Shuriken made their way to his legs, while in the same instance Kunai's with wires attatched to them made their way for his shoulders. 

The other projectiles close in from his cardinal positions to disallow him the luxury of moving to the left, or right, or forward without difficulty.

<I wonder why he didn't move...>* - Mon Nov 23 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Hm. This is no ordinary shinobi... > The Minatabi could do nothing as he saw the male ward off his attacks. The sound of projectiles clinking behind his hardened dermis made a lump form in the Raikage's throat. 

<That cumbersome wall is in the way..I suppose I have no choice.> The male begins to form a set of handseals,

<I'll bring him out of it.> Eiyu shifts to the side, the Earth beneath Ichiros feet began to stir. Spikes rupture from the sediment itself with the intent to catch his legs off guard.

"I can see if you had come for my head, this would've been a problem."
Once more the Raikage aimed to confine the Engi. He was very powerful, it was clear he didnt want the bounty hunter to get close.* - Mon Nov 23 19:20:06 2015
