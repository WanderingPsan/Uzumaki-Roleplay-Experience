<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: They don't want their chunnin? - Sun Sep 13 00:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What? - Sun Sep 13 00:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) he had his back turned to the others so they would not see this but as soon as he had spoke these words his Sharingan would've activated.
"Now, let help you... What are you doing here?"* - Sun Sep 13 00:31:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys just backstabbed me so. - Sun Sep 13 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Please don't call him my 'buddy'. - Sun Sep 13 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) no direction was specified in his response so it goes into the form of default, his gaze instantly tears into his mind if there was no defense at all. "Tell me everything....." Yes, he was manipulating his mind.* - Sun Sep 13 00:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well there was this Gezo prince guy... - Sun Sep 13 00:33:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) if at all possible he simply goads the male into giving the impression he was beyond tired, if it took effect he closes his eyes and deactivates his Sharingan before stepping away.* - Sun Sep 13 00:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But I do think there is truth to his statement that Tethys kicked him out. - Sun Sep 13 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Why he was here. - Sun Sep 13 00:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Probably some elaborate ass plan. - Sun Sep 13 00:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) does is required and uses some device to keep his body in check. Due to his Doujutsu being active he was able to see if any Fuuinjutsu formulas were present on his person. He chuckled internally at the fact that his actions were s subtle that no-one in the vicinity would've seen the extent of his visual prowess save one, even still there was no indiciation to even the one who had seen his gaze what they could do. Ushinawa's mind was like a fortress when it came to spawning illusions in a second, it is what made him dangerous, but alas he kept it under wrarps for his own well being. "Done.."* - Sun Sep 13 00:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: "Kicked" out.. - Sun Sep 13 00:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) moved rather quickly after hearing this, his speed was like a blur, his hands quickly whirl together and create a wave of condensed lightning, the scope and power of it was amplified by his prowess. * - Sun Sep 13 00:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Prick. - Sun Sep 13 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Damn, he's' fast....> This man was clearly a seasoned shinobi and moved practically as fast as himself if not faster so conventional fightning just wouldn't do here. <It takes someone very talented to move out of the way of that technique...> He positons himself so he couldn't be attacked while sinking underground.
Then he begins his descent.* - Sun Sep 13 01:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: omit - Sun Sep 13 18:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) opened his eyes and glanced at the surrounding forest. Crimson hemisphere pry the landscape bare and Ushinawa seeks the various organisms at his feet, struggling in trees and flying through the horizon. "I think it's about that time we show the world what I am truly capable of, Gintoki." His hands quickly sink into his weapon holster while he jumps into the air, the metallic projectiles tear for various poiints of several tree's his only target being the branches that hung from the oaks at his sides. The head of the flying implement carves into the stump and peels away the layer of bark. 

Ushinawa promptly accelerates while bringing his hands together into a rapid flurry of handsigns, the culmination of his chakra and Katon affinity ignites several trees and produces thick smoke that would sting the eyes. It was ironic that with each use of his Sharingan that it was adjusting to not only his body but the enviornment as well...

"I see it..." He mutters under his breath while taking off into the treeline wich such grace and ability that it didn't even seem human.* - Sun Sep 13 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: .... - Sun Sep 13 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) continues to have his Sharingan active while observing the field as it were. The training field was the perfect place to test his ability, he'd come across animals who's senses were exploited by his visual prowess. Just a glance was all it took to grasp ones mind into a one dimensional field of looming darkness, just a glance to constict the movements of others and entice actions. Such was the strength of the Sharingan, Ushinawa knew that others would attempt to steal this power for their own but he wouldn't let them.... He still was not yet done with this world as it were, and he wouldn't be done until the Gezo fell.

The shinobi world and their problems meant next to nothing to the Uchiha. His prime concern was how this force of elite warriors governed these nations of misfits and tried to lead them into a sense where their hand was needed. They were little more than slaves, and they were the real reason why this world would never know peace. Everyone would always try and fight to secure what they thought what gain them merit, but in reality they were just playing their hand and nothing more than mindless drones.

"I will not falter..."
Veins took possession of the sides of his face while his Sharingan was strained. <Hn... I promise...>* - Sun Sep 13 18:50:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The partial breaks in your speech patterns, your isolating me when you had a question. - Sun Sep 13 19:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ".........." Ushinawas mouth dropped and he took a step back out of utter shock. Beads of sweat gently riding his brow, the rise and fall of his chest even becoming more pronounced. <He is........ Like me........?> Luckily he was able to compose himself quickly enough to let his surprise fade away rather quickly. "Revert.... Them..." He mutters quickly while looking around the area. "Don't show them to anyone unless you are going to die, and if I'm around when this happens I will protect you with my life..."* - Sun Sep 13 19:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) knew the hardships Hideki was going through. It was one thing feeling alone, but to make matters worse he would be hunted by other people if they were to find out of his ability. That was something Ushinawa knew well, and even though certain people knew of his Sharingan they didn't know what it was truly capable of. Hideki had only started his journey in being able to draw from the power of the Uchiha bloodline, it would be his to master and his alone. No-one else was fit to wiled the Sharingan and that was fact.

"Indeed..." 
Ushinawa promptly makes his way south whilst motioning Hideki to follow. "We should see if any of the others have awaken."* - Sun Sep 13 19:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Hm? - Sun Sep 13 19:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) slowly brings the front of his palm infront of his eyes, the callouses that formed were due to extensive Kenjutsu training. Even the scars over his wrist leading to his forearm was a testament as to how far he had grown. Perhaps if anyone was adept to sensing the human psyche they would pick up this lingering darkness.

"If Kirigakure shows up here again.....Let me handle it up front while you play support......"* - Sun Sep 13 19:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) knew that Zetsumo and Beth had the advantage due to being in the air. There were few who could take a vantage point from afar like this, but Ushinawa knew of one person specifically. In addition he had to worry about ground forces which was something that he was prepared for. Still, one could not account for everything so for the time being he'd simply wait to see what would happen next. "Hmm...." The white of his eyes took on a vermillion composition, the center pupil was now accompanied  by three surrounding tomoe.

<Hmmm...>* - Sun Sep 13 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"The ocean is caving in and...... What?.... Someone is running across it ...." Ushinawa's gaze attempts to adjust to whatever is looming closer, but alas he could not at least for the time being. He didn't even want to waste movement to unsheathe his sword. "It's with... Such speed that the mines are exploding but he seems to .. Elude all of them with his foot-falls."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wasn't one for making himself an open target because Kenshin was known throughout the world or being the fastest thing the shinobi world had ever seen. He wonders how long it would take for the Speedstar to break their offensive line. His ability to help the others was taking a beating due to the fact that the man simply couldn't be stopped conventionally. 

He burrows underground and awaits a turn to spring.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) makes his way south and notices the bodies that decorated the floor, he activates his Sharingan and notices that their chakra is disturbed, further inspection of the area granted by his visual prowess attempts to pinpoint the cause if possible. Naturally the culprit would've been on the run, whereas those shinobi who were not involved would be stagnant. His speed is immense and his tracking ability had some merit thanks in part due to his ability to read chakra signatures.
