<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Things have changed. - Fri Sep 11 15:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can . . . I think . . . That's if we progressed equally as much since last time . . . Right now though it's a matter of pissing the rest of the gezo off. - Fri Sep 11 15:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's something I don't want to do. - Fri Sep 11 15:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) chuckles slightly as he slips his arms through his robe. There was a lingering lucid aura around his being. Something colder than usual and it was clear that the rogue had changed. Obsidian eyes carefully adjust to his former comrades form, a look of disgust taking possession of his visage.
"He is the Raikage... Do you even know what that means?"* - Fri Sep 11 15:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes I do. - Fri Sep 11 15:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you know how strong he's gotten? - Fri Sep 11 15:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He was knocked out by one of Zetsumo's goukyakus. Knocked out, rather than disintigrated like he should've been. - Fri Sep 11 15:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's also slower than you'd expect a raikage to be. - Fri Sep 11 15:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was gonna go after him but after I saw him take one of Zetsumo's jutsus I changed my mind. - Fri Sep 11 15:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If not for how durable he is, he didn't seem that impressive. - Fri Sep 11 15:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not underestimating. Just trying to help Kilm figure out how strong he is. - Fri Sep 11 15:21:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) notes the events that led up to his descent. The destruction of his brother by an incompetent Klaus, the ignorance of his fellow comrades and their ability to understand his pain drove him over the edge. Now, he stood out as a man determined to live a life where he was unknown. He didn't want infamy or a life where he would be known as someone who was simply a rogue. He stepped onto his own path that was neither good or bad.

However, there was something that was powering his resolve. It was a feeling an emotion for genuine hatred for the people responsible for what happened to him during his past. It was all leading up this and he was getting stronger, and as the allied shinobi forced worked to put Zetsumo away they wouldn't even have an idea that a similar fate was in-store for them.

He casually slips his arms into his sleeves still seething with rage although seeming calm on the exterior.
<Klaus I do wonder if you're still alive.. I would've loved to have been the one to see the vacant look on your eyes as my blade pierced your heart...> He regains his center shortly there after and inquires of the group in attendance.* - Fri Sep 11 16:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Need help? - Fri Sep 11 16:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Do what you will. - Fri Sep 11 16:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But do not attempt to manipulate me with Genjutsu. - Fri Sep 11 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: It is technically a genjutsu, one that ensures you are to tell the truth. - Fri Sep 11 16:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I see... Then so be it. - Fri Sep 11 16:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's quite simple really. - Fri Sep 11 16:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) recognized the Genjutsu immediately. The trigger was established easily enough and he would speak, these words were the truth. "My loyalty is to survival, and not to a person whom I've just met. For my ulterior motives I don't really have any other than seeing these people suffer as I have suffered. I have no thoughts of betraying Zetsumo.."* - Fri Sep 11 16:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Kilm seems to know this man. I'll pick at him later. - Fri Sep 11 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) stirs internally, the Genjutsu over his mind was something that annoyed him to his core. Not because he was being screened but moreso because Beth continued to prod him with questions after he revealed himself. He knew a lot more than what he said about the group but didn't feel it was relevant. It was because information was a weapon, and while he truly had no intentions of harming anyone in this group he deduced that it was within his best interest to be quiet. 

"Still, your people came up in a few conversations, and what you could do."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"Hnn.." He glances at his twin sister and seemed hesitant at first. He hadn't  had contact with his family in such a way since the demise of Gintoki. Nonetheless he steps into her embrace his arms weaving across the small of his back, but his peripherals resting on either arm. He notices Beth's shift in movement and curses silently. 
<I'm going to assume she has mental problems.>* - Fri Sep 11 16:51:50 2015

Her superior strength was no match at this point, ironically the roles were him succumbing to her powerful biceps. "Ughn..." He mutters under his breath out of the slight amount of discomfort she was exuding over his body. 

However it did feel good to finally hug his sister after all this time. "..Fate, and you, Misa..."* - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||It had been too long since they were together, too long since Ushinawa felt Mariana's skin on his body. "You don't know... How long... I've wanted to...." His right hand brushes the side of her face revealing her-cheek bones through her flowing black hair. He moves in for a kiss, the motion of his lips pushing her's everywhich way, sensually prying back the clothing on her skin leaving her bare if she allowed it.

His chest sinks into her's breasts most likely causing them to pursue up while his index finger curves her bodice. "Tell me what you want.." He whispers.* - Sat Sep 12 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) |She would feel his flaccid length grow in her hand. The eight inch shaft beats visibly through his skin, his uncut crown was gleaming at this point. The surrounding lights illuminate the nexus of veins flowing through his body member. "Hrngggg...." It was obvious he was enjoying it because he winces many-times before giving her his next suggestion. "Then put it inside..." His waist extends forth allowing him to drag his cock across her grip. * - Sat Sep 12 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) felt his clothing torn of of his body. Most of his body was shaved - save for a patch of pubic hair ranging over his shaft. Now that he was on the bed he wonders what Mariana had in-store. He assumed she intended to ride him so he opens his legs out of instinct, however feeling the presence of something invade his hole causes him to jump. "*Gasp!*" Her finger continued to work into the area causing a mixture of pain and pleasure. "I....Hn.." He was going to tell her to stop initially but then came the added stimulation of her mouth against his crown. Instantly his body reacts and several droplets of precum trickle from his crowns entrance. He clutches the bed with all of his might. "FUCK!"* - Sat Sep 12 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) | His pink crown was exposed through her pulling the skin back previously. It remained that way the duration of the time his rod spent slamming into her mouth. His length indiscriminately attacking her throat. When she reached five inches in he'd press on the back of her head so that she took every inch of his being. The gyrations that were produced through her throat spasms massaged the crown thoroughly... He grunts low but he found it increasingly difficult to keep up with Mariana's finger that had just hit his prostate. He felt like he was on the brink of cumming while not actually even hitting that limit yet.

His body contorts tightly from the involuntary orgasms.* - Sat Sep 12 03:54:01 2015

"I see..." He reaches for her waist and guides her movements so she wouldn't slip up. With the spittle from his cock acting as lubrication he tests her asshole with the crown of his penis. 

The opening slowly expands as his girth pushes away her insides. He presses down on her shoulders so that the pressure of his eight inch cock inside of her filled her entirely. But he doesn't just stop there, just when she thought he was going to start slow he goes a little faster. Every follicle, every vein he possessed presents itself. "Grind..... On it......More..."* - Sat Sep 12 04:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||The circular movements provided by his lover added heat to the mix. This warm sensation built on the precipice of his penis. While she continues to stradle him he extends his arms to the side and simply drive his waist upwards. Then came the descending lips wet, and hot in conviction. He was currently enthralled by their kiss but he still manages to abide by her request and add more momentum to the driving of his shat through her narrow orifice.

She gives him her back. and as expected his arms reach around her body until he had her breasts in hand. He pinched the nipples together, from index to thumb they were twirled. Now that his cock was inside of her pussy he didnt need to be particularly careful about injuring her. He starts at a normal tempo,  but as she moved with the push and pull of his waist his muscles tense and he begins to fill her entrance rapidly. The clap of her ass hitting his waist was very loud, he shows no intention of stopping until she orgasms, hard.* - Sat Sep 12 04:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) || The irony of her statement - Ushinawa was on the verge of his climax as well. Though he always tried to await of the arrival of his lovers orgasm first. Still it was hard to fight the urge to release when her tight walls bat against his throbbing extension. Luckily for him he no longer needed to endure the wait of meeting the needs of his lover because it was at this point he too came. His hands lower from her pink nipples to her waist wherein he grips with vigor while he cements his eight inch shaft as deep as he could manage into her pussy. 

" Me too.... Fuck you are ... Tight.. I bet you were waiting for me to do this.. . . Right... Regh...."This region contracted and was now lubricated with his dwindling essence that was sure to make it's way onto his clothing and the bedspread, but he was happy he was able to ride the wave of his climax with his lover.* - Sat Sep 12 04:45:13 2015

He was hard pressed to maintain his composure due to the unexpectedness of her movements. The rotating hips took him into realms of pleasure so high he thought he'd never hit the ground. He leans forward while she was still in motion and hugs her body with his arms. Of course since she had her back to him it meant that his hands stopped at her stomach. They were as close as possible when this was taking place, and for good reason.

"I need something. . . . .To hold onto.." He speaks in a strained tone. His seed continues to spill from the chasms of her pussy but most of it was still kept away due to his member clogging her pussy.. His erect cock was still standing firmly inside of her body and he made it's manifestation evident by wriggling the base even deeper... * - Sat Sep 12 04:58:52 2015

Rare for someone of his ilk but circumstances changed the way he looked at life.

He'd pause momentarily not because he was upset that Misa knew that he had a girlfriend as she was his sister, moreover it was Zetsumo.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) reached for his blade - the midnight black sheathe was inverted whilst he made his move. Quickly and fluidly he directed the blade along a horizontal path while in the same motion unhinging the other blade at his left and aiming to make small lacerations across her legs. She was being attacked from two different directions with two different weapons, Ushinawa waits to see how she reacts to this attempt.* - Sat Sep 12 15:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Wow..> He thought to himself as she blocked the attack, so she had improved and was able to parry both of his strikes. Upon seeing her leg shot up in the attempt to strike him he side-steps while rotating the direction of the blades in his hand hopefully causing somesort of difficulty for Mariana. Now that he avoids the blow he attempts to bring his right hand against her left shoulder, but it was another slash directed at her being and if she was hit it would not bite deep.* - Sat Sep 12 16:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Emotion was good when it came to certain things. It reminded people of their humanity and helped them to become stronger when the need arises. Rage did have it's place in a battle but it had its ups and downs. The strength and speed of Mariana would've been boosted obviously and had Ushinawa been hit with this he could've literally been impaled but such were the risks one took when fighting.

Ushinawa's fighting style was technical and he drew his strength from being dexterous and agile. The head of the spear misses him entirely but he doesn't attack out of fear Marian would go into a wild frenzy of strikes and that was something he couldn't always predict, so instead he falls back some before raising his blades in her direction.

Hirusho makes his way to Mariana and reaches for her hands, his onyx eyes seem to penetrate her very essence, almost as if he could see her very soul. "You've become a fine shinobi..."

Hiru wouldn't have forgotten to kiss his love, he knew how they rarely departed without giving eachother a mutual send odd. So, with this he leans forward and kisses her lips, slowly and full of the sensual energy they have come to enjoy. It gets to the point where he quite possibly goes over-board and gropes her breasts, squeezing them and letting go before attempting to squeeze them again, but only if she let it get that far, either way he'd step away while looking at the ground.

Still, he knew she was capable of protecting herself and he knew she would be alright. When he turns away from her this time the pattern of his obsidian eyes turn red and chakra signatures are highlighted all around, thus the Sharingan had been activated and he zooms away, he was about to master a -very- dangerous aspect and if he died now it would simply mean he wasn't ready.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) listens to all of Zetsumos instructions carefully as he plans to choke the nation dry. He awaited to see where not only his place would be, but also Marianas. Hirusho normally worked alone in many instances as he found people usually just got in the way but this was different. He had to draw on his times as a trained shinobi to work with his team, and that was something he disliked.
Still, if it meant he could attack and protect at the same time he was willing to do so. 
"I suppose it's that time then.."
He nods softly whilst motinoning towards the woman dressed in black. "I know you're ready.."* - Sat Sep 12 19:13:04 2015
