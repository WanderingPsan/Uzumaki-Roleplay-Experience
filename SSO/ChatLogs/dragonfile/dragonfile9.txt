<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) didn't have much else to say regarding that matter. He knew that he wouldn't get what he requested because he simply didn't meet the requirements. Still, a part of him couldn't feel happy that he declined the deal; it showed maturity on his part because honestly if he had accepted it would've been the easy way out. Sure, he would have power like he wished, and the prospect of summoning a creature but he would've compromised himself. 

"See you.." He makes his way north intent on rejoining the group.* - Sat Sep 19 22:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) it was assumed that these snakes moved very fast, and it was their intent to restrain his movements. However, there was one problem with the jutsu's creation is that she first aimed to restrain him, his over-all movement, to stop his handsigns they would have to make contact with his arms, and more importantly his hands.
"Trickery?" He'd inquire, but he was already through the notion of breaking it, as you see, the snakes would potentially burn away at the first mention of touch, as he didn't need to form handseals for chakra flow, he simply conduted his chakra through his hands into the medium. "Surely..." 

If all went as planned he'd simply turn in her direction and glare at her... 
"You didn't such tactics would work...."* - Sat Sep 19 22:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) listened to her story intently. One thing was for certain and that was the young Hanabi had been traumatized by this world and all of the things inside of it. She was looking for people to drag under wing, so to speak. It was unfortunate that he was able to see through her jutsu so easily, even while his Sharingan wasn't facing her direction. He continues to look at her eyes and speaks in an unhindered manner. "You've lived a tough life, I get it... His aura seeps through the his skin, and no doubt running chills through the womans body if she was exploitable in that manner.

"But you've got to understand.... What you've done is wrong..... In addition I'll let you in on a little fact..... That is . . .I can cast Genjutsu by simply opening my mouth... It just takes a few words." 

Yes, a ruse within a ruse.
"I suppose since you attacked me I will take the knowledge from you that I wish, but don't worry.. I'm not going to harm you... I suspect I have you to thank afterall." He had a backup plan in case this didn't even work, additionally.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Then it came, in the world of illusions Ushinawa's maw opened revealing the set of teeth in his mouth. "Su-... How...?" The male seemed to be afraid of the transformation's the exuberant power. It seemed he was now the ant among God's how could he possibly deal with this threat? 

Regardless other things were currently in action. In reality he set the motions forth to capture into a coma-esque state. If all of this went through he'd simply extract the information he needed from her. He wasn't aware of what she was telling was the truth since she did lie about Hideki's condition before. In addition she seemed to want to do whatever it took to secure him, to no avail.

'Just what exactly are you?'
'How do I truly call upon the creatures you call upon?'
'What are your true intentions?' 
Everything would be exposed whilst caught in his visual prowess.* - Sat Sep 19 22:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) 's eyes narrow, perhaps now that she was under his Genjutsu he could impose his will on her. It would be an easy enough affair to extract more, and ironically her intentions did seem to be pure, but it wasn't something that he was going to do. He had enough problems as it was, his only interest was in the contract, and he did wonder about it. 

"To sign the blood contract.... Do you need to be a snake?"
"Do you have the contract on you now?"* - Sat Sep 19 23:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) nods calmly as he approaches the scroll in question, he slashes the pad of his index finger with a Kunai and scribbles his name onto the surface in blood. He looks around at Hanabi shortly thereafter. "Return it.... " Then, once she sent it back where it had come from he'd release the genjutsu.* - Sun Sep 20 00:09:36 2015

He commits a series of slashes across her body in mere seconds, adding to his prowess were the creation of flames around her base meant to simply drop her, though not kill, simply wound so that she wouldnt' be a problem.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) cranes his head in the direction of the scythe wielding monster known as Erebus. He didn't expect to hear him speak, or respond to him in any manner whatsoever, however now that he had spoken he couldn't help but feel that his ways were inhuman. With this, he turns and faces the males direction his Sharingan observing his movements but other than that he was not hostile in the slightest.

"Hm...? Oh, I see... Tell me, where are these gates you speak of? Do you mean in death?"* - Sun Sep 20 15:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) understood the gist of what Erebus was saying, and the fact he spoke of the shinobi nations being corrupted by sin, their taint even dwindling into the next generation. He glances at Mariana, and Hideki, the both of them were indeed precious to him and he would make sure they were not harmed if within his power. But if one thing was certain it was that the Jashinist who stood before him was by no means normal, and even moreso he wanted the same thing that Ushinawa did, perhaps even Niza would see the truth in the Land Of Water.
"Then... It shall be so, provided that you do not harm my allies.. However I am interested in Kirigakure, to see how they've matured, and how they are doing provided this war which is most likely going to rear itself."* - Sun Sep 20 15:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: IS that you part your forces and let me see into Kirigakures heart.. By part I mean have them not attack me. - Sun Sep 20 15:28:38 2015
