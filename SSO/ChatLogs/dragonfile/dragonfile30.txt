<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances at the red head, a look of indifference taking possession over his youtfhul features. "What're you doing in Kirigakure?" He states, his tone partially demanding, yet passive enough so as not to insult the males presence.* - Sun Nov 15 21:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) chuckles lighty, the male notices how Haku was able to summon the eel. To say he was surprised to say the summon would be an understatement. "That's actually pretty handy... But they don't talk, do they?"

Eiyu looks at the creature a bit closer, even taking the time to narrow his eyes. He follows the same movements as Haku did, biting into the pad of his forefinger, and them formulating handseals before slamming his palm into the ground. 

"Summoning jutsu." The adolescent frog named Uie commences to hopping around the field. "Hey, Eiyu-San."* - Mon Nov 16 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) uses the excess amount of blood running over his palm. The splattering of rich crimson running over his palm as he takes his sole index finger, and draws a line across the base of his hand. From there he begins to craft a sequence of handseals - his chakra slowly reaches it's apex, and there was a wave of white blowing into his vicinity, the summon had been conjured to the land of the living, only it seemed to be the same summon he had conjured previously.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) chuckles to himself. Haku, and Hachirous interactions were slightly humorous. Hachirou was blunt in almost everything that he did, in-fact that he was so quick to jump straight to the point it could offend others who simply wanted conversation. In this case, Haku was actually interested in what his friend was capable of. In the end they were met with a rift that firmly cemented itself between the two.

They were both socially awkward in their own way, and that was nothing to be ashamed of.

"Heh.." Eiyu kicks his Jounin-Suit off and prepares to dive into the water, but not before summoning Uie on look-out. "Watch me back, bro" 'Sure, Eiyu-San..'* - Mon Nov 16 04:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "ECK!" Eiyu jumps out of the body of water certain that the animal would latch onto his skin. "Crap...!" The youthful shinobi extends his form out of the lake, no longer waiting to be in close proximity between the monstrosity.

"Baka!" He shakes his fist in the direction of the blonde haired male. "You should've warned me earlier... What if he had latched onto me?"

Happened to his face?> He observed his jaw-line, and how there was lack of shape - there seemed to be disfigured flesh that moved in over-lapping layers giving him the image of something grotesque, although that is what Eiyu wouldve that if he was shallow. Instead all he expressed was empathy, even for the people who would disallow him the luxury of losing his life.

In reality he knew he didn't stand a chance against Ortho.
But it was the principle..
But honestly what could he do? He was weak, his comrades knew he was weak, furthermore he could have his legs cleaved off if he continued on this course of action.

He seems to be dissuaded.* - Mon Nov 16 04:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) continues to read from the scroll on his waist. The details inscirbed inside of it's surface was numerous, however, there was one concept inside that was a most unique concept. He had practically no use inside of battle and seemed to be slightly useless in it's own right. Still, he remembered the saying every skill gained on the battlefield could be used in several scenarios. Just because he didn't see a use for it right now didn't mean he wouldn't see one at a later period in time. 

"Let's see..."

He continues to read avidly. Several hours loom by and he is left reading the smallest details over, and over again.* - Mon Nov 16 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Er, this is pretty basic, but I'm not one to complain...> Eiyu continues reading the material, the process of imbuing your finger with chakra and drawning delicate signs across surfaces was starting to show signs of usefulness. Perhaps not for himself, but on other objects that he could get away with writing on. "Hmm.." He thought of lacing his Toads with such messages and could imagine them ripping him asunder for even thinking of doing something so careless.

"I would never do that, heh..."* - Mon Nov 16 07:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Then the only way he can be dealt with is being destroyed? Who are his allies? - Mon Nov 16 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: No idea, but they all live with him. He has no allies outside of his village. - Mon Nov 16 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see... - Mon Nov 16 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: There might be a way to protect portions of this village, but Id only be able to keep it up for an extended period of time once I learn how to employ the jutsu. - Mon Nov 16 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It drains chakra constantly. - Mon Nov 16 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hm? What way i- Ah... - Mon Nov 16 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's called Five Barrier Seal. - Mon Nov 16 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: A barrier fuuinjutsu. - Mon Nov 16 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 16 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It consumes chakra when active, but my Chakra pools are larger than most. - Mon Nov 16 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can keep it up for a while before I need rest. - Mon Nov 16 15:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hmm...Well if you can manage that, that'd be great... - Mon Nov 16 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I will begin on preperation right away.. I just need a few moments to learn how to use it properly... - Mon Nov 16 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Very well. - Mon Nov 16 15:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) takes a scroll from his waist-band and begins to read from the selected material. Just from what Eiyu was able to scan over it required the use of five tags imbued with chakra. Then the user imprinted a seal over all of them, and placed them over a location strategically. But the true strength of this barrier Fuuinjutsu didn't come from it's properties being able to resist things, moreover it was the fact that in order for an outside party to break the barrier one had to physically remove -all- five tags from a specified location.

Such locations would be top-secret, and if the user didn't have knowledge of Fuuinjutsu there was simply no-way they'd be able to deduce it's purpose. Eiyu did take into account that Ortho did have various means to disrupt this barrier, perhaps he could get one of his allies to help him in some manner in the future. This only meant that Eiyu would have to invest in better Fuuinjutsu techniques in order to find new ways of either turning people who didn't belong away, or revealing their location.


"I see..." He continues to look over the material at hand reading all of the small print. These types of techniques interested him because he had an affinity for it. He had already mastered finger carving seal with ease. It didn't take much for this other Fuuinjutsu technique at this point. Regardless, he continues to read from the document with the hope that there wouldn't be a single gap in his understanding of it's usage. There was power in knowledge after-all, and he wanted to use this knowledge to get things right. He knew this fix wasnt a permanent one, but what else was there to turn away the forces that be?

If the Mizukage was away there wasn't anyone nearly strong enough to defend against Ortho's attacks. <It has to work..> Eiyu grits his teeth at this point as he recalls all of the lives that had been lost during Ortho's initial attack. Or was it the beast that ravaged Eiyu? Would such a barrier even hold against a beast like that? Probably not, but unless Ortho or his comrades had any knowledge of how to defeat this seal, it was probably not going to be something that they would be able to solve.* - Mon Nov 16 15:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Hmm.." It would seem that the once easy concept was more complicated than initially thought. Eiyu assumed that his knowledge in Fuuinjutsu would grant him some sort of advantage over learning this concept, only it seemed to be the case. With the Finger-Carving seal at least there was an expectation of how it should be used, but with this unique barrier Fuuinjutsu things were entirely different. Truth be told he hadn't handled such a technique like this before, and was starting to highly doubt he'd be able to learn this in one sitting.

Still, he had to try to do so as there were lives on the line. He was tired of seeing the Land Of Mist aflame simply because there was a dispute among money. Was five hundred thousand ryo worth the lives of men, women, and children? It seemed to be the case at this point. There was no value for human life anymore, he suspected there would come a time when people were killed for grains of rice, let-alone a fair amount of money.

This sickening truth made his stomach churn. "It has to work.." He mutters under his breath, there would be no stopping the Minatabi unitl he understood the concepts of barrier Fuuinjutsu. Well, at least with this technique. He truly hoped the information would begin to click because his next attempts would utilize it in application, and if he got it wrong then he'd have to tweak it. He had done enough reading by this time.* - Mon Nov 16 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Let's see here..> Eiyu had a -very- basic understanding of how this Fuuinjutsu played out. Now it was time to use it in various methods in the hopes the solution would high-light itself in his through his actions. He would begin by imbuing the tags with his chakra, with the jutsu formulas carefully inscribed into it's surface he places the five-tags on various surfaces - or to be more precise he'd place them onto buildings.

The purpose of this was to localize where this test would take place. But it was just that, a test. Of course the first attempt ended in failure, the barrier never took effect at all. Something was obviously wrong with the initialization phase of the jutsu. <Damn it..> Failure of course would not stop him from trying again, he would once more turn to the scroll and see where he had made his first mistake.

<I'm on my way to perfecting this...> He thinks to himself, and he did still show no signs of slowing down. "I'm almost done. It shouldn't be much longer." He glances in the Mizukage-direction showing that a minor failure wasn't enough to stop him. "There are a few mistakes on how I was crafting the formulas but it's not nearly enough to put a stop to me." He smiles softly, show-casing the fact that he took his errors lightly, and it wasn't something that bothered him. This didn't show a lack of seriousness on his part, moreover that he understood that failures were bound to happen so he prepared for it and simply brushed it off, trying again in the hopes it would be better.* - Mon Nov 16 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Come on..> Now he was truly starting to understand the difficulty that came with this technique. It wasnt something that you could just skim through at his level and have even a novice level of understanding. Eiyu had devoted a large portion of his time -in- Fuuinjutsu, and he hadn't even reached the surface on what it could do. When he glanced at techniques like this it reminded him why he became what he is today.

Why he was on the constant search of answers in a world that left him with nothing but questions. Inquiry was very important, and it was something not everyone had the curisoity for. But for those who did, another layer of this world would come to frutition. The knowledge that was around him was surely something to take advantage of, and he would do so. He would read all he could, and learn as much as possible so he could design his own Fuuinjutsu. 

But for now it sufficed to learning this simplistic technique. It would suffice to learn one measly aspect of Barrier Fuuinjutsu. There had to be a way to solve this... He had to end Ortho's crusade on Kirigakure, and this was the first step, he would answer back with an intelligent response, not one of force. He would see if the male was able to figure out the seal, because with each second his understanding of five barrier seal was growing.* - Mon Nov 16 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: So, Mizukage-Sama... - Mon Nov 16 15:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Yeah, I hear you. - Mon Nov 16 15:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) works methodically to imprint his seals on the manor. One tag to the west, another to the east, one south, and another hidden behind the vending device at the front. The Fuuinjutsu barrier is active, Eiyu formulates the seals needed to protect the front!* - Mon Nov 16 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Sigh." Eiyu bites the pad of his forefinger, letting the blood flow to the floor. He calmly drags his bloodied index and streaks it across his palm. When he formulates several handseals he makes sure to partition his chakra properly. Though, to be honest at least in Eiyu's case he didn't need to wory about wasting chakra, his pools was vast.

"Kuchiyose.."
'What can I do for you today, Uie-San? Nyah! Sike, I'm not doing a damn thing..'

"Baka... What did I tell you about using foul language in the presence of company.."

'Oi, oi! I'm going to tell pops on you.. You shouldn't have ever called me stupid!' "Listen, I need a favor from you, can you just make your rounds around the village, tell me what you find."

From there he glances at the Mizukage. "Hmm, this may be in due time, but I had a favor to ask of you, Mizukage-Sama."* - Mon Nov 16 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmm.. I don't mind at all. - Mon Nov 16 16:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Let me see your index finger. - Mon Nov 16 17:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) reaches for a Kunai in his back-pouch, and then if allowed cuts into the pad of Liu's forefinger. He extends the contract forth, inches away from his hand.

"I will trust you, as you've trusted me.. But do not abuse them, or hurt them.. Or I will catch hell, it will be in the end... That is all I ask, and considering you've signed this here contract that makes us even, no? I will continue to serve Kirigakure, as well as your command. But this gesture is in good faith.. Sign your name in blood."* - Mon Nov 16 17:03:08 2015

"Every-single time." Eiyu's eyes darken as he thinks back to that eventful evening. There was a strange calm that followed the day, birds chirpped harmoniously. Men and women went about their normal routine of buying and selling merchandise.

Then everything stopped. "Hn..." Eiyu tried to push away what happened out of his mind, the exact response of the shinobi, and other happenings but all of it was in vain. 

<So much killing... So much death..>

There was a myth when you killed so many people in one sitting the sky would rain blood. Edge confirmed all of that to be true with his massive explosions, hell, even Kenshin had did a number on the foundation of Kumogakure. 

"Sigh.. The male struggles with his thoughts everyday. <If only I had been a little faster, or.. If I had been a little stronger...> Wishful thinking for someone who was light-years away from most when it came to obtaining power. "I don't think anymore Kumogakure shinobi need die anymore, Haku...."

He slices deep into the pad of his index finger, draws the blood through the front of his palm and forms handseals, the extension of chakra through blood causing the rift of time and space to open releasing the frog known as Uie from its home.

His left hand rests smugly on his waist, housed on his belt were a series of crimson scrolls. Ironically enough, almost all of these scrolls were labeled with a Lotus flower on the exterior, and the one's at his back were normal, and black in coloring.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Eh, my mastery with this sort of thing is really, really, really good..> Eiyu thought it best to give another go to the summoning technique. The Minatabi bites into the pad of his forefinger letting the blood well on the tip, from there he brings the bloodied finger through his open palm. Hand-seals were woven in rapid succession.

"Kuchiyose No Jutsu!" 
He slams his hands on the ground, expecting to see Uie, but this time it seemed as if he had summoned a distant relative. "Nani!? What is this!?" The Oragne splotched Toad looked at Eiyu for the first time, a snot-bubble protruding from it's snout region.

'Oi, Oi.. Old man, do you have any snacks.'
"Baka!!!!!!!! What makes you think I summoned you to eat?"
'Well, if youre going to be like that, I'll just go..'* - Tue Nov 17 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Right.. Let's try this one more time..!" Eiyu's hand was still bleeding so it was perfect for what he needed to. "I don't know what to expect.. What will I summon!? Who knows!? Hopefully, it's someone cool.. Nyahhhhhhh!!!!!!" Eiyu's hands cross, fingers weaving several shapes in a blink of an eye. "Reveal yourself to me, SUMMONING JUTSU!"

"Oh, it's just you..."
Of course he summoned Uie, the average looking frog with black speckles decorating it's trunk. 'What do you mean, just me?! You don't know how valuable I truly am, do you? Well, I'll tell you something.. Im very freakin valuable, Eiyu-San.. Without me.. You'd be nothing, just don't forget it..'

"You know what? Oh, okay.. The next time when I'm in a giant scuffle I'll take the time to summon you.. 'Oh, woah, woah, and woah.. Let's not get carried away here, Eiyu.. On a serious note, I suggest you do get better so my other family members can help you out, right now you're pasty, and weak. You need to get stronger... Just a little suggestion..'

"Baka! Don't you think I know that? Isn't that what I'm doing?!"
'Yeah, I guess.. Just hurry it up, will ya?'
Eiyu's right brow twitched, and the rest of his body followed suit. 
"I know what I'm doing, Uie-San...."
He dismissed the troublesome creature.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: I think these Toads are turning me into a dork. - Tue Nov 17 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Er, even though I can use basic sealing I still only have a novice level understanding of it.. It's time to up the ante.> Eiyu was very familiar with sealing a small number of weapons into scrolls for use later. Hell, he had already done so with the Lotus sealing formation. Things were not always easy coming to him however, despite his efforts, and his intelligence he could be fairly clumsy. Even when he was trying his upmost to be serious.

"Let's get this underway." He begins to open a regular looking scroll, and then reaches for a standard Kunai. One tool at a time is sealed into the mass of parchment, and then he imprints his chakra through and through, imbuing it with a Lotus seal, and placing even more weapons into it's folds.* - Tue Nov 17 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Bored...> Eiyu showed signs of losing motivation already. Basic Sealing was such a generic technique that he thought himself above. It was kind of idiotic in a way, this very basic technique enabled him to venture into other topics and expand his knowledge. His ignorance would be stifled once he moved onto other things, but for now he found himself yawning while infusing weapons into the scroll.

He catches himself nodding off every so often. However he wasnt going to let a minor pit-fall such as sleep disturb his training. He had come a long way in such a short period of time, and didn't want to see all of his progress to go to waste. There was just so much he hadn't yet done, or seen. Perhaps after mastering basic sealing, and then lotus sealing he would move onto more advanced topics such as body sealing. The process of placing seals on organic flesh, such a thought amused him to his core, but he couldnt think of any of that now. * - Tue Nov 17 18:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can wait outside. - Tue Nov 17 19:05:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Whichever you want. - Tue Nov 17 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Right." Eiyu didn't really show any signs of distress or anything like that. He expected to get turned away, if anything it was Sunagakure's way of saying he didn't matter. That and the condition of his village as well, he had come to terms with the dejection of his people by their hand already. He had dialogue with Hassan once before. It was talk of how something would come in the form of a representative, but no-one came. 

Of course in a village were missions were not regulated it produced stagnation. Men could never be two places at once, this left a rift in their leadership. Of course the condition of the village began to suffer. You could occupy a nation, but when you did nothing but 'protect' it's occupants you were bound to cause it's descension. 

Whether Sunagakure knew it or not, Kumogakure was dying. This frustrating fact made the male cement his resolve, and stay put, he didn't intend on leaving any-time soon. 

"Thank you for your help.. I know it's odd speaking to an adult as a child trying to come in, but you did well considering." He'd offer a smile towards the lad, but all he felt was a sense of over-bearing frustration.

<If anything.. I can at least have Uie look around...> He looks at his hand, and then the child, then at the shinobi, well, once I get some distance..>* - Tue Nov 17 19:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: ..Ugh, I guess it's too much to hope for a Sonoran..  - Tue Nov 17 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <That outta be far enough.> Eiyu bites the pad of his forefinger, blood trickling on the hot, and imposing sun. He streaks the appendage through his open palm, and then formulates handseals. 

"Kuchiyose." 
"Well... My luck isn't all bad today." Just what he wanted, a Sonoran-Toad is pulled through time a space, this creature was native to the desert region, and wouldn't attract too much attention.

'Eh, what is it?'

"Can you do be a favor and check out the interior of Sunagakure? Just like so I know how things are going.. I want to know if Hassan is avoiding me.. I don't know much about what people over there look like but any help would be welcome."

'Sure, fine..' The Toad bellows before slipping away, it's powerful legs shooting it nigh above the sky-line.* - Tue Nov 17 19:18:24 2015
