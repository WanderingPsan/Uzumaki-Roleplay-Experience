Small actions set Mariana off, and the calmer side of him would have to take over. He was thankful he didn't have a temper like her's or else it would make for a most heated exchange. "Listen.."

His right hand paces his scalp, the black curls ruffling against his scalp.

Some would simply descend onto the floor, only to whisk their presence away once he took a step forward, his focus was now upon Violet, his Sharingan's illumination casting a deadly haze over the orange haired heroine. 

"It is taking great restraint for me to forget what you and Tethys did to me back in Konoha..

It bordered vehemence.


"Kirigakure has a horrible track-record of protecting anything. In my eyes they are bunch of failures - the only reason why they did not fall was because of this Kakei I've heard of.  Kenshin as well."

For all the pain I had been delt, I will claim or take what puts me at ease, for the pride I strived for to see from my father. That goal, that I never acheived because of this world. I will claim one far superior than that. I will claim; No. I am owed all of these things, and I will earn acknowledgement that I had never been given. Regardless of what kind it is. - Fri Sep 25 08:49:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) clasped his hands together into a string of various handsigns, after collecting the alloted amount of chakra he forms a ring overh is mouth and forces the super-heated mixture through his lips. The massive-fire ball took on the shape of a gaping Dragon's maw, it pushed the air currents out of the way and set anything else in it's path ablaze. It continued to fly off into the distance getting smaller by the second. He wipes his mouth with his wrist, the taste of ash hot on his tongue.

"It's still not yet perfect."* - Fri Sep 25 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) forms several handseals in a span of a few seconds. While he was going through the motions he carefully kneads the chakra inside of his gullet, pulling and expanding it's over-all consistency. When it was refined to it's highest density possible he forms a ring over his maw and forces a stream of highly combustible flame into a nearby tree-stump. The exterior of the tree ignites, and the surrounding leaves and bark was quite literally blown away in an instant. This was something to be expected, Ushinawa's mastery over said technique was growing rapidly.* - Fri Sep 25 15:46:20 2015
