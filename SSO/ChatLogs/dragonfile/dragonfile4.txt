<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) the tomoe in his eyes spin in a counterclock-wise motion while the white of his eyes change into a crimson composition. His visual prowess was at a level where he could grasp the minds of others with a simple glance. It was viable in doing so in close quarters, but in order to truly come into his own with this technique he'd need to push himself to the limit. Villagers who happened to walk by were exploited in an instant, his gaze eventually lulling them into a false sense of security before they crashed to the ground.

Ushinawa was no pushover at this point anymore. Day and night he sought to extract information with a single glance, he learned many things from the people who he had entrapped. To make matters all the more grand people simply were not aware of the extent at which he was able to snare them. They often woke up with no memory of the incident at all. It was ironic that someone like Beth who spent all of her time using Genjutsu would never reach this level.* - Mon Sep 14 12:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) wasn't finished here, he needed more time in order to increase the strength of his Sharingan. More people vanished by the day, their memories fuzzy, and the events leading up to their capture were simply gone. It simply took one glance, and eye-contact by him and it would seal their fate. He even noted his ability to project fake sensations against the user. Much like a battle that was being played out he could manipulate several factors like having the user think they were truly fighting in but in reality they hadn't moved an inch. It was this sort of latent ability that made him so dangerous and he was only starting to realize that now.

There was still the problem that the other nations knew he had the Sharingan but they knew next to nothing about its true origin. They knew nothing of how it was able to sway hearts and freeze the hearts and minds of it's victims in but a few seconds. They knew nothing of the darkness that was bred through his actions and led to his hatred increasing. So many of his kin had been hunted for something the shinobi world simply didn't understand. He was figuring out it was for good reason that they had done so, his people were different from others and his Sharingan was certainly one of the main sources of his power, and the funny thing about that was he was sure he had only reached  the tip of the iceberg.* - Mon Sep 14 12:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) |<Hm, the strain on my eyes....> Ushinawa's orbs flutter open revealing the pattern in his eyes. The Sharingan was a double edged sword not only draining chakra but also stamina. He had to be careful when using it or he would wipe himself out on two fronts, it was viable to train his physical being because it was only a matter of time before he'd truly be stressed to the limit. Still, just be testing his Sharingan this much he was able to train himself properly against what was to come which would be a most difficult situation.* - Mon Sep 14 12:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) looks about the field, his eyes slowly pivoting onto Zenkai. He comes to the realization as to what just happened. He folds his arms over his chest while looking ahead. "Unfortunate."* - Mon Sep 14 14:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: So now we play the waiting game. - Mon Sep 14 14:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He used to talk about making the world a better place. Then he did that. - Mon Sep 14 14:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) eyes casually shift onto Zenkai, he makes eye-contact with her momentarily, but it was most likely she wouldn't see that. Then, he observes her hand descend to the boy's scalp. This innocent gesture pieced together another part of a puzzle but so many pieces were not yet fit into their respective holders. He had so many questions about so many people and found that he couldn't ask them anything. 

He was still on the outside looking in and to be honest that was something that didn't bother him in the slightest.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'm okay. I'm trying to learn something, how are you feeling, Aunt Zenaki? - Mon Sep 14 15:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) envisoned many things about the outcome of the war. He knew that it would change the face of the shinobi world, and that the victors would decide in what form it would exist in. Tethys no doubt returned to his home as a hero for returning the lost artifact,  but Ushinawa was the only one who knew of its true origin and where it deserved to rest. 

Flashback of their snide remarks and sayings of belonging was nothing more than flippancy. It went without saying that not only was losing the blade their fault, but also they were to blame for Yusei's descent into darkness. But now things had certainly changed, he could see their destruction looming on the horizon. Those chants of praise and admiration would turn into wails of agony. One could argue that the loss of life was something that he should've worried about but in all honesty it didn't disturb him in the slightest. Kirigakure killed their own shinobi for having special traits and it was assumed their value of life was next to none....

Much like Niklaus they would need to be put down. Nothing felt right anymore, the shaders of black and white were now all gray. He was no longer seeing in color, his clarity wasn't defined anymore, there was only one color within the spectrum that he saw now, and that was red...

Yes, day by day his hatred only grew stronger, and his aura colder and colder. * - Mon Sep 14 15:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) felt the tension building which promptly snapped him out of his mental soujurn. Zetsumo didn't take people lightly and especially now since they had begun fighting, it was obvious that he'd demand absolute compliance. 

His onyx gaze rests upon Zetsumo at this point. "He's speaking to you... But to destroy any amounts of suspicion she is a fellow comrade of mine who would do well to test her hand in battle should you find use of that in your fighting force." 

Despite Ushinawas statement there were lingering similarities of their facial features, but it was obvious she favored Misa over the male in that respect.* - Mon Sep 14 15:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Crap.. - Mon Sep 14 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Is this all a ploy? People only use the basic skills when they have nothing else up their sleeves. - Mon Sep 14 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at the both of them in battle but makes no move. <Hmmm.. You have...Improved...> He wonders if Zetsumo would be impressed by the display, hopefully he was. Ushinawa hoped this was the case because he remembered Zetsumo wanted to spar him as well, and if it came to that he'd be forced to show-case his ability, lest he be deemed worthless and cut off, literally.
"I will help you get stronger.." , he mutters softly.* - Mon Sep 14 17:04:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mmm...Maybe. - Mon Sep 14 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) recognized the jutsu Hideki was currently using and begun to form the respective seals as well. What Hideki found was not only was Ushinawa fast, he was capable of striking him whilst moving at this speed. But alas, he sticks to the over-all premise of this battle being hinted towards Ninjutsu, so, when he unleashes his own torrent of lightning it expands in a way that was sure to make him very uncomfortable, oh, and as for the explosive tag Ushinawa was already on the move before it began.* - Mon Sep 14 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: such tenacity.. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: much lightning. - Mon Sep 14 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) thinks: wow. - Mon Sep 14 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) there was one thing about using Shunshin in combat, and that is there was always a delay in using it after. Because of this Hideki's actions worked against him because the time it took him to do all of those things Ushinawa formed a single seal allowing for a circular inferno to spawn around him, had he truly wished to use this tactic he'd find that he was his own worst enemy in terms of the explosive tag going off in his face.* - Mon Sep 14 19:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: That's his fire. - Mon Sep 14 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Will you teach me Alpha? - Mon Sep 14 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I know the basic Ninja art jutsus. - Mon Sep 14 19:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But I am no means proficient when it comes to the element. - Mon Sep 14 19:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I need to go and train. - Mon Sep 14 19:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) anticipated his opponents next move as the lightning crackled towards his position, it was able to part his barrier partially as he aimed to tear through the front. However, Ushinawa wanted to see how he would fair if he increased the over all intensity of this training exercise. He quickly accelerates to the side whilst forming handseals obviously reading where the lightning balls destination was, from there he unleashed an orb fire from his flank, however it would crash -into- the ground and would ignite near his general vicinity..

He wasn't trying to kill.* - Mon Sep 14 19:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) didn't understand why Hideki would run -into- the flames, even with the effect of the smoke-screen he was liable to get himself fucked over. It was also because of this he probably wouldnt be subtle about using the smoke-screen to his advantage, also there was another reason because the Sharingan had a sort of glow to it, one Ushinawa could identify. 

Quickly, he'd bring his blades into his hand in the attempt to slam the base into opposite sides of his head in the attempt to knock him out and hopefully deactivate his Sharingan.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But all I can think about is the possibility I'll get stuck in genjutsu. . . - Tue Sep 15 11:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Kinda isn't good enough, you must be determined. - Tue Sep 15 11:36:57 2015

He makes his way to the weapon vender making it obvious that he intended to purchase wares.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) allowed his crimson hemispheres to open once more, the pattern of his Sharingan fluttering vivdly, the illumination of his gaze catching the notice of onlookers who simply collapsed at his feet. Others had hellish nightmares of profound proportions and none of them could remember any of it. Hirusho found the minds of lesser citizens repulsive, he stopped picking on vagabonds in the streets and evolved into thugs, and thugs into low-level shinobi. Posts were seemingly left obscured, talk of a man who was able to strip away will at an instant were whispered. Though, it was only a rumor as to what the origin of this was. 

Still, it helped Ushinawa develop his Visual prowess towards an inhuman level. He was starting to truly realize the strength of this ability and how to manipulate others with it. Those around him knew next to little of his true prowess and it only made him that much stronger. Still, people had seen him use the Sharingan before but they had no idea what it did, and neither did he until he ventured into the deepest, and darkest corners of his mind searching for every iota o information that came his way.....
