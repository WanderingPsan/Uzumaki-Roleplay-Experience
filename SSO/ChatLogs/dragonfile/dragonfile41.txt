<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) glances at Kai knowing good and well why she intended to avoid Kumogakure. Sadly over this period of time the male had become all the more distrusting - more than likely due to the fact most of his fighting force consisted of shinobi who once claimed alliegance, but then did whatever they wanted to. Yet in the end they always returned 'home' when it became a necessity.

"You are free. Do what you will."

It seems that he had the affinity for multi-tasking in various scenarios, though, for the time being he half expected to find the lady to speak up but she had remained stagnant for a fixed duration of time leaving Eiyu with the impression she was currently preoccupited with her thoughts.* - Mon Dec  7 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) lunges over the table - both of his extending to grab hold of her collar if she allowed it. The fabric around her torso begins to bulge as the Raikage of Kumogakure pulls her inward so that they are staring eye to eye - his icy gaze penetrating deep into her soul.

"I understand, Kari-Chan. But what would have me do!? You have no idea of the precarious situation I am. You have no idea what's at stake! I don't want there to be a repeat in which our entire nation is destroyed and we work from the ground up. It's me this.. Me that. The Raikage's fault, he doesn't me... He betrayed me.." 

"You dont get a second chance if you fuck up, Kari-Chan...! I'm trying to help you... I am trying to help Kumogakure....." He releases his hold either way.* - Mon Dec  7 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) kept his hold on her. "Forgive me, but if what you say is to be true allow me to do so."* - Mon Dec  7 23:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) begins to form a series of handseals before Kari, when this performance was over he aimed to entice her mind to get her to relay information about her past.

"Tell me everything about Ichiro and his faction, what has he been hiding? What do they have you do?"* - Mon Dec  7 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <I see.. So she was telling the truth...Or perhaps... Hmmm..> "Tell me this, are you loyal to Kumogakure, or your brother, and what do you think of the Raikage himself, do you wish to harm me? Do you resent me? Hate me?"* - Mon Dec  7 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Forgive me, Kari-Chan...> Most of what Eiyu was attempting to extract was for the benefit of Kumogakure, and he had gotten all the answers he required, but now he was just being selfish. He wanted to know how Kari felt - and while this probably wasn't the best way to go about it had deemed that he had no choice. He upholds the jutsu attempting to draw it out as long as he could. <Not much longer now...> He holds it, much to her distress, and his. "Tell me, Kari....."* - Mon Dec  7 23:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <So she is loyal, I must say I didn't expect this at all.> Eiyu's hand deforms now, no longer holding the seal in question. His arms drop to his sides, his blue eyes scanning the Fuuinjutsu formulas on his desk, and while he tried to give the impression nothing happened he could not. 

It was like he was frozen in his own state of mind.
"Forgive me."* - Mon Dec  7 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"I'm sorry..."  He watches her crumble to the ground. Haku's advance went unnoticed up until the time he gripped his shoulder. "I can tell you right now that wasn't my sole intention. But I don't think you should judge me so freely, Haku-San."

Eiyu shakes his head knowing full well Kariudo might be enraged.* - Tue Dec  8 00:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) nods softly. "The interrogation is over." The male had ventured into the depths of her mind, a place that he had no place being, although he was able to catch a glimpse from someone who gave him great difficulty reading. 

"Everything is in order.. Kari-.Chan.. Erm.." His right hand adjusts the headband slung over his head.* - Tue Dec  8 00:58:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) formulates several handseals within a period of a few seconds. But not before biting into the pad of his forefinger - when all was said and done he transfers his palm on the ground letting a massive plum of smoke to arise in his stead. Though, once the smoke begins to depart a massive frog with horns mounted atop it's blood-orange had, and slitted irises observes the male before him. His massive body bearing the scars from it's trials and tribulations, and in reality Eiyu's head had to ascend to simply observe it's entirety.

"Did you summon me again... Hmph, I am so ungraceful...." He looks at the Minatabi with a critical eye. "But you seem to be unfit to even summon me, tell me why you've brought me here."* - Tue Dec  8 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) forces his foot to ascend so that he was able to scale the beasts form, and it didn't seem to mind all that much. "What are you doing?" "Well, I need to speak to you." When Eiyu was standing on it's crown he out-stretches his arm to expose the massive splendor of Kumogakure in all of it's beauty. Now, at this moment in time it was looking as if the restoration process was in full force. Buildings that were destroyed in the past were now repaired, and the wounds that Edge left in his wake were starting to heal.

"This is my home, Mr.Gamaken... My people who I wish to protect, and by inheritance whom I wish for you to protect, because these people need me as much as I need you.... Please..."

"But why? You humans are ungraceful creatues with excessive violence."* - Tue Dec  8 01:44:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Men and women begin to file in. The massive construct was hidden by long drapes. The Raikage of Kumogakure wore all black - a sign to show that he was grieving for all of those who had been lost. There was a moment of silence wherein not a single soul of Kumogakure spoke. 

Then, the fabric was pulled away from the structure to reveal a -giant- crimson memorial stone bearing the name of all of the shinobi who had been killed and recorded as Kia, as well as shinobi who went Mia - The Yondaime wasn't mentioned at all.

Lastly, the Raikage spoke. Now adorning his sartorial robes of elegance. 

This speech would determine the fate for the rest of his people.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) ||It wouldn't be hidden any longer - over the loud speaker Eiyu spoke, his voice magnified by the loud-speakers indicating the message to be spread throughout the masses. "I call on all of you here today because I am bearing a message. I know Sunagakure occupies these lands but it won't be for much longer, I know they are here to protect, but we are now at the point where I am confident in our abilities, and thanks to the joint effort of our allies in Konohagakure working together I can finally say it's about time Kumogakure become an independent nation."

"It is what I, Minatabi, Eiyu planned to do from the start, and while this may cause tensions to flare from the outside world I want you to know nothing will stop me from this goal of mine. I swear it."

Yes, the Raikage had openly voiced his desire to seperate from Sunagakure, and it would happen within these span of years. Word would begin to spread like wildfire, how would the surrounding nations take it?* - Tue Dec  8 02:06:17 2015

Sunagakure shinobi could pop off at any moment - it had been several months since he had gotten a response. Perhaps Sunagakure truly didn't care about Kumogakure? Or rather, their intentions were good and not shadowed by ulterior motives. But if that was the case why did they remain? It was starting to feel like an annexation more, and more.

<I don't wish to do this... But I will give them a little longer before I scare them out of Kumogakure...>

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) bites his forefinger and performs a series of handseals.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Dragonfile) ||The civil unrest begins to stir in Kumogakure, at this point it wouldn't even matter if Eiyu was taken down or not. The people's will was strong, and would not be destroyed by the likes of these shinobi, and in this state of rapid recovery it was assumed that Kumogakure's armed forces were existant, though their numbers were not vast. One year would not be enough to reclaim what they had lost over the years but it was a start. 

Eiyu is adorned in his robes. Loyalists of Kumogakure stand at his sides. Kumogakure is booming once again - and it's voice spoke of change. Would the rest of the world listen? Or would it forsake them once again?

<For now, we must do what we can.>

"Send men to do patrols around the border, if people approach Kumogakure I want to know before they know I'm here."

Eiyu slashes his hand, blood dripping from the appendage as he works to formulate handseals - after pressing his palm against the surface a massive Frog arises. 

"Oh, you finally got it?  Say, Mr.Gamaken. I could really use your help? I dont know, for I am very ungraceful. "I'll need you anyway, please... I wouldn't summon you if it wasn't essential.. I will think about it."* - Tue Dec  8 07:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Eiyu was well aware of the consequences of it's protest, but alas the Raikage would not waver. "Do not let their words sway your hearts. It is true that Kumogakure was run by Sunagakure for the longest, but who was it that helped Sunagakure when it was sundered by the very force that destroyed us? Yes, the Land Of Wind, as they like to continue on about how much this has all been for benevolence have forgotten where they have came from. Where they have begged support, and support was given. I've read the archives read by Chiyari, and it is quite surprising. What we're dealing with is not a nation ruled by benevolence, but one hypocrisy. Hideki would turn over in his grave, but alas do not falter because we want no help. We do not want their influence, the surrounding villages think this is my doing, but it is not. Show them that you will not bend at the knee, and that our will is unified. Do not forget that they were once in the position we were, but now that favor is on their side....... They wish to impose their will, but I telll you this much. If we shall suffer I shall be the first one to accept the pain and endure, and if we fight I will be the one who dies on the battlefield. Brothers, sisters....."

"For Kumogakure."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"You can try and kill me, but I will simply become a martyr. This is only the beginning, Sunagakure." Thus begins the planning of the Raikage who anticipated this - but he had to admit hindsight was twenty twenty, if he had only remembered to do this early none of this would be happening. Some would say this action wasn't warranted but alas it was.

"Begin construction of the dome." Thus the construct was in the process of being built, and thus Eiyu had an ingenious idea. Though, it was easy for an enemy to anticipate an attack coming from below - how would one come from the air? It was a most interesting development and so he speaks to the regular deniziens of how connecting innocuous looking tags to carrier pidgeons in the number of one thousand, yes, the Raikage would deal with sealing the proper proportions as he was adjusted to Fuuinjutsu, and had vast chakra pools, though even he couldnt do this all at once so he has his locak villagers help with it's construction, it would be perched from a distant location.* - Tue Dec  8 08:07:15 2015
