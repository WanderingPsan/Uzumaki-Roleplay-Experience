"This is Kage-Bunshin No Jutsu, it allows the user to summon a clone that is able to use all elemental techniques, as well as any other jutsu's you may know.

This wasn't the only time the child had been known to get into sticky situations, and given his insanity it surely wouldn't have been the last. Eiyu manages to hug her from behind, but like all gentlemen, his reach was neutral, coming to wrap over her shoulders, before spinning her in his direction if she allowed it.

He drew his mouth close to her ear as a means to whisper after getting some distance.

<What is that?> "I didn't know you were one for body art, Eri-Chan." He'd state casually.* - Tue Nov 24 00:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Enough..." Eiyu snaps his fingers and has the child escorted. He turns to the Uchiha, they seemed to be a quiet lot, who kept to themselves unless they were provoked. The child was lucky that Ortho wasn't here or else it would spell a fate worse than he could expect, but as the Raikage he would be forced to disallow the Uchiha the chance to do so, or at least try.

The childs idiocy was starting to become a liability.

"Do not insult our guests." Eiyu nods, and walks forth. "There is no need for violence either. Simmer down."* - Tue Nov 24 01:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Interesting. - Tue Nov 24 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm telling you this in good faith, should the time arise where you find yourself in trouble due to his crusade. - Tue Nov 24 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You will be informed a little of his techniques. - Tue Nov 24 15:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But he is too powerful currently.. - Tue Nov 24 15:27:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I wouldn't underestimate them. Heiwa is the Captain of the Genjutsu, and Fuuinjutsu team. - Tue Nov 24 15:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Though, it is unfortunate that I was his Sensei in regards to Fuuinjutsu. - Tue Nov 24 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Then he turns around and stabs me in the back. - Tue Nov 24 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Kirigakure has betrayed the Land Of Clouds. - Tue Nov 24 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: They send their men to kill me, and they've failed. - Tue Nov 24 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I see... - Tue Nov 24 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Their children are lethal. - Tue Nov 24 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I assumed this Heiwa had some power, seeing as he was given the rank of Special Jounin when I was there. - Tue Nov 24 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: But Genjutsu... - Tue Nov 24 15:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: If you look at the triggers for his Genjutsu. - Tue Nov 24 15:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: You will be finished. - Tue Nov 24 15:36:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I've only seen two of the other in combat. - Tue Nov 24 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The red head-female, and the other girl. Their abilities are unknown, but if they are anything li-.. Hm, what were they able to do? - Tue Nov 24 15:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: One chose only to use a tanto--I have a feeling she is incapable of jutsu usage---and the other...I assume you've heard the name Baen before? - Tue Nov 24 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm afraid I haven't. - Tue Nov 24 15:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Ah. - Tue Nov 24 15:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Incredibly durable compared to the average shinobi. - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Manipulated . . .His bones? - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Indeed. - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Which child?  - Tue Nov 24 15:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I only recall him having white hair. - Tue Nov 24 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: White hair.. - Tue Nov 24 15:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: The shinoi of Kumogakure cannot afford to slack off. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Kirigakure is only getting stronger. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Thank you for this information. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Was there anything else you required? - Tue Nov 24 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see. Then let us return to our respective positions. I'm going to go train now. - Tue Nov 24 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) shunsins into the wall and dies.* - Tue Nov 24 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) reaches for the collection that he had obtained over recent years. There were various techniques that the young male hadn't yet studied. This was for many reasons, namely the fact that time hadn't been on his side, and due to his lack of elemental mastery over Doton it made things very difficult as well as time consuming. But while he had these few seconds to himself he thought it best to do something.* - Tue Nov 24 15:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <I'm smarter than I thought.> Eiyu places hiding like a mole into it's respective pocket on his waist-band. He had mastered the technique quickly, but he hadn't moved onto the next jutsu which is what he had intended to do. <Hmmm> The user conjures a river of mud beneath the feet of it's opponent. If a person employs water style to the mud it becomes even stronger. <Hm..> Interesting.

He practices the concepts until he is able to get a better understanding of how to manipulate his chakra properly.* - Tue Nov 24 15:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) turns slowly, both of his eyes widen, a look of confus-. He was going to respond, however that is before a bird perched on his shoulder.
 "One second. Supaiku." He'd mutter before forming a single seal, a clone manifests, he'd take the message from the bird and moves some way abit from the village before opening.* - Tue Nov 24 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Sake would be nice. - Tue Nov 24 17:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I suppose I will be very busy shortly.. I wonder what will happen... - Tue Nov 24 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: Why is the Mizukage attempting to speak to me now? - Tue Nov 24 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Do you want me to join you maybe? - Tue Nov 24 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) repeats the same process of having his clone read, and write.* - Tue Nov 24 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 24 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I wont be leaving Kumogakure... It'll probably just .. - Tue Nov 24 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Have our troops on high alert for a period of time. - Tue Nov 24 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn, you wanna talk about it over sake? - Tue Nov 24 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This no training bit sucks. - Tue Nov 24 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Guess it doesn't matter though, who needs to train when you are gonna die? - Tue Nov 24 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) seems to be a little upset by the response.
"Hmm." 

<There's no way to confirm...This...>
Eiyu promptly writes a message in response to the Mizukage.
To Supaiku he responds with.
"Of course. Provided everything will be okay."
It didn't take a genius to understand what he was insinuating.* - Tue Nov 24 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) quirked a brow. He did feel as if Supaiku was acting strange, but he suspected it was for good reason. "Eiji, don't forget your missions." He'd mutter before making his way to the shop.

"When you're done, return."
It wouldn't be Eiyu if he didnt act as if he was scolding him due to the circumstances of his previous mission.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Before they could do anything Eiyu reaches across the table and reaches for a glass of water. He takes a sip. "What's going on?" He inquires bluntly.* - Tue Nov 24 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can tell something is off... - Tue Nov 24 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm concerned. - Tue Nov 24 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 's eyes widen. "What do you mean, die? His heart began to race like lightning beating across the horizon. 

He reaches for her shoulder, his warm hand descending, digits curling inward, she would feel his distress upon hearing this.

"What's going on?"* - Tue Nov 24 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"No.." Eiyu was determined to see Edge fail. "Supaiku, please tell me everything. What do you mean seal you with a curse? - He sealed off your chakra as well?" 

<If this is Fuuinjutsu, he's using a superior method of sealing. The likes of which stump my knowlede.. But Kumogakure has resources... Hopefully..> 

"Explain what kind of curse this is.... What did he do?"* - Tue Nov 24 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: You can't give up.. Must I remind of the child in your stomach? - Tue Nov 24 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: It was a type of fuuinjutsu... Ortho couldn't read it. - Tue Nov 24 18:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looks away momentarily. "...I don't know what's going on... But I need you to talk to me - Wait, let me see... Let me see your seal." Eiyu leans a bit closer, his eyes widen as he looks for anything that could possibly aid his efforts.* - Tue Nov 24 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) sighs heavily. "The pattern is too complex.... Edge is a genius... I haven't seen anything like this..." His voice is solemn. "Is Edge coming here to kill you? Or is it that the seal is designed to do you in...?" 

<Perhaps if I could... Converse with the others... But I haven't even been able to summon them, and I doubt they are all too versed with Fuuinjutsu anyway.

Eiyu shakes his head.
"The only people who I know might be capable of such a feat live in Sunagakure... If any of them are actually able to do so..."* - Tue Nov 24 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I think they will.. Provided we give them proper incentive... - Tue Nov 24 18:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: You were busy.... - Tue Nov 24 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I tried to tell you when I arrived three days ago. - Tue Nov 24 18:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) the glass in his hands explode. The sharpnel cuts into his palm, blood descends  and runs down his wrist.

"No......"* - Tue Nov 24 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I wasn't busy! - Tue Nov 24 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I'm sorry...... - Tue Nov 24 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) picks the pieces out of his palm and wraps it with a bandage. He looks away from Eri, his eyes resting on the table at hand. He couldn't even maintain eye-contact, he was the Raikage yet he couldn't save her from dying. It seemed only Edge was capable of such a feat.

"If he did come, and broke the seal. The instance he does so I will be forced to fight him on principle...He's done so much evil in the world, and I just can't forgive him for that.... If you are to die today..." He looks on helplessly.

"I will not leave your side... That is until Ortho arrives.. When he arrives..."* - Tue Nov 24 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"*Sigh*... He killed my people, and forced them into poverty. Made a laughing stock of this nation by forcing the Yondaime to flee for her life, and has commied all sorts of evil."

"I vehemently despise him, but I really want answers from him. Why is he doing this?! What does he hope to prove.. Supaiku..!" 

He is forced to lower his voice, as he was getting the attention of onlookers. "There was to be a way... I can't..-..." He cuts himself off.

There is a pause.
"I can't lose a friend like this, unable to do anything....Why would Ortho trust Edge? He will probably kill him, or do what he did to you to him and force him into being a slave.... There has to be something we can do."* - Tue Nov 24 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 's head lowers, the lines around his eyes darken. Edge was so powerful he had done away with Ortho in a manner of seconds, and then sealed Eri's chaka away. "Do you know where Edge is located?"

He knew better than to storm his homestead with a group of shinobi. He knew what he was doing was foolish if Eri gave him an answer, but he say little else. What other choice did he have? 

"I wish to confront this man."* - Tue Nov 24 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) shakes his head. "I will never give up on you, Supaiku." There was a fierce glow of determination on his eyes, the likes of which were rarely shown behind his indifferent face.

"I will not take no for an answer... There is no such thing as fate, and if there is we're going to change it." He reaches for the girls collar, bringing her inward if she allowed so that their foreheads touched, and she'd be able to look deep into his stormy blue eyes.

"Let me help you. I will do what I can..."* - Tue Nov 24 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) releases his hold, his head motions away. "I-.. I'm sorry.. I didn't mean to offend you.." He was obviously on the defensive." I - .. I just want you to realize that I'm here to help, and I wouldn't do anything like that. I respect you and Ortho too well to try anything like that. But I will do what I can, but it's going to be very dangerous on my behalf.."

<It just so happens that I have a plan...> "Do you know where he is stationed, at all?"* - Tue Nov 24 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) turned red with embarrassment. It had obviously been a long time since anyones tone had been that way with him. It was like clockwork, his right hand scratches the back of his head indicating that he was slightly nervous, but even with all these quirks he was a benevolent man.

"I will send out scouting parties... Or perhaps try to call a meeting with the intel and reconnaissance division.* - Tue Nov 24 19:12:51 2015

"This is the Raikage speaking. I am calling an emergency meeting for all council members, I advise you to congregate the Manor for a brief discussion..." He gives the order to have the intel and recond team to assemble as well.

They draft all of their knowledge together in the attempt to place a location on Edge's whereabouts, and where he had last been seen.

 Regardless, Eiyu motions for the Human-Carrot to acknowledge him. "I need to speak to you in private for a second. There is something I must show you. You alone."* - Tue Nov 24 19:28:12 2015

If Edge, and Ortho became a problem there would be no stopping him. Furthermore, since Edge currently had Ortho by the balls there was no easy solution."

<Hm, now this is interesting.> Upon closer inspection he ascertains that Chiyari had been over-thrown, the Coup De Etat' obviously failing somewhat as the male no longer ruled Sunagakure. 

It's rulership was now in the hands of Lord-Hassan of Kumogakure.

Though, upon finding out Edge's reasons for killing off so many shinobi enraged him to the very fiber of his being. "To erase our existence for the action of one man whom we could not control...To think he stands above us all, judging us like we are his creations... It's utterly disgusting... It makes sick to my stomach..."

The voices, yes he also heard the voices of the damned played in his memory.
"Yamete! Yamete! Yamete!" The pleas, he didn't know Edge's intentions until looking at this information.
