<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) had no other way to deal with this problem. Sure, there were less decent methods to approach this, but it involved stripping free will from the user. That was something he didnt agree with, and of course he was sure to hear talk of how he was being too weak, and enabling his shinobi to do things they wanted.
Well, they wouldn't have to worry too much longer because he didn't intend to be Raikage forever. 

Just until it was stable.

He opens a book, and begins to trace the patterns inside of the paper. The swirls from within were obviously Fuuinjutsu patterns.* - Sun Nov 29 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) shakes his head once more. His wrist rotates upon the creation of movement, so that her hand would fall short of making contact. "Please don't, Kariduo-Chan." He continues to work on the formula, but refused to make eye-contact with her.

"This is your wish, you have it in your hand.. There is nothing else that needs to be said. What I think is of little importance right now, for I have given you permission to do as you wished in this regard."* - Sun Nov 29 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 's writing hand begins to tremble. "Stop...." He set's the writing implement on the table, and let's it rolls across the table. "Do you want to know the truth, Kariduo? Yes, I care about you, as well as the rest of my shinobi greatly"

He slides the material back into it's respective drawer, and then rises to her feet so that he was looking in her face.

"I will not brand you a traitor, for you are not a traitor to Kumogakure. You will be allowed to leave when you wish."* - Sun Nov 29 23:57:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe, you're just lacking in the quality humor department? - Mon Nov 30 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Did you want to speak business? If so give me a second to finish up speaking to this woman- Oh, that's possible as well. - Mon Nov 30 00:11:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||It had been a long time since he had actually felt another human-being this.. He usually confined himself to his own bubble, and didn't like for it to be disturbed under any circumstance. This was for various reasons - one of them being the fact one could be poisoned rather easily with contact, another being his chakra could be sealed away from him with a touch, or he'd be commanded to do something odd...

But probably the most reason he had for not doing this was because he was honestly afraid. So when Kariduo asked him her question, both of his eyes widened, but then came to a prompt close when he understood why.

Both of his arms part, and then close, his right hand resting on the small of her back, and his left wrapping around the back. He pulls her in deeply, so that the scent of raspberry could linger with him for a long time, and she would smell the rich mahogony clinging from his robes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) pulls away in-time for his last comment to be heard. For the time being he was content with their conversation. Slowly, his right hand reaches for a nearby cabinet, and he resumes tracing several formulas with his finger which he commited to memory.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Tch." The sound of his tongue clicking against the roof of his mouth was surprisingly loud. "There is no such thing as a useless shinobi... Everyone has their place no matter who they are, and consider this... The 'Yondaime' fled her home, and now lives in the shadows.... Even she still has uses.."

<Though, besides being a cumdump, I don't know what else she'd be good for..>

Scalding hot tea explodes from the tea and strikes his chest.

"...............Maybe I got the formula wrong.." He mutters in a pained voice. Even though Eiyu was the leader of the village, even he could appear to look as if he didn't fit the part at all, at least on the surface.* - Wed Dec  2 05:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <I see . . . . .There are some ... .Crazy additions..> Eiyu's right brow quirked slightly, with a look of obvious confusion.

"I'd prefer if you didn't consume my shinobi.." Obviously Takuma could handle himself, or maybe he got off on it in some manner.

But that would mean he is a kinky bastard.* - Thu Dec  3 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) decides that this would be the best time to show-case his skill. He deemed it that Takuma was going to need help, so the only way to help him would be to get the woman to release her grip. He'd take his index finger and middle, before making his way towards the female in question. When he was able to position himself on her flank he'd thrust his two fingers into her exposed orifices, one for the vaginal opening, and one for the anal one.

"One thousand pinch of death!"* - Thu Dec  3 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) motions forward.* - Thu Dec  3 07:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: -- - Thu Dec  3 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Oh my..> "You'll have to forgive me-.." He was able to see just how much damage had been done to Takuma in such a short period of time and was amazed. This girl was no dainty cougar, she was an outright demon. <I didnt know so much damage had been done in such a short period of time.

Though, as he saw blood rolling down her cleavage he was astounded by how someone that looked like that could be so.... Ravenous.

Nonetheless he flings himself backwards, his right hand extending forward, his index finger aflame with some sort of odd looking energy. "Please, stay back... I don't want to use this finger....... I'm also ...Going to have to restrain you for your actions... You going to uh yield, right?"

Eiyu was intent on challenging this woman at her own game, one of domination.
"Takuma-San, get to the hospital."* - Thu Dec  3 07:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: god* - Thu Dec  3 07:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) couldn't let his carnial desires get in the way of his judgement, all things considered this woman was very dangerous, and she probably thrived on hunting to a degree. However, these factors are something that Eiyu had to deal with, and understood that in order for him to remain alive he'd have to use his head.

<Unbreakable doll?> He wasn't sure what this meant but he would not have any part of her eating him alive. So with that he bites into the pad of his forefinger, entirely disregarded the extended arms, and promptly bites into the pad of his forefinger, he slams his right hand into the ground and waits.

"But perhaps you'd be more willing to speak to my friend...."

Inside of the smoke, a figure shifts unsteadily.

His summon promptly vanishes and Eiyu is seen from a distance simply standing on the rock-face glaring at Yuriko.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Yes?" Eiyu glances at Takuma, and then to Yuriko. Truth be told, he couldn't help feeling bad for her considering that she seemed to be so nice - but that was just it, she could be acidic as well, and she consumed Takuma's arm in seconds - that was something he was alarmed of.

However.

"Sigh." The male disrobes, letting his lean physique protrude from it's suit. "Now that I'm no longer burdened by dead weight..." He shifts onto the balls of his feet now that he was rolling down the mountain side.

He presents himself somewhat closer to the duo, but far enough to keep her from springing on him. "Hmmmm...?"* - Thu Dec  3 08:17:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) found himself in a unique situation. Mainly because of how young he actually was, he had to admit he was feeling the stress of being in close proximity to the opposite sex, even if they seemed to be a eating machine with the hunger a mouth capable of ripping flesh asunder.

But for now - 

"Hnnn.." He can feel her body jostle against her's, he breats perking against his torso. The smell of -blood- wafting into his nostrils as well - the scent was something he knew of all too well. But for now, they were equals, his blue eyes stare down at her.

He is frozen, the only movement that was taking place was the accumulation of blood flowing through a particular member.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Kumogakure needs it's best to lead the village, and I am not that man anylonger. I've built it up from dust. - Sun Dec  6 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: But now. - Sun Dec  6 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Someone more deserving. - Sun Dec  6 22:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I will still be a shinobi. - Sun Dec  6 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I see, But if you aren't deserving shouldn't that motivate you to do better? - Sun Dec  6 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I didn't become the Raikage out of desire. - Sun Dec  6 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I did it because I had to. - Sun Dec  6 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I am not deserving of such a title, not yet. - Sun Dec  6 22:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Someone who relies on his comrades to cover his back, and make up for his weaknesses, and do the same for them. - Sun Dec  6 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: You are the best suited. - Sun Dec  6 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) head descends - Menma spoke truth. The Raikage was someone who did what needed to be done, but at the end of the day he was one man, and still relied on his shinobi to get the job done. He couldn't do everything, and that was what Eiyu was trying to do - Or that is what he felt he needed to do. But things were different now, Kumogakure had obtained some sembalance of power, and if he was going to remain Raikage he was going to have to go through with his initial plan but it came with consequences, and if it failed so too would Kumogakure potentially.

But in the end. 

Kumogakure would be an independent nation no longer would Sunagakure's forces operate the Land Of Clouds. Eiyu's hands drum together as he mulls over the situation at hand.* - Sun Dec  6 22:40:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) whispers: So nothing you want me to look into? - Sun Dec  6 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: I wish to know. - Sun Dec  6 22:53:52 2015
