The Minatabi's eyes open, his blue eyes keeping careful note of the male who stood before him. 

"Hello, Mizukage-Sama." He looks on, obviously disappointed.

"Let's just be up-front." His eyes narrow intentaly on the two individuals. "Mizukage-Sama, if you had a prolem with something I said, then you should've said it. Simply because I have no idea what you were thinking, and made it seem as if your village had a prolem with mine. But the debt I owed you, I paid, and told you there wouldn't be problems between us.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) found Kana's comment mildly annoying, he had good intentions of wanting to see her safe, but seeing as she was taunting him in this desperate situation was something he disliked greatly, but it was over-looked. One had to be careful how they presented themselves, displomacy was key.


"Ortho was planning on taking him on as well, with the help of the allied forces. His strength, and his men would've proved to be formidable, but now his people are nothing more than leaves in the wind, and our over-all strength is cut. Sunagakure is xenophobic, and is slow to accept change, and working together.. Oh."

"Kumogakure shinobi. Sunagagkure shinobi.... High alert. I want to see if the interior of this village has been trapped. Investigate, sensors remain vigilant, but expect for our sensory attempts to be blind-sided. Shinobi are to do their rounds before manning their battlestations."

Yes, he assumed that Edge left a present somewhere in the village ready to be used against Kumogakure at somepoint. He had to be sure that the village was safe before having the shinobi assemble their battlestations which were the northern flank. Easten flank, western flank, and the southern flank.* - Tue Nov 24 23:57:00 2015

If there was a moderate disturbance they would act on it. Ever since Kana informed Eiyu of Ortho's and Supaiku's demise he found himself in a depressed mood, but didn't say anything to his men.

Not even the death of comrades, or close friends could turn him away from his destiny. His head lowers and he looks into his palms. "Sigh..." He reaches into his back-pouch and clutches a single strand of red hair. Some shinobi simply looked on anticipation, others seemed to be on 'Edge'. 

Others were still in-shock that Eiyu managed to deduce portions of Kumogakure had been trapped. But in all honesty he was frustrated he hadn't checked on that sooner. He had Supaiku to thank for investigating the archives and finding the information he needed on why Edge had a grudge on Kumogakure.

"Hm..." <He won't be much help in battle, but at least he can relay this message to the others.....> Eiyu bits into the pad of his forefinger, blood streaks out of his index and is followed by a sequence of handseals.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <So, he's a natural conductor. That mean's some of my techniques will be useless against him.> Eiyu chuckles, as he brings his hands chest level. "Hm, as you wish."

One Earth pole surfaces from his right flank, and another from his left in the attempt to bash him between the two posts. He didn't utilize the sharpa edges, as he did not wish to hurt his opponent, but he did intent to hit him with them.

<This outta start the tone for battle.>

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Fast.. Too fast..> Eiyu reels away from the kick, and manages to elude it by a slim margin. <I never liked Taijutsu.. It's something that I will have to work on the future. He notes that his opponent was -very- fast, and able to react to most of his attacks quickly.

<Probably should've cut his route off with the frontal assault, he exploited my failure. He's a crafty one.> Eiyu manages to back up and form handseals while doing so, his opponent would most likely sense that something was coming his way.

<Let's see here.!> He begins to knead an oily substance inside of his chest, and in due time opens his maw, accelerating the process in what could only be described as a wave.

If it made contact he'd find fierce resistence.* - Wed Nov 25 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Yeah, now that's bad...> Eiyu watched in horror as the lightning caused his fire to erupt. Of course his opponents elemental prowess would be better than his, he was for all intents and purpose ahead of the game in that respect. 

He is forced to accelerate forward, and then flip on his flank, and unsheathe two scrolls from the side of his waist.

<Twin Rising Dragons...> He'd mutter as the scrolls around his person opened, the lotus formation revealing itself for what seemed to be a plethora of weapons, however no wires were attatched this time, they had been left out, due his fear of him possibly channeling Raiton based chakra through the implements. But what he was left now was a storm of projectiles all meant to defeat him, if he was hit he'd only be met with mild injury.* - Wed Nov 25 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: oh. - Wed Nov 25 02:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 
<What the hell is this?> He was honestly surprised his opponent was so fast. In-fact his eyes even widened at the acceleration of his target. <I'm gonna get caught up in another bout of Taijutsu.. I don't want that.> Eiyu vaults onto the fence, he knew better than to fly skyward without a defense however. 

The left scroll had been scorched, and promptly ended. Embers run off of his frame as he forms a single seal. 

<Hn..> He seems to be winded at this point, but he was able to go on due to his decent stamina reserves and impressive chakra pools. 

<Kage-Bunshin No Jutsu.> 

The real Eiyu kicks the clone to the left whilst in mid-air using the momentum to send him to the right, while the clone that had been pushed to the left formulates handseals to copy what he had just done. 

Inside of his maw, another wave of oil makes it's way towards him, in the hopes something would happen.* - Wed Nov 25 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Woooooaaah. - Wed Nov 25 02:55:21 2015

||There was no way to dodge a technique in mid-air. He had been smitten with the lightning ball and thrown against the fence. Lightning crackles around his form as he his body is forced to spasm.
"Ergyhh!"
However, the oil that the clone had hit him if he didn't move out of the way of it's attack. But even if it did, none of that mannered as the real Eiyu had been taken out of the fight.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <I haven't seen her before..> There wasn't much that he could see because of the hoodie she wore. It hid most of her body, though did little to conceal the three arms she sported on each side of her shoulder. "...." Eiyu hadn't seen anything like it before so he began to stare, not out of disrespect but because he was honestly shocked.

The scent of raspberry became apparent around this time as well. <First someone who summons Carrots as weapons, and now this.. Kumogakure is... Becoming odd...>

"Hello..." He says after a long and drawn out moment of silence.* - Wed Nov 25 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "I am Eiyu, the Raikage of Kumogakure, and you are?" His eyes never leave Kariduo as he inquires of her name. However if there was one thing he lacked it would be subtlety. He starts by glancing at the top of her crown, but where the hood was situated it left most to the imagination. Then to her eyes, lips. 

The pink bubble is suspended between her mouth, the rounded ball is destroyed - he can see her mouth move to pop it. "..I.. Don't be offended by this, but I haven't seen anyone like you before...Can you tell me a little about yourself?"

* - Wed Nov 25 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||Quite frankly there was a lot of things he wanted to ask the girl. However he was starting to understand, slowly. "Engi, huh.." He takes his time to consider these next few questions carefully. Even if Kariduo was taking his questioning in stride he didn't want to hit a heart-string, and then have a six armed emotionally charged female at his throat.

Though, judging by how she acted it seemed as if it were unlikely to happen.
". . .I don't know, I don't want to make you feel bad or anything. You seem to be very special, but I know some might not approve of that word."

He pauses. 

"Can I see your arms better?" 

He extends his right arm forward, should she allow it his palm would run between the arm in the middle, the target being her bicep.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arihs(Osmanesanogo) says: Raikage, stop trying to get laid and give me a C rank. - Wed Nov 25 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) continues to inspect her arms even though he knew deep down she was correct. She was simply a girl with six arms, and other than that feature it'd be assumed she was normal. Though, he began to look at the applications for such things, did this mean she could utilize several jutsus's at once? Did it mean she was naturally gifted at figthing due to the fact she could send too many arms against they enemy in overwehlming numbers.

His hands would no doubt be cold, so after doing his inspecting he retracts his hand from her arms. "I kinda wonder what your life would be like if you were a shinobi." Eiyu points to Eiji. "I'm sure you know of the Kirisaki clan, they single handedly resolved the issue of hunger in Kumogakure.. You should get to know em'."

Next, his eyes rotate to the white haire child. "He's .. .Well, here." * - Wed Nov 25 18:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances at Menma through the corner of his eye.
<Hm...>
"What happened?" He is on alert at this point, Mena wasn't doing too well, and it was obvious that he may require medical attention.

* - Wed Nov 25 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) looked away. "I-.. I know they are dead.. I've recieved news of their passing earlier... It is unfortunate that Edge killed them... Do you know where they died? If so, it may be possible someone can recover their bodies for a proper funeral if you have not done so already."

There wasn't much else he could offer in terms of condolences.


"I tried to help them, for what's it's worth, but they left without informing me... I didn't know where they had gotten to until it was too late."* - Wed Nov 25 22:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) knew all too well of what Menma was going through. Ironically, it had been Edge that had taken much from him as well. He was simply lucky in that it had been several months since the passing of his own family. The wounds were still fresh in his mind, but he lacked the raw tenacity of hatred that most of his compatriots shared.

It was most likely because he had empathy, he understood other's emotions and tried to aceept them into his being, even if it was too much for him. Even with Edge's vehement hatred towards Niklaus, he could find no reason to justify devoting an entire village to destruction because of it.

Nor could he accept what had happened here. <I will never forgive him for this..>
"Yes, but now you can honor them by getting stronger for the day that we must confront Edge. Before Supiaku's death she informed me that she was happy to die, she would be free, no longer bound by a cursed fate, and Ortho wished for me to...... Protect his family. It was his dying wish, and I will accept it... Hatred begets hatred, Edge must stopped, but dont let yourself be consumed by will... It will take time."* - Wed Nov 25 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) |"Then live for her, but do not die for her. It was not only her wish, but also Ortho's that the few of you who remain live to see tomorrow. You cannot do that by whimsical assumptions of how you do not have time, as that is the key factor in all of this. If Ortho was your leader, and he died.... What does that say if you confront him now?"

He shakes his head.
"No, you must train... You must look to your comrades for help." He glances at Eiji, and then to Takuma.

"You must do everything you can to ensure their death was not in vain... But if you go live off of your course of vanity you will have done nothing, accomplished nothing, and made their deaths meaningless."* - Wed Nov 25 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Trust me. I will see you through this. You aren't the only one who's lost someone." Eiyu's eyes changed, they did not adorn a look of pity, but of understanding. The softening of his gaze was like a father attempting to comfort his own child, a powerful aura of benevolence presents itself.

"We will take Edge down, but we will do it together."

He extends his hand in the Uchiha's direction hoping he'd take it and help himself to his feet.

"I promise."* - Wed Nov 25 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||It was rough being the kind of person Eiyu was. Failure wasnt an option because of it. Menma had been faith in him, if only for a moment, and if he failed to live up to his expectations the Minatabi would be held accountable for it. <I might not have been able to save Suipaku.. But I know I can save the others if they give me a chance.>

"Thank you...." His blue eyes transfer a non-verbal message to the mourning Uchiha. 

It was a look of determination.* - Wed Nov 25 23:43:47 2015
