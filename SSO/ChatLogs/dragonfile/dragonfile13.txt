<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) eyes disallowed such a mistake to transpire. His optic nerves collected the smallest details, even the subtle movement of the heroine. He promptly side-steps, avoiding the collision entirely. He observes the female further, his eyes narrowing.

"Hello."* - Tue Sep 22 21:20:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) pats his stomach softly.

"Uhm.. Mr.Ushi.. Can you please not do that?"
It sounded as if a female's voice broke through the bindings of his robe. 
Upon closer inspection it would seem as if something began to incline towards his neck.

Two pale antennas prod the surrounding air.* - Tue Sep 22 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Kenshin? - Tue Sep 22 22:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) "No.. It will upset him if he hears people are searching for him.. Most likely get paranoid for no reason. If we come across him that is fine, but we arent going to make a case of it.. For now I suppose we continue as planned and train for the time being. In a few mo- .. Oh... I'm going to need at least two hundred thousand f-.." Ushinawa yelps out in surprise, his wifes embrace actually managing to get the best of him. He stifles another outcry, and instead clenches his jaws tightly.

<Damn.. I wasn't expecting that..> THough in response his right hand shoots out and slaps her ass with enough force to have her individual cheeks quiver in his palm. * - Tue Sep 22 22:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"It is only the way of the world. What comes up, must come down. But whatever force brings this nation to his knees will be profound, provided they cannot find a savior." Ushinawas eyes avert onto Hideki's back, his face bearing nothing but indifference, two handseals and formed in response to the boy leaving. "I'm not just going to let you go get yourself in a heap of trouble."* - Tue Sep 22 22:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) didn't want to activate the jutsu because of company. However, he found another way to get the message across without revealing his new jutsu. He reaches into the confines of his weapon-holster, his index finger looping through the eye of the projectile. He'd toss it in front of the boy's foot-falls, hopefully stopping his approach entirely.

"You're not going, and that is final."* - Tue Sep 22 22:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) noticed Misa's approach long before she ascended the steps leading into Niza's manor. But as she grew closer his attention was now upon her. Both of his eyes now lay upon her frame, the revered Sharingan in all of it's glory, three tomoe and all. 

"Who are you?" He'd inquire, blatantly  ignoring her greeting.* - Tue Sep 22 22:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Uh, farther down. - Wed Sep 23 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I've been meaning to try this new jutsu. - Wed Sep 23 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Shinra Tensei. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The first move is yours. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Nay. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: We roll a dice to see who goes first. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Odds, I go first. - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Evens, you got last. - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Yes... - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sounds good. - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||"It's time to get serious, Hideki.. Show me that you're not push-over." Ushinawa formulates hand-seals at a rapid pace. When he completed the sequence of handsigns he knead the chakra in his gullet, and then draws the mixture into his throat, and out of his mouth. <Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!> The massive inferno moved at an impressive pace most likely forcing the Genin to move or end up blacker than Popo's son.* - Wed Sep 23 00:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Did I miss anything? - Wed Sep 23 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Impressive.. He anticipated my fireballs strength and deduced that he couldn't fire off one to cancel it's power... Very skillful, Hideki.> Ushinawa couldn't trace the young-mans movements, the acceleration Shunshin provided was truly on another level of it's own. However, much like always there was a delay for the caster using it, one that UShinawa sought to exploit. However, you got too close to me... The Uchiha accelerates as well, his speed enough to cause a tiny maelstrom of dust whipping against his feet.

He extends his right foot towards Hideki's stomach in the attempt to send him crashing against the rock formation behind him.* - Wed Sep 23 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) recognized the seals coming from the Uchiha and sought to match them, but a bit faster. His handseal speed was indeed something he took pride-in, it allowed him to get the upper-hand on opponents who wer a -tad- bit slower. The snakes attempt to intercept the boy's own, and coil around them, extending Kusangai-like blades from their pronged tongues. Ushinawa scoffs.
"Surely you didn't think you'd beat me with something that I already know."* - Wed Sep 23 00:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Hm, close-combat.. He intends to attack me while the snakes are tethered to me..> What followed his actions was a cloud of smoke that signaled the summons be tucked away. While in the same motion he reaches for the Katana on his right hip with his left hand. The midnight black hilt bore an unearthly metallic glow, it's pristine edge collides against the incoming Gunbai into an effective parry, and with his free hand Ushinawa intends to draw from his other hip another blade and slash Hidekis abdomen, but due to the strength and trajectory of the swing the damaged would've been deafened.* - Wed Sep 23 00:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) ||Ushinawa observed his attack hit it's mark. However, there were more pressing matters to attend to. The male made his way west in the attempt to escape what would be a most one-sided battle between the two. He was starting to realize that his chances were somewhat better at a long range battle. 

Several explosive tags were strewn across the floor, and already Ushinawa knew what this meant. It was simple really, he had to move, and he did so, explosions tore into the skies, flames were sent into a sporadic frenzy, but alas he wasnt scratched, however his robe was tainted with the ash of the battle.

"You are getting better, Hideki."* - Wed Sep 23 00:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) thinks: Hideki use the force. - Wed Sep 23 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: You play to much. - Wed Sep 23 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <So, he intends to drag this on a bit longer.. So be it..> Ushinawa sinks underground rather timely, and he'd do his best to burrow himself into the ground, it'd be easy enough to detect him at this point. But could the same be said about his fellow compatriot?* - Wed Sep 23 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) chuckled internally, the magnetic waves acted like sonar. The shift in Hideki's very movements were felt and Ushinawa was going to make this as easy as possible. He gradually snakes his way to the side. When he had reached his destination he ascends and remains silent. 

<Time to end this..>* - Wed Sep 23 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I just tol dyou to stay away from her, Hanabi. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) whispers: How are you holding up? - Wed Sep 23 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <I see..> Ushinawa thought of reclining his back against the wall, but instead leans forward. Both hands on his hip, onyx eyes looking forward, the best word to describe his demeanor being depraved. He glances at Hassan, and then the boy whom he had met in Zetsumos camp. 

Thoughts paced his mind, and regret set in. 
"Forget it.." He'd mutter.* - Wed Sep 23 13:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: How are you holding up? - Wed Sep 23 13:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Do you not want to be around me or something? - Wed Sep 23 13:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No, it's not that at all. - Wed Sep 23 13:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's just things are bound to get nasty, and I don't want you being hasty. - Wed Sep 23 13:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Mmm.... - Wed Sep 23 14:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps you should wait for Hideki. - Wed Sep 23 14:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Fine. - Wed Sep 23 14:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: In the mean-time. - Wed Sep 23 14:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: How about a spar? - Wed Sep 23 14:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure. - Wed Sep 23 14:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Nani!? - Wed Sep 23 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Such perfect boobs... - Wed Sep 23 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Such form. - Wed Sep 23 14:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Wed Sep 23 14:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) glances at Mariana whilst his right hand shifts out of his robe, four ninja stars approach her person. He didn't even acknowledge a start to their spar, this action would no doubt be seen as low, but it was to teach her to expect the unexpected. There was an aura of danger about the cloaked individual and Mariana would do well to sense the air around him had shifted.* - Wed Sep 23 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) dies.* - Wed Sep 23 14:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <To think she'd be so apt to use that on me. Well, indeed... It's power is very formidable, however Mariana. Just because something is no longer in sight, doesn't mean it doesnt exist.> Ushinawa's index finger twitches, the metallic bindings around the shuriken grew taut, he manipulates the discarded projectile his lover thought she dodged with but a simple gesture.

If it did hit, he intended to disrupt the process of her Cherry Blossom Impact going through. It did require precise chakra control and perfect, but with this sleight of hand move it would no doubt ruin her day. If he did manage to hit he attempted to lodge it behind her shoulder.

<Such a simple, yet effective technique...> 
If she had these eyes to observe the metallic wire, his reaction would be different.* - Wed Sep 23 14:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Hmmm. I see...> So her punch did go through, as expected. Rocks were sent flying, debris swirled over-head almost as if in a stage of stasis. She grew closer, using each rock formation as a platform. It was unfortunate that she was too slow getting there, Ushinawa was on the move, away from said punch, but whilst doing so he forms two handsigns. Suddenly snakes shoot through the corners of his sleeves, one of them aimed to sink it's fangs into her shoulder, the other one extended a blade attempting to lodge it within her right thigh.

"Too slow... Such a direct attack like that will never work... Not until you're faster or at least distract me.."* - Wed Sep 23 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) <Impressive.> So she was not going to hold back anymore. That much he enjoyed as this was a battle between two shinobi, and Ushinawa needed to see how much Mariana had truly grown. The snakes of course went up in smoke, the deadly counter by yours truly actually managed to stun the Uchiha a bit, but it was something he had to expect. 

<She even is trying to close the distance while using the spear. Well, it seems I hav no choice..> He came in fast, his Sharingan calculating the trajectory and then feeding it into his brain so when he unsheathed his blade he was about to counter it's collision. His wrist rotates, hopefully jarring the spear around in the air while he closes the distance and attempts to make eye-contact.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: | im cooking - Wed Sep 23 15:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) was sent flying. His body coming to a stop, crashing and tearing through the landscape like an arrow against a string. He was luckly Mariana's words did not actually transpire if all went as planned. He was fortunate because of one thing, and it was simple. He used the same technique numerous times before on her, attempting to get her into a sense she had won, only to take her back to reality one it was all said and done.

He forms the ram seal, simply adding to the ruse his hands had done the deed. But alas, she had fallen victim to his Genjutsu.* - Wed Sep 23 15:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: It's over. - Wed Sep 23 15:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Time for BDSM.. - Wed Sep 23 15:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) makes his way to Mariana, his Sharingan fading and turning back to it's original obsidian. He'd infuse his chakra into her body, ending his hold over her. "Kai."* - Wed Sep 23 15:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hmm, you've done well. - Wed Sep 23 15:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No need to be sour. - Wed Sep 23 15:41:52 2015

But her touch stimulated his lower body causing for his rod to expand, and then came her warm mouth extracting the skin away from the crown, exposing the pink layer of flesh underneath. She licks around the base and he helps her further by pressing on the back of her head, and then opening his legs and driving his body downwards. With this motion it was easy to say he was fucking her mouth, and quite possibly near her throat, his length did manage to penetrate all the way through.* - Wed Sep 23 16:16:00 2015

The mixture parts in strands as the changes onto his balls, leaving them moist with her tongue. He grits his teeth hard, using his hands to establish a grip on her head.

Then, she switches to her cunt, her wet folds over-lap his cock, he meets the three inch mark, and then he is suddenly all the way. Her legs come in hard, pushing her up and down, the clap of skin between their flesh heating the exchange and his cock, even now he expands her inner walls, her pink inside clearly visible.* - Wed Sep 23 16:32:12 2015

He avoided going too hard as he didn't want to reach her cervix and pause her pain. 

She was enjoying this, riding him to this extent and truth be told so had he. He uses his thumb to massage her clit while she continued to form circles around his hips. Faster, faster....

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) had to admit be was surprised by Fujiortas reaction. The male was ready to protect his daughter at the cost of his life. In all honesty it was something he could admire, at least had it not been for a particular incident. The incident his brother was cut down in front of him, his village leader doing nothing, and making the killer a shinobi, and someone who he eventually called his sister. That will to protect a loved one was something Ushinawa hadn't yet been able to do. The loss of his loved one, the ignorance of those who were around him... Everyone wanted to to be strong, and everyone wanted to defend their loved one's.

"Do not..." Ushinawa paces, his rage rising to it's apex. No hostile action was made save for the Uchiha maintaining eye-contact.
"Preach to me! Kirigaure wouldn't help you fight the Gezo, you'd be fighting a one man battle against an entity you are too weak to face. Everyone bows at their feet, everyone is weak!!! That mongrel of a child is the reason why my brother is dead!"

There is a moment of silence, the tension was rising, in all his years of being a shinobi Ushinawa never looked like this.
"She will turn out to be another Katya, and when she does.......... I'll be there. I swear on my brothers grave....I swear on all the lives lost due to senseless violence, and death..... In the end.... Your fate will be one of pain, and suffering just like mine.... Misery loves company, and I know.....

Then she went around killing everything she could, even attempting to strip rulership over Sunagakure from her, in the end, as you say she was killed by her own people. Even moreso, where is Kastya now? You have nothing but broken memories that are meaningless... You talk of defeating the Gezo, but I know how your battle went with Edge.. I know what's truly going on.. These people, Kirigakure, they won't support you against the Gezo.. If it ever came to it, and it will... You will just be another corpse..." 

Ushinawa did notice the seal upon his flesh however. Though no real response of acknowledgement was shown to his younger compatriot. The bound between them both in the past was strong, but through recent developments his will had been tarnished. Slowly but surely it was turning as black and sin, and he simply couldn't understand Fujiorta anymore. 

"You're right........... If you're a shinobi, then you are a shinobi first.... Your child comes second, your village over an individual, but I see your emotions are as charged as mine... You don't truly believe in what has been taught, and I can't blame you... But as it stands.... He takes the time to observe his surroundings. "Your daughter will die, and then you will wish you heeded my warnings, not as your kin, but as someone who knows how far people will go to achieve a goal... Can you really say if the Gezo ordered for you to turn in your daughter these peope would resist? Could you really do it on your own...?" He leaps forward, his foot-falls accelerating past the norm. He extends a fist forth shooting it out in the means to strike, if all went as planned, or at least this is what Fujiorta saw, but what happened in reality was entirely different.

"Well, can you?!??"* - Wed Sep 23 18:34:14 2015

What he thought he was doing with his jutsu happened, but in the real word not even a spark likely. It would be different if he had it activated before but as it stood, he was in a world of illusion and Ushinawa could potentially move on him, however, such actions of his were not cared for. Fujiorta was not a target of his disdain, he simply wanted to see what the man was about.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) chuckles internally at the thought of Suitengu conforming to the life-style of Kirigakure. The young lad no doubt had a lot of pent up anger within his soul, and it was something that Hirusho could feel. Having spent a fair amount of time with the lad he knew a bit about him, a lot due to his unwillingness to speak but Ushinawa's Doujutsu was abl to deduce a bit about him. No doubt things that even the child didn't know about, perhaps.

Still, there was another child, Kastyas. He did wonder how much she had matured, the little girl even wielded the bow he had given to her, it was no doubt something she would remember though. 

<Ripe.... For turning..> In the distance he observes the scout who managed to get away when he was spotted in Zetsumo's residence. "You again..."
His eyes casually shifting to the male in question, a look of difference even through the concealing folds of his facemask.* - Wed Sep 23 21:23:12 2015
