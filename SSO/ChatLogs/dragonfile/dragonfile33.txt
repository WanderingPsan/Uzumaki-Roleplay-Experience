<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"I spoke to Ortho personally. Its true, I did almost die and it's because I tried to combat him, but it was under -strained- pretenses. Killing so many shinobi is nothing something that can readily be forgiven, and I understand that. However, Kirie's actions were the cause of this evil, that is not an excuse either. I'll be honest, there needs to be a solution in all of this, but not one that ends in a brawl for many reason. For one, by killing him you create the conditions for history to repeat itself. By killing one, you create the potential of creating ten Ortho's who're empowered by his demise. Will he attack Kirigakure again? No, I don't see him doing such a thing, I actually had a long talk with him. You claim you want him, do you truly want war? This isn't just some little skirmish, Mizukage-Sama. This will be a long and drawn out process and you will most likely have to kill other people..."

He pauses, letting his words sink in.

"I am a pacifist, but I am all for defending the village, and I really understand what's going on... Edge killed so many of our people, The Raikage left our people to die, and I wouldn't kill either of them. If Edge came now,I 'd try to stop him and understand his reasoning. You don't find solutions in killing everyone and creating conditions for history to repeat itself. Empathy is the key to solving one's problems... It's the reason why I am still alive today.. I listened to what he had to say... Now the question is, will you? Hm, and this isn't me being on one side over the other, -If- Ortho tried to make a move on Kumogakure, or the shinobi I've come to know I'd attempt to stop him all the same."

He tilts his head to the side, allowing for the shinobi to get a good look at his blue irises.

Within seconds they are on the scene and train all of their resources against the attackers. It was obvious who was what given the fact they were still standing and the others were sleep, couple it in with the fact that Eiyu more or less assumed he would be betrayed at one point.

"Suiton! Great Water-Fall!" The water was hopefully enough to negate Ortho'[s charge. More shinobi come in with their game faces on.

"Fuuton, air bulllets!" The bullets were disperesed in a way that Heiwa would find it difficult to dodge, as they spanned a rather decent area. For Ortho, however a mud-wall is erected between him, and the boy ensuring a momentary delay in response.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||The two shinobi would be Kai'd out of the Genjutsu.* - Sat Nov 21 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: They could've been my Loli-specimens, a shame.... Hm, a shame indeed. - Sat Nov 21 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) forms the needed handseals to formulate a single Kage-Bunshin in his place where he goes to train.* - Sat Nov 21 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) goes over a basic sealing method, he begins firstly by grafting a  set of handseals, and while he does so he is able to implement his chakra in a way that binds these projectiles inside of the parchment, but it'scale is multiplied tenfold, and the Minatabi knew just how many weapons he sealed into each sroll, they were numerous, and could be used as offense should the need arise, but he was more or less striving for a sense of mastery.* - Sat Nov 21 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) continues with the sealing of objects, due to his mastery in Fuuinjutsu he is able to seal multipe objects in at once. There was a rather decent stockpile in his arsenal right about now so he didn't have to worry being caught flat-footed. <Good..> He finishes working without any sort of break even though he was already physically tired from using a Ninjutsu he wasn't going to go into detail about. 

<Hm, it's nearing completion...>* - Sat Nov 21 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) formulates his chakra into the parchment once more, taking careful note of how much energy he was consuming, due to the large chakra pools he had swiring within him he was able to repeat this process with relative ease. Now, that he had sealed a moderate amount of weapons into their respective container he works to store his scrolls on his person, should he have use for it later he would call upon it.

But for now he didn't need it.* - Sat Nov 21 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Sat Nov 21 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Sat Nov 21 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) glances in Supaiku's direction, along with the various men in her company. The male seemed to move in the cold, unwavering in his conviction. Though it never really bothered him much, a blast of  steam rippled from the edges of his lips due to the frigid temperatures.

"Hello there... Whom might these people be?"* - Sat Nov 21 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ..... - Sat Nov 21 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: This guy needs memory training. - Sat Nov 21 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Oi,.." He motions towards Hatsujin. "I apologize.. It's just everytime you come I'm either about to die, or I'm about to ask for something that I need and it's importance is paramount.." EIyu chides, he was serious in his response but he wanted to keep the mood light.

"Who's the one with the sword? He looks... Pointy.."* - Sat Nov 21 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) sported messy hair, along with the look he hadn't slept in ages. The body suit he wore was tight enough on his body so that it exposed his bodies contour which was quite muscular. The male was fit, but oddly enough gave off the impression he was fatigued.

He also had a belt full crimson scrolls with Lotus imprints on them. Though one thing that they would all note regardless was his friendly demeanor.

He showed no outward signs of malice.
"I take it your journey was okay."* - Sat Nov 21 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'll simply hold back on the talking, too aggravated. - Sat Nov 21 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) opens his arms to recieve her hug, and while the girl wraps his arms around her him, he lifts her into the air, the embrace was a gentle one as he did not know how fragile she was, but it was assumed due to her side she bruised easily, not that the male was notably  strong himself.. "Now you can tell everyone you saw me eye to eye." <Hmm....>

<That pun was terrible....>
"Hatsujin doesn't seem bad, or anything. Though I see he takes my forgetfulness personally, I guess if he knew me a bit more he'd understand why I forgot."* - Sat Nov 21 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) whispers: Sorry about getting worked up last time, a lot was on my mind.... and he didn't mean what he implied, he wasn't -trying- to tell you... So I fucked it all up, but now you are in on the secret Eiyu-kun. - Sat Nov 21 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I take one step forward, two steps back with that girl. . . - Sat Nov 21 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Whatever. - Sat Nov 21 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Just looking out for you. . . - Sat Nov 21 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Gah, less people, more guitar. - Sat Nov 21 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) whispers: I fear that it will only be you, and Ortho who knows that secret in the future, mine isn't looking so promising.. - Sat Nov 21 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) set her down as gently as a feather. He smiles widely at this point, his left arm reaching behind his head, he'd ruffle the strands of white before his grin turns into a frown.

"I assume Ortho told you what has happened." His eyes waver to Hatsujin, he notices the boy's dejected aura. "I know you might be annoyed with me right now, but you should really pay attention to what I have to say now, you as well Menma."

Eiyu looks a tad bit depressed.

The news wasn't good.* - Sat Nov 21 17:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Let me explain more. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The Mizukage and his men visited Kumogakure without me knowing, I hadn't even realized they sent a bird my way. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: When he arrived. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I told him to end his crusade against Ortho, as I had no intention of fighting. - Sat Nov 21 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He laughed in my face, and vanished. - Sat Nov 21 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Shortly thereafter. - Sat Nov 21 17:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: If you seek her out and are careful about how you speak to her then she might be willing to allign with you against the current Mizukage. - Sat Nov 21 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I can't tell you why she might want to help you, that's her own news to tell. - Sat Nov 21 17:34:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: So that Kirigakure can become an ally in the future, or at least... just not a threat. - Sat Nov 21 17:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: You ready, Eiyu-Sama? - Sat Nov 21 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Nuh. - Sat Nov 21 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Sat Nov 21 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll begin. - Sat Nov 21 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Now, Menia-Chan.." Eiyu takes a step back, his more timid nature rising from the confines of his soul-case. "Now.. Now.. There's no need for that, give me a little time, you hear?" 

Eiyu didn't seem like he wanted to battle just yet.
<Take the hint you heavy handed greenbean! Oh, it's good she can't hear me...>* - Sat Nov 21 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nope. - Sat Nov 21 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: Just let it happen. - Sat Nov 21 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Hn, I should really learn how to be more demanding..> "Wait!" Eiyu demands. "You haven't even seen my ultimate jutsu.. " He reaches for a scroll on his waist and let's the parchment scale to the floor.

<I've stored enough farts in this to kill an army....>
The putrid odor of stank butt would most likely give Menia a run for her money while Eiyu takes this time to make a timely escape..* - Sat Nov 21 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Sat Nov 21 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) smirks. <So she intends to just go forward with her action. Perhaps she has more fire than I had intentionally thought.> Eiyu accelerates at a speed he had never really utilized before, while in the same instance he flings another scroll in her direction. 

Upon closer inspection it seemed to be an average looking document, but upon a fixed interval of time the rush comes to life. The ground turns into mud, and three wolves take to creation around her flank, he had obviously avoided her initial charge.

"Tch, that's no way to treat your Raikage." He states in a more serious manner.* - Sat Nov 21 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"Forgive me.." The wolves reform at a quickened pace, using the Earth as a medium to do so, because of this it would disallow her a chance to attack Eiyu directly, and because of their formation she couldn't readily escape. "I shouldve come at you with my full power, and it's not much, all things considering." He refines the Katon chakra inside of his gullet, and releases this in a mixture of obtrusive oil from his maw.

"But with this, you've fallen into the divination of my attack range."
There is a confident gleam in the Minatabi's eyes at this point. 

"Try moving.~"
If she had been hit, she would've found herself to be stuck.
