I will give them the supplies they require, but the ore they give us we don't even use it.. It isn't even in Kumogakure - this is how much I do not trust them..." He pauses - his eyes narrowing slightly. "But you seem to be decent enough. Hm, well I need for you to know that I harbor no ill will towards you or anything... I just find Sanoke's lack of apology hilarious considering this dispute of his caused many good men to die on both sides. . . We fought for our right to be here, so we had a reason to...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||It was true that a leader did not make a village was, they followed out of loyalty, and if given a task it was the shinobi's purpose to heed. Though, in the end Eiyu still disliked Sunagakure greatly. He wanted to punch Sanoke in his mouth - but he had gotten over it. They had devoted a memorial stone to the dead, and those who had been widowed were paid.

"I will speak to him. But he will not come to Kumogakure."* - Fri Dec 11 05:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) 's green eyes spot the Dragon from afar - its mosiac girth proving to be formidable. In a way Eiyu saw this as a showing of strength, though in it's pesence he remains unwavering - blasts of cold air waft into his face from the momentum of wings threshing against air.

The surrounding shinobi prepare themselves for what quite possibly was about to turn into a confrontation. "Enough." Eiyu raises his right hand and all of his men heed his directions. 

He knew those robes from anywhere. <The Kazekage.> His tattooed  face frowns,  he descends the villages gates - back into his respective village he went.

"I'm done. I'm afraid you've made this visit for no reason, Lord-Kazekage. I will visit you at a later date if you permit me. But you will not come into Kumogakure. Nor will I speak to you now. The wounds of your betrayal to my land are too fresh. For now it should suffice that I still continue to maintain my deal with giving you goods... Farewell."* - Fri Dec 11 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <Curse his good nature...> Eiyu smiles. It was something that he had done a lot - though the outside world probably hadn't seen much of it in all truthfulness. The Raikage of Kumogakure adorns a pair of gloves on his hands before the massive gates open revealing the revamped village. It was beautiful - with mountains interlacing between giant walls to keep the outside wolrd out. From their tall buildings with shinobi posted sentry - It was just possible to get a glimpse of it all - it's was a complex nation that trumped Konoha. Which was odd considering he forced Sunagakure away. Where was he getting this revenue?

"Go home. If you allow it, I will pay a visit to the Land Of Wind. I have heard what you've had to say, and I agree with you - You are an acceptable Kazekage and Sunagakure is lucky to have you."* - Fri Dec 11 06:16:44 2015

"You really shouldn't do that.." He responds with frustration.. <So much for that attempt.> 

"You scared me to death."* - Fri Dec 11 11:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) <What's she doing?> Eiyu's eyes sharpened when she lunged forward - he took into account of her nature, and then his bleeding finger and put two, and two together. Though he seems to relax some when she reaches for his wrist - in the end his index finger is reeled into the depths of her mouth. The subtle tinge of pain working in tandem with her tongue work aroused his senses greatly.

"N-No!" He knew that this sort of thing was dangerous as well seeing as she devoured Takuma's arm in seconds. He attempts to reclaim his finger from her mouth.

He also had to account for the fact she was crouched beside him. While he was still on the ground he begins to push himself backwards. "I'm not food, Death-Chan!"* - Fri Dec 11 12:03:34 2015

<Too much is left to the imagination, more!> Though, his thoughts were interupted by her comment, and while her comment was savage in his its own right he couldnt help but feel blood pooling to a certain body member of his. 

He shifts to the side - his hands non-chalantly cementing at the front in order to conceal this. It was the curse of being a man, or the curse of this tight Jump suit rather.* - Fri Dec 11 12:17:13 2015

It was just within his nature, he couldn't help who he was, and as much as he tried to conceal it in the past things just came out.

"You know...." His voice dies off knowing good and well she would tease him about this in the future.

"I'm fine..." Though before all of this he is reminded of when Haku returned and Yuriko was holding hands with. The male wouldnt have done such a thing if he hadn't connected with her on a deep level. He felt shame for reacting how he did after seeing her flashing skirt.

"I'm sorry." He scratches the back of his head. "It won't happen again.. You just caught me off guard Y'Know?"* - Fri Dec 11 12:26:36 2015

No doubt Konohagakure was on the brink of collapse. He knew Sunagakure didn't give a damn so long as their supplies reached them. He was curious to see if Rias was still alive, had she perished there might be an opprutunity to help the people, though in the end it would be up to them if they decided to accept.
