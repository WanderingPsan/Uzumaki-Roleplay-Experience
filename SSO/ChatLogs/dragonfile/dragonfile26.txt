<br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||Several jutsu formulas were driven into parchment, his chakra was like a covering over these folds of paper. This life he imbued into the various papers that were already heavy with his vitality. His prowess in Fuuinjutsu was growing, but he still was lacking in several areas. For one, it took a bit too long in order for him create seals. He wanted to be able to create them spur of the moment because in the battlefield you were not given too many chances to react to anything.

"So thats..." He begins to compress all of the tools at his feet into the layers of parchment. <I can't believe it...> Yes, there was vast improvement in just a short period of time, and this was something that blonde haired teen enjoyed. His progress was something to behold, and even now he hadnt even yet reached the tip of the ice-berg in-terms of jutsu...

There was a vast collection of jutsu, and skills he intended to pick up. He wanted to visit other nations in the hopes maybe they would have something to teach him. Was he a leech? Well, that was a matter of perspective, it was true that he was trying his hardest to learn from those to teach him, but he would aslo show them techniques and skills that he had learned. It really wasn't much of anything but hopefully it would serve enough where he would at least be listened to.

"I must work on going to Kirigakure at some-point..."* - Sun Oct 11 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) let's his chakra levels descend. Now that this was complete he brings his palms together, said fingers closing over one another. The ram seal was formed, the combination of his chakra rising, and his skill with this technique made for a lackluster display. Too much process is wasted trying to break himself from a bind that never existed in the first place.* - Sun Oct 11 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <I've got this...> Once more he forces his chakra flow to come to an end, and then he is able to go through with this next step. Next, his body was flooded with his own chakra that was being regulated through his entire body.* - Sun Oct 11 16:33:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I'm not Sunagakure... Kilm told me he was staying here, and I came for him... - Sun Oct 11 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I couldn't find him though. - Sun Oct 11 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) was getting annoyed by this constant back and forth struggle. Sunagakure wasn't accepting anyone else, and he was forced outside as if he was nothing more than trash. Yet again he was forced to eat his words, and had to deal with the drama of being unwanted. For someone who reached out for so many he was starting to feel isolated. It wasn't a good feeling at all, it must be similar to what Heiwa felt. The child was strong-willed, but even Nozumi knew that he was suffering because the same could be said for him.

In all honesty it was useless thinking about all of these things when he had training to do. So, he begins anew by cutting his chakra flow entirely, and then he allows it to rise, it's essence expanding and growing with every-waking second. "I see..." His prowess in Genjutsu disruption was improving tenfold, and he could tell that it wouldn't be long before he had this under-wraps. <I really need to work on the other technique I learned once I'm done with this....> * - Sun Oct 11 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) ||It seems that Nozumi was going to start all over again. If there was one thing he needed to improve it would be his chakra control. The basis of manipulating ones celestial energies was one of mind, and body and he hadn't had the chance to refine either. But even with small training tasks such as these he was able to do so. It made him happy to a certain degree, but he also knew he had a lot of work to do if he was going to master Kai.

Yet again his chakra is no longer running freely though his body, and instead replaced with calm. His entire chaka nexus has gone dark, but in that moment his nodes spark, chakra returning in strong waves. The end result being a sudden 'snap' against Genjutsu if one were present.

* - Sun Oct 11 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) could see other people in the distance attempting to get their own training underway. Men and women dressed in casual clothing were throwing ninja stars at targets they intended to hit. They were misses though, it was easy to tell they were fresh, and it actually brought a smile to the boy's face. "You have to give yourself some slack. If you aim directly for your target you will find yourself that you need to give some lead. Otherwise, you will not always hit your target.."

Their faces lit up when they hit their mark, both of them bowing respectfully before stepping away to do what they needed. "Thank you, Nozumi-San." 
Now it was time for him to train, and what better way to get that underway by working on the Genjutsu disruption technique otherwise known as Kai.

"Hnnnn.." Both of his hands clasp slam together, and his chakra is quiet, only for it to kick up at the last second, a storm of his own energy promptly rising and possibly ending any sort of potential genjutsu that was tossed against him. * - Sun Oct 11 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <This is getting tiring....> Gradual process was just that. Cutting off the source of his chakra was vital at this point. When it was cut the energy inside of his core is ignited. His form is saturated with azure energy that only seemed to get stronger by the second.  This process was something Nozumi worked tooth and nail to master. But it was also something that was vital, and he couldn't stop until he was done.* - Sun Oct 11 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) set's the scroll on his back against the wall. "Let's see..." His hands were just recently washed so he makes his way to the table, opening the menu to see what he could order. Chicken and dumplings were the first on the list followed by a cup of sake, and an extra helping of miso. "Tired..." The Uzumaki rubs his eyes and waits for his food to arrive.* - Sun Oct 11 17:27:02 2015

This matter wasn't really a personal one anymore, these people were fighting in plain sight around the citizens of Konohagakure. There was no unity, everyone, and everything seemed to conflict everyday. Nozumi remained quiet for large portions of time, usually spending his effort on personal reflection over happenings around the village but this...

He had to say something.
"If... He was named the Hokage then we just have to accept it... I don't care what your problems are,but as a Konoha shinobi I'm telling you guy's what is going on is wrong.... Too many people are fighting over nothing.... I.."

His eyes trail to the ground.

Secondly, I've spoken to Sunagakure, and they've told me no Konohagakure shinobi are allowed in.....

 If you would allow me the man-power to work on the mansion for you I can get a few things done... Oh, and I've spoken to a man named Kilm who wants to help Konoha as well, and he used to be a Chuunin.. I talked him into returning-.. I was also told you wanted to kill him, but I do think the more people we have working here would be for the best... There are more Konoha shinobi out there...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) 's chakra level lowers until it is cut off completely. The ram seal allows him to fold his fingers together thus giving birth to chakra rising through his core. This mixture elevates rapidly, and manages to have his vitality sent into a sporadic ascent. There was a faint azure building within his core, and served as the medium to break  Genjutsu techniques should such tactics be employed against him. * - Sun Oct 11 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Sigh....> Nozumi had so much time to himself because in this village he was nothing. People ignored him like a piece of trash at their feet, and it would be a lie to say that it didn't upset him. Sure, there were people like Kilm who listened to him, but as long as he was weak he knew that there was always going to be that person who didn't give a fuck about what he had to say.

"Let me not get-side tracked this time.." He mutters to himself.
He forms the ram seal and the chakra inside of his body slows to a halt, and then after a few seconds it is kicked into high gear. The change actually enough to cause the sand beneath his feet to stir slightly. In this short gust of wind he had attempted to use Kai.* - Sun Oct 11 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Let's give it another go...> The chakra inside of his body is cut again. Because of this he knew what the next step that would follow said action. For a while his progress is slowed however, in the momentary ceasing of his chakra flow he is reminded of the events of the past. It bothered him greatly that he had to deal with the fact his entire life was a game of chance. Being in this village with people he didn't know, only to go to Konohagakure shortly was a back and forth struggle. 

"I just need to tell Sensei how I am feeling..." <Ohh...> His chakra returns in-time for him to unearth a plum of dust beneath his feet which eventually settle entirely. He looks into the horizon at the gleaming sun, and smiles.
"Beautiful..." Even though he was no longer in his home, he is reminded of it's light because in the end they all shared the same star.* - Sun Oct 11 22:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) didn't have many options inside of this village so he decided to continue with his training. Nozumi was quite honestly at a loss though, he wasn't really about Konoha's situation, and there was nothing he could really do about it. These thoughts always racked his concentration, and made him feel like he was useless. The other people in his village spent their time getting stronger, and doing missions with one another and he was isolated. 

The people who he did try to bring closer seemed to dislike his company. <Guess it'll just take time.. Gotta worry about myself anyone..> He crosses his hands together and just like that his chakra level is dropping rapidly, only for it to spark wildly, the energy reaches it's highest limit hopeully enabling him to break Genjutsu when the need arised.* - Sun Oct 11 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) had to start training himself from the ground up all over again. The process of breaking Genjutsu was an easy one, especially since he was starting to see progress. He had all but mastered the technique, now all he needed was to keep going with it. "I'm getting better..."* - Sun Oct 11 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) <Come on...> Nozumi had used a lot of chakra in the attempt to master Kai correctly. It wasn't enough to kill him, but he was starting to feel tired. He could feel the sweat building on his chest that showed through his clothing. "Ugh.." He wipes a few drops from his brow, and smiles. "Here we go..." The ram seal is sustained carefully, and he is left with shutting his chakra flow off entirely. Then, he kicks it into over-drive, the buildup of energy and it's sudden release was designed to break him from Genjutsu, hopefully with minimal effort.* - Sun Oct 11 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) "*Sigh"* Thus began Nozumi's attempt in trying to establish a means to further train the jutsu at hand. Once more the chakra flow through. He follows this action by forming the ram seal and morphing the chakra inside of his body to manifest once more. The combination of these two actions enable him to break low-level Genjutsu with ease. There was still one problem and that was the fact he hadn't entirely mastered it but that was something he intended to fix shortly.* - Sun Oct 11 23:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) nods, his eyes squint carefully. He needed to take something to take away this feeling, but it was something he questioned. "Why, you want money for it, right?"* - Mon Oct 12 00:06:24 2015

We were all heart-broken when he heard our leadership fled, that caused a lot of other people to leave as well."* - Mon Oct 12 00:36:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: So you don't desire going back? - Mon Oct 12 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) had to admit he was bitter over the past. He wondered why the people who had sworn to protect their region would leave it so quickly. But in all honesty he truly understood why Katsune had done what she did, she was trying to survive, and casually throwing her lie to the side to confront some immortal was less simply foolish. 

Tears stream down the blonde haired male's face, after promptly wiping his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket he smiles softly.

"I see, and I finally understand.... I'm not angry anymore, I'm just sad that I couldn't have helped you, but Konohagakure needs you, we need you, and by inheritance.. I need you as well... Just like I need Kilm.. We can't do it without you guys.."* - Mon Oct 12 00:46:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I also told him that after that; I'm going back to Konoha to see it revived. - Mon Oct 12 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: At that time I'll show up and make sure Konoha's what Orokuru wanted it to be. - Mon Oct 12 00:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm's a great teacher. Whoever he teaches will grow up to be on a jounin's level in no time at all. After that maybe they'll rape or kill or whatever -- something he doesn't realize. But the fact remains. He'll make you strong. - Mon Oct 12 00:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Thank you, Katsune, and I will do whatever I can to help you.. But I'm afraid for now. - Mon Oct 12 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I cannot do much of anything, but I won't waste anymore of your time. - Mon Oct 12 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't be so sure you're wasting my time. - Mon Oct 12 00:59:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) extends his left arm into the air, his right hand grips his bicep. He stands tall, both of his blue eyes descend. 

The previous Hokage stood in his midst, he was star-struck to have met someone so important but he did a good job of acting as if she was just a normal person.

His demeanor seemed innocent, and in all honesty he was, but he still wore the Konohagakure headband, he was still a shinobi, and he would do what he had to that would secure his peopes fate.

He keeps this pose for a while before suddenly speaking to make his silence less awkward.

"If I keep meeting people, and helping them realize that they are needed perhaps I will realize my Nindo. Heh.. But I promise, Katsune.. I will do all in my power to make sure you, and my Sensei are safe in the future."* - Mon Oct 12 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I'll start my training now... IT was good speaking to you. - Mon Oct 12 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) "..." Nozumi looks at the floor, and then back up at Beth. "I see.. Uh, what you been up to?"* - Mon Oct 12 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Other then recovering from a two on one. Nothing much. - Mon Oct 12 02:08:25 2015
