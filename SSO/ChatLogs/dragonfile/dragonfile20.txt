<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Waiter." Kojiro points to the table. "Sake, keep them coming until one of us drop." Kojiro is given his first cup, and he downs it instantly. "Nice."* - Mon Oct  5 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) ||"Well, fuck..." Kojiro is slid a cup of sake, the tips the warm fluid down his throat, it went down like fire, same as always. He was feeling okay or the time being, he kept his poker-face, remaining stoic about what was currently going on. He was going to have him think he could keep this up all day, but in reality he needed to regulate everything. IF he didnt' he was going to lose.* - Mon Oct  5 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Gonna own this shit.." Kojiro takes another swig of the acrid fluid, his nostrils flare as the fluid began to work it's way through his system. He could feel himself starting to sweat, and his heart-rate increase. The sake went down, but this time it didn't burn as much, and in-fact it started to feel warm. It was a sign he was buzzed.

<Damn...>
He empties the cup into his mouth.* - Mon Oct  5 06:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Yeah." Kojiro prepares to empy the remaining flluid from the next Sake cup into his mouth. He seemed to be holding out rather well, all things considered but he knew it would only be a matter of time before he was fucked over. He had to be careful, he could swear the room was spinning, or maybe he was. "Down the hatch."* - Mon Oct  5 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "What's wrong? You seem to be getting a little flustered?" Kojiro muttered the words, there was a slight slur to what he said but nothing too profound. Kojiro brings the cup against his lips and swallows. "Damn.." The shots were adding up and even though he wasn't as jacked as his friend he still was feeling the liquor getting to him, his brain, and the rest of his body.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <Fuck....> It seemed his opponent wasn't going to go down so easily. Kojiro cursed his luck. "FUCKING WaITER, hurry up with this fucking shit before I gut you..." More glasses were tossed towards the two, five cups on his left side. he grabs two cups at once and downs them both before looking at the table. "Oh shit...." He was starting to see double.* - Mon Oct  5 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Fuck..." Kojiro was getting upset, there were two more cups at his side which he grabbed and promptly downed. But this time he paused, he had to contain himself, and make sure he didn't lose it, but at this point it was obvious that he was drunk. But still, he controlled his liquor and looked at the male in his eyes. "Let'sh.. See... Yoush. One up me. *Hiccup*"* - Mon Oct  5 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Hey, drunk.." Kojiro muttered as he got off the table, or well, stumbled. He was drunk off of his ass, and was happy to see that he had won. He wasn't going to take anymore-shots or he would be fucked up, perhaps even beyond Amon current state. 

"Pay back' isn bitch.." He all but falls over his rival and slaps his left butt-cheek, hard enough to leave an imprint when he woke, and then, like the true savage he was he starts to fuck up the Cafe in anyway possible.

||Then it began, the two males erupted into a mass of heavy blows and bodily fluids that were strewn everywhere. Kojiro's fist makes it's way for the nearest individual, and he aims to land a ram's head punch onto his solar plexus. The man is sent fllying across various tables, and slides crashes and strikes his head against a nearby post. Splintered tables bent under the males momentum, and it seemed it had only yet begun for the Yamanashi. 

"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!" He was struck in the face by a wooden post, in the back of the head to be exact, in response he reaches for the males head and slams his skull into the table in front of him repeatedly, each time he had done so the shop was rock with a miniature shock-wave of discontent.* - Mon Oct  5 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) Kirie would notice Kojiro's chakra flare, she was intelligent to watch, and due to the speed at which lightning coursed through his being she would no doubt see how dangerous an opponent he could really be. But still, he wasn't as imposing as he could be, this was his attempt to free himself of her grasp, not really to attack her, but, he still had the desire to go on a rampage, but several factors played in.* - Mon Oct  5 07:28:00 2015

It's not like he was able to fight her, he was drunk, and he was injured from his previous battle. It didn't make for a good mixture truth be told. "...Ugh...." So, it seemed Kojiro's technique had the opposite that he intended, there was no way he could've foreseen such a thing happening, nor would he even really remember what happened.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) felt a warm energy permeate his injury, it's essence was able to speed up his metabolic rate closing the gash he had in his body. It was enough to bring him around, and he looks about the room. They had been moved from their previous location, and now they were in a building that was known for being vacant. The young man manages to lean his back against the wall, and looks about the room. "...Uh.... Damn... " He looks at the door-knob and tilts his head to the side.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) ||Kumogakure was littered with giant rocks, even around the manor one could easily find a formidable rock-formation. "Fuck.." The man's ebony hands press into the cold surface of the stone, he could feel the rough ridges bite into his arm-bandages but he didn't care. "Ready when you are."* - Mon Oct  5 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) nods his head to show that he understood. "We got this. Hrhng..." Kojiro's hands push against the rock-formation with all of the force he coul muster. He was doing well initially, his powerful legs, as well as working in tandem with his arms, and back muscles was more than enough to propel the massive structure upwards, and thats where his progress ended. "Oh fuck...." He finds himself exactly where he started. "What the fuck!?"* - Mon Oct  5 08:51:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Yeah, it's not as easy as you thought, heh.." Kojiro braces the massive rock-formation, his arms were dug in, he resume the proper stance with partially bent legs and arms. He drove the boulder across the pile like a mighty piston, sadly this piston was running on fumes. The boulder began to fight back against his attempt, and Kojiro began to descend, even with the resistane he provided his sandals carved the ground at his feet. 

He failed to make any ground whatsosoever. He simply slid down.* - Mon Oct  5 08:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) didn't want to be upstaged by anything or anyone. The three of them were working to move these boulders , and their attempts were all met with success initially. Sadly it such things wouldn't continue, the massive rock began it's ascent however due to the the rigidity of the rock it was starting to take a  toll on his muscle fibers. He did his best to dig in but it simply didn't do anyting at this point.. He was testing the limits of the human body which was a combination of physicality and mental endurance. "Come on....!!!" He roars, but the boulder screvms back and pushes him back. 

He was helpless for the time being, all he could manage to do was to cling to te edge with all of his might. Beads of sweat saturated his forehead, his forearms, and any other place of exposed flesh. The only mark of his will were the small depressions left in the ground from his acceleration that was promptly cut off.* - Mon Oct  5 09:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <Fuck... .Is this guy serious?> He was being over-shadowed by Maloth's strength. He didn't show any signs of stopping at all, it was like seeing a human locomotive pusing an unreal amount of material like he had done this on an everyday basis. "Come on...." He thought he'd be able to best Amon, but it really didn't even matter if he did or not. 

Whatever slight amount of accomplishment he could obtain from defeating his rival was thrown out the window when Maloth came into the picture. The white haired adult was putting everything into this boulder. The veins in his arms pop out of his skin, low grunts escape his lips, he timed his rolling of the stone with each time he managed to exhale. It was working well for a while but the rock was simply too heavy, and he was not yet strong enough.

<Fuck..... Get all of those doubts out of your head... You -are- strong enough to muscle your way through this... I won't........ Be ..... Made a fool of anymore!!!> 

He prepares for his next attempt, but all he could manage for the time being was holding it's position. He wasn't making any ground.* - Mon Oct  5 09:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) reaches for her waist. "Come on.."* - Mon Oct  5 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) stopped midway, he turned to his sister. It wasn't really suggested that someone of her age should be drinking, and even for a shinobi sobriety was important. 
"Depends how you look at it... Sides, I'm not even asking you to have a whole gallon, just a littke cup to help you relax some. That so bad?"* - Mon Oct  5 14:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Good.. When you see how it feel's you're going to thank me." Kojiro chuckles before reaching for his sisters arm. He would run to their destination actually excited to see how his sister reacted to drinking a small amount of Sake.
* - Mon Oct  5 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) ||The owner of the shop seemed to be very upset when he saw Kojiro. There were broken desks everywhere and some of the patrons had bandages over thier noses, and some over their arms. <Guess I shouldn't tell her that I went crazy here and fucked people up...> "Uh, I'd like a few rounds of Sake.. They're all for me.." The owner looked at him like he was insane.
"You fucking serious, kid? You fucked up this shop once before...."
"Trust me... I won't be a problem, but I do want what I have ordered.." 
Several cups of Sake were placed before them, Kojiro slides one to his sister. 
"Drink."* - Mon Oct  5 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) laughed at his sisters reaction and her inquiry. "I had a drinking contest with a friend and things took a turn for the worst, no big deal." He rubs her back softly, his eyes remain on the cup however. He watched with a glimmer of mischievousness hoping she would finally drink. 

"Do you want me to start it off?" He reaches for a nearby cup, and attempts to bang their cups together into formal gesture.

"Cheers."* - Mon Oct  5 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) set the cup against the brim of his lips and the drink was gone into the depths of his throat. It went down like fire much like before, but the bitter-sweet taste of the Sake was something Kojiro thoroughly enjoyed.

"Do you like it?" 
* - Mon Oct  5 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Do you want to try one more? - Mon Oct  5 15:07:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Drinking Sake is the only ting that helps me settle down.. Well, besides the onsen. - Mon Oct  5 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) slides his sister another cup. He remains silent for the duration of the next cup that he drinks. Still, he would be okay with having two shots, and probably would not even be buzzed. He was a heavy drinker, and it was funny because he didn't even know if he was allowed to have Sake, the legal age was a mystery to him, and if the Raikage saw him there was no telling what he'd say.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) "Oh, you're getting buzzed." Kojiro wasn't going to have her drink anymore, especially when she was so reluctant beforehand. He supports her head resting on his body, she no doubt would be able to hear the faint mumur of his heart-beat pulsing through his chest. "You want to go to the house? I know you like studying, and all and I can look out for you there.. I don't think you want to drink this anymore do you?"* - Mon Oct  5 15:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) carries his sister away, with her arms wrapped around his body. "Got it." 

THe owner looks at him. 
"You have to pay for those drinks."
"Put it on my tab."* - Mon Oct  5 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) sets his sister on the bed, and sits on the edge. "You alright, sis?"* - Mon Oct  5 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Take off that jacket.. - Mon Oct  5 15:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: I wanted to talk to you about the fact that you're getting older... - Mon Oct  5 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Well, you are a woman by the worlds standards, and mine. - Mon Oct  5 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Hmm. - Mon Oct  5 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: Yeah. . ? - Mon Oct  5 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) leans forward, almost as if there was some pinnning motion to his movements. He reaches for his sisters wrists, and pulls himself so that his forehead was touching hers. "There are things in this world that are horrible, and I will attempt you to protect you from them... We are kin, but the Yamanshi clan must prosper, and I want you to know that.... I've watched over you, and I protected you but... What's even more important is our legacy.... I'm sorry..." Kojiro leans forward and attempts to suck on the side of her neck, and in the same motion gropes her breasts lightly.

"You will bear our children in the future."* - Mon Oct  5 15:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) pulls up his pants. The deed had been done.
He looks at his sister with a faint smile on his face. To him, he hadn't done anything wrong. "You okay?"* - Mon Oct  5 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) understood that while he did in-fact steal her virginity they were still blood, and by tradition, and their culture it was simply a matter of time. To keep clans pure, interbreeding became verbatim, though with Kumogakure's advances in genetics, and other concepts of what right, and wrong should be there were still lingering ideals of what family was, and what their duty consisted of. The Yamanshi males were different in the fact they were sexually charged, and while Kojiro could've found anyone to have sex with her didn't want that. To have a pureblooded son, or daughter was something that he wanted.

He had deflowered his sister, and had taken a great risk by doing so. So, imagine his surprise when she leaned forward to kiss his lips, he reaches for the back of her had and pulls her inward, using his tongue to venture into the depths of her mouth, they would share their passionate embrace.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) scratches the back of his head, obviously confused by his man's get-up. He turns to face him. "Yo?"* - Mon Oct  5 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) ||His chakra was normal, no unique patterns were present upon his form. He blinks rapidly, confused by the males illuminated eye. "Who wants to know?"* - Mon Oct  5 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) tilts his head to the side. He was confused by the man's presence, not because he wished to remain anonymous, it was because of what he was saying was very dangerous. The Raikage often talked about the Gezo, and it is where they were able to get top quality supplies, but there was also talk among fellow comrades that the atrocities that were commited were unacceptable.

"New era? Not ruled by the Gezo?" Kojiro's eyes close momentarily, he brings his left hand which was bandaged and bloodied onto his forehead, his index and middle finger massage his temple.

"You talk as if you're insane.. You know that is impossible right...? The Gezo is... Well, they are Gods... Is this a test to prove my loyalty to them? I've done nothing wrong."* - Mon Oct  5 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) <Can be killed...?> Kojiro hadn't really seen the crimes the Gezo had commited. If anything he had heard from other peoples mouths about how people have to beg at the knee to satisfy their commands, and any mention of an attack against them was enough to make people run away. Kojiro was truly conflicted about what this man was saying, sure, he didn't like the Gezo either, but he wasn't ready to go against them, especially when he was so weak... 

But that's just it..
<I'm only as weak as I believe myself to be...>
He looks at his bandaged forearm, and the crusted bloodmatter that stained the cloth. His eyes avert to the humanoid, with the orange mask that concealed his facial features.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) sported a muscular build, he had various scars planted on random portions of his body. His right eye was a bit puffy indicating a blunt force trauma wound. He stood at six foot two, but other than that he seemed to be average. "Yeah, I will admit.. I don't want to be a toy." Said eye threw him off, just looking at the bed of crimson put him off, but in all honesty he cared nothing for it's apperance. He was more interested in hearing what the man was about.

He was silent for a moment.
