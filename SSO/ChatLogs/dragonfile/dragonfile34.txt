Hmph.
"In a matter of seconds scrolls were released from the confines of his hand- or at least a single scroll in particular.

"I wonder..."
He unseals the matter within seconds. There was a single windmill shuriken spinning off the surface of his fingers, it spun like a buzz-saw at a rapid pace with several explosive tags planted underneath.

He throws directly at her knowing good and well she'd be able to dodge.
"It's over... How about some tea now?"
Of course he wasn't going to activate the tags on the shuriken, but it was to get her attention that had this been a real battle, she could've very well been dead. That is if everything went as planned.

She's really making this harder for me..> Regardless of her supposed dexterity, attempting to catch an oscillating windmill after it gained momentum is a nigh impossible feet. It'd be like attempting to grab a single blade of a fan spinning at high speed. It moves with such intensity it is almost as if the individual blades had become a solid. Regardless, the male forms the seal needed to ignite the explosive tag as he reads her movements coming as they did.

Her movements were fast enough, but were not instantaneous, that was her down-fall.

The explosion that follows would no dobut be able to knock her old cold, couple in the fact that the wolves had slacked off, they would now tread forward as she had seemingly forgotten about them as well. 

Through all of this Eiyu manages to create the distance he needs.* - Sat Nov 21 21:34:04 2015

He forms a single headseal in time to for her descent, the clone manages to make his way towards the lass and offer her his hand. If she took said hand he would help her to her feet before fading away into a plum of smoke.

"But that's what being a shinobi is all about, anticipating your opponents weakness, and exploting them." His gaze travels to her feet. 

"You need to learn how to move faster. Though, I will give you points on being reactive." Eiyu seemed to be -very- tired after doing the jutsu he had just done as well.

"You've certainly earned yourself a Moniker, but I don't know what to call you.. Green and mean? Green-Lean? ...No, no.. None of that is right..> The Earth wolves crumble into nothingness.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) removes her clothing provided she didn't wake up in the midst of it, and attempts to outfit her with exactly the same clothing she had before. He folds her dirty-clothes into a neat pile by her bed-side, and opens a book before descending into a nearby chair.

He would wait for her to awake.
<It's been a long time since I've seen an exposed body like that.. It's a good thing I'm not perverted..>

In his hand he was holding the latest edition of Hentai monthly.* - Sat Nov 21 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) odds are, after waking up her cognitive reflexes were going to be delayed, also considering she had just plopped she had to be notably fatigued. This allows him the time he needs to elude her grip.

"Oi, what do you take me for?" His chair goes streaking across the floor. The rucus was enough to catch the attention of the guards of Sunagakure as well.

'What's going on?'

"Uh, this is really awkward... Someone thinks I raped them?"
The guards bust out laughing, not giving a care in the world. 
"We''ll come in if we hear anyone dying."* - Sat Nov 21 22:31:15 2015

He would like to note he was too far to grab her of course, she was already at the door.

"I tried taking you to your house, but you're homeless.... I brought you here so you could get clean, and I was going to make you something to eat... Just wait till then... Please..?"* - Sat Nov 21 22:37:13 2015

"To make things even.." He begins to unclip the top portion of his robe, the hooks fall to the floor with an audible clank leaving his exposing chest for her to see. Said fabric parts even further to reveal his lean abdomen, and small navel.

He was defined with muscle that was for sure.
"I will cook in the same manner you found yourself." He opens the firdge. Oddly enough, his fridge was stocked with spinach.
Not that weak shit in the can either, but the actual vegetation.

"I know you said thats pretty much all you eat... So I kinda.. Thought ahead?"
He shrugs. 

"We'll have salad, and... " He looks around his cabinet.
"Do you drink?" He'd reach for two Sake glasses and toss them onto the table, wherein he fills both of their cups with the liquid.* - Sat Nov 21 22:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) descends. His white hair blowing freely thanks in part to his ceiling fan. He folds his hands over the table into a neat dome. Menia would've most certainly thought he was up to now good when all he was doing was being a good guy.
 There was a cloud of gloom that followed Eiyu's head at this point.

<You would think... With everything I said these people would believe I actually don't go around doing evil things.. I'm not even a pervert..>

"Guess I'll eat this ..Then.." He fills his sake glass for two as he watches Menia leave his manor.

He positions the glasses on adjacent sides of the table and mutters.
"Cheers."

He throws a picture on the other side of the desk, the person in the picture had long red hair, and blue eyes. Though, on the sides of her cheeks she sported freckles, and there was a sort of radiance on her flesh that made her photogenic.

The first shot does little to dull his depression, but instead dulls his throat. The next would dull his mind.
He reaches for the bowl of spinach, and chews on it's verdant ridges slowly.

It was an empty gesture, he felt no feeling of sustenance, if anything it simple kept him alive.
"I apologize."
From here on out he seems to be living in his own thoughts, no longer concerned about her, or even himself for that matter.

He smiles softly as the liquor helps him to reminisce of better times.* - Sat Nov 21 22:57:42 2015

Then, after doing so he'd slide it into his back-pouch. "Thank you. I promise you I did nothing wrong to you, and I would never do so in the future. He makes his way to the fridge again, and tosses in a slab of meat.

"Kobe-Beef.. It goes well with spinach, though I take it you're not a meat eater like your cousin... Sorry, I just have to eat a little meat." When it started to brown he'd toss it on his place, along with miso sauce he had prepared earlier.

"Would you like anything else.?" He'd nudge her bowl across the table, and pull her chair out for her to sit.* - Sat Nov 21 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) "Promise not to send me flying through the roof.." He chides, he still managed to cling to a portion of his humor despite having a sense of loss, and confusion. He was able to cover it up well enough, but things in his life served as triggers. Much like Menia departing when he offered her dinner. But now she had decided to eat, rather it be out of her wanting to, or out of pity for the Minatabi was something he hadn't yet figured out.

"He takes another bite."
"Tell me, Menia.. If you had to rate one thing that is the most important thing in your life, what would it be?"

He swallows down hard.* - Sat Nov 21 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) was surprised that she had nothing to live for. He expected that there would be at least one thing she enjoyed about her life, but he was starting to understand that she was a clean slate. In a way, Kumogakure was the paint brush to the canvas, well, what did this make him? The painter?

<We'll have to figure out squads soon if more people continue to join our armed forces..> Eiyu takes another bite of his foot - however his fork tilts downward, and his arm freezes.

He is able to feel the warmth of her body.
"It seems its getting a little hot in here." 

He begins to eat slower, deliberately.
If anything, just having here there would be enough, he was innocent in most respects, if not a little annoying.* - Sat Nov 21 23:32:41 2015

This method of training will ensure that you not only improve your body, but also the mind. Both of you have already shown me you're more than capable to handle this."

He continues.

"I have created a provision called the 'Pit'. This is where shinobi test their might against different creatures. However, where the goal of most exercises are to kill, you will be doing the exact opposite. You will not kill the creature. Rather, you must incapacitate the predator, as prey. I won't lie to you, this isn't exactly safe but I think you ae ready for it."

It felt to be something that Niklaus would've built during his time as Raikage. Eiyu takes his place above the stand, and directs the three of them to leap into the 'Pit.' 

The rounded building had gates on all cardinal points. They were -massive- creations that were reinforced with steel. *Tsssst* The sound of heavy breathing filled the arena, beady crimson eyes lit the Northern gate with darkness. 

The armored titans chains had been released, it's massive feet slam into the ground with so much force small tremors racked the vicinity. It's head lowers, an armored talon descends it aimed to impale all three of them where they stood.

"Let's begin."

Eiyu claps.

"I'm proud of the both of you as you adapted rather nicely and used teamwork."
"When we form squads, expect for Eiji to be the leader. Especially if he continues to outperform the rest of you. Next, I see Takuma becoming a very promising prospect, but Menia... You need to step your game up..."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) chuckles. He wasn't going to involved in their skirmish, as the Raikage he could only do so much. He had given Eiji a difficult task, one that he expected the male would satisfy. "Eiji, I entrust you with your squad. You know what to do." He nods softly before stepping away.

"There will be a period of time where Sunagakure troops will escort you around the village, but this is only so you will get adjusted, and so they can monitor your movements. I suggest you will not take offense to that, as that is verbatim."

Eiyu's right brow ascends towards the long haired male in the corner of the room.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) ||"I see." Eiyu took note of his demeanor and simply assumed his journey had been a rough one. Caravan's were subject to attack, and some rides were simply terrible because they were low quality. There was nothing to dispute any of what he said, if anything he would've been questioned by some garbed in Sunagakure gear, and as long as he didn't have a Kirigakure headband in his possession the process was sure to be as smooth as silk.

"Nice to meet you."
Eiyu's eyes rotate to Asteroth. He says nothing, he simply looks her up and down before turning his attention to both Eiji, and the child. 

"I suppose that's all we're going to do today. Remember what I have told you because it's not going to be delayed."

<I have faith....They will not fail...>
