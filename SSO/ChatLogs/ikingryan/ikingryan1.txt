<br><font color=yellow>*Sasume(IKingRyan) coming to what it may be the center of the leaf village but now territory of Amegakure and another alliance member they have. Sasume was young when this started and was brought into the academy to be trained into a ninja at the age of eight. He was a essential prodigy at being a ninja and passed quite early and became a genin.
"Hey Sir."
Sasume said as he stopped infront of Zetsumo.* - Sat Sep 05 05:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sasume(IKingRyan) would stare at the man as he would look at him with his eyes that were pure black and engulfed with darkness. Sasume was getting tired of living this way around these people and his life was ruined because of them but instead of acting stupid and getting himself killed he would try his best to become stronger.
"I'm going to be real with you. The academy I was put through was a joke, they didnt really test me in any sort of way it was too easy to pass. So... mind being my Sensei for now and training me so that I can actually become stronger.?"
Sasume asked with a dull expression on his face as if it was a drag for him to even speak out his mouth, or he was feeling extra lazy and irritated today.* - Sat Sep 05 05:53:55 2015
