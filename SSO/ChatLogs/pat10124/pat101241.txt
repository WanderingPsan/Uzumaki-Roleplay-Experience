<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Uchiha's Hatred: This character carries the hate of the Uchiha with him. He is relentless, and hate driven. His power is boosted, and so is his mastery over the Sharingan. His power grows at a quickened pace, and he seeks to end not only the source of his hate, but all those connected to the source, and connected to his hate as well. He loses himself in hatred, and destroys everything to try and sate the insatiable urge which follows him. His strikes are much faster and stronger than the average fighter.
