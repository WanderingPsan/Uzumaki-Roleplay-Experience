<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) hums softly as he walks out into the middle of the park- whistling softly as he does, hands in his pockets and a lazy smile on his lips. He looks around- and sighs contently as he realizes he's alone.

"Ah... good.... no one nearby to muck with me.." The young man drawls out lazily, as he stretches out- and focuses. He breathes in, and out- as he readies himself. Everyone has to practice, after all...

And with that in mind- he begins to chant in a low voice in a forgotten tounge, words of ancient and terrible power. They are difficlt to pronounce- and as ever, he struggles with them.. as he calls to the dark energy within himself- and as he finishes the chant, lifts a thumb to his lip to bite into it; letting his blood annoint the dark magic he has gathered- as he brings forth a creature from the darkness...

A bat-like thing that flutters about him briefly- letting out screeing noises before twisting and shifting- morphing groteusquely into an orc-like thing of muscle and hide at which he nods slightly, smirking arrogantly.

"Ah.... yes, as useful as ever." He says proudly towards the beast- analyzing the monster he's called forth quietly.* - Sat Dec  5 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs after a while. It's not enough, after all- so he speaks a few harsh words, and lets the beast return to whence it came.

"Ah.... practice practice practice, but I never get anywhere.." He drawls idly- before turning to walk away- a sour frown on his face. * - Sat Dec  5 11:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) hums calmly as he rests against the wall- idly thinking on what he'd do to the current Hokage if he had a chance; chuckling faintly at the lewd thoughts running through his head- before shrugging them off as he reaches into his hoodie for a small item; a tiny black book with a jashinist symbol atop it.

He hums calmly as he leans back against the wall; and flips the book open. He dismisses thoughts of lewd tortures, in favor of thoughts of the mystical and arcane, as he begins to studiously plumb the lore on his summoned demons of choice.

He nods calmly- as he sets aside the tome- and begins to chant softly under his breath- ominous words spoken softly peeling from his lips as he summons forth one...* - Sat Dec  5 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) chuckles softly as the first Shingo flutters around through the air- then nods as he brings his hands together as if in prayer after sliding the book away- murmured prayers to lord Jashin shaping his will and the dark energy in his body- as he brings forth another beast from the netherworlds... chuckling faintly at the feeling- as he practices alone, in the desolate corners of Konoha.. smiling grimly.* - Sat Dec  5 14:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs- tucking away his tome and heading away from the dark corner of the village; dismissing the two Shingo back to the netherworld with a wave of his hand and a sigh as he slides the book away- gritting his teeth.

"...Shame I can't practice longer, but.. musn't get caught.."* - Sat Dec  5 14:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) hums calmly as he walks towards the scene- looking around with a crooked eyebrow and a warm smile.

"Hey now- what seems to be going on here, hrm..?"* - Sat Dec  5 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Nothings going on. - Sat Dec  5 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) crooks an eyebrow at that- then sighing faintly as he smiles warmly- looking on with a crooked eyebrow.

"Ah, nothing? Nothing, you say..? Why, my freind- it looks to me like a beautiful young woman is being left alone in the streets! Ah, how sad.." He says- his tone teasing and playful as he looks on, leaning into the fence- before holding up his hands.

"Ah, but it seems that is what she is prefering, non? How sad indeed, for one to chose loneliness and freindliness, indeed indeed!" he says with a sad smile- before looking towards Ryuusei and waving.

"Regardless, I dont' suppose I might make your aquiantance?"* - Sat Dec  5 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Tch. . . - Sat Dec  5 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: People are trouble Saika. . . - Sat Dec  5 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Remember that. - Sat Dec  5 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs gently and nods.

"Ah, ah- Gan, is what you may call me." He says warmly, waving gently. As the woman turns to walk past... he gives a flowery, gentle bow- smiling softly.

"And... ah, ah- no non, beautiful woman... please! One should not judge the whole garden by a few rotten flowers, no? While some people are irredemable scoundrels; you should surely know that there are yet a few radiant flowers in any garden- though, perhaps such flowers are.. ah, not so radiant as yourself, admitably!" He says- his teeth sparkling white and his tone playful and warm- confident and bright.

He makes a point of making eye contact, himself.* - Sat Dec  5 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) gasps aloud at the display, covering his mouth- then sighing sadly as he drops his head and shakes it, stroking his chin.

"Ah, what a shame that it has come to violence- still! Such rude staring is rather ungentlemanly, isn't it?" He says- sighing sadly as he starts to walk forwards, tapping his chin.

"Still! He did have at least one point, you know! The flower that secludes itself in darkness, is the blossom that withers away before long! One must have freinds to persist in the shadow- sharing strength emotional and otherwise between each other, for the sake of mutual growth, mhrm. WIth that in mind- perhaps you might refrain from wounding him too badly, and consider my offer to treat you to tea?" He suggests- a confident, gentle smile on the young mans face as he walks closer...* - Sat Dec  5 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) scratches his head and sighs- his expression a bit amused at the scene before him, and a bit bemused and suprised.

"Ah, wow... and, beautiful flower- why I may understand your dislike of the situation... the fact remains that in solitude, no flower may bloom to it's fullest potential. As for the rest.." He sighs- and walks in- smiling gently as he holds up his hands non threateningly.

"My freind- is it not obvious that this beautiful flower of a woman is clearly in pain from some past occurence? Why else would she be pushing away honest attempts at freindship, non? Clearly, she is wounded- calling harsh names will do no good for that!" He says empathically- before looking back towards Saika.

"Ah... as for perversion.... he was most likely simply unable to help himself- you are quite beautiful, you know!"* - Sat Dec  5 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs, as the girl moves to walk past him, and he steps to the side to let her...

"Ah.... beautiful flower- while I do not know your proper name.." She sighs, as she moves to walk past. He doesn't reach out to touch her- not wanting to annoy her more.. but he does move to walk beside her.

"I do know that you should not be suffering alone. You don't deserve to wallow alone in pain- but to be comforted and helped.. so, ah- even if you don't like people... surely, I can assist you..?" He says- warm, gentle... and then he chuckles softly.

"And certainly- I can reassure you. You don't seem like a bitch to me; simply someone who needs freinds."* - Sat Dec  5 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) chuckles softly and smiles as he continues to walk alongside her, hands in her pockets.

"I'd rather not, you know? I can't make freinds with people and get to know them better... by just staying away, non?"* - Sat Dec  5 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Huh? - Sat Dec  5 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs at the girls agression. She steps back from her- and holds up his hands.

"...Sorry. You know I just want to be freinds, yeah? Look.. if you're going to hurt me for trying to be freindly, fine... I guess that'd be pretty funny... but otherwise.." He just shrugs. 

'Otherwise, I'll just buy you some tea and head on, a'right?" He says with a gentle smile.* - Sat Dec  5 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Sat Dec  5 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: That ass though. - Sat Dec  5 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Sat Dec  5 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs. He's not checking her out like the other boy was- just looking at her in general. His eyes give no real indication of where she's staring; though he does sigh in a somewhat lovestruck fashion as she sashays away, frowning sadly.

"Ah, what a sadness.... still! I shall not impose upon a lady who does not desire my company, saddening though it may be to see such a beautiful flower pass from my gaze so sadly! I shall not disturb you further- but, should you reconsider, my offer of freindship stands forever open!!" He says almost melodramatically- sighing broadly- before turning to smile charmingly at Nigen.

"Ah, as for what is going on.. sadly, this most beautiful flower does not wish for freindship- and as my red haired companion had the ill manners to gaze upon her lewdly, it worsened her mood and caused her to assault him- which caused a saddening spiral of vaugely hilarious events.. and now, she is offendedly stalking away, ah, how dramatic and sad!"* - Sat Dec  5 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sat Dec  5 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Honestly.. - Sat Dec  5 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I don't understand what's up with you kids.. - Sat Dec  5 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) shrugs and sighs, leaning back.

"I don't get people either." He admits with a sigh.* - Sat Dec  5 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If anything, you all should be training. - Sat Dec  5 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) says: Yeah, probably... - Sat Dec  5 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..still.. - Sat Dec  5 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Sat Dec  5 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Listen, guys.. - Sat Dec  5 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're going to need to get along for the long haul. - Sat Dec  5 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So..do hang out for a while. Try to get to know one another. - Sat Dec  5 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) says: Hrm? Yeah.... I'm aware, of course. That's why I'm trying..! - Sat Dec  5 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) says: But... alas. - Sat Dec  5 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs- and does give parting words.

"Ah... goodbye! Talk to you another time, yeah? Hopefully when you're feeling more calm!" He says- fully planning to show up at the Ramen place she's heading to in a litle but; but also planning to give her some time to cool off..* - Sat Dec  5 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: What's her problem..? - Sat Dec  5 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) says: Hrm? Ah..! - Sat Dec  5 22:16:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ah, greetings. - Sat Dec  5 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Anything new happening with Kumogakure? - Sat Dec  5 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Mmm. . .No. - Sat Dec  5 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Well. .  - Sat Dec  5 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Some chick bit off my shoulder. - Sat Dec  5 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: But then healed it. - Sat Dec  5 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: So there're vampires in the village that was originally mine. I'm glad I didn't stay there. - Sat Dec  5 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) scratches his head and sighs- looking on with a sad smile.

"Ah, good day.." He says softly towards Amaya- before turning towards Takuma and crooking an eyebrow upwards. "Ohohoho, how strange!"* - Sat Dec  5 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: This whore is the former Raikage. The one that disrespected Zeus... - Sat Dec  5 22:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs and waits for a moment, tapping his chin.

"Mrm... well, a pleasure to meet you all, yes! I am Gan- and I am sure we will be able to enjoy each other's company in the future- but for now! I have a comrade's sad loneliness to try and mend!"* - Sat Dec  5 22:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) sighs softly. He isn't actively looking at the others in the ramen shop- just waiting for his ramen and leaning back- a frown on his face.* - Sat Dec  5 22:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) meanwhile, seems to sit there- thinking quietly. He scratches his chin as he waits for his order- not noticing the flash of lightning.

"Ah, well..." He murmurs- frowning. He sighs awkwardly- and turns to adress Saika.

"Ah.. hey. Sorry for earlier. I was just trying to make freinds.... I didn't mean to.. somehow offend you, or something... sorry." he says succinctly- before looking back to the bar as his food arrivees, and starting to eat quietly.* - Sat Dec  5 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Gan Ning(Ellthestrange) meanwhile- notices nothing...

He just sighs as he eats his Ramen- not wanting to bother anyone, but just to eat in peace.* - Sat Dec  5 22:45:45 2015
