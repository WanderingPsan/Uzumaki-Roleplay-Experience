<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I need to know...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: There is no tension between us because I was born with the family doujutsu right?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ...O-of course not Luna..Why would there be?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: .
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I was just making sure... And we have been becomming quite...Distance lately... You know, with you joining your cult or whatever.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ...Yeah...It's not a cult..Don't call it that.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Sorry....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( inb4myprofilesays cult of jashin )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (XD)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: It's fine...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I was also wondering if you wanted to train a bit?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Jashin does not forgive..But I do.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Riiiiiight..
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Uhh, okay..
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Okay, so what do you want to do?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Trying to think of a legit perk / Jutsu combination )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (Zealot?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (lol)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Eh, thats a given )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (oh)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( I mean the fact that I fight for Jashin not the perk )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (oh)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Hmm, would you like to spar?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Well, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I was thinking more of formal training.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Like working out, but okay.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Hmm...We can do that too...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Let's do that instead...I guess...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: We can have a spar first as a warm up for our workout.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Okay! Come at me sis!
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Well, i'm not much of a first attacker.
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) closes her eyes and re opens them, revealing a dark azure blue eye with one triangular tomoe protruding from the center.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) whips her scythe around and stares Luna down. Her symbol of Jashin jangling on her neck. "Oh you sure? Alrighty!" She exclaims as she suddenly runs towards Luna. Kirsten swings the scythe around her body and spins as she attempts to knock her sister down with the handle of the weapon.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (so you are swinging with the handle of your blade?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (or....)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (like wut)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Spinning the whole thing. The blunt side is turned towards you )
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: This is gunna be a nice clean fight, no hitting below the belt no dirty shots.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: *rings bell*)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Alister. Please help Skarrj. I been ignoring him for a while )
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) had literally activated her eyes just in the nick of time when her sister attacked, her motion capture able to perceive her movements in time before she swung her blade, taking a quick step back with her reflexes and countering with a straight kick to the stomach after she swung her blade. She waited for an opening right after she swung the sycthe.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (can we rp for two perks at a time?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (like....)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( like )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (i wanna work on my strenght and stamina)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (by sparring and working out)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (sparring = stamina. strength = training)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Hmm...Yeah. I guess that could work. Yeah since perks dont work like Jutsu )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (stamina could also be running laps, and rock climbing)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (in about a week i should have the stamina perk, and in two weeks ill have strength)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) is struck across the gut by her sister's kick. "Oof!" She grunts as she rolls backwards, head over heels. "That was crazy..." She says as she stands up. "Again!" She exclaims. "With Feeling!" She yells as she leaps upwards above her sister. She brings the scythe down attempting to hit her on the shoulder with the backside of it, not wanting to cut her to pieces.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (sorry, went to go get some apple juice)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( its cool )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (rping)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) 's eyes continued to lock on Kirsten, watching her leap into the air infont of her with the hilt of her sycthe aiming at her shoulder. Luna's body was able to withstand the hit of her blade, causing a slight tingle of pain to be sent throughout her shoulder, however it was barely anything to her, Luna's physicall prowess was quite impressive. After being hit, she took used the recoil from the hit to her advantage, and since Kirsten would still be in the air afterwards, she simply kicked off by forcing all of her weight to her left leg, kicking off the ground and brining her right knee of towards her stomach as she was in the air.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (:D)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Wait..you got two perks? o-o )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (you said i do)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lolwut? )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (cuz this trait gives auto body)

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (+ my starter genin perk)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( i remember )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (lol)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) groans as she is kicked in the gut again by Luna. Kirsten flies upwards and lands on the ground behind Luna. She rolls across the ground and just lays there for a moment, in pain. "Grr, I'm not going to give up!" She exclaims as she drops her scythe. Kirsten runs straight at her sister and attempts to tacke Luna to the ground.*

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (im not sure how to explain what I am doing)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lol try )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (but its a simple Martial Arts move.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (where the person is tackled, but then they kick the person off by using their momentum)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) 's knee makes contact with Kirsten's stomach, causing her to fall back down to the ground. Watching as she stood up, her eyes kept motion of everything that was happening, she smiled at her sister's words. "That's the spirit Kirsten.", she said, watching her sister come forward to tackle her. She allowed her sister to tackle her down to the ground purposely, in order so that she could lift her knee up and place her toes against Kirsten's stomach and kick her off from behind, her body would be sent in back of Luna.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lol duh ik what that is )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Its a power ranger move XD )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (LOL
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (its just, I never rped it before lol)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) flies through the air once again. "Jashin Damn IT!" She exclaims as she hits the ground and slides. Kirsten looks at her sister. "How are you so much better than me!?" She exclaims, making direct eye contact with her sister.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) 's azure blue eyes looked at Kirsten's directly in her eyes. "It's not that I am better than you little sis. It's just i've been in alot of fights, so I know how to defend myself.", she said, smiling and looking at her sister. "Don't worry, you will get better."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) stares her down and looks rather angry. "Grr, gah!" She exclaims as she runs directly at Luna. Kirsten's right arm would snake out and attempt to grab her sister's arm. If she is successful, she would then bring her left leg up and attempt to kick her in the side and push off with all her weight throwing her across thr ground.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) took a deep breathe as her sister ran forward, she allowed her to grab her left arm, however when she kicked, Luna simply brought her right knee up to defend against her kick, negating the kick while brining her free left hand around for slight elbow to her cranium.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (misclick lol)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smirks as her sister falls into the mini technique she had concocted on the move. "Aha!" She exclaims as she brings her other arm up and attempts to grab Luna's leg. If she is successful, she'd take the elbow to the head, but Luna would lose her balance and fall over, allowing Kirsten to grapple her and pin her to the ground.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (i swear... if people start calling my shit a cheap imitation of sharingan...)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lol xD )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (im going to rage)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (Evan already started with that shit)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) had fallen into her sister's clever taijutsu trap, being pinned to the ground and locked by Kirsten. "Good move sis. I guess that's enough sparring for today.", she said, making her way out of Kirsten's grasp and deactivating her eyes, turning them to their original black color.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Ugh, yeah...You kicked my ass though...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: You will get better.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Don't worry.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Eh, hopefully....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Grr, theres something I want to do...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Hmmm?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I was offered the power by the Clan...But, I don't think I can go through with it..
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Offered the power by the clan?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: What do you mean?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (BY THE WAY)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (no one would be able to take my eyes and lol implant them)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( why? o-o )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: By the Clan of Jashin....If I sacrifice of myself...And Of another to Jashin..I can be granted an amazing gift...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (since our clan has special bodies capable of using them. They send electrical impulses to our muscles that a regular body would not be able to sustain. Meaning if they try to lolimplant, their bodies would cramp up with intense pain 24/7 until they die or it is removed.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (so GG for the powergamers that try to take my eyes)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lmao genius ! )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( I say I have the kg i just cant activate it...o-o but if you took my eyes you could and then give them back :3 )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Sacrifice.... Yourself? Doesn't that mean you will die?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (wait wut lol)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: No...I simply have to go into battle...

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Oh...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I don't know sis.... Your little... 'Religoin' has always been a bit iffy to me.

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: -sigh-
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I cannot stop the choices you make.

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I promise...I'll be safe...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Good...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: By the way, why is your cult-, I mean religion so secretive?

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Allow me to go first?
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: You may.
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: Just don't hurt me... I guess that is all I can say.
<br><font color=yellow>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) reaches into his pocket, pulling out two kunai, which had numerous seals on them, he stuck his finger in the whole, swinging them around his middle finger, as he grabbed the hilt of them, pointing his left hand out, as the kunai pointed to his opponent, his right hand staying firmly at his side, as he entered his Martial Arts stance.
*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smiles as she begins to do a string of handseals. "Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!" She exclaims as fog begins to form around her body. The fog would be released from her and begins to float around. It begins to coalesce into clones. Since they aren't full clones they dont use very much chakra. The clones would begin to run all around, surrounding Gendou. If he were to attack one the attack would just go through them.

While the clones run around Gendou, Kirsten takes out two smokebombs. She throws one up into the air, it would arc through the sky and land behind Gendou exploding on the ground. The other one she throws on the ground right in front of her. She then begins a string of five - seven handseals and dissappears in the smoke.*
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [O_o]
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [I realized something]
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [I didn't get any jutsu other than my 1 C rank D:}
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Thats all u get really )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Cuz u got Kuchiyose )
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [That sucks D:]
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [What can a cat do in combat]
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Scratch )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Piss )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Meow )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( :D )
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [Can I train for others? D:}
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( mhm. )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Hell you can train to get battle cats )
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [Like maybe a uh... Small Snake one?]
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [Battle Cats? D:}
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [As in, like Kakashi?}[
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [But cats]
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( mhm )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Like lions and chiz )
<br><font color=yellow>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) blinked, noticing that he was surrounded, he smiled, as he stood still, concentrating his chakra, he would then use the kunai on the left to slice a small cut on his finger, then he would create a marking on the other kunai, tossing it into the air, suddenly a cloud of smoke appeared, out came a cat, as he was shrouded by the smoke, and still trapped by clones he stood still."What to do..." He thought, knowing that his opponent could attack at any time.

Sighed, reaching into his holster as he pulled out an exploding tag, attaching it to his kitty,"I am sorry my friend... You must take one for the team." He whispered, the cat shook its head, charging to the front, as it attempted to attack a clone, before realizing that the attack had no effect, he would quickly disperse his cat, reaching for his holster as he pulled out a third kunai, this kunai having a small chain attached to it."This will work." He said, as he held the kunai in a defensive position.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smirks to herself as her hand reaches up in the totally sight, obscuring fog and reaches for Gendou's leg, she doesn't make much noise as she is skilled at this jutsu. Kirsten's hand shoots out of the ground and aims to grab Gendou by his ankle. If she is successful then he would be pulled under the ground up to his neck and she would be standing over him, staring down at him.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) smiled, seeing as two hands were about to pull him into the earth."Clever." He said. He would then calmly holding his other kunai, activate its seal, as a cloud of smoke appeared, suddenly an armoured cat appeared in his hands, the cat would then attempt to attack the girl, trying to claw her hands away from his legs, if this would work he would jump back, spacing himself from his opponent.

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( ...Why? )
<br><font color=yellow>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) Looks down, as he felt two hands drag him down into the earth, feeling ashamed as he was stuck in the ground, due to his opponent clever technique,"Damnit... You won." He would mumble, as he struggled to rise from the ground.

<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [I hope its Wind <.<]
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) looks at the male and looks towards the ground. She frowns deeply. "I am sorry..." She says as she pulls her scythe from her back. "But I must.." She says as she spins it around her body. Kirsten Omikami would then quickly swing the scythe around, it would be aimed at cutting Gendou's head clean off of his body.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( v.v )
<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [Thats fucked up <.<]

<br><font color=yellow>*Lrn2type(Jjking218) steps out from behind the tree clapping.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) gathers the head of the boy whom she had just killed. She then digs up his body, tears falling from her eyes. She takes a scroll and seals his body inside of it as the Clan had taught her. "This is going to be horrible..."*

<br><font color=yellow>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) walks off.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) slowly backs up as she moves to leave the village.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Hey..Luna.

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Because I didn't enjoy it...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I know it is a shinobi's job to take the lives of others when needed, but there was just something that didn't feel right about it.

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: ....What did you do.....?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I-I...*Sniff* I killed someone!
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: ...............................
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: What.
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) is at this point bawling her eyes out. "I-I went to Konoha...And pretended to want to spar with someone...Th-then when we were sparring..I k-killed him!" She sobs.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) was ingoring the fact that her sister was sad, she was more concenred about the political side of her actions and how they could affect the shinobi world. "Kirsten... You do realize the severity of your actions right? This may spark a war between villages if the wrong person finds out about this...."*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I-I...I'm so sorry...I...I had to....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: For what reason Kirsten?
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) really doesn't want to tell her sister that it was the Cult of Jashin that was what caused her to have to kill the male. She -really- did want to tell her that she secretly enjoyed killing the kid. "I-I can't say..."*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (wtf happened..)

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( kay :D )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: It's that Jashin shit again isn't it. Kirsten, I want you to stay away from those people... They are leading you down a dark path...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ....Luna, you don't understand...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I-I have to do this...For our village.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: For our village? What do you mean?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ..The power that will be granted to me..By the Malevolent Lord Jashin....It..It will help me help the village greatly...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: ...........
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: How do you know for sure this power will even be granted to you? How do you know this cult isn't just using you?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Luna...I know..Because I've seen it firsthand...This power...It is great...Beyond recognition.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Mother would not have wanted this.... And you know it.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Mother would not have wanted this.... And you know it.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ...Luna, stop it...I'm doing this for you...And Mother...And the rest of the village.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: You are using this cult to cope with mothers death. They are giving you false promises that you will think is the right thing to do.  
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: No! They are helping me! And they are helping the village by doing so! Stop talking bad about what you don't understand!
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Tch...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Fine...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Continue to throw your life away.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Grr....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: With some cult that is only using you.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ...That's it!
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Yes / no this jutsu for me real quick )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) suddenly leaps across the small space between them and attempts to throttle her sister. She is angered and wants nothing more than to wring her neck.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) could feel the anger consuming her younger sister as she leaped forward, she simply leaded backwards a bit to avoid her tackle. "I am going to have to stop you if you continue to kill innocent people Kirsten.", she said with a stern expression, she seemed to be ready to face her sister in combat if she needed to.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Grr...You can't stop me!
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (you are the Sasuke to my Naruto <3)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) suddenly pulls out a kunai, and instead of leaping at her sister she pulls it up and brings it down on herself. She stabs herself in the left shoulder. "ARRGGHHHH!" Kirsten screams in pain before doubling over and passing out.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( mhm <3 )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: .....
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) sighs as she shakes her head, watching her sister fall to the ground. "This cult is really messing you up...", she said, standing there with her arms folded.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (icly ima find the Jashin temple and slaughter every member inside)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (-nods-)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( LOL nuuu x3 u couldnt kill the ones that matter anyway. they immortal silly :3 )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (AW DAMNIT)

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (and then burn their heads)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( LOL they be sitting around, talking heads and shit XD )

<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) lays there all passed out and stuff.
*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) pulls the kunai out of her shoulder. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) screams out in pain as she sits up.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) takes out of cloth and begins to apply pressure to the wound for a few minutes in order to stop the bleeding. Shortly afterwards, she took out a bandage to wrap up her shoulder wound, saying, "Relax and sit still...."*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: *complies*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) is all finish.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: *grumbles* Thanks...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: No problem.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Luna..I'm sorry...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( one sec ()
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( typing )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) suddenly does a short string of handseals. She rolls over her head and onto her feet. She is facing her sister. "Earth Style: Rock Trail..." She says as she slams her hands into the ground. A bunch of rock pillars would suddenly rip through the ground leading towards Luna. As they move towards her, Kirsten pulls out a smoke bomb and throws it at the ground. In the time that this occurs she turns her body a bit and runs as fast as she can away from her sister, attempting to flee the village.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) took a few steps back once Kirsten started doing her seals, she had not seen that seal combination before, and didn't know what her sister was planning. Watching the pillars come up from the ground infont of her, she quickly attempted to use her reflexes and do a cartwheel to the right, at the same time activating her Zentengan to see things more clearly. While avoid her jutsu, she was unable to stop her sister from leaving, and she had no idea where she was going or could have even gone. She ran towards the gates of the village, hoping to someone find her sister that had dissappeared, her mind in a critical emotional state now that her sister was trying to leave the village.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (does Kusagiri need help?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( idk )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (my ooc is off lol)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( She hasnt said anything on ooc )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ...Why are you following me....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I'm running away for a reason...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Where do you think you are going.... I'm not going to let you go around and kill more innocent people.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I'm not going to kill innocent people for no reason...I swear to you...When I get back I'll have proof....My killings weren't in vain.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Every killing done is in vain. It will not bring peace, it will only cause more problems that the world is already facing.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ..Heheh, you're so idealistic sissy...You're so adorable...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I am not joking around Kirsten. -serious face-
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I will do everything in my power to stop you....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Even if I have to break your legs.
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) turns on her sister. "Break my legs? Try me..." She says rather sternly.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Dont make me add you to the list qq )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (Q_Q)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) formed a single hand seal and placed her right arm high up into the air, a small whisper escaped from her mouth. "Ninja Art: Hidden Mist Jutsu...." At the sound of her words, a thick mist encassed the area using the already made water vapor that was in the atmosphere. It surrounded the entire area including the bridge, and Luna's Zentengan was still able to slightly see Kirsten within the mist. She reached into her holster and pulled out three shuriken, launching them in Kirsten's direction before jumping ontop of the gate to confuse her whereabouts.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) has trained with her sister in the Hidden Mist Jutsu. She isn't skilled to the point where she can easily see through it, but she does have some level of sight. "Damn.." She says as the shuriken enter her small field of vision. Kirsten quickly spins around, knocking the shuriken from the air with her scythe.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (sorry rping)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) adds in her other special jutsu to the mix while the mist as still in place, stringing together a few hand seals and saying to herself, "Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu." Created from the vapor of the mist, multiple clones materialized from mist, three of them appeared surrounding her sister, and three appeared a few feet away from them on the bridge. Luna made her way off the bridge and stood next to her clones, which were not genjutsu. She allowed the mist to disperse around Kirsten, and now that her fog clone were now in play, she would not know which one was the real Luna after the mist was gone.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Grr...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( ugh. I g2g Trin. Just doped up..Uber sick. Drowsiness kicking in....Pick up from hea 2mar? )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (okay :<)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (bye)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( night <3 )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (night <3)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (hi)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( hi )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Where were we? )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (um)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( eh start over )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (nah)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Why are you following me...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (i know where we were)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (also)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( otru )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (u wanna just continue? or just say you got away?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Uhh...I wanna get away...-BUT- I want to continue..Kinda )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (I had fog clones surrounding you)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Oh..Yeah )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I won't let you leave..
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Grr...I won't fall for this jutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Remember..I can do the same thing...
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) looks around at all of the clones for a second before just walking straight away from her sister.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Hmph.
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) causes all of the clones to make it seem like they were throwing shuriken at her, however since the clones were not able to attack, it was only to add on to the illusionary effect. The real Luna threw a shuriken herself, combined with the illusionary clone shuriken aimed at her. Only one of the shuriken would be real, however in her current position, Kirsten would still not know which one was the real Luna.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) turns around as her sister throws the shuriken. It catches her right in the gut. She drops to her knees and looks at her. "Th-this what you wanted?" She says to her, bleeding.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( let me go. quickly. I have to go get my 2nd kill b4 sashi leaves )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Just go Kirsten.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I will deal with you when the time is right....
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ..Hmph, it'll be too late at that point.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: We shall see.
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) runs away. Heals after a few hours. Goes towards Kumogakure.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Hi there!
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Hmm? Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Are you a Kumogakure shinobi?
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Yes, I am.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Oo! Would you like to train with me!?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I need a training partner.
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: What sort of training...?
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Just a simple spar.
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Sure, why not.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: Okay! Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: This a good spot?
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Sure, sure.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: I'll take the first move!
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: Sure.
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smiles cheerily as she makes several handseals. The air around Kirsten begins to get a bit moist. It suddenly congeals into several clones of her. Each clone is an exact replica. There are about twenty clones of Kirsten running around the area. They are half-clones and therefore do not have mass, but anyone who hadn't touched one would swear they were genuine.

As the twenty clones run at the male, they all pull out kunai and leap at him. Kirsten is among the seven clones that hang back from the initial charge. As they make the other clones make their charge she pulls out three smoke bombs. She tosses one up into the air and it lands somewhere behind Alastor, she takes another and throws it directly at the ground in front of her and she tosses the third one to the ground in front of Alastor.

Kirsten makes three handseals and dissappears into the smoke.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He smiles, noting that this should be a fun fight. He tilts his head to the side slightly, wondering what exactly this shinobi was hoping to accomplish. "Tricking me...?" he mumbled to himself, as he smiled. He formed five quick hand seals, as the smokes bombs went off.

In one swift motion, he pulled out and equipped a kunai into his left hand. He was alert, listening to his surroundings, trying to pick out where his opponent had gone. He smiled once more, a plan in his head.

In one more motion, he threw the kunai into the ground in front of his right foot, following the downward motion to crouch. He slammed his hands against the ground, as electricity would surge through it. It was not enough to hurt badly, but it would be a nice shock, that should easily defeate all the fake clones coming towards him.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( The electricty is running along the top of the ground right? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mhm.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smiles to herself as her clones are easily dissipated. At this point her clones didn't even matter. "Shinjuu...Zanshu!" She says to herself as her hands shoot up from under the ground. The smoke would obscure her opponents vision giving him to warning as to the coming attack. Her hands would reach for his legs, if successfully grabbing the crouching boy, she'd pulls his body underground up to his neck.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He saw more smoke, as the clones were destroyed. "Heh, now to find the real one," he thought to himself, as he felt something tug onto his leg. "Heh, idiot," he thought to himself, as he was dragged under the ground, concealed now and trapped up to his neck. "You win," He yelled out, smiling slyly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) is standing over the male, she pulls her scythe from her back and stares at him with a blank expression. "I am sorry..." She says as she swings the scythe around her body once and then spins as she swings it like a golf club, the scythe is aimed at taking the boy's head clean off his body.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He saw the girl standing over him, and smiled. As he heard the words, his smile faded into a frown. The chakra he had been channeling into the ground had never faded, though. He had been pulled in while the jutsu was activated, and had been continuing to use it since. He had not suspected this girl would try to kill him, but he was not going to show any mercy either now.

 "NO!" he screamed out, as he sent about twenty percent of his chakra through the ground around him in an eletric current, which would destroy most of the rock around him, freeing himself. If the girl did not move, she would be eletricuted, too.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Nice to have a jashinist.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( how many times can you use Earth Flash? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (No idea. I'll ask.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (use the verb)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (OH now it shows.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Wasn't showing before xD)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (its supposed to be 2-3)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: (Trin )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( What does taht mean exactly? )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (what?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( I never did understand that )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( 2-3 )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (^.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( So 2 or 3 ? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (I mean, before it drains all my chakra?)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Oor what?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (3 is like pushing your limit and draining your chakra)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (And if you have the chakra perk?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (1 more use)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (So 3-4.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (use it again)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Thank ya.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (k)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) groans as the boy destroys the ground beneath him with a surge of chakra. She leaps upwards into the air and while doing so whips out two kunai and throws them straight at the boy's head. If successful, they would embed themselves straight into his skull.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( 4got to post it )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Nice.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) As he was now free, he frowned. "This, is not going to happen," he said as he saw the kunai began to fly towards him. "BYE!" he shouted, as he attempted to jump over to the right, hopefully dodging the kunai, before trying to run off in the direction of Kumogakure. His thoughts were racing, as he wondered why this person would try to kill him, a lowly genin.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) smirks as the boy begins to run towards the village. She makes two handseals, as she does so she begins to run after him. She leaps upwards and lands on the ground. As she does so the earth would ripple beneath him, causing him to slow down because his footing would be uneasy. Then all of a sudden rocks would raise from the ground originating from beneath, behind, and to the side of him in a straight line. They would come up with enough force to break any bone in his body in the places where he was made contact with.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) "Damn, almost out of chakra!" he screamed inside of his head, as he turned back towards the enemy. "Can't run!" he shouted, as his footing became loose, and rocks began to shoot up. He knew he had only two uses, max, left of his technique, but he could not be bothered with that now.

He formed five hand seals, as the rocks began to shoot up. "JIBASHI!" he yelled, as he reared back and slammed his right hand hard against the ground that was moving in front of him, shooting towards the spikes that were rising towards him. 

The electricity left a small 'slice' in the earth as it went, but would continue after the spikes. It would continue on until it met under the girl, as he hoped he could incapacitate her with the shock. "Heh, raiton beats doton," he said slyly, as he pulled out a kunai, panting heavily.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Your chakra would be low, too. J/s.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( mhm ofc )
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) is caught by the raiton arcing through the ground. Kirsten is panting heavily but she doesn't drop to the ground. "Huff, huff....Heh, but you can't possibly have enough chakra at this point to continue on..." She says as she holds her scythe at a ready stance. Kirsten suddenly rushes forwards. 

She brings her scythe up and spins her body once, Kirsten then swings it over her body as she brings it towards the boy's midsection attempting to cause him to drop to the ground bleeding out.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Oh damn sorry my thing didn't autoscroll just saw you posted.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lol kay. )
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He saw the scyth coming towards him, as he knew what he had to do. "HA!!" he shouted, as he threw the kunai at the girl's torse, as he fell onto his back. He performed five hand signs, and if uninterrupted he would then pull out his last kunai into his right hand, as he landed on his back. His face was covered in sweat, his body was burning in pain. His breathing was heavy, and he was scared for his life. "I WILL NOT DIE!" he screamed, as he awaited the next blows.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( kay. Typing )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay. Take your time.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) leaps to the side, avoiding the kunai, Kirsten would then spin her body around, getting closer to Alastor, she then swings her scythe directly for his throat as he begins to do the string of handseals, stopping his jutsu in its tracks.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He didn't know what to do. He saw the scyth coming down towards his neck, so he did the one thing he thought he could. He would sweep his body in a whirlwind like motion, attempting to grab ahold of and twist the leg of the girl with his own leg as he withdrew a kunai.

He would once more attempt to form the five hand seals fast, as his body would have been twisted out of the way of the scyth when he grabbed ahold of the girl.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( wait. So you used my body to spin around, and turned away from me to do the handseals? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (I basically grabbed your leg between my legs and twisted it to knock you over, and my torso went to the side with it.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( So we'd end up laying down right? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mhm.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) isn't about to let the boy catch her. Kirsten leaps upwards and pulls her scythe back. "Die." She says dully as she brings the scythe down through the air. She would swing it with an immense amount of speed. The close quarters would cause this to be an extremely hard to dodge attack, since the weapon is quite long.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Where would the scyth be hitting me? Torso?)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( From shoulder to waist. Like..Itd cut into you )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mmkay.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He finished the hand signs. But now she was upon him. As the scyth went into his flesh, he would let out a scream of pain. At the same time, he would slam his right hand onto the scyth as it entered his shoulder, sending a huge shockwave straight through it and into the person holding it, the girl. If it hit her, it would most likely knock her unconsious, due to the immsense amount of eletricty entering her body at once.

If the girl let go of the scyth, he would take it out of his shoulder, attempting to slam the pole into her torso, before spinning the scyth around.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( That was Jibashi u used? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mhm. My last use, I'm drained of chakra now.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) Kirsten lets go of the scythe as the boy puts his hand on it. "Not about to let that happen again!" She exclaims as the raiton chakra surges through. She is in the process of letting go as the raiton chakra hits. She is caught slightly, it simply causes her arms to go numb and her vision to blur for a moment. "Damn..." She grunts as the boy takes the scythe and hits her with it. She is down to a small amount of usuable chakra at this point. "Grr, one more jutsu I have.." She says as she gets up from the ground and stares him down. 

"Huff, huff...." She pants as she stares at the boy holding her scythe. "You're goin- *cough* You're going to pay." She says rather angrily. She pulls a single kunai out of her pouch and a single smoke bomb. Kirsten suddenly begins running at Alastor. She gets about 5 feet away from him and throws her last smokebomb at the ground. It would go off, obscuring his vision. She suddenly throws the Kunai directly at him from his vulnerable position. 

Kirsten then does four final handseals before dissappearing totally into the smoke.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He knows he doesn't have much time. "Not again!" he shouted, as he used the scyth to help him stablize himself. He used what little stamina he had left to hop into the tree by him, away from the smoke. "Probably underground..." he thought to himself as he leaned against the tree, the scythe still in his right hand.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Shit didn't mean to hit enter.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (WHatever.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ) What about the kunai? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Didn't see that line. Retyping.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He was tired, he was delerious, and sweat was dripping in his eyes. The kunai came flying at him, and landed itself into his left shoulder. "ARGH!" he screamed, as he left it in there. He didn't have the strength to move it. 

He knew his only chance was to get to higher ground, but he would never make it to the nearby tree. He barley was able to keep body up at this point, at the point of passing out. But he smiled. He admired this girls style, and knew she could help him, and he could help her.

"I like your style. Maybe we could work as an alliance, instead of trying to kill each other! We could be a great assest to one another!" he said, as he awaited a reply, vulernable.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( HMMMMM Quite a conundrum...I need another kill....But I could -really- use you...Hmmmmm )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (You should ttly use me.)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Wouldn't be hard to get a kill with a team ;)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( im kinda back and forth gotta do stuff )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (xD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) stares at the male. "Had you been stronger...You could have helped..." She says as she makes her final approach. She pulls out her final Kunai and holds it at the ready. "Prepare..." She says as she runs around behind him within the smoke. She is to his right when she throws the Kunai at him. Just as she finishes she runs towards where she knows he is. Kirsten leaps up into the air and lands in front of him, out of the smoke. She lands with her palms on the ground. 

All of a sudden, in a surge of chakra, a large rock formation would appear up under him. It would shoot up and be aimed at his throat. The rock wouldn't be very sharp, but it would be strong enough to break his trachea, killing him almost instantly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) dies.*
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( lol aww )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( nothing dramatic or anything? )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Nothing I could do.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( shucks )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Naaah)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Remaking now.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( kay. That was an -amazing- Fight )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Mhm. Props to your strategies.)
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: (  Im gonna reward you upon remaking )
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) says: ( Thanks )
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (Yay xD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Kirsten(Beasta202) enters the hospital of Konohagakure no Sato. She is interested in killing another of their shinobi. She walks in and find a young girl, sitting on a bed watchign a TV. She walks in and throws a kunai at her. She takes it to the chest. The girl falls over, in pain.

"I'm sorry..But you must die." She says as she stabs her in the heart with the kunai multiple times.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: ..........
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: ..
<br><font color=yellow>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) heard the whirring of the shuriken coming towards him. "Crap!" he yelled as he quickly stopped his hands and jumped to the side, hearing them wiz past him. He then noticed three girls, which looked exactly like Luna, running towards him. "Nice." he said as he quickly ducked and dodged all of the attacks that was being thrown at him. "Now!" he said as he saw an opening on the three, and would send a quick punch to each of them, quickly making them disperse in the mist.*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Matsu(LordxPatrick) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Matsu(LordxPatrick) says: What's going on here?
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: Shhh.
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: They're sparring.
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: (I say. We verb it out like men.
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: (*nods*
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Matsu(LordxPatrick) says: (LOLNo.)

<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Matsu(LordxPatrick) says: (Verb = shit.)
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: (I was joking.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Matsu(LordxPatrick) says: (I figured. But still lol.)
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: (Momo: 1 Trin: 1
<br><font color=yellow>*Omikami, Luna(TakeTheCondomOff) watched closely as her clones ran towards Momo slowly, her eyes set on each and every one of them. She seen a figure within the mist punch through one of her clones, however fog clones do not disperse when struck, the attack simply passes through them. Taking this to an advantage of Momo, she once again takes out three shuriken and throws them in the direction of where she sent her fog clones, hoping to land a strike on Momo's body.*
<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: (It's tied.
<br><font color=green>*Omikami, Matsu(LordxPatrick) says: (Alastor: 85)

<br><font color=green>*James(Lord Anime) says: (Running in a general direction

<br><font color=yellow>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) watched intensely as his arm went directly through the clone. "The hell...?" he thought quickly as he heard the whirring coming towards him again.

"Now to finish this." he said as he let the fog clear completely before looking at his opponent directly in her eyes.*
