<br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) unraveled a scroll, and rolled it across the sandy surface. Saseko placed his index finger on the first word, and read the scrolls contents within her mind and used her index finger to guide through the words. From reading the first couple paragraphs on the scroll, Saseki could tell that this would take a long while. Saseki sighed loudly and looked at her father, then back at her scroll, she murmured under her breath "...Where is brother and mother..." it's been quiet the long time since she last saw them.

But she shook her head and continued to read the scrolls contents, the jutsu itself seemed to be of great usage. Looks like you need a lot of chakra in order to even perform the technique. But if Saseki was able to learn this technique, she could create exact replica's of herself. She could even play hide n'seek by herself! Then Saseki realized that is total loner status. But none the less she shook her head and continued to read the scrolls contents. After a long while of reading, Saseki took out a small honey bun from her jacket pockt.

She carefully unwrapped the honey bun and ate it. Saseki also had a bottle of milk in her jacket pocket aswell, opening the bottle of milk and drinking it. After finishing the food and drink, she went back to the Shadow Clone scroll that she was reading. Man this scroll had a lot of information on the technique. Saseki occasionally looked up to see if anything was happening, seems like nothing really was. 

After confirming that, she continued to read the scroll.* - Tue Sep 01 01:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
After reading the scroll for a long while, Saseki yawned loudy, then looked over toward her father and squinted. She then said under her breath "He's been quiet for a while..". Saseki diverted her attention back to the scroll looking over it's contents, the jutsu itself could prove for a good divertion in leading an enemy away from you. Which in the long run could prove to be efficent. Saseki slowly got up from sitting down on the sandy surface. She quickly rolled up the scroll and placed it back into her jacket pocket.

Saseki then went to travel around the village, ya know to do know people stuff like that.* - Tue Sep 01 02:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Saseki appeared near an area where there seemed to be a lot of people, Saseki herself was only six years old and about 3'4. Average height for a six year old maybe? She continued up the path.* - Tue Sep 01 02:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) continued to skip toward the mansion.* - Tue Sep 01 02:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) turned around and squinted looking at her father and said "...Why."* - Tue Sep 01 02:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Le Jumps on her father and shouts "ONWARD!" pointing to the south.* - Tue Sep 01 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Was concealed by her father, and after getting a certain distance away, she hoped out of his cloak and said "Dad! Who's a guy that has white hair and a gord?!?...Um...What's a gord?" * - Tue Sep 01 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) frowned.

She then sighed loudly and said "Figured you didn't have anything else to teach me!" she took out the three scrolls and waved them around and said "This is probably all you could teach me anyway." she stated, and placed the scrolls back in her jacket pocket. But learning some taijutsu moves wouldn't be all that bad, she could defend herself if she learned some.* - Tue Sep 01 02:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) bore a confused look.

But she did what she was told, she attempted to send a straight forward punch toward her father's gut. (Attack Speed 1, Strength 1, Tai 1.)* - Tue Sep 01 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) arm was knocked away, she quickly tried to do a low kick toward her father's ankle. If she connected the hit, it probably wouldn't have done much. Probably wouldn't even feel like a pinch. * - Tue Sep 01 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Balance was screwed up, causing her to fall face first into the sandy surface. Saseki quickly got up once more, and ran toward her father once more, she jumped into the air and extended her leg forward, attempting to do a flying jump kick toward her father's ribcage region.* - Tue Sep 01 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Was caught in her father's grasp. She looked at him with a frown and crossed her arms and said "...Fine." that was a rather quick taijutsu lesson.* - Tue Sep 01 03:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) closed her eyes and drifted to sleep on her fathers chest as she then said "I love you to dad." After that was said, she went to snooze.* - Tue Sep 01 03:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) woke up from her father's grasp, and wiggled her way out. She quickly stretched followed by a slight yawn. She scratched the top of her head and unraveled the shadow clone jutsu scroll infront of her, and quickly examined the scroll and read it's contents. She wanted to learn the jutsu quickly, so she can move onto learning better jutsu. But she looked over toward her father, wondering if he woke up, and once she did that, she looked back at the scroll.

But she was curious once more, what happened to her mother, her brother, and more importantly the maid?* - Tue Sep 01 14:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) continued to read the scrolls contents, learning the technique would require large amounts of chakra, and chakra Saseki had. But creating exact replica's could prove good for stealthy things, like hiding from her father, or going to random locations for adventure! Yeah, Saseki liked that idea. But one thing still remained, would her father know which one was which? Saseki scratched her head and looked over toward her father and said "Hey Dad, why don't we live in a house anymore?" she asked curious.

If he replied to her, she would continued to read from the scroll, needing to finish learning the scrolls information.* - Tue Sep 01 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) looked at the scroll, examining it up and down once more. She sighed loudly and murmured to herself "...So much reading.." he stated to herself. But none the less she continued to read it, but god damn it took forever. Upon reading the scroll, it seemed that you would have to evenly distribute chakra into each clone, or else they'll just disappear from lack of chakra. That seemed to prove quite the challenge. But Saseki liked challenges, it's more or less an obstacle for her to overcome when she gets older, or when she continues to train the technique itself.

Upon reading more into the scroll, it seems that the shadow clones can think for themselves, and can even dispel themselves without the users command. That can prove to be problematic for Saseki. But stroked her chin and continued to read while questioning herself, if she was in battle and used the technique, would her clones dispel themselves out of fear? Probably. Only way to find out, would be to test it.

But then again, she didn't think her father would like that she did that. * - Tue Sep 01 15:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) continued to read the scrolls information, this took a long time, and time was already being wasted. She sighed loudly once more and rubbed the back of her neck, reading the scroll itself was boring. And she still had to learn two more scrolls that she had in her jacket pocket that her father gave her. She once again looked around the general area they were in, it was a pretty isolated place. Buildings were here and there, cactus were also around the area, and not to mention a lot of moutain terrain.

She felt like if this place was to have an earthquake, they would all be screwed over.* - Tue Sep 01 15:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) continued to read the scrolls information and contents, absorbing the information having it process through her brain. If she could just learn this technique already, she'd probably be set for life. But then again, the other jutsus she had to learn were probably going to be longer, by longer a longer time to read them. Which would waste more time, this was becoming a bother.* - Tue Sep 01 15:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Upon reading the scroll, she yawned and placed it to the side. She took out a bottle of water and drank from it, in the village of Sunagakure no Sato, the heat was pretty bad. So she had to keep hydrated and all that good jazz, she put the cap back on the bottle and placed it on her left side. She then grabbed the scroll and placed it back infront of her, she continued to scan the information on the scroll.* - Tue Sep 01 15:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) continued to read from the scroll itself, continuing to gather information on the technique, of course this was a long process, and it took time to learn every aspect of the technique. Maybe when she does learn it she could play hide n seek, or tag, and trick other people into thinking its her, but it's really not. Oh the possibilities.* - Tue Sep 01 16:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Starting to read the scroll once more, it was like a repeated process by this point, she read the scrolls contents and continued to read. It was a boring process none the less though. But once she was done reading it, she would learn the technique. But until then, she continued reading.* - Tue Sep 01 18:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) continued to read the scrolls contents, her eyes slowly started to close, but the reopen once again. Reading this much information on a scroll was rather difficult, and she just wanted to get it done and over with by now. But then again, it would take time. She yawned and looked around the area once more, and let out a slight sigh. She then murmured under her breath "...Where's mother.."* - Tue Sep 01 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) placed the scroll gently down on the sandy surface as she looked at her father and said "..W-What do you mean a better place?"* - Tue Sep 01 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) placed her hands forward, and attempted to push her father as she then says "No! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me!"* - Tue Sep 01 18:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) was grabbed by her father and coiled around him. Hearing the words that she died and commited suicide hit her deep, tears flooded her eyes as they came down her face. "W-What..H-How....Why...W-Why!" she dug her face into her fathers chest as more tears fells down her cheek. She couldn't beleive that her mother was actually gone.* - Tue Sep 01 18:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) continued to cry, her tears seemed to get a portion of her fathers shirt wet. She continued to sob and remain close to her father, motionless. She was thinking back at the good times they had, when they used to have family dinner, talk about how there days were. Ya know, the good stuff. But now, it just seemed that it was only Ozui and Saseki that remained of the family.* - Tue Sep 01 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) stopped sobbing and looked at her father, wiping off her tears as she then said "I'm..Sorry for getting your shirt wet dad." she stated as she continued to wipe her face.* - Tue Sep 01 19:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) she rubbed her eyes as she then said "Can I um... Finish reading the scroll?.." she asked.* - Tue Sep 01 19:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
With that she went and picked the scroll up from the sandy surface, wiping off some of the sand that got placed on the context. She slowly began to read the scroll, her eyes felt heavy, maybe it was from all the crying she did earlier. Her eyes seemed to be a bit red from all the crying she did earlier. She sighed heavily, it looks like they are the last remaining survivors of there family. She hasn't even heard from her brother since they moved. Maybe he died along with mother?

She didn't want to think about it, if she thought more about the subject, she would surely cry more and that's something she wanted to prevent for now. She had to focus back on the task at hand, and that was to finish reading the scroll so she can learn the shadow clone jutsu and move on by learning the other two scrolls in her father's jacket pockets, that he gave her. She kind of wished she had a memento from her mother.* - Tue Sep 01 19:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) dropped the scroll and looked at her father and said "Can... I have it..."* - Tue Sep 01 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) slowly extended her hand outward and grabbed the katana. But it was big on her, so she instead strapped it to upper shoulder. * - Tue Sep 01 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) saw her fathers fire technique, and was amazed by it, but she continued to unravel the shadow clone jutsu scroll and read the scrolls contents, she continued to read the scrolls contents as she scratched the top of her head and sighed loudly. She then says "This is taking so long.. Soon enough I'll be done.." she stated talking to herself. But continuing to read the scrolls contents carefully and throughly.* - Tue Sep 01 20:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) looked at her father and squinted and says "Oh yeah! I'll show you!" she frowned. She quickly read the scrolls contents, she wanted to prove to her father that she -could- use the technique, and once she uses it, she'll have some fun playing hide n' seek! Jesus that's such a loner status. But she continued to read the scroll and stop getting off topic, there was something here that gave valuable information, the scroll read that if you don't have the right chakra reserves for the technique, you could die from chakra exhaustion.

Saseki scratched her left cheek, she was kind of nervous, did she have enough chakra reserves to learn the technique? I guess the only way to find out was to try and use the technique herself, of course probably training the technique could be a pain in the ass. But it would be worth it in the long run. Finally she reached the breaking point of the scroll.

Which that breaking point was the ending, upon finish reading the scroll she raveled it up and gave it to her father and smiled and said "Done!"* - Tue Sep 01 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) performed the required handsigns for the Shadow Clone Technique, she gathered up the natural chakra for the technique, having the pools of chakra in her system fluctuate, and then suddenly it remained calm. She then upon finishing the handsigns held the last handsign, continueing to gather up the chakra nessessary for the technique.

She then shouted "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" as an exact duplicate of herself appeared, but upon using it she started to pant and had her knee's fall to the sandy surface. She started to pant, as she then says "Almost..."* - Tue Sep 01 20:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) got up from the sandy surface and looked around and said "I could play tag....WITH MYSELF!" she stated excited.* - Tue Sep 01 20:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) started to form the handsigns for the Shadow Clone Technique once more, gathering up the required amount of chakra needed to perform the technique itself. She held the last handseal, gathering up the right amount of chakra for to execute the technique, after awhile of holding the last handseal she shouted "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" and created exactly one replica of her shadow clone. Once she did that, she sat down on the soft sandy surface. But of course she evenly distributed the right amount of chakra to the clone.

After awhile of resting Saseki got up and said "Tag your it!" and tagged the clone's shoulder, she then started to run around in a circle, having her clone follow her. This was probably a great idea for Ozui to teach his daughter a time passing jutsu in a way for her to entertain herself. Loner Status: Naruto.* - Tue Sep 01 21:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
After a long while of playing tag, the shadow clone said "I'll be right back!" as it ran off to go up north. Saseki just sat on the sandy surface and chilled there.* - Tue Sep 01 21:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) turned her heels and ran back down south. Nothing new here.* - Tue Sep 01 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Saseki's shadow clone finally reached her and disappeared in a puff of smoke. Nothing new near the north side of Sunagakure it would seem.* - Tue Sep 01 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) woke up, rubbing her eyes. She got up and decided to practice her jutsu, afterall practice makes perfect right? And so she formed the nessessary handsigns for the technique, and upon completeing them, she held the last handsign. As she began to gather up some chakra, it was seemingly visable for a quick second, and then disappeared. Saseki then shouted "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" as an exact replica of herself was formed.

Saseki started to pant, and then tagged her clone and said "Tag your it!~" she stated gleefully, and started to run around the area, while her clone chased her around.* - Wed Sep 02 23:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) stopped running, and she weilded a single handsign and dispelled the clone. She looked at her father and shrugged and said "It was an alright village.. I guess.." she stated, as she looked at the ground. She didn't really make any friends in Sunagakure at all.* - Wed Sep 02 23:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) was placed in the mansion, she looked around the room and said "Wow..Roomy." it was definately a lot more roomier than she expected. But now she got more time to practice the shadow clone technique, she quickly formed the handsigns for the technique once more, holding the last handsign and gathering up a lot of chakra to perform the techinque. It was true though, that the Shadow Clone Technique took out massive amounts of her chakra reserves, but if she continued to practice it, she would get better.

She finally executed the jutsu, having an exact replica of herself took form in the room. Followed by a plume of smoke, which eventually disappeared, the clone itself went ahead and surveyed the room, went door to door trying to find anything worth while. To maybe see if anyone else had the house before them, or if someone left anything in the house.

But after awhile of searching, nothing new or old was in the house. So the clone dispelled itself, Saseki decided to also regain her chakra at the time, she sat on one of the pillows and meditated.* - Thu Sep 03 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) took out a scroll and exmained it, after further examination she looked at her father and said "Can't you just...Teach me this.. Ya know... I think it would be easier than learning from a scroll... Take's to much time, ya know?" she stated looking at her father, curious if he'd even do it.* - Thu Sep 03 01:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) scratched the top of her head and said "Mmmk!" she quickly pointed her index finger upwards, followed by her concentrating on trying to use the technique to distribute even amounts of chakra to said finger. Upon doing this though, her chakra fluctuated, causing the chakra at the tip of her finger to be rather visable. As it appeared and slowly disappeared. She grunted and continued to try, she murmured to herself "Hnn.." it seems she took more of her fathers personality in a way.

But sweat was dripping down the side of her face, she continued to sit on the pillow, basically meditateing to regain the chakra she just lost on trying to even use the jutsu. The jutsu itself seemed really advanced for someone her age, and rank espeically. But after awhile of resting and regaining back her chakra, she quickly pointed her index finger upward once more. She then said to herself "I probably have to evenly distribute chakra to my finger..Which like father said, takes a lot of control.." control was something she didn't have much of.

But none the less she still tried her best to atleast perform the technique at hand. She started to really, really concentrate. Sweat continued to drip from her person. The chakra at the tip of her finger was visable once again, a faint blue chakra to be exact. She then carefully tried to mark the wall, but with that she poked it instead. It didn't even mark, which ment that the technique still needed worked on.

She then said "One more time.." she sat back down on the pillow and started to regain her chakra once more, infact this seemed like it was going to be repetitive process, which could prove boring. But after awhile of regaining back her chakra, she quickly distributed chakra to the tip of her finger once more, which of course this time, it didn't seem to fluctuate. It seemed to stay at a visable blue color.

She then said "I think I got it .... This time.. I think." she stated, as she attempted to mark the wall once more, but this time when she marked it, she traced her finger down the wall. Leaving a long ass visable line. She stopped processing chakra to the tip of her finger and looked at her father and said "...Did I do it right?"* - Thu Sep 03 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) nodded and yawned and said "I'll practice it more.. Tomorrow... Good night dad." she statd as she laid down on the pillow to drift to sleep.* - Thu Sep 03 02:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) woke up rubing her eyes, she slowly crawled away from her father, got up, yawned, and stretched. She took her mothers samurai sword and slowly placed it on the ground. She then formed several handsigns, obviously performing the Shadow Clone Technique. Saseki while holding the last handsign, she then with a plume of smoke an exact replica of herself took place. She stroked her chin and said "Mmmm. Little more practice." she stated as she dispelled her clone.* - Fri Sep 04 00:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) got up from sleeping, and grabbed the blanket that smelled a lot like her mother. She shuffled up the stairs, not really giving much of a care what was going on between her father and the newcomer.* - Fri Sep 04 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) started to perform several handsigns, and upon performing the last set of handsigns, she held the last one. As her chakra started to surge through-out her body. The blanket she seemingly had one, slowly slipped down her small body, to which she undid her handsigns and quickly grabbed it. She said in a low tone "I won't allow this blanket to touch the ground." she stated to herself. She grabbed the blanket and wrapped it around her body.

Once she knew it was secure, she began to form the handsigns for the related technique she was going to perform, which of course was the Shadow Clone Jutsu technique. Upon forming the handsigns, Saseki's chakra started to surge through-out her body once more, a visable blue aura was clear on her. But after awhile it slowly vanished. She finished her final handsign, and held it there for awhile.

And then she finally said "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" as a puff of smoke appeared right next to her, forming an exact replica of herself. She sighed slowly, she examined the clone up and down until she finally unsheathed her samurai sword, which was a memento of her mothers. And stabbed the clone in the chest with it. The clone puffed with white smoke, as it spread across the area. She sheathed the samurai sword, and looked around.

Saseki sighed once more and began to walk back down the stairs.* - Fri Sep 04 20:58:52 2015

Le frown was still there.

She moved her hands to her samurai sword, and gripped it. She sighed slowly, she felt like her father was going to forget about her entirely.* - Fri Sep 04 23:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) nodded her head.

She formed several handsigns, her chakra flared, making it clearly visable around her, a faint blue chakra pretty much surrounded her person. After completeing her handsigns, Saseki said a loud "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" as a large puff of white smoke, took its place next to Saseki, forming an exact replica of herself. The clone took off the samurai sword, and placed it on the ground. Considering the sword itself, in a way was kind of heavy. But she would learn how to utilize the katana later.

Saseki's clone charged forth toward her father, but this was a slow encounter. (Speed 1.)* - Fri Sep 04 23:24:48 2015

She wielded a single handsign and dispelled the clone, she then said "..I'm getting tired...We can do this another time." she stated lazily. She started to walk back toward her room, which was up north and to the right.* - Fri Sep 04 23:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) grabbed her sword and looked at her father, she did a run and slide and slid right next to her father and says "I'm high numbers!" she stated excited. As she rolled the dice mid-slide.* - Sat Sep 05 21:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) grabbed the dice and pocketed it.

She sat on a pillow and stared at her father, and squinted at him. "You cheated."* - Sat Sep 05 21:52:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) started to form handsigns on the same technique she's been trying to master for a long ass time, and that was the shadow clone technique. But once she was done forming the handsigns, a faint blue chakra bursted around her figure. Saseki then shouted out "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" in a plume of smoke, an exact replica of herself took it's place beside her. She sighed loudly and said "Tag" the clone nodded it's head as it tagged the original Saseki first, this caused Saseki to get pissed and chase after it.* - Sun Sep 06 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) wielded a single handsign and dispelled the shadow clone of herself, it exploded in a plume of smoke as she sighed and said "...I want to go outside and play.. But father won't let me do anything." she stated to herself.* - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) frowned.

She continued to sit on the soft pillow, crossing her arms, thinking of what else could be determined as vicious.* - Mon Sep 07 14:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) squinted at her father and spoke.

"You'll win, it's no fun when I'm the only one breaking a sweat, while you just stand around not even breaking a sweat to begin with." she stated looking at her father.* - Mon Sep 07 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) sighed.

She looked down at her mothers samurai sword that was given to her as a memento. She  rubbed her fingers on the sheath, Saseki took it off and placed it on the pillow. She hated to admit it, but she really didn't like kenjutsu, and thought it really wasn't much of her style. Saseki started to form some handsigns, and upon doing the handsigns her chakra flared, being a faint blue color around her body. She then finished the handsigns, holding the last handsign, the chakra subsided as she created a clone of herself, which followed with a puff of smoke.

The replica of Saseki sighed, and began to walk toward her father, things were pretty boring around here to begin with, her mother is dead, her brother went missing. The maid is also missing, and the newcomer she saw come in here couple days ago is also missing. Thing's were getting fishy, and Saseki didn't like it.

Why was she sheltered her whole life? She barely even left the house to go play. She'd always play inside the house, like tag and stuff. Saseki's clone spoke up, considering clones also had minds of there own "Why am I being so sheltered."* - Mon Sep 07 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Saseki's clone sighed, she decided to throw a weak leveled punch toward her fathers gut. There was definately no umf into the punch, she had no motivation.* - Mon Sep 07 17:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Her reflexes wasn't that quick, so when he swung down, it hit her regardless. The shadow clone itself came rushing in, the original being Saseki, she grabbed a hold of the sword. Her black eyes eyeing her father.* - Mon Sep 07 18:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
The clone tried to do a tackle, while Saseki threw her fathers Bokken at him. This wasn't the best idea considering he could probably jump up and grab it, but for now she tried it anyway.* - Mon Sep 07 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) ||
Clone ran into Saseki, causing her to fall back and hit her head against the wall behind her. The shadow clone dispelled itself. And Saseki was left there rubbering the back of her head as she then said "See, it's not point in this.." she stated obviously annoyed.* - Mon Sep 07 18:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) crossed her arms and continued to sit on the soft pillow. Her mothers samurai sword was next to her.* - Mon Sep 07 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) formed several handsigns, and upon forming the handsigns she clapped her hands together. An aura of chakra emitted from her surroundings. Saseki was gathering up the required amount of chakra needed to perform the technique she was about to perform. And after awhile of charging it up, she finally releaed it by saying "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" as plume of smoke appeared next to her, followed by an exact replica of herself.

Saseki shook her head and held a handsign, she dispelled the clone and continued to sit on the pillow. She sighed loudly as a tear fell down her face. She then spoke to herself "I wish you were still here mom...And you to Orihara..." * - Fri Sep 11 16:56:57 2015

She held the last one, as chakra flared around her, being a visable blue chakra. But after awhile it subsided, as Saseki then said "Shadow Clone Jutsu!" as a puff of smoke appeared next to her, followed by an exact replica of herself. Saseki then nodded her head and said "I can feel it being less of a strain now.." she stated to herself. As she held another handsign and dispelled the clone.* - Fri Sep 11 21:36:00 2015
