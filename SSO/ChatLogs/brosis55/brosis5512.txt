<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out from the confines of his robes, his last mission scroll. He examined the outside of the scroll, analyzing it, before reading on the side "Locat Missing Cat." he sighed, another worthless mission, however this could help him out by utilizing his speed. This could be good practice.

He opened the scrolls confinements. He nodded his head in approval, closing the scroll and placing it back inside his robe pockets, he went off into the forest to find the missing cat, and to hope that he could get this damn mission, done and over with. If he finds this cat, he'll just use the wire bind technique, and just drag it back to the mansion or something. 

Upon entering into the forest, he had focus his eye sight on finding the animal. Scanning the area, it seemed like he'd never find the damn thing. It could be small, or large. He could only hope it was large so he could spot it rather easily, but alas, it wasn't going to go his way, nothing really ever does go his way. He's always had to do shit the hard way really.

Jumping from tree line to tree line, Takuma stopped and spotted the animal. Doing a quick set of hand signs, kneading chakra in his body's system for a short while, then when the kneading of chakra was complete. So was his hand signs. Out of his sleeves, came out strands of wire, that wrapped itself around the animal's frame.

Once that was done, he'd literally drag it back to the mansion. And once he got there, he threw the animal onto the wodden flooring. "Done." was all he said, as the wiring was dispersed from the animal's frame. It didn't seem to hurt the animal at all, the only time it got hurt was when he dragged it, and threw it on the floor. It was a gentle throw though, cats have nine lives after all, right?* - Thu Dec  3 06:17:36 2015

Sogeki was a real nigga, Takuma, walked over and placed the Mud Wolves scroll on the table. And with that, he walked out of the area, he was going to leave them alone for now, it looked like they needed it.* - Thu Dec  3 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) noticed the weird looking individual, raising an eyebrow as the female craned her head to the side. "What the fuck. . ." he thought to himself. This chick looked weird from the get go. But he didn't say anything, he continued to lean against the mountain, his eyes, remained on the female however.* - Thu Dec  3 06:56:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) felt a little creeped out, this was to close for comfort.

"Hm. . .I don't think so."* - Thu Dec  3 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) had his chin gripped, while still staring at the female.

"I dress myself thanks. I had people that used to care for me, but they're dead." he stated, awaiting to see what she says next. His eyes however, continued to make eye contact with hers.* - Thu Dec  3 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
"We have a uh, ramen shop not far from here. I'm sure you'll enjoy the food they prove there. It's pretty good food." he didn't like how things were going however, she leaned into Takuma rather closely. * - Thu Dec  3 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
His ears twitched at the hearing of her moaning. "The hell?" he said to himself. But then, that's when it happened. The woman bit down on his shoulder, which as covered by the cloths he was wearing, granted, she could probably bite through it, he wouldn't know for sure, but if anything. He could definately feel a burning sensation.

Takuma, had to be gentle in this situation, he knew how females were. He tried to gently push her head off of his shoulder, and if that was a success, he'd move himself a certain distance away from the weird female. He gripped his shoulder, and rotated it slowly. "I can feel a burning sensation." he said to himself.* - Thu Dec  3 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Takuma pushed Yuriko aggressively away from him. The amount of force he had on the push, was definately great. It was definately a struggle when he did this. He clenched his teeth, the amount of pain he was feeling, was definately incredible. "Fuck!" he screamed. 

If the pushing off of her was a success, then he'd try to distance himself. * - Thu Dec  3 07:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Once the distance was established, Takuma formed several hand signs, however; they were slowed. They weren't as quick as before. He kneaded chakra in his body's system for a short while, before he was finished with the hand signs, the kneading in chakra was complete. He formed the last hand sign. 

In a plume of smoke next to him, appeared an exact replica of himself. This was still a strain for him however. The shadow clone, ripped off one of Takuma's sleeves, and wrapped it around his shoulder that was bleeding. He winced in pain, clenching his teeth. Once the shadow clone finished that, it sprung into action. It made it's way toward Eiyu's position.

Takuma, nodded his head, and ran for the hospital. Eiyu's only help for right now, was Takuma's clone, who also had Takuma's same injury.* - Thu Dec  3 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Eiyu. . .Don't do it. - Thu Dec  3 07:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) //
The Clone yelled toward Eiyu.

"Don't be fooled by her looks! Look at what happened to my shoulder!" the clone yelled. He could only hope, that Eiyu wouldn't fall so helplessly toward the females beauty. Deep down inside, the chick was definately a killing machine from the looks of things, she drew blood on Takuma's shoulder, in less than a couple of seconds. Who knows what she could be capable of doing.* - Thu Dec  3 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
The clone's eyes widened, as it bared witness to the massive toad that was summoned before them. The clone was shaking slightly, only to smack himself gently, to snap him out of it. He inhaled, then exhaled slowly. "Oi! Big guy! I wouldn't trust this female!" The clone pointed toward Yuriko. "See my shoulder? She did that!" he yelled at the big toad. * - Thu Dec  3 08:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
The clone made it's way toward Yuriko.

"Uh. . .Yo, are you alright there?" the clone poked her shoulder. But was also very careful, in case he had to utilize his speed to make a fast get away, he would do so. * - Thu Dec  3 08:05:58 2015

The clone was jumped on by the female, her breasts were pressed against his belly, as for her face, it was near the clones chest. "I'm sure uh, he'll come back at a later time. . .Maybe he had to uh, take care of his kids? Ya know?" By this point, the clone was just pulling shit out of his ass.* - Thu Dec  3 08:10:14 2015

The clone continued to make eye contact with the female. 

"Yeah, I'm sure. Uh, they go somewhere uh. . Up there. . " he pointed toward the sky. Then pressed his hands against the ground's surface, having it to where, he sat up straight.* - Thu Dec  3 08:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
The clone shook his head.

"What did I tell you earlier, Eiyu?" the clone was ashamed. He knew what Eiyu was all about. The clone, formed several hand signs, kneaded katon chakra in his body's system for a short while. <This is all I can give for now, Eiyu. Use this chance, to get the fuck out of here.> The clones chest, expanded slightly, however, the clone ran a certain distance away from the two.

After the kneading of charka was done, so was the hand signs. Opening his maw, out came a large fireball toward the two of them. This however, was made to only seperate the two. The clone, got on one knee. One eye was closed, while the other eye was opened. "I gave you an opening, now use it, fool."

The clone, disappeared into a plume of smoke shortly after.* - Thu Dec  3 08:32:25 2015

Clone was disperese nigga, the attacks were pretty powerful.* - Thu Dec  3 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Upon being at the hospital, Takuma ordered the nurses to do something about his shoulder, wrap it around with bandages, something that would hopefully, help stop the bleeding. But once the nurses have finished, Takuma, got out  the bed, and had too make his way toward Eiyu once again. He couldn't leave the Raikage alone with that woman. Who know's what she's capable of doing.

However; it seemed the nurses stopped, and told Takuma to stay in bed, to where Takuma declined, he pushed passed them, and made his way out of the hospital doors. The ironic thing was? The hospital was pretty much near the Kage mansion, so it wasn't that far of a walk to begin with. Hands, remained in his robe pockets however.* - Thu Dec  3 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) raised an eyebrow.

Taking note that Yuriko, still had dry blood on her lips, and her neck, and on her breasts. Takuma didn't forget about that, so when she inched closer toward his own lips, he tilted his head to the side, to avoid the contact with their lips, if that was to ever occur. "What kind of deal?"* - Thu Dec  3 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Indeed, the smell of blood was definately still heavy on Yuriko. It flew into his nostrils. Takuma, pondered this for a moment, as she continued to keep her face close to his own. "Yes, I do know. . . .I like the idea, but you'd have to do it in a secret room. Not where all the prisoners could see you. That way it prevents them from seeing whats to come." he stated. He hoped the decision he made, was on that Eiyu could possibly make aswell.* - Thu Dec  3 09:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) nodded his head.

"Sure, sure. If you can fix me up, that'd be great too." he asked, rather curious to what she'd do to fix his shoulder. The bandages he had on his upper left shoulder, were covered in dry blood. His eyes shifted fro Yuriko, toward the new individual that waltzed into the village, he wondered if the guards let the male in.

"Nah, he's sleeping." he shifted his gaze back at Yuriko. * - Thu Dec  3 09:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) was putting his faith into this woman. He had no idea what was about to happen, and if he was to close his eyes? What if she was to bite him again? Or eat him? But, Takuma did a he was told. He carefully took off his robe, and threw it to the side. Underneith the robe, was a light grey shirt. The bandages on his upper left shoulder, showed dry blood.

Takuma, carefully removed the bandages, wincing in pain. "There. . ." he said, as he closed his eyes, and awaited for whatever was going to happen.* - Thu Dec  3 09:36:25 2015

"Thank you. I appreciate it. What's your name again?" he asked, curious to who the young healer was. Maybe she was an advanced medic? Maybe she was good at healing wounds. 

Yo, what if she was a fuuinjutsu specialist, and placed a bunch of explosive tags onto his shoulder. And he just didn't know about it. If that was the case, then god damn, he would be the perfect ambush. He shook his head, he doubt something like that would ever happen.* - Thu Dec  3 09:42:24 2015

"A deal is a deal, a promise is a promise. If we have prisoners for you to eat, then you may eat them." he stated rather bluntly.

Takuma stood there, waiting for the people inside the house to open the door. And once they opened it, it was revealed to be a young lady, looked like she was about eighteen, to nineteen years old.

After they relocated, Takuma, from his peripheral vision, he could see Asin. But his main focus, was on Nigen. With a quick set of hand signs, he kneaded katon chakra in his system. Upon completeing the hand signs, he opened his maw, and out came a large fireball toward Nigen's current position.

Takuma, however didn't stay in one spot, he relocated. Utilizing his speed, he'd move diagnol.* - Sat Dec  5 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) raised an eyebrow.

It seemed that Nigen, has yet to throw an attack at Takuma. Could he be a close ranged individual? There was only one way to test this theory. Once again, he made a full sprint toward Nigen's current position by this point, taking out a single kunai, which was in his right hand. He'd attempt, to give Nigen a small cut on his shoulder.* - Sat Dec  5 22:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
His wrist was grasped by Nigen's hand, this halted his attack. He diverted his gaze toward the knee that had been sent toward Takuma's gut region. Once it made contact, Takuma only winced in pain. It wasn't that damaging thankfully. Maybe his opponet was holding back? His wrist was still being tightly held by Nigen's hand, so he struggled to be released. 

If that wasn't to work, then Takuma would send a punch toward the male's jawline. He wasn't going full out, if anything, he held back on the punch he sent toward Nigen's jawline.* - Sat Dec  5 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
His leg definately buckled. His balance was shot down, and thus, distance was created. Takuma looked over toward Nigen, smiling. "Heh. . I guess you're right. . .But hey, maybe next time, we can continue this spar. I forgot something in Kumogakure." he stated, as he placed the kunai back in his kunai holister. Hands were in his robe pockets.

He turned on his heels before walking away, he said one last thing. "Thanks for the spar, Osda."* - Sat Dec  5 22:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) quietly went into the home, he started to tip toe into the building. Upon entering the home, he surveyed the inside of the house. It looked like your average home. Slowly, he made his way toward the drawers in the house. He opened it slowly. Once opened, he took a pair of panties and threw them over toward Eiji. "Should we put these panties on peoples mail boxes?" he whispered.* - Sun Dec  6 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) pondered this for a short while, but he shook his head.

"No, there's probably people still there. Let's go put these panties on peoples mail boxes first." he stated. Takuma, quickly grabbed whatever panties this woman had left in her household, and quickly went outside with Eiji. Takuma carefully, placed the panties on the mail boxes, going house to house. In total, there would've been ten panties, on ten different mail boxes. Takuma smirked. "Ya know what. . .Let's try the mansion."* - Sun Dec  6 03:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) utilized his suimen ability, quickly and effectively, Takuma climbed up the side of the mountain, all the while carrying Eiji. This process, was indeed strainful, mainly because Eiji was all muscle. But once they reached the top of the mansion, Takuma jumped ontop of the roof of the building, Eiji beside him. He whispered toward him. "We need to be quick, before we get spotted. . " he stated.

Quickly, he tied majority of the panties he had in his hands, into a somewhat small flag. He then, tied it onto the first pole that was on the roof of the Konohagakure Mansion. It flew proudly in the wind. Takuma nodded his head, and chuckled a bit. "We should probably get going here soon." he stated toward Eiji.* - Sun Dec  6 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) performed several hand signs. Kneading chakra within his body's system for a short while. Once he completed the hand signs, he slammed his hand against the ground. In a plume of smoke, a small dark green toad appeared before them. It opened it's mouth, and it began to suck Takuma into the toad, but before he was fully engulfed into the toad, he grabbed Eiji's arm, and took him into the toad's body with him.

This prevented any type of ninjutsu detection. Sensorys wouldn't find them. The toad, then hoped into the water, going 100 meters deep into the water.* - Sun Dec  6 03:46:08 2015

The dark green toad, hopped out of the water, opening its mouth, Takuma and Eiji came out of it. Quickly, they manevoured their way around the trees that surrounded Konohagakure no Sato. "We got to get out of here." he stated loud  enough for Eiji to hear.* - Sun Dec  6 03:57:13 2015
