Suddenly he opened up his skin's pores, and formed several handsigns at a quick speed, as bugs started to crawl out of his face, arms, hands, feet, everywhere. They swarmed Maloth in a frenzy, there intended goal? It was to slow Maloth down, but not just that, but to also suck the man's chakra dry until he was unconcious. He needed to complete his D rank misson that was given to him nearly a month ago, but couldn't complete it because he got injured in an A rank misson. Now is the perfect time to try.* - Sat Oct  3 04:24:32 2015

Arnitanu's reflex ability was shit no less, but regardless the bugs did their job and latched onto Maloth's muscular frame, and once Arntianu got hit by the hammer, it literally sent him flying across the cobble flooring. Suddenly he continued to do more handsigns, but this time, more and more bugs came out of his body, from him opening his pores, this time however instead of just 100 bugs, this time it was 400 bugs, as they started to once again swarm Maloth's person.

Arnitanu wanted to get this fight over with,  as quick as possible but none the less, Maloth was on the prawl and if he was to get hit by that hammer once more, he'd probably get knocked out. * - Sat Oct  3 04:39:02 2015

However Arnitanu was still breathing which was a good thing.* - Sat Oct  3 04:54:24 2015

He stopped leaning against the tree, and turned to look at them. "None of ya fuckin business mate." Gakuto started to form several handsigns, as he started to build up katon chakra within his bodies system, molding the chakra, and after he completed the handsigns, Gakuto held the last handsign while looking at them. He jumped back, he was a rouge shinobi, however, if they were to look at his forehead protector, the Konoha symbol had a line through it.

His chest expanded slightly, as he opened his mouth and out came out volleys of small fireballs that he sent forth in an unpredictable manner, they were all sent forth toward Shinjin, Ortho, and Takeda.* - Sat Oct 10 18:20:22 2015

They thought this was an easy mission however, the body poofed into a log, which had explosive tags attached to every part of it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) sighed, he sat down on the sandy surface. forming a couple handsigns, and holding the last one. <...Partial Expansion Jutsu..> He held out his right arm, as it expanded and grew in size. He punched the ground below him, as a slight shockwave occured. He frowned. <...Not as strong as I thought...> his arm then, returned back to normal size. He was barely even tried, he continued to sit down on the sandy surface, taking out a bag of chips and eating it. All by his lonesome, seemed like there would be no one else around him. Which sadden him greatly, considering he hasn't made that many friends yet.

After finishing the chips, he threw the chip bag behind him, as he laid his back against the ground. Staring up at the sky. He had no friends, and no family. No one to call his own, no one at all. And it did sadden him quiet a bit. However, he needed to do something, he needed to get training, and that was exactly what he was going to do, however he didn't know who to ask, it seemed like the Kazekage Hassan was always busy, and so he would probably be delayed.

He sat up straight, sighing once more. <....I should walk around or something..> he thought to himself. But then he threw that thought to the the side, he was just going to chill out near the moutains and houses. He slowly got up, and leaned against the cliffs. Crossing his arms and just thinking about life at this very moment, wondering how else he would get strong.* - Fri Oct 16 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) sat down on the ground, he took out some chips and opened it slowly. And once he opened it he started to eat the chips pretty damn fast. Considering he was kind of fat, and fat boys needed there food.* - Sat Oct 17 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) finished his chips, he got up, walked to the trash bin, threw the bag of chips away. And sat back on the ground. Just chillen there.* - Sat Oct 17 19:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey Yan.. do you have anything cool to show me? - Sat Oct 17 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) got his fat self up, and ran toward the scroll. He grabbed it and looked at Yan. "Thank you very much!" he stated as he started to run the other direction, wanting to get the scroll learning and mastered. But ya boy was fat, so it was a slow process.* - Sat Oct 17 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: I wonder if he is like Flexus..We sha'll find out soon. - Sat Oct 17 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) took out the scroll, excited to learn something knew, he quickly unraveled the scroll and started to read it throughly. He wanted to absorb all the information in the scroll, and once he does that, he wants to learn some advanced techniques. He wanted to grow to be big and strong. He wanted to become the best of the best, no matter what the cost. However, he didn't have that many friends just yet. Maybe Yan would be Daiki's first friend? That sounds pretty exciting in his mind.

However, he had to focus, he continued to read the scrolls information on the doton technique that he grabbed. Wondering what he could do with the technique, he also wondered what else Yan had up his sleeve, wondering if he had more than juts doton related techniques, however that would come later on in life. For now he had to focus on learning this jutsu first.* - Sat Oct 17 20:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) after he had gotten done reading the scroll, he raveled it up and placed it in his back pocket. He then started to form several handsigns, having doton chakra manifest within his bodies system, and when he was done doing that, he opened his mouth, as a river full of mud came flowing out of his mouth and was flowing across the sandy surface. After he was done using the technique he sat down gathering up chakra. It wasted quiet a bit.* - Sat Oct 17 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) continued to practice the Mud Silhouette technique, forming several handsigns for the technique in general, having the doton chakra within his bodies system mold itself. And after he was done making the handsigns, he stood there holding the last handsign. He raised an eyebrow and thought to himself before releasing the technique. <...Is there anyone else that can do what I can do besides my parents?> he thought about this for a long while. But then brushed it off, there probably was no one else who could actually do what he does.

However, he released the jutsu he was holding onto for so long, as he opened his maw and sent forth a flowing mud river, as it started to wash up some of the sand aswell. It died down after it traveled a few feet. Daiki however scratched the top of his head, he was bored of this technique already, and it seemed like the drain on it was already going away. However, he took out a bag of chips, opened them and started to eat out of them. He was hungry, but then again ya boy was fat and needed the food.

He munched on these chips like there was no tomorrow, and after he was done eating the chips he threw them to the side, yeah that's right, Daiki litered boy. He started to skip across the field, wondering what else Yan could teach him, but then again Yan wasn't probably going to teach him another jutsu until he mastered this one first, so he stopped prancing about and actually decided to try and master the jutsu.

And if he does get it mastered, he'd reward himself with some snacks and such. He deserves it after all the practice he's doing right now.* - Sat Oct 17 20:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) formed a couple handsigns, after finishing the handsigns, his arm swelled up. Daiki, then poked the turtle with his index finger, which was rather huge. Suddeny he was uninterested. His arm unexpanded itself as he turned on his heels. "Maybe next time turtle guy..I forgot to go take a dump. Going to go do that. Yeah.."* - Sat Oct 17 21:01:13 2015
