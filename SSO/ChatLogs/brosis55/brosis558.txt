Got his index finger cut, a slight pain overcame him. "Alright. . ." he signed the contract with his blood. And awaited further orders on what to do next, from Eiyu.* - Thu Nov 26 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Now, follow my handmovements. - Thu Nov 26 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) watched carefully as Eiyu perfomed the jutsu, and summoned a frog from the void. Takuma, was amazed at how simple it was, to just summon a animal whenever he wanted. Although, he felt like animals hated when that kind of shit happened, so he wouldn't really abuse it that much. And so, Takuma, brung his thumb near his mouth, and bit down on it. 

And then, he performed several hand signs. He molded chakra within his body's system for a short while. When he was done forming the hand signs, he slammed his palm against the ground's surface. A plume of smoke, surrounded his entire hand. When the smoke finally subsided. A tad pole was on the ground. " . . . . .That ain't right. . " he shook his head, that was embarressing.

With the blood that was still trickling from his thumb, he decided to form the same hand signs, once again. And once he finished doing the hand signs, he slammed his palm on the ground's surface. Once again, a plume of smoke, could be seen, until the smoke finally subsided. A toad was then present infront of them.

The small toad, spoke. "Hey guy! Do you got any snacks?"

Takuma, squinted his eyes. "Who, are you little man? And why do you want to have snacks at this very moment, didn't you eat before you were summoned?"

The toad, spoke again. "Names Gamatatsu! And yeah, I did. But I'm hungry again! Come on guy, give me some food!"* - Thu Nov 26 18:35:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) picked up the toad, and placed it ontop of his head. 

"Sure, we can get you some snacks, I guess." he turned on his heels, and started to walk out of the area, before he turned back around to look at Eiyu. "Thanks for teaching me. Hm. . .Do you know the earth element?" he asked rather curious, he wanted to know, so he could teach Eiyu some of his jutsu in return.

The toad on his head, patted Takuma's hair. "Hey big guy, I just want some food now! Teach this guy later!" Gamatatsu stated this, and looked around the place. "This places looks familiar."

Takuma groaned. "Ugh. ."* - Thu Nov 26 18:39:34 2015

"Alright, I'll teach you Earth Stone and Bamboo shoot." he stated, as he formed several hand signs. He started to mold doton chakra into his body's system, and after he finished his hand signs. The molding of chakra was finished. The earth infront of him, turned into four large spikes. But soon enough, they sunk back into the soil.

Gamatatsu spoke "Ooooooo!! That's niffty guy!"

Takuma sighed. "Name's Takuma, not guy." he looked over toward Eiyu. "You try to perform the technique now."* - Thu Nov 26 18:43:50 2015

Formed several hand signs once again. Molding doton chakra in his body's system for a short while. And when he finished the hand signs, the soil underneith him turned into a fluid, to where he grabbed Gamatatsu, and threw him toward Eiyu. "Catch, yo." before he sunk into the earths surface. Only to appear shortly after, behind Eiyu, and come out of the ground.

Gamatatsu, jumped off of his head, and landed on the table. "Alright guy! Thanks!" Gamatatsu, for being such a small-- tubby toad, it ate the miso ramen rather quickly. 

Takuma squinted his eyes. "You done?"

Gamatatsu, replied by nodding his head. "Yeah, I'm done! Let's go!" Gamatatsu exclaimed.
