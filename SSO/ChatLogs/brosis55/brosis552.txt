She placed down her mothers samurai sword, and sat down next to the tree, leaning against it. Staring at the sky, that was seemingly covered by the leaves.* - Fri Sep 18 22:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) yelped.

Ozui's grip was indeed strong, as she was slammed against the tree, her head hitting the back of it. She gasped for breath, as she resembled her mothers facial features more than her fathers. So this only made matters worse. Saseki coughed slightly, as he uttered just a few words.

"I...Di-..Didn't...Want to.....Die....Yet!" she exclaimed as tears flooded the seven year olds face.* - Fri Sep 18 22:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) was released, as he caressed her throat that was being choked by her father. Saseki thought of one other thing to do, and that was to take out a smoke bomb that she had in her pockets and threw it on the ground, while her father was busy being tramatized, she used the smoke as an escape plan. Saseki also quickly formed handsigns, and upon completeing them, she created 2 shadow clones. One going directly south, the other one tackling her father. While the original tried an escape.* - Fri Sep 18 22:53:13 2015

"You were really considering to kill me. Your own flesh and blood..." she stated, a hint of disappointment when she ended her sentence. Saseki didn't know how to feel about this situation. Her emotions were starting to get to her, but she bottled them up and didn't want to release them. Her whole family was all sorts of fucked up to be completely honest.* - Fri Sep 18 23:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) pushed her father.

"Don't touch me." she said, seemingly she said this was hate. As her onyx orbs pierced her fathers.* - Fri Sep 18 23:16:16 2015

Saseki held the back of her head, she had a headache after that  occurence. She then spoke softly, "I don't believe you.. Just..Leave me alone.." she stated.* - Fri Sep 18 23:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saseki O. Kimura(Brosis55) was still wrapped around her fathers grasp. There was something he wasn't getting through his thick skull.

There was a bruise mark on the right side of her neck, followed by bandages wrapped around her head from banging her head against the tree.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) says: Yeah. - Sat Sep 26 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) continued to keep up with the small squad of people he barely knew, although he did know Lyric, which was a plus. He was jumping from tree line to tree line, being a true ninja and all that good jazz. He occasionally looked behind them, just to see if they were being followed. He placed the kunai he had gripped in his hand back into his backpouch. He had a giant shuriken on his back, he could use that for some defensive purposes or something like that, or he could use it to throw at the enemy.

He'll decide on that later, but he was confident in Kilm's leadership abilities. But if he was to come back from this alive, he would definately have a story to tell to his friends whenever he makes new ones. Cause right now he only has one friend. But, Arnitanu quickly formed handsigns, as he opened up his pores that were on his right cheek, 3 bugs came out of it, he closed the pore shortly after. As he stopped for a second and had the three insects go toward three different places on his body. One on his right shoulder, one on his right knee. And the other one was on his right hand. Just in case they're was to be close combat, he would be ready.* - Sat Sep 26 19:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Forget using jutsu for a while . . . - Sat Sep 26 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) continued to move with his squadron, he was observing the area around them, this place was definately a wasteland, but once he heard Kilm's orders, he got ready to attack them, Arnitanu was best suited for long range combat, however he had to make sure the blacksmith was okay, and his squad mates for that matter. He quickly formed several handsigns, as he placed his arms outward, he opened up his forearms pores, as hundreds of bugs started swarming out of his arms.

The bugs rotated around him, he also made a portion of them gaurd the blacksmith, he charged forward, grabbing his Giant Shuriken and throwing it at one of the rouge shinobi, of course this rouge shinobi was obviously skilled enough to avoid it, the rouge shinobi simply side stepped it. To which Arni frowned, wasn't his best idea. He took out a single kunai, and wrapped an explosive tag around it. His bugs that were around him however, charged forth.

The bugs now started to swarm the rouge shinobi, to which the rouge shinobi formed several handsigns and used a katon technique to get rid of his bugs. Arni was furious by this point, considering those were -his- bugs, he would have to collect more later on, however. Arni quickly threw his explosive kunai toward the rouge shinobi.

To which the rouge shinobi, deflected it with another kunai, causing them to collide and explode upon impact. A smoke screen was obviously seen near Arni as he fought against the rouge shinobi. But it was a smoke screen, so he couldn't see shit. The rouge shinobi however, came out of the smoke screen, attempting to slash at Arni's chestal region. To where he got slashed, having it become a deep cut, as blood started to gush out of his chestal region.

Arni coughed out some blood, as he jumped back and formed several handsigns, he opened up his pores once more,  sending forth several hundreds of bugs again at the rouge, to occupy him as he took off his kimono, and wrapped it around his chest, to of course attempt to stop the blood from gushing out of his chest anymore. This was definately problematic.

He needed to end this quickly, although the rouge shinobi shunshined toward him, avoiding his bugs for a moment, as he sent attempted to stab toward his left leg, to which was a success for the rouge shinobi, once again a large gash was spotted on his leg. To where Arnitanu winced in pain. "Fuck!" his insects did a U-turn coming back and attacking the rouge shinobi.

This time the insects, got onto the rouge shinobi, surrounding the rouge shinobis whole body, sucking the rouge's chakra dry. Arnitanu started to pant, as the rouge shinobi got his chakra sucked dry, and had his insects return to him, he opened up his pores having the insects return into his body.

Arnitanu collapsed, face planting onto the dirt. He continued to breath heavily. He got some bad injuries right now.* - Sat Sep 26 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) before Taiga grabbed him, he took off his shirt, and wrapped it around his leg, to stop the bleeding. Although it was revealed when he took off his shirt that he was fairly muscular. He then got lifted and placed on Taiga's back. He coughed and said "I...Almost...forgot.." he opened up his finger's pores, as the bugs that were on his comrades flew back into his finger, as he closed the pore and said. "Thank you, Taiga. I appreciate it."* - Sat Sep 26 21:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) continued to get carried by Taiga, Arnitanu felt like a big bother, he left himself get injured and that costed himself, and the team to get delayed on their trip back to Konohagakure. Arnitanu murmured to himself "This is all my fault.. I'm delaying our destination back to Konoha.." but since Taiga was carrying Arnitanu, he probably heard him.

Although the 3 bugs he had on his body went back inside him, to which he opened his pores for this and then closed them once more. Being an Aburame can be hard sometimes.* - Sat Sep 26 21:11:53 2015
