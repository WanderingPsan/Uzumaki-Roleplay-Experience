". . . .Seriously." was all he said. But a mission was a mission, and he was going to complete it regardless of it's rank. It would help bring funds toward Kumogakure. "Yo, do you have any jutsu's in your arsenal I could learn or somethin, I've mastered majority of mine." he stated rather curious to see the Raikage's reaction.* - Tue Nov 24 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) grabbed one of the mission scrolls out of his back pocket, he unrolled the scroll infront of him. Carefully reading the scrolls information. First things first, he had to go and pick up a letter. That's fantastic. First of all, he had to repy to the Raikage. "No thanks. Fuuinjutsu seems useful, but I don't think I have the paitence for it." he stated, as he walked off into the distance to go pick up this dang letter.* - Tue Nov 24 05:54:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) made his way toward the post office, which was in Kumogakure no Sato. It wasn't that far of a walk, thank god for that. His hands remained in his pockets, as he made his way toward the post office. Upon entering the room, Takuma cleared his throat, and spoke. "I'm here for a letter." he told the employee. To which, the employee took out the letter, and gave it to Takuma. Takuma, tiped an imaginary hat toward the employee. "Thanks, yo."

He turned on his heels, and exited the post office. Once he returned back toward the mansion, he placed the letter back on the Raikage's desk. He reached into his back pocket, and pulled out the next mission. The next mission on the list, was to go and capture a run away dog. It seemed easy enough, after all, he was pretty speedy. He could probably get this done in a jiffy. * - Tue Nov 24 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) started to roam around the village of Kumogakure. Upon opening the scroll, he sighed. Trying to find run away dogs could prove troublesome. But god damn, he hated doing this kind of shit. His next mission after this, was definately going to be a difficult one. But a mission was a mission, and he had to get it done and completed with. The faster he got this done, the quicker it would be.

His eye sight, wasn't all the greatest. However, it didn't mean he couldn't train his eyes to be great. He squinted his eyes, scanning the general area carefully, and throughly. He unsquinted his eyes, and walked toward the ramen shop, upon entering the doors, Takuma cleared his throat and spoke. "Have you guys seen a run away dog anywhere around here?" he asked curious toward their answer.

One of the employee's shook their head. "No, I haven't seen a run away dog, try the outskirts of Kumogakure, or you could try the sparring arena north west of here." the employee suggested for Takuma. Takuma, nodded his head, and bowed respectfully. " Alright, thank you sir." he turned on his heels, and left the ramen shop, the shop seemed busy during this kind of day.

That was usually a good thing, however, he made his way toward the sparring arena. And that's where he saw the cowering dog. Takuma sighed, usually when dogs were cowering, it usually ment they were scared. Takuma, got on one knee, he took out a small treat, it was a honey bun. "C'mere boy." he said softly toward the animal in the corner.

The canine, slowly made it's way toward Takuma, and once it made it's way toward him. He fed the honey bun to the canine, and grabbed it. He pet it softly. "Time to take you to the mansion." he stated. He made the journey back, all the way toward the mansion, and once he got there, he placed the dog down infront of the assistant. "Here ya go." he said, turned on his heels, and left.* - Tue Nov 24 06:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Fuck. . . Building a house. . . - Tue Nov 24 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) grumbled to himself. He hated having to do pointless missions. But if he got this shit done now, the better off he could be. He placed his hands in his pockets, and casually walked away from the Kumogakure square. He carefully examined the area around him. Some buildings were rebuilt, other's were still destroyed. Edge really did fuck up Kumogakure. It was a shame, that they got hit the way they did. 

He clenched his teeth. <That lucky son of a bitch!> If only Takuma could've been there sooner, maybe then he could've saved someone, or maybe even have been a decoy so he could distract them, and have them escape. If only he was there sooner, if only he was stronger back then. It just continued to eat away at his mind. He shook his head, he couldn't let it bother him. The past, is the past. Now, is the present. That's what he needed to focus on.

Takuma, inhaled, then exhaled slowly. He was started to get enraged slightly, he needed to calm himself. He couldn't let rage cloud his mind. He had to use his head, and think clearly. If he was to try and fight Edge now, he would certainly die. He would need a great plan for this. "Focus, got to build a house. . . ." he said to himself.

Upon walking toward the construction sight of the house that needed to be built, he saw a bunch of workers there. Takuma shouted toward them, waving one hand in the air to get their attention. "Ooooooiiiii!!" he shouted. He jogged over toward them. "Yo, I'm here to help out yo." he stated toward the workers. The employee's looked at him with an eye brow raised, but then it clicked in their heads that this was Takuma, the one known as the Power-House of Kumogakure.

"Alright boys, let's get this shit started. No time to slack off." he said this and clapped his hands. "Come on, let's go, leettt's gooo!" And with that, the workers got to work, and started to construct the house, from the bottom, up. Takuma, didn't really help out much, he was moreso an observer by this point. He was just instructing them on what to do.

If anything, he was just here to watch and make sure nothing bad happened. It would suck if they were building this nice home, and someone was to attack them or something. That would definately be a terrible thing. However, Takuma saw one of them slacking, he pointed a finger at one of them. "Yo, keep workin!" he shouted at the male.

To where, he didn't argue, he continued to work. After a couple of long hours. The home was finally finished. Takuma, started to clap. "Nicely done gentlemen! I'll tell  the Raikage of your great work!" he shouted at them. He turned on his heels, and started to leave the area. "Good work gents!" was all he said as he left the area. Hands remained in his pockets, as he made his way back toward  the Kumogakure square.* - Tue Nov 24 06:22:17 2015

"This will be fun." 

Takuma, utilized his speed, and got out of the Carrot's range. He did a quick set of hand signs, molding doton chakra within his body's system. After he finished the hand signs, the molding of doton chakra was finished. The earth, surrounding Eiji, would rise up and create a carvern to imprison him in. And if this action was successful, he would create an opening infront of Eiji.* - Thu Nov 26 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Upon seeing this happen, Takuma frowned. Hand signs were once again formed, molding chakra for a short moment, before the molding of chakra was halted. A strand of wire, came out of his arm sleeve, it's destination, was made straight toward Eiji, in an attempt to immobolize his opponet. He could only hope, this would work.* - Thu Nov 26 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
The strands of wire, were broken from Eiji spinning. <. . Nicely done, Eiji.> he thought to himself. Takuma, formed several more hand signs, however, he squinted his eyes. ". . What the fuck . . .Is tha-" he was cut off short, when the carrots made their way toward Takuma. His eyes widened, he had to utilize his speed, and manevour around his own earthen corridor. It was clever on Eiji's part, to use the earthen corridor against Takuma.

Lesson learned. But, after he finished forming the hand signs for his technique. The very soil infront of Takuma, erupted into a earth dragon head. The earth dragon head, opened it's maw. A bright orb, could be seen inside the mouth of the dragon. It fired out, 10 mud balls toward Eiji.* - Thu Nov 26 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Eiji would have to get through the dragon head first. Those Carrot Drills, were even more deadly than the dragon heads attack. Takuma, had to build some distance, he quickly jumped back. Forming several hand signs, katon chakra building up in his body's system. And after he was done molding the katon chakra, he finished the hand signs. He opened his maw, and out came four small fireballs that were sent toward Eiji's current position.

Eiji was a deadly opponet at close range. If they were to fight at close range, Takuma would truely get rekt.* - Thu Nov 26 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Eiji was indeed, a great opponet. However he saw that Eiji was gaining rather fast. He had to change this, he did once again, another quick set of hand signs, molding chakra for a short while, but then, he finished forming the hand signs. Opening his maw once again, a river of mud came out, and made it's way toward his current position once again. He attempt this time, was to cause Eiji to become unbalanced.

And if this action was performed, he would have to think of another strategy. Considering, Eiji was a clever shinobi, he wasn't stupid. He played things smart. * - Thu Nov 26 04:26:14 2015
