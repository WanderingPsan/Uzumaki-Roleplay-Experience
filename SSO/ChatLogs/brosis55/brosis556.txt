<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hm. - Sun Nov 22 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) tips an imaginary hat toward Eiyu.

"Heh, will do captain. Alright, let's get going, Eiji!" he turned to face him. He didn't know the Raikage could summon animals, that seemed like a unique ability.* - Sun Nov 22 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 22 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: Then we'll get going. - Sun Nov 22 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: Takuma, let's go. - Sun Nov 22 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) eyes widened as they were about to get assaulted by two very bulky men, that seemingly were pretty skilled with blades, considering they each had some. "Shit." he jumped back, quickly, he formd several hand signs, molding Doton chakra within his body's very system. After he finished the hand signs, four large spikes, erupt out of the very soil.

Two spikes, strike the first male, one in the chest, the other on the man's thigh. The second male, two other spikes, would launch themselves, into the males chest, and the males arm that was holding the blade.* - Sun Nov 22 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) was not about to let the bandit flee. Utilizing his speed, he met with the bandit forming several hand signs. Upon completeing his hand signs, he opened his maw, a river of mud went ontop of the bandit trying to flee. And if it was successful, he would hope that it stopped the bandit from fleeing. Takuma took out a kunai. "Yo, what's going on, why the sudden urge to run from the battle?" he asked rather confused on the whole situation.* - Mon Nov 23 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) raised an eyebrow, he turned his heels and saw the door open. He looked over toward Eiji. "Hm. . .The door why would it open by itself. . ." he muttered to himself. This was strangely odd indeed. He sheathed the kunai back in his pocket. He reached for the door, slowly of course, he was a very cautious individual. He didn't want to risk getting fucked up.* - Mon Nov 23 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) was hesitant from the get go, he knew things were going to get fishy by the time he saw the bandit flee. However, upon noticing the metal prong extend outward, Takuma adjusted accrodingly toward this action. Quickly, he sped out of the metal prong's reach, in this case, he was trying to dodge it by utilizing his speed. * - Mon Nov 23 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) smirked.

"So you're the warlord eh?" the conversation, was cut short however. Takuma, once again sprinted out of the senbon's general range. He wasn't about to get bodied by a marksman of the sorts. He did a quick set of hand signs, molding doton chakra within his body once again. After finishing his hand signs, the molding of doton chakra ended. 

Out of the very soil, came out a dragon's head. The dragon head, opened it's mouth, a bright white orb, was in the middle of the dragon head's mouth. Then, came the mud balls that were fired from it's maw. Ten shots were fired in total toward the warlord.* - Mon Nov 23 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) squinted.

"Yo. . . That was a female. . " he muttered to himself, the dragon head, turned back into regular mud. However, Takuma's sight, wasn't all the best. So spotting the actual warlord was definately a hard task itself. If anything, Takuma was confused that they just attacked a small child. Was the warlord using childeren as decoys?

Takuma scratched his head. "This isn't making any sense. ."* - Mon Nov 23 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) looked over toward Eiji.

He noticed how he smashed the window with his foot. Quickly, Takuma was in close pursuit behind Eiji, trying to make his way toward the warlord himself. However, Takuma had to prepare, he once again, formed a quick set of hand signs. This time, it wasn't doton chakra, it was katon chakra. He was molding katon chakra in his body's system. After he finished the hand signs, the molding of Katon chakra finished.

He held the last hand sign, he was not going to release the jutsu just yet. He didn't want to catch Eiji in the cross fire, considering Eiji by this point, was in front of him.* - Mon Nov 23 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Was called a ginger.

Quits life.

Fuck this mission.

He left.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) opened his mouth, and out came four small fireballs straight toward the male's back. He did this, to subdue the enemy. Of course, he would probably have some severe burns from the small fire balls impact. If they were to reach the male in time, Takuma would've tooken out a kunai. He was still on alert, after what happened last time, this could also be a decoy.* - Mon Nov 23 02:37:26 2015

He was furious. He leaned against the mountain, crossing his arms. He saw Eiyu shed some tears, that was one weakness. A shinobi was to near show emotion. His gaze, shifted back at the ground's surface. Takuma was wondering what he should do now. Would he continue to carry out dangerous missions like the one Eiji and himself went through? Or would he just chill on the side line, and only get stronger for the village.

The choices, would vary.* - Mon Nov 23 03:29:29 2015
