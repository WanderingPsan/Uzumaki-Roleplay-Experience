<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) walked out of the Kumogakure square, with hands in his pockets. He needed to go somewhere isolated so he could practice his katon jutsu. Once he got toward an isolated area, he would begin his training. He formed several hand signs. Katon chakra molded within his bodies system for a short while, it was mixing with the oxygen in his body, combining the two elements. His chest then expanded slightly.

He opened his maw, and out came five small fireballs, they made their way toward the ground. Once the small fireballs made impact with the ground, nothing much happened to it. Takuma squinted. "How the fuck am I going to beat Eiji if I can't damage the ground. I want to create craters . ." he thought to himself. This was not good at all, he'd have to improve hell of a lot more.

Takuma sighed, this wasn't turning out so well. If Eiji saw what Takuma was doing right now, he'd probably insult him. The man had some good roasts, and ya boy didn't have good roasts back for him. He wondered something though, "His carrot techniques, are mad strong. I don't even know how this man got so strong. That shit just blows my mind man. . ." he thought to himself. But if that's what made Eiji strong, that's what makes him strong.

He formed several more hand signs, he started to mold katon chakra in his chakra system once again. However, he didn't have transionist, so he couldn't use the jutsu twice probably. So he stopped the molding of katon chakra. "I need to rest, before I can use the jutsu again. . ." he said to himself. He needed a lot of work to do.

And this was exactly what he was going to do, to get that sort of work done and over with. However, Sunagakure killed Edge. That was great news, but what if Edge had an ally? Or -did- he have an ally? There were many questions Takuma had, that held little answers. He could probably try asking Eiyu, but he probably wouldn't know. He stroked his chin, who would know?* - Fri Nov 27 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several hand signs, he was molding a -shit- ton of katon chakra within his body's system. After molding the required amount of katon chakra, he mixed it with the oxygen in his system aswell. Once he finished the hand signs for the required technique, his chest expanded once again. He opened his maw, and out came a dragon head-shaped fireball that was sent toward the sky.

Takuma got on one knee, sweat dripping from his face, and through-out his whole body. The technique was definately a strain, it would seem that his limit would be one use with the jutsu, before his chakra levels would hit an all time low. Takuma started to pant. "Holy. . . .Shit. . ." Takuma struggled back to his feet, wiping the sweat he had on his face away.

He smiled, he was improving greatly. He just needed to practice the technique a little longer, then he would be set. Once he has the techniques mastered, Takuma would probably go ask Eiyu for a promotion or something. Takuma would take whatever he could. He needed to get a rank up or something. He proved his elemental prowess infront of Eiyu. He even proved it when they went to the Grass Village.

That wasn't Takuma's greatest moment though, considering he killed an innocent little girl at that given moment. He sat on the ground. Looking up at the sky, as the skys began to darken where Takuma was standing. ". . . .Damn Eiyu. . .You're right. . . .The image will never leave me. . .Can't believe I killed a child." he said to himself.

Takuma got up, he bowed his head down. Clenching his fists. "I have to be more careful when I use my techniques. ." he unclenched his teeth, and brang his head up and stared at the skys once more. He smirked. "No point in thinking about the past, I got to think about the future. Afterall. . .Our will can bring forth miracles. . "* - Sat Nov 28 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) decided to move out of the area he was in. He felt as if someone was watching him, and didn't want people peeping at his techniques. He didn't want anyone knowing what he was capable of just yet, he liked keeping his abilities unknown. But while he was on the move, in case someone was to chase him, he formed several hand signs. 

He began to mold katon chakra within his bodies system, mixing it with the oxygen in his system aswell. After finishing the required hand signs for the technique, his chest expanded. Opening his maw, a dragon head-shaped fireball was sent straight toward the ground's surface, but when he performed this action, he also jumped back, to be sure he didn't get caught in the radius of his own attack. 

Once the jutsu impacted against the ground's surface, an explotion rang out. Debris was flung around the area, followed by large amounts of smoke, including left over fire being placed around the impacted zone. Takuma, continued to utilize his speed, he wanted to get the hell out of here. He didn't know if someone was here to spy or not, but you never know.* - Sat Nov 28 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
After he got a good distance away from whoever was spying, or so he might've thought. You never know nowadays, cause people just run straight by you and don't care what you're doing. So he would rather go somewhere isolated, where there was no one to peep on what he was doing. But, he decided this was a good enough area to train at.

Once again, Takuma formed several hand signs, he continued to mold katon chakra within his bodies system, again of course. He continued the same procedure, oxygen mixed with the katon chakra. After he finished the hand signs, his chest expanded slightly. Opening his maw, out came forth once again, a dragon head-shaped fireball, and was sent toward the sky. This caused for darkened clouds, to encircle his position.

"That's not a good sign." Takuma said to himself, the jutsu didn't drain Takuma -that- bad, but it was still a pretty bad drain. And he didn't to get this jutsu mastered. He stroked his chin. "I should try using the jutsu while on the move, instead of being stationary. . .That sound's like something I should do. . ." he nodded his head. That was definately something he was going to do.* - Sat Nov 28 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Takuma utilized his speed, his right foot dug into the dirt, he pushed off of his right foot, and sprinted straight forward, forming several hand signs, molding katon chakra once agian, in his bodies system. Which mixed with the oxygen in his body of course. Sweat was dripping from his body. After the molding of chakra was done, he finished his hand signs.

His chest again, expanded, out of his maw, came out a dragon head-shaped fireball. This time, it was sent toward the ground's surface. Once it impacted with the ground, a large explotion rang out. Debris being flung everywhere, followed by a large black smokescreen, and some fire being spread across the area it impacted. Takuma halted.

He placed his hands on his knees. He was panting pretty bad. "Fuck." was all he said. He was starting to feel the effects of the jutsu draining him already. He wiped off the sweat from his face. "I know this isn't my limit." he said to himself. He still had a good amount of chakra left over. He stood up straight, reaching into his back pouch and taking out a bottle of water.

He unscrewed the cap from the water bottle, drinking from it. Once he was done drinking out of the water bottle, he placed the cap back on it. Looking at the bottle of water, he could see that it was half empty. He placed the water bottle back in his back pouch. "Phew. . . . That was refreshing." Now, was the time to get serious.* - Sat Nov 28 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Once again Takuma was on the move, utilizing his speed, he manevoured around the area forming several hand signs once again. Molding katon chakra in his bodies system, mixing it with the oxygen in his system. He finished his hand signs, halting the molding of katon and oxygen. He opened his maw, and out came forth another dragon head-shaped fireball, that was once again shot at the ground's surface. 

Debris just continued to fly everywhere. The impact was great, an explotion rang out. Causing another smoke screen to take place around the area Takuma was in. There was also, flames surrounding the vast area. Takuma continued to pant, he got down on his hands and knees, and was puffing. "Damn. . . . I have enough chakra. . For one more. . . But this might be my limit." he said to himself.

He slowly got up, his left eye, squinted, while his right eye, looked completely fine. The reason his left eye squinted, was mainly because of how much of a drain the jutsu casted, and not to forget that debris was also flung up everywhere. So the damage he took was probably minor, considering he was smart about not being near the explotions when he sent out the jutsu.* - Sat Nov 28 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) sat down on the grounds surface. His left eye, wasn't squinting anymore. He decided to meditate for right now. He started to regain the chakra he lost earlier. Which was a lot of damn chakra. By while he was meditating, he was calming his mind. It was good to keep a positive vibe about things. Despite what was going on in the world around them.

After a long while of meditation, Takuma got up, and formed several hand signs, once again, he started to mold katon chakra within his bodies system, mixing it with the oxygen in his body. Once the two were done mixing with one another, the molding of chakra stopped. Takuma's hand signs, also stopped, as his chest expanded once again. 

Out of his mouth, came another dragon head-shaped fireball, that was aimed straight toward the ground's surface again. The impact, caused once again, an explosion rang out around the area Takuma was in. Having debris flung up around the area, followed by a smoke screen to be spread out. Takuma started to cough, mainly because the smoke screen got all in his face.

"Damn. . .I should be more careful. . ." Takuma decided to take a break for now. He placed his hands over his head, inhaling, then exhaling slowly. "I should probably take it easy on this jutsu, I don't want to cause the village to be on red alert, or something like that." he thought to himself. If anything, the explosions could probably be heard through-out Kumogakure no Sato.

Takuma scratched the top of his head. "I should get the hell out of this area." Using his speed, Takuma raced the hell out of the area he was just in. He didn't want to catch a case. While running, he wiped the sweat off of his face. He probably should change the cloths he has on, considering the smell of burnt things could be on his body.* - Sat Nov 28 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several hand signs, molding katon chakra in his body's system, mixing it with the oxygen in his system aswell. Once the molding of chakra was finished, he finished his hand signs. His chest, expanding slightly. Takuma opened his maw, and out came forth a dragon head-shaped fireball. 

He sent it straight toward the ground's surface, which caused it to explode upon impact. Causing an explosion to ring out in the general area Takuma was in. Debris of course, was once again flung into the air. A smoke screen, was also created. Takuma, literally had to continue to travel around Kumogakure no Sato. He didn't want to get caught with all these large ass explosions that he was creating. He would probably get in some serious ass trouble.

Once again, he utilized his speed, and got the hell out of the area. Occasionally, he turned around to see if anyone was on his tail, and when he saw that the ghost was clear, he continued to run to a different location. He just wanted to get better with his katon techniques, and he didn't want people questioning what the hell he was doing.* - Sat Nov 28 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Once he got to a safe area, Takuma started to form several hand signs, once again. Katon chakra molding in his body's system, which mixed with his oxygen that was in his system. After completeing his hand signs, his chest, once again, expanded. Opening his mouth, out came a dragon head-shaped fireball, that he sent toward the ground's surface. 

Once it impacted with the ground's surface, -another- explosion rang out across the vast area. Debris, again was flung everywhere. Followed by a smokescreen that took effect around Takuma. Causing there to also be flames around the vast area aswell. The place was looking like a battlefield by now, the worst part of it was, it was near the lower portion of Kumogakure that the explosions were rining out from.

Once again, Takuma had enough for one day, and decided to get the heck out of the area now. He's trained the jutsu enough, and decided he needed to take a long break. If he needed to train the jutsu again, he would do so when he wasn't as tired. He would do so, when he was more motivated or something like that. He turned on his heels, placed his hands in his pockets, and got out of the area.* - Sat Nov 28 01:15:56 2015

Takuma, formed several hand signs, molding katon chakra within his bodies system for a short while. Once the molding of chakra was complete, he finished the hand signs. Out of his mouth, came a stream of chakra infused gun-powder.

Takuma, bit down on the flint that was inbetween his teeth, causing a spark. This spark, ignited the ash cloud. Causing it to explode, this explosion was rather large, as it could've been heard around the general area Takuma was in. Once he was finished with the technique, he decided to meditate a little bit. Considering the technique, still drained him.

Sweat was dripping from his face, just from performing the technique. B rank jutsu, sure are tiresome.* - Sat Nov 28 17:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) quickly formed several hand signs, katon chakra was molding within his body's system for a short while, after the molding of chakra was finished. So was his hand signs. His chest expanded slightly, once he opened his maw, out came a dragon head-shaped fireball, headed straight toward Sogeki. Considering the arrows were in the way of the attack, they would also get consumed. 

Takuma, however didn't stay still, he wasn't a fool. He quickly moved out of the way, utilizing his speed in order to do so.* - Sun Nov 29 02:45:07 2015

The dragon head-shaped fireball did the trick, and got rid of the arrows. However, Sogeki was definately good at long range, considering he was able to draw arrows out rather quick. Takuma once again, formed several more hand signs. Katon chakra being molded in his system once again, after the molding of chakra was complete, so was his hand signs. His chest, expanded, opening his mouth, he sent a fireball toward the arrows that were shot.

He shifted his gaze and looked over toward Eiji, who in return saved the female from getting burned. Takuma, called out toward Sogeki. "Yo, let's call this off for  now." Takuma wasn't ment for spars, he was ment for serious combat it seemed.* - Sun Nov 29 02:59:37 2015
