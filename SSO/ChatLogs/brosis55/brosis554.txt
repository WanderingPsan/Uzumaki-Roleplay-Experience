The Fat Man started to run the other direction to learn the scroll that was given to him by Kilm, however it was a slow process, he was a fat man after all.* - Sun Oct 18 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) unraveled the scroll that was given to him by Kilm. He carefully read and examined the words on the scroll. He was happy that he was starting to make friends so easily now, however his only friends that he had now was probably Yan, and -maybe- Kilm. He was happy regardless though since he got himself another scroll to learn off of. Upon reading about the scroll, it seems as if you can create elemental clones. And this elemental clone, was a Doton Clone. Seemed useful.

Daiki continued to read the scroll, he was already getting excited about learning another technique that could prove useful for him one day. And man was he excited. After he was done learning this scroll, he would probably give himself a well deserved break. Considering he was a Fat Man after all, and fat men needed to have there breaks and food, and what not. He still wondered if there was anyone else around the world that had the same unique ability as he does, there probably was, but until he finds one. He's just going to assume that there isn't.* - Sun Oct 18 17:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) grabbed the scroll, he started to read from the scroll, carefully reading its contents, Daiki nodded his head while reading the scroll, it seemed like the technique could be useful for getaways. However, it seemed like you'd need to dig yourself a hole-- Daiki looked at himself, holy shit that hole is going to have to be big as fuck. But he shook his head, and continued to read the scroll's information.

It also seems like you'd need to break down the ground's surface through doton natured energy. Seemed hard to be honest, everything is easier said then done. But Daiki was a lazy fat person, he didn't like doing work, he was a very very lazy person. He took a break from reading the scroll, he placed it down, and took out a bag of chips. He opened the bag slowly, and started to shove his face with chips, and fam he ate these chips fast as hell boy. When he was done eating the chips. He got up and threw them away in the trash.

He picked back up the scroll to continue reading it's information* - Sun Oct 18 18:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Brosis55) continued to read the scrolls information, Hiding like a Mole. Daiki scratched his chin, the technique can also sense along the ground and uncover obstacles above the surface and underneath you. That seemed like a useful thing. The technique seemed cool, although it seemed like he'd need some good chakra to perform the technique, he hoped he had enough to perform it. After reading it, Daiki got up and rolled up the scroll, he walked up to Sanoke and handed him the scroll.

"Thank you sir, I appreciate it." he stated giving the man a smile shortly after, he was making progress, that was a fact.* - Sun Oct 18 18:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) started to walk around the village, trying to look for these damn thugs and possibly put a stop to them. Quickly, he got into a full on sprint, scanning the whole area around him, he needed to focus, and stay on task. No distractions. ". . . . . .Why do we need to hire thugs, or even try to change their minds. . .They're thugs for a reason yo. . ." he stated that to himself. Considering he was doing this missions alone.

Sighed, he continued to walk around the village, that was, until he finally saw a couple of thugs near a cliff area. Takuma saw this as a great opportunity to try and use his new jutsu, that he obviously learned after graduating the academy. Quickly, he started to form a set of quick hand signs, in hopes none of the thugs were a mysterious sensor. He started to mold doton chakra within his bodies system, holding it within his body for a short while.

Then, once he finished the hand signs, Takuma yelled toward them. "YO! Quit harming the citizens of Kumogakure. . .Or else. . ." he stated this, with a glare at one of the thugs eyes. To where, the thugs didn't heive his warnings, and instead, continued to beat up one of the civilians in Kumogakure. "I warned you, fools." he stated this, and slammed his palm against the cliff.

Suddenly, the cliff collapsed, sending a rock slide toward his opponets, however; Takuma had to be quick; quickly, he ran over to the beaten up civilian, considering the thugs were pre occupied on how to get rid of this rock slide at the moment, and grabbed the civilian, tossing them out of the rock slide's range. But, the Thugs weren't quick enough, and got hit by the attack. However, they would of course still be alive.

Takuma walked over toward them, and tossed fifty thousand ryo toward them. ". . . .If you want to become strong like me, and do what I just did, become a shinobi, and join the ranks of Kumogakure no Sato. You won't regret it, I promise you." he stated this, placing his hands in his pockets, and walking back toward the Kumogakure mansion, with a mission completion, he hoped his reward, was good.* - Tue Nov 17 21:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took a scroll out from within his pocket, he walked back toward the cliff's behind them, leaning against them. He unrolled the scroll, his eyes, now glued onto the paper, reading the contents that were within the scroll. Slowly nodded his head while he read the scroll, it seemed the technique he was about to learn, could definately be a devistating one-- That is, if he was to catch his opponet off gaurd. It would also seem, that he'd need to work on trying to do combination jutsu.

Considering, if he learned this, then dear god he would be set for life. Occasionally, he looked up at the two individual's that were infront of him, taking note of what they were wearing, all that good stuff. However, the Raikage called the male with the blonde hair, 'Haku'. "Hm. . ." he shifted his gaze, back at the scroll infront of him. Continuing to gather more, and more information on the scroll, in hopes that he would soon be done, reading the scroll. Cause god damn, this took a lot longer than expected.* - Tue Nov 17 22:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out a scroll from within his pockets, slowly, he opened the scroll. Reading it's contents slowly, making sure he could absorb all the information he could get from it. "Hm. . ." the technique seemed to require a rather, decent amount of chakra to perform, but in Takuma's case, he already had more than enough chakra, he was blessed with large amounts. Performing this jutsu, would probably be child's play.

However, he shouldn't underestimate the jutsu cost, of jutsu. Considering he won't really know if the chakra cost would be great, or less. He could only hope it was less. Cause if it was more, than jesus christ, he would be in some damn trouble. But, that didn't matter, as long as he learned the technique, that's all that mattered to him for now. Takuma yawned slowly. "Damn, just reading scrolls can get boring sometimes. . .Holy shit. . ." he said to himself.

Indeed he was very fucking bored, considering there was anyone in Kumogakure no Sato anymore, he blamed the lack of leadership for that, consideirng if they had better leadership, they'd probably be in better shape. But nowadays, anyone would probably run from trouble. But not Takuma, he would fight anyone who brang trouble, the village was in the midst of recovering. And he will defend the village, while it did so.* - Wed Nov 18 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) finally finished reading the scroll, he rolled up the scroll, and placed it into his pocket once more. Quickly, he went off and bought himself some blank scrolls, the reason for this? So he could set up traps, you never know, when an intruder would come by.* - Wed Nov 18 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out once again, another scroll, reading the scrolls contents once more. He didn't really like reading from scrolls, they took a rather long time, espeically if they were high in rank. Takuma sighed loudly. "Holy fucking jesus christ man. . ." he said to himself, as he read that this technique would definately, take a shit ton of chakra to muster up, and to even conjure it up. None the less, if he -learned- this technique, he'd definately be pretty set for life.

But then again, he said that same shit about the other scrolls he read, but this one for a fact, would definately be a good one to have in his arsenal. He shifted his gaze from the scroll, to the waters infront of him, he leaned against the cliff behind him, in case someone was to come by, he could probably use this as a rock slide to cover for his escape. The waves, however, continued to flow smoothly. Life sure does pass you like a wave, he would never foget that.

He shifted his gaze, back to the scroll, reading through the contents slowly, and carefully. He inhaled, and exhaled slowly, still rather bored out of his damn mind. Kumogakure no Sato was definately empty, but he couldn't blame the village, considering the attacks that took place in the village, it's no wonder it's so isolated. "So one male's name is Haku. . . But what's the Raikage's name. . . ." he thought deeply about this.

What was the Raikage's name? He shook his head, for right now, it didn't really matter, he'd just ask him when he got back from sleeping or something like that. If there was one thing that really got him interested, it was this scroll in his hands, he continued to read the scroll's contents. Carefully analyzing the technique, making sure when he -does- learn it from this scroll, that it will be atleast, kind of perfect.

But, with practice, it could definately perfect.* - Wed Nov 18 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) continued to read the scroll's contents, he sat down on the ground's surface. His eyes, still glued on the scrolls surface. " . . . . How much longer. . . Till this is done. . ." he said to himself, but the answer was literally right infront of him, it seemed he would need to read the scroll for a little while longer. "UGGGHH!" he shouted. This was definately being a pain in the ass, and he hated that sort of thing.

However, he was close to being done, he rolled up the scroll, and placed it within his pant's pocket. Slowly he stood up. "I'm going to go ahead and go to the village square, maybe theres people there by now." he said to himself, jesus man, he literally was talking to himself cause of the lack of people within the village. That was not a good sign, nor was that a sign for good health neither. He should go find some people, and make friends.* - Wed Nov 18 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several handsigns, molding doton chakra within his bodies system, and upon doing so, he held the last hand sign, as he continued to mold the doton chakra within his body, gathering up the required amount of chakra needed to perform the technique. Mainly because, this technique was a B rank technique, and he would -definately- need to continue to gain chakra, in order to perform the technique at hand.

However, the stone's, and very earth combined into one live being, a rather large stone dragon was formed, and it's primary target, was at the ground's surface infront of him. The dragon went head first, and collided with the ground, nearly destroying itself, leaving a rather large crater in the grounds surface, followed by a bunch of dust collected around the surrounding surface area. Takuma began to pant, and sat down on the ground.* - Wed Nov 18 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) unraveled several scrolls infont of him. Quickly he started to form several handsigns while he was performing the technique, gathering up chakra within hi bodies system. He was going to use the technique, Mud Wolves. However, after he finished the hand signs, and the doton chakra was done molding within his body's system. He placed his palm ontop of the scroll. Placing the jutsu, into the scrolls confinement.

Sweat was dripping down his face. ". . . One down. . . .Three more to go. . ." he stated to himself.* - Wed Nov 18 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) unraveled several scrolls infront of him, quickly, he formed several hand signs for the technique at hand. Molding Doton related chakra, within his body's system. And then, once he finished forming the hand signs, and molding the chakra. He slammed his palm against the scroll's surface, having the Mud Wolves jutsu, inside the scroll by this point.

Sweat was dripping down his face, he was starting to pant. ". . . One down. . . .Three more to go. . ." he stated to himself.* - Wed Nov 18 21:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) once again, started to form the -same- exact hand signs as last time, molding doton chakra within his body's system, and by the time he was finished forming the hand signs for the technique, he slammed his palm on the scroll's surface, the process continued to repeat itself. He was going to continue this process, until he finished up with the last two.* - Wed Nov 18 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
However, this was starting to become a strain, and so he once again, formed several more hand signs, at a rather fast pace, having Doton chakra, mold within his body's system. After he finished his hand signs, and of course, finished molding the chakra for the technique, he slammed his palm against the scroll's surface, once again. Sweat, was dripping down from his face, and landing on the ground's surface. 

"I need to rest. . ." the rolled up the three scroll's that had the jutsu's sealed inside of it, sitting on the ground's surface, starting to rest, and regain the chakra he wasted earlier.* - Wed Nov 18 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) slowly got up, after he regained what chakra he had left, he started to form the hand signs for the technique, one last time. < . . .This will be the finishing touch. . . .> He thought to himself, as Doton chakra, continued to mold within his body's system. And after he finished molding the chakra, and finished the hand signs for the jutsu, he slammed his palm against the scroll's surface, placing the Mud Wolves technique, within the scroll.

Just like what he did earlier to the other three scrolls. By now, he had four scrolls prepped and ready, in case if they -were- to be attacked by an unknown force, then he sure as hell, would be ready for them. He rolled up the last scroll, and placed it within his pockets. * - Wed Nov 18 21:23:24 2015

And after he finished forming the hand signs, molding the chakra would've been finished, as four large spikes came out of the ground around him. But, he didn't hold it in there all that long, it slowly seeped back into the ground. ". . . . .Niffty. . ." he said to himself.* - Thu Nov 19 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out a scroll from the confine's of his pockets, he unrolled it infront of him. His eyes, glued to the scroll, his attempt was to read this scroll, and have it done by the end of the day. It seems, that this technique requires more than average chakra to perform, if anything, he'd definately want to finish it sooner or later. But for now, it was going to take awhile to read the scroll itself.

He did ponder something, he wondered when would the former raikage, ever return to the village itself. Last he heard, the former ran with her tails between her legs. ". . .Fucking pussy. . " was all he said, anger and frustration started to seettle a little bit, but he shook his head, he needed to focus on reading this jutsu scroll, and being done with it.

However, he was -almost- done reading the scroll, he was near the end of the paragraph. It even read somewhere in there, that the technique, could be good for combination jutsu, if anything, Takuma would need this jutsu, for later jutsu combinations. He inhaled, and exhaled rather slowly. Reading scrolls was definately a pain in the ass, and he hated doing it, but it was what he had to do right now.

By now, he was finished reading the scroll, placing it within the confines of his pockets, and continued to lean against the cliff. His eyes, were aimed at the ground, just looking at the ground's surface. ". . . Kumogakure will be restored sooner, or later. . I can only hope it's soon."* - Thu Nov 19 01:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out a scroll from the confines of his jacket, slowly unrolled the scroll across the ground's surface. Takuma at the time, was sitting down while he did this action. His eyes, were glued onto the scroll's words. Slowly observing it, reading it throughly, and carefully. The technique, seems as if someone can conjure up, a river full of mud from the users mouth. Seemed legit enough for Takuma, although, he could only hope it didn't require much chakra.

He thought wrong, continueing to read the scroll, it seemed that the technique, indeed did require tons of chakra to muster up. Well, not really tons, but a decent amount of chakra. However; Takuma had monstorous chakra, he could probably complete this action, with enough practice of course, practice always makes perfect, no matter what anyone else says. Takuma sighed, ". . . I barely talked to anyone anymore. . .There's not really that many people in Kumogakure to begin with. . ." he said to himself.

It's true however, there really isn't that many individuals in Kumogakure no Sato. But, he didn't let that get all to his head. Carefully, he continued to read the scroll's contents, he was eager to finish the scroll, and finally learn the technique. But god damn, reading scrolls -did- take forever, he wondered where the kage was at, so he could get a few missions to complete. " . . Hnngg.. " was all he said.

However, he was pretty close to finishing, he rolled up the scroll, and placed it back within the confinements of his jacket. Slowly, he stood up, and leaned against the cliff. He was kind of tired, and kind of exhausted, mainly because all he's been doing his reading from scrolls to keep occupied. God damn, he wished he could've sparred someone, but he was afraid he'd kill someone in a spar. He shook his head, he'd have to place that thought to the side.* - Thu Nov 19 05:17:00 2015

Upon finishing his hand signs, and with the molding of chakra being done, a rather large earth, stone, dragon was formed with the earth's soil, and rock of course.

As the large dragon, zoomed past his comrades, and wrapped itself around Arihs' body. It did -not- squeeze, instead it stared deeply at the male. "Wear some damn cloths man, I'm tired of hearing this constant bickering." he stated, rather annoyed.* - Fri Nov 20 03:34:11 2015

He warned him man. He formed another quick set of hand signs, molding once again more doton chakra within his body's system. He made it over toward the moutain that they were near. And after completeing his hand signs, he hovered his hand over the moutain's surface. "Last chance man. . ." The Earth Dragon, was still in play, as it's body in fact, did surround Arihs entire body.

He started to meditate, calming himself, before he was to do any other harsh action against Arihs, who was a new comer in Kumogakure. A foreigner, in a land that was probably unknown to him. Atleast, to Takuma's knowledge, he hasn't really seen a male like him in Kumogakure before. 

However, he continued to clear his mind of any rage.* - Fri Nov 20 03:43:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) grabbed himself a shovel, sighed, he quickly started to dig a hole, he was working diligently. He wanted to get this easy part of the mission done and over with already. Mainly because this shit, would definately take a long ass time, if he was to put it to the side. And that was something he didn't really want to do at all. Sweat was starting to drip down his face. <. . .Why the hell do -I- have to dig these stupid ass fucking holes.>

Indeed, this was probably the only thing he hated most, that and probably reading jutsu scrolls. Since that shit, definately took a long ass time, and he hated that shit too the most. Occasionally, he looked around the area, to see if anyone was around. And it seemed like there wasn't, besides the Raikage, but he didn't pay much attention to him, since the real cause at hand, was to get this digging done.

After he dug the hole, he stuck the shovel into the dirt. He turned on his heels, and started to walk away from the site for now. <. . . Fuck that. . .FUCK. THAT.> he thought to himself. Shit was definately annoying to do. If Eiyu was to give him another mission like this, he would cut his wrists, shit was so god damn hard man. Took forever, it was time consuming.* - Fri Nov 20 05:03:47 2015
