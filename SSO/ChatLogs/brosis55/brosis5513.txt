<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) continued to read the scrolls contents. The ability to perform a proper Doton clone, seemed like a difficult task. The building up of chakra, seemed as if someone needed a good amount of chakra to perform the technique. Which in Takuma's case, he had more than enough. Atleast, he hoped he did. He diverted his gaze from the scroll, and looked around the given area they were in. 

It seemed Sunagakure no Sato, had a lot more villagers than Kumogakure. But truth be told, Kumogakure was still being restored after what Edge had done to it. Takuma stroked his chin, he wondered how the rebuilding was coming along anyway. He shook his head, he stared back at the scroll, reading it carefully. Making sure they when he -did- perform the technique, that he could perform it correctly.

By now however, Takuma was just about finished with reading the scroll, later on he'd probably have to try and perform the technique. He rolled up the scroll, and placed it in his robe pockets. He casually walked back toward the Kazekage, which he was probably at the Sunagakure Square. Takuma, was pretty much sight seeing by now, getting a good glimpse of the village.

Sunagakure, seemed like a nice place to be in, despite the very hot weather. He wondered how the hell people in Sunagakure could live in such, hot weather. Kumogakure was a little more cooler in temperature. It wasn't as hot as Sunagakure, that was for damn sure. * - Mon Dec  7 22:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) shifted his gaze at the red headed girl, who seemingly had dried tears. 

Seemed like Sunagakure had some women issues. Takuma turned to face Sanoke. "I appreciate it, that you allowed me to stay here for a short while Kazekage-san. I'll be sure to visit again." he waved good bye, as he waltzed out of the Sunagakure square. Hands in his robe pockets.* - Mon Dec  7 22:45:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) unraveled the scroll that was given to him by Eiyu. Upon opening the scrolls contents, he carefully read inside the scroll. Nodding his head as he read. The technique seemed to be katon based, which was seemingly Takuma's specialty. But, he prefered Doton over Katon. Mainly because doton seems to have more of the, powerful techniques than fire sometimes.

He pondered one thing, he wondered why that little girl named Izanami, wouldn't teach him any katon. The reason was probably because he kept calling her a little girl, and throwing a pebble at her head, for not paying attention to him. All well, he didn't a small little girl to teach him anything, he has all the techniques he needs, for right now anyway. Takuma shook his head, he was getting side tracked.

He set his gaze, back on the scroll, and continued to read it.* - Tue Dec  8 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out the first mission scroll, as he was walking out of the kage mansion. Upon opening it, it was revealed within the scroll, that he must clean up trash that's around the village. Takuma sighed, when he read the scrolls contents. If there was anything he hated more, it was missions man. He would rather be training jutsu right about now, or training his summoning jutsu. One of the two.

But a mission was a mission as he always said, and it'd help with Kumogakure's funds. And so, Takuma grabbed a trash bag, and dragged it out of the kage mansion, before he left of course. He grabbed one of those, trash pokey things, and poked every other trash can he saw, and threw it into the trash bag. Once he did that, he continued to walk around, surveying the area.

Once surveying the area was completed. Takuma, threw the trash bag on the ground, followed by the trash poking stick. Formulating the required hand signs, Takuma kneaded katon chakra in his body's system. Upon finishing the hand signs, he opened his maw and sent forth a breath of fire, that impacted against the trash bag, turning it into ashes shortly after. * - Tue Dec  8 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) opened the next scroll that was within the confinement of his robe. Upon opening the mission scroll, it was told within the contents, that he must go and pick up a letter for the Raikage. Another stupid side mission for him. "Ugh. . ." he uttered to himself. Why so many useless missions, he missed going on dangerous ones.

By now, it was just, weak missions. But he had to get it done and over with. Takuma made his way toward the post office, walking in, and going into the Raikage's mail box. He grabbed the letter, and left the store, making his way by now, toward the Raikage's desk. Placing the letter on his desk, for him to later read when he had the time of day too. Takuma, took out another mission scroll. "What's next. . ."* - Tue Dec  8 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) walked his ass toward the Kumogakure mansion steps, he searched for one of the brooms that might've been around the area. And once he found it, he quickly grabbed it, and started to sweep away at the steps. ". . .This is stupid. ." he uttered to himself. Why the hell does someone need to sweep up the kage mansion steps man, people are just going to step on it again.

Takuma sighed, he had to get this mission over with already. Shit was taking to long. He pondered something, he wondered what Eiji was doing all this time. He hasn't seen him in a long while. He's probably training his techniques, or traveling around the world. Something that Takuma would wish to do, but sadly couldn't for right now. 

He would be traveling, but Eiyu had to give him these damn missions to complete. By now, Takuma however, was done sweeping at the mansion steps. He threw the broom to the side, and walked away from the mansion. "Jesus Christ. . .What the fuck is next. . " he said to himself. He took out another mission scroll, that stated something about catching a cat.* - Tue Dec  8 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) quickly manevoured around the area, his eyes scanning the vast area carefully, in search for the missing cat. However, he halted in his steps, he could hear the loud speakers booming, it was Eiyu on the speakers. Takuma, listened to Eiyu's words carefully. And nodded his head in agreement to whatever he had to say. Takuma smirked. "It's about time, we got rid of these Suna chumps from our village!" he exclaimed.

But he shook his head, he still had a mission to complete, and get done. So he couldn't stall for much longer anyway. Quickly, he made his way into the forest, in search for this damn lost cat. He performed several hand signs, kneading chakra within his body's system for a short while. When he completed the hand signs, in a plume of smoke next to him, was an exact replica of himself, a shadow clone.

Takuma, pointed toward the east. "You search that way, I'll search this way." he stated. The shadow clone, nodded it's head, and went east, to where Takuma, went west. Yes, the mission did take longer than expected, but, sooner or later, the clone and takuma himself, met up.

"Did you find it?" he asked his clone, to where the clone only shook his head. "Fuck. . ." was all Takuma said, until, he saw a fat white fluffy cat, zoom past their faces. Takuma pointed and shouted "There! Let's go nimwit!" he pushed his clone to the side, to where while the clone was falling, grabbed hold of Takuma's hand and brung him down.

Takuma, wielded a single hand sign, and the clone disappeared in a plume of smoke. "Dick." was all he said. As he raced over to catch the cat. Once he caught the cat, he grabbed it, and raced back to the Kumogakure Mansion, placing the cat down at the square. "There. . .Done. . " he said to himself. Now, he only had one more mission let to do.* - Tue Dec  8 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Missions can wait. - Tue Dec  8 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) pulled up to the scene. 

Hands in his robe pockets, he looked out and saw everyone that was attending the ceremony. Takuma himself, heard the speech the Raikage gave, and only nodded his head at Sogeki's comment. "I agree. . " he stated.* - Tue Dec  8 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) stared at this man, he's seen him in Sunagakure before.

"I will show these men and women I am nothing like the Yondaime. You will not fight alone, I will join you, so too will our men. For we are brothers, and we lived together like brothers, we will survive as brothers or dies a brothers. From this day on we are bloodkin."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) hadn't realized that Sogeki was so physically strained.

Takuma chuckled. "You're right. . About time I catch a body." he stated. His arms were crossed, back against the mountain. His eyes were closed shut, his head, facing down. Takuma spoke once again, this time, his eyes slowly opening. "What ever happened to Akarui, Sogeki."* - Tue Dec  8 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) turned his head to face Sogeki.

"I see. . Shame. . Really is." he stated. He shook his head, he didn't think Akarui would've killed herself. But that's just life. He notied Eiyu coming by, and gave a nod of acknowledge ment toward him. "How are holding so far, Eiyu?" he asked curious.* - Tue Dec  8 20:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) walked out of the Kumogakure square. Hands in his robe pockets. He continued to make his way to the construction sight. Takuma sighed. "Time to build a house. . .Damn I hate building things. . Espeically for a mission. . " he stated to himself. By now, he got to the construction sight.  He waved at the construction workers.

"Alright, first things first. . .We get some beverages." he stated, as he ordered one of the construction workers to go buy them some beverages with Takuma's own cash. After a couple minutes, the worker came back and handed each of them some beverages. After they were done drinking the beverages. Takuma clapped his hands.

"Alright, let's get this shit started." Takuma quickly got to work, assisting the workers by grabbing wooden planks, and placing them down on the ground's surface, just like how the diagram showed. Takuma was started to break a sweat. He needed to work on his stamina, and strength that's for sure. Takuma got up, and walked toward one of the buildings, and leaned against it.

Takuma wasn't about to build a house, he was going to have the workers build it themselves. If anything, Takuma would just stand guard, and make sure no one was to come and attack them. Afterall, they were still at war, but it seemed like they were at a stale mate for now. Which was completely fine. If anything, Takuma and Sogeki could probably flank them.

But there was something to be taken into consideration, they definately had a lot of man power. And their shinobi, definitely were strong. He remembered some of the shinobi from there, since he was in Sunagakure a couple months ago. So he recognized Izanami, that was the first person he could recognize.

However, it was a good thing that Sogeki and Takuma didn't attack at the time. Cause if they did, who knows where they'd be at right about now. They'd probably have some injuries, Takuma had full confidence in his abilities, to be perfectly honest, if he was to just be at the front line, and have Sogeki as his back up support. Things would definately be in their favor.

Takuma sighed, he stopped leaning against the house, and saw that the construction workers finished making the house. Takuma nodded his head. "Nicely done boys, I'll be sure to tell the Raikage of your efforts. Thank you." he bowed respectfully toward the construction workers, and left the scene to go back toward the Kumogakure Square.* - Tue Dec  8 20:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out the scroll that was handed to him by Menma. He carefully read the scrolls contents. Noding his head as he read the scroll. It seems the technique allows the user to sink underground, it looks like it's just like Subterranean Voyage. Except it isn't an assault ninjutsu, it seems more like a scouting technique, to where you could probably sneak into enemy lines.

But Takuma already had something that allowed him to sneak. But this could prove useful. He was just about done reading the scroll, so he rolled it up, and placed it in his robe pockets. He scratched the top of his head. "Did you want your scroll back by chance?" he asked rather curious toward Menma, and if he didn't want it. That just ment more scrolls in his arsenal.* - Tue Dec  8 20:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several hand signs, kneading chakra in his body's system for a short while. Upon completeing his hand signs in a plume of smok, an exact replica of Takuma's self, was present beside him. He jumped back, yelling at the clone. "Sparring match, let's go." The clone however, raised an eyebrow at this, but accepted the challenge.

Considering it was just Takuma against his very own clone, things were going to be fairly easy. They both charged forth, Takuma sent a punch toward the clone, to where the clone, grabbed the hand-- Blocking it essentially. The clone, sent a knee toward Takuma's gut region, Takuma, brought his own knee up and countered. 

Fighting himself, seemed challenging enough. He jumped back, and performed several hand signs, his chest expanded, as he opened his maw and out came forth a large fireball heading straight for the clone. The clone however, performed the same technique, having the two techniques collide with one another, causing an explotion to occur. 

The clone however, was breaking a sweat, same with Takuma. He smirked, "Looks like fighting my self, can prove challenging." he stated. As he weilded a single hand signs, the clone disappeared in a plume of smoke. Takuma sat on the ground for a short while, regaining what chakra he had wasted just now. Sweat continuing to drip from his body.

Takuma slowly got up from the ground. And placed his hands in his robe pockets, walking back toward the Kumogakure square. He inhaled, and exhaled slowly. He was kind of exhausted, he wasn't about to fight himself again. Shit woud just end in a stalemate.* - Tue Dec  8 21:17:26 2015
