<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Welp, see ya guys later. - Fri Nov 27 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several hand signs, katon chakra was molding within his body's system for a short while, and after the molding of chakra was finished, his hand signs, were also finished. He opened his mouth, and out came forth four small fireballs. They impacted against the grounds surface. Takuma, looked at the impact it had on the ground, and it didn't seem to do that much damage. He frowned at this, and scratched the top of his head.

"What could I do to improve this. . .Maybe I should increase the power? No, that'd be way to difficult, even for someone of my rank. . Think. . " he said to himself. He didn't want to hurt his brain, trying to think of ways he'd increase it's power. But for now, he just wanted to get better with the katon element. And that was by training the jutsu constantly. Practice always makes perfect. That was definately for sure.

He wasn't tired, the jutsu itself didn't even drain him all that bad. The drain itself on the jutsu, wasn't enough to tire out Takuma. He was gifted with monsterous chakra. He was thankful for that, and his speed, was superb at best. He'd have to do something about increasing his speed later on. Considering Eiji, got hella of a lot better than Takuma all of a sudden.

He would use that as motivation. He couldn't let his rival get the best of him. "No. . I have to prove myself. ." he thought to himself. Eiji, was definately a great shinobi, heck, Takuma would hate to admit it, but Eiji was starting to get a lot better than him. To think, Takuma was the best elementalist they had in Kumogakure. For now atleast, the next generation will always surpass the previous one.

He should change his quote to that one, that seems pretty legit. Takuma sat on the ground's surface for a short while. "If we were to get attacked. . .What would I be able to do. . I need to advance my elemental prowess,  my doton abilites are excellent. .But I lack the strength in my katon elemental jutsu. . .I need to change that now. . ." he said to himself, Takuma stood up.* - Fri Nov 27 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) inhaled, then exhaled slowly. It was time to get serious. He formed seveal hand signs, katon chakra molding within his body's system, the katon chakra was mixing with the oxygen in his body's system. After he finished the hand signs, Takuma opened his mouth, and out came forth once again, four small fireballs. The fireballs impacted against the grounds surface, Takuma squinted his eyes.

He examined the impact closely. "Damn. . " he said to himself. It was still weak, it lacked the power to fully damage the ground's surface. He wanted to create a crater. He needed to improve his ninjutsu prowess, but not just that, his control needed to improve greatly. This had to be done sooner, or later. And it was going to be done sooner, rather than later. Takuma, sat down on the ground's surface. Sighing.

"If I want to get better, I'm going to need more motivation. I know I can surpass Eiji, but it would take a lot of time. . .But time is always limited. ." he said to himself. Takuma hoped he wouldn't go crazy from talking to himself. Cause god damn, that's what its sounding like right now. Takuma stroked his chin. "If I can get this jutsu down, I could probably teach Eiji, my more advanced jutsu." he stated to himself. There he goes talking to himself again, jeez, he needed to get himself in check.

"But, I need to master this summoning jutsu soon. . .It still drains me pretty bad. . . . .I need to talk to Gamatatsu, or Gamakichi. . .I wonder if they could teach me a thing or two, or a way of how I could become stronger. . Eiji is getting strong pretty god damn fast. ." he thought to himself. The fact that Eiji improved in less than a coupe days, really worried Takuma. How could his rival, just increase his speed, and power in that short of a time span?

Takuma, got up from sitting down once again. He rotated his neck, he set his gaze on the ground's surface. It seemed to not even have been pierced just yet. "Heh, this time, I'll atleast try to make a crater. . . Come. . ." he thought to himself. He was dead set on trying to make a crater, why? Because that would mean his fire jutsu was improving. And that's what he needed to do right now, it was to improve.* - Fri Nov 27 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several more hand signs. Katon chakra was molding within his bodys system once again. He was mixing it with the oxygen that was inside of his body, and once he was done molding his chakra. He finished the hand signs. His chest expanded slightly, as he opened his mouth and out came small fireballs. Their destination, was made toward the ground's surface. Like he mentioned last time, he wanted to make a crater.

And by the time the fireballs hit against the grounds surface, it formed a small crack. Takuma was panting by this point, "Almost. . .I almost had it. . " he said to himself. In reality, he wasn't as close as he thought he was to creating a crater. He needed more training with the katon element. "Damn it!" he said to himself. He fucking hated that he wasn't able to create a crater in this damn floor.

He sat down on the floors surface, once again. Pondering on what he could do with the jutsu's he had in his arsenal. He would need to think of a good plan. But what plan would that even be? Maybe he'd have to see if Eiji was down to perform combination jutsu. Takuma nodded his head at this idea. Eiji's carrot jutsu, woud definately come in handy.

But now was enough time of resting, he got up from sitting down on the ground's surface. He pondered another question that was bothering him. Why would Ichiro betray them? He wanted to become a Kumogakure shinobi, and yet, he wanted to just, betray them just like that. It angered Takuma. Eiyu was nice enough to even let the damn guy stay in the village. If anything, new laws would have to be established.

Takuma would probably have to establish it with the Raikage if anything. Considering at the moment, Takuma isn't the best right now. And he would need to rank up in the village, in order for people to even respect him. That would be priority number one. And once he ranks up, he could probably be allowed a lot more freedom then he has now. Yes, that's his next goal now, is to get passed chunin rank and go to jounin. This would probably take a lot of time.* - Fri Nov 27 21:32:22 2015
