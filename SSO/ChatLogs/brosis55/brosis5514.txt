Takuma slammed his palm against the grounds surface. A small dark green toad appeared. It opened it's maw, and sucked Takuma into it, but before he went inside the toad, he grabbed Sogeki's wrist, dragging him into the toad along with him. 

The small toad, hopped its way toward Eiyu, climbing its way onto the young male's shoulder. It croaked. Once the smoke subsided, it seemed as if Takuma and Sogeki magically vanished. * - Wed Dec  9 03:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) grabbed the box of condoms, and placed them back into his robe pockets.

"Alright, well you two have fun now." he stated.

He walked off into the distance, he needed to get some training done. There wasn't really much pervertedness going on, he didn't really know what Saika's problem was with a box of condoms. How was Ziare to know if she had an STD? However, Takuma continued to trail out of their view.* - Wed Dec  9 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Thirty minutes. - Sat Dec 12 13:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) left the scene.* - Sat Dec 12 13:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) Takuma performed several hand signs, kneading chakra into his body's system for a short while. After the molding of chakra was complete, Takuma brought his thumb near his mouth, and bit down on it. Drawing blood, the blood from his thumb, dripped onto the ground. Takuma, then slammed his palm on the ground.

In a plume of smoke, appeared an orange, and purple toad. ". . . . .What. ." Was all Takuma said, he face palmed. Out of all the summons he could summon, he summoned Gamakichi. This toad, was a humorous one, he liked to crack a lot of jokes from the looks of things. So it was only a matter of time, before Gamakichi was to crack a joke to Takuma.

Gamakichi, stared at Takuma. "Hey Ginger. What's up?" Takuma just stared at the toad. "Why are you always summoned!" Takuma wielded a single hand sign, and had Gamakichi unsummoned. Takuma sighed, he left the area and went into the forest. Maybe there he could find some animals he could interact with. It would be better than talking to his summons.

Takuma, quickly ran into the forest, examining the area he was in. "Wow. . " was all he uttered. He carefully converted chakra to the soles of his feet, and walked up one of the large trees that were in the area, examining the various animals in the area. Squinting his eyes, he saw a deer pass by him.

Takuma nodded his head. "The forest sure is beautiful." he said to himself. He jumped down, and carefully moved around the forest, seeing various butterfly's, and other insects. He looked up at the sky, and saw birds flying over head. ". . .That sure is a lot of birds." he thought to himself.* - Sat Dec 12 13:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) sighed very loudly. There wasn't really much he could do out in the forest, but see animals. He could summon Gamatatsu, or Gamakichi, and see if they'd want to play with these animals or something. It was the least Takuma could do atleast. But then again, Gamikichi likes to talk a lot, and tease people. So having him out wouldn't be much of a benefit.

And as for Gamatatsu, he'd just ask for food none stop. So that wouldn't really work out so well. Takuma scratched the top of his head. He had no idea what to do right now. And to think, he'd be spending a couple months in the forest, to analyze what animals do. Instead, Takuma decided not to summon the toads, but ran deeper into the forest, and found himself a raccoon. He was going to test himself.

Takuma took out of his back pouch a honeybun, which was still in the wrapper. Takuma slowly made his way toward the racoon, and took the honeybun out of the wrapper. Slowly, he hovered it infront of the racoon's face. " . . .Here. . ." he stated, in hopes the racoon would take it, but then again racoon's are vicious as fuck creatures. He'd have to be careful on how he does this.

The racoon slowly crept closer toward Takuma's hand, which held  the honeybun. The racoon sniffed the honeybun, and snatched it straight from his hand. Takuma exhaled slowly. He was holding his breathe that whole time, mainly because he didn't know if the racoon would attack him or not. Maybe he was just lucky by this point. He'd have to expand further. The next animal he'd have to test, would have to be a deer.

Takuma wiped his hands off with his shirt. Quickly now, he manevoured around the forest once again, in search for a deer. He halted his movement, and scanned the area in search for a deer. "Damn, nothing here." he once again manevoured around the area again, trying to find himself a deer.* - Sat Dec 12 13:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
The searching for a deer, was finally complete. Takuma finally found the deer. He approached it very carefully, and slowly. He took out some berries from his pocket, and hovered them infront of him. "I'm not here to scare you off. . .I'm only here to be friends with you. . " he stated to the deer. He wondered if animals could understand what he was saying, he could only assume they did know.

The deer, raised its head, staring directly at Takuma. It sniffed at his hand, which contained the berries. The deer looked back at Takuma. Takuma, stared back at the deer. "Eat. The. Berries." he thought to himself. The deer however, ate the beeries off of his hand. Takuma, slowly pet the deer. To where the deer turned around and left the scene.

Takuma, went to a nearby tree, and leaned against it. Hands in his robe pockets as he watched the deer run off. Takuma smiled. It seemed like he was getting better at interacting with wild animals. He could only hope, that once he gets his next summon, that it too would obey him. But then again, you never know now a days.

But then again, it was better safe than sorry. It seemed when Eiyu summoned his toad summon, that pink haired female was able distract him. Whatever Eiyu commanded, it seemed to not take orders. It just continued to stare at the female and not attack at all. It was rather odd none the less. But Takuma felt if he could get better with interacting with the wild animals, that he'd hope that wouldn't happen to him.

There was something that was bothering him though. How was that female able to heal his shoulder completely. What type of ninjutsu did she use? Or was it even ninjutsu at all? This was definately mysterious. He wanted to know more, but being close range with that dang female was suicide. Takuma, pushed off of the tree he was leaning on, his next target, was to try and see how he faired with a bear.* - Sat Dec 12 13:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Takuma stroked his chin. He wondered what bears liked most. Would it be sweet things? Like honey? Or would it want meat? He needed to think of something. He only had one honeybun left in his back pocket. Two bottles of water, one glass of milk that was in a glass bottle. And his last item concerning food, was a bag of chips.

He'd come to the conclusion of going to try and feed the bear, if he was to ever find one yet, his honey bun. It was the only logical thing he could do for now. Takuma sighed. "This is starting to get difficult. . I should send a shadow clone first to encounter the bear. And see what the bear does when I try to approached it. . ." he stated to himself. Takuma had to strategize before waltzing in on a bear after all.

Takuma, formed some hand signs, kneading chakra in his body's system for a short while. After completeing the hand signs, in a plume of smoke next to him, appeared an exact replica of himself. Takuma nodded his head at his clone, as they ran through the forest together. After awhile of searching, they finally found themselves a bear, which was chilling near a large waterfall.

Takuma tapped his clones shoulder. "Go in there." he said to his clone. The clone nodded its head, and ran in on the bear, taking out a honey bun. The clone spoke toward the bear "Here. . Take this." he unwrapped the honey bun. The bear slowly stood up, and when it stood up, it was about eight feet, and seven inches tall. The bear smacked the honey bun from the clones hand.

The clone, quickly had to jump back, bears were so hostile. The bear however, picked up its speed rather quickly, and sunk it's teeth into the clones stomach region, and literally moved its head from side to side, tossing the clone all about. The clone shortly after, disappeared in a plume of smoke. Leaving the real Takuma to deal with the bear infront of him.* - Sat Dec 12 14:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
The bear laid its eyes onto Takuma. Takuma got into a stance. "I guess I'll have to proof my dominance to you, beast." Takuma formed several hand signs once again, kneading chakra into his body's system for awhile. After completeing the hand signs, in a plume of smoke next to him appeared an exact replica of himself once again.

Takuma ordered his clone to go distract the bear. To where the clone nodded its head. The clone charged forth, literally running circles around the large bear, in hopes of distracting it completely. The bear of course, fell victim to the clones stupid antics, and those stupid antics were running in circles. The real Takuma however, saw this and face palmed. "Why..."* - Sat Dec 12 14:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
The real Takuma formed several hand signs, as wires came out of his sleeves and went straight toward the bear. However, it would be awhile before it reached the bear. The clone fell victim to one of the bears attacks, which was a slash with its claws at the clones face. This caused the clone to disappear in a plume of smoke.

The wires by now however, reached the bear and immobolized it. Takuma walked toward the bear very slowly. He pet the bears nostril. "Hey, hey. . .Be easy. . .I'm not here to hurt you. . " he took out from his back pocket, a honey bun, slowly unwrapped it. He placed it infront of the bears nose, to where it sniffed the unknown food. It licked it, and then ate the whole thing. Takuma nodded his head.

He released the wires that binded the bear. "There ya go. . .Sorry about that buddy. . ." he pet the top of the bears head. The bear finished the food, and looked at Takuma, before it turned around to leave. Takuma didn't know if he did a good job or not, but it seemed like the bear enjoyed the honey bun he gave the animal. That seemed like an accomplishment for him.

He ran back toward the village of Kumogakure, he finished doing what he had to do. He felt like he had a better understanding of animals by this point, and he could only hope, with the next summon he gets, that it too will obey him.* - Sat Dec 12 14:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out one of the mission scrolls that were in his robe pockets. Taking one of them out, he unraveled it, and read the contents that were inside. He nodded his head, he slowly rolled up the scroll again, and placed it back in his robe pockets. It was about time Eiyu increased the mission ranks Takuma got. He made his way toward the gates.

He made his way toward one of the shinobi, to where they saluted him. One of the shinobi commented. "Good evening, Takuma sir." Takuma placed a hand up infront of him, it was raised at about chest level. "Good evening solider. How are things coming along here?" he asked, the solider of course, commented by saying that there wasn't really much activity. They haven't gotten any new faces as of late.

Takuma nodded his head once again, and continued to patrol the gates. "Keep watching for anything suspicous. ." he stated, as he carefully looked out at the vass land Kumogakure had. Takuma was actually happy though, considering they won their freedom from Sunagakure no Sato. It was definately something different, and he enjoyed different.

Takuma made his way toward one of the sensory shinobi which were at the gate. "Pick anything up? Any rouges? Anything at all?" he asked rather curious to what the sensory shinobi would tell Takuma. The shinobi finally spoke up, his eyes were closed still, as he was still concentrating on sensing. "Nothing new Sir. Just a bunch of animals coming and going. . ." the shinobi stated toward Takuma.

Takuma smiled at the shinobi. "Perfect. Keep up the good work, I'll notify the Raikage that you lot are doing a great job in defending our gates." he said this, and continued to walk off. By now he was going to search the other side of Kumogakure, he was going to check and see if there were any problems on that side.* - Sat Dec 12 14:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) made his way toward the other side side of Kumogakure. He converted chakra to the soles of his feet, and climbed the gate, only to appear ontop of it now. Looking at the guards who were patroling the area. "How are things here solider?" he asked one of the shinobi, to where he turned around and replied to Takuma's question. "Everythings fine. . And quiet."

Takuma nodded his head, but soon raised an eyebrow. "Everythings quiet huh? . . .Increase the amount of sensory shinobi at the gate. . .I want nothing getting passed us. . .I want to make sure Kumogakure is safe and sound. . I want -nothing- getting passed us. . " Takuma stated this, and hopped down from the gate.

Landing on the ground's surface, small amounts of dust picked up around Takuma as he landed. He placed his hands in his robe pockets. He turned on his heels to examine the gate one last time before he was to leave the area. It seemed that he should probably let the Raikage know, that they should probably look into increasing the durability of the gates.

They seemed like they needed a lot more work to be done with them. But it all depends if the Raikage had any money left over, he could only hope Eiyu had enough money for such a task. But then again, he didn't want to sound needy, nor did he want to sound like he was trying to take charge or anything like that. Later on today however, he'd need to get Sogeki and go on a secret mission.

And that mission, was to go after the rouge Kirigakure placed a bounty on. Yes, that would definately be a good time. He could even create a new jutsu with Sogeki. Maybe have it called 'Takuma & Sogeki Ninja Art: Lazer Toad.'  and have it to where they both come out of his hiding in a toad technique, and have Sogeki sent out several arrows from the toads mouth as they come out of it.

That kind of sounds kick ass now. . .* - Sat Dec 12 14:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) opened up his next scroll, looking over the contents carefully. He sighed. He had to show a villager around the village. This seemed like this would be a pain in the ass. But a mission was a mission. Takuma placed the scroll back into his robe pockets. He made his way toward the Kumogakure square, but he halted in his tracks and looked at the arena that was just up north of his current position.

"Memories." he said to himself. As he continued his way toward the Kumogakure square. Upon arriving at his destination, he took out the scroll once more form his robe pockets, and looked over it again. He had to search for a village who was standing with a sign, who obviously wanted to be shown around. Takuma, rolled up the scroll and placed it in his robe pocket again. He squinted his eyes, and continued to scan the area.

By now, he finally found the village, Takuma waved. "Hello there. My names Takuma, I'm here to show you around." he stated with a smile. The villager bowed respectfully toward Takuma. To where he waved the Villager over. "Come, let's explore." as they headed their way out of the Kumogakure square. By now, they reached their first destination, and that was the ramen shop/tea shop.

Takuma pointed toward the shop. "This is the Ramen shop. It's a pretty good hang out. Their food is pretty amazing too." he stated this, and went inside the ramen shop. Waving at the Ramen chef. He turned his heels to look at the villager, to make sure he wasn't boring him. To his astonishment, he wasn't. The villager nodded his head as they entered the ramen shop.

Takuma smiled. "Glad you're enjoying yourself. Come, we have more places to go to." he stated this, and waved good bye at the ramen chef as they exited the shop. The villager pointed to one of the clothing shops within the village, to where Takuma nodded his head. They didn't go into the shop however. Takuma spoke "This of course is the clothing shop. A lot of nice things here."

He stated this, and kept moving. He was just about done with this tour. They stopped near one of the ninja academys in Kumogakure. "This is the Academy. This is where we train people to become shinobi, like me." he stated this, and pointed to himself before looking at the villager he was showing around at the time. "Do you have interest in becoming a shinobi?" 

The villager shook his head. Takuma frowned. "Shame. You look like you had talent." he stated this and patted the villagers back. "That's it for our tour. Catch ya later man." he ran out of the scene shortly after. The villager just stood there by now, just chillen near the ninja academy.

Takuma, finally made it back to the Kumogakure Square. Looking around the area for a short while. ". . . .There's no one here. . ." he stated to himself. He wondered where every one was at. They were probably all training, or doing something to improve themselves. Seemed like something Takuma needed to do. He needed to step up his game anyway.* - Sat Dec 12 20:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) closed his eyes, placing his hands in his robe pockets. Takuma took a deep breathe, holding the breath into his body's system for a short while, before slowly exhaling it. Takuma opened his eyes and looked directly at Sogeki. "I say. . . . . . Yay."* - Sun Dec 13 01:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several hand signs, kneading chakra in his bodies system for a while. Once performing the hand signs were complete, a plume of smoke appeared beside him, an exact replica of himself. Takuma didn't know if Eiji had suimen or not, so he only assumed he didn't. With himself and his shadow clones combined effort, they'd carry Eiji as they walked on the Konohagakure walls.

And once they made it over, he'd place Eiji on the ground, his shadow clone disappeared in a plume of smoke, Takuma looked over to see if Akito followed closely behind them.* - Sun Dec 13 16:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) formed several hand signs, he started to knead chakra in his bodys system. The chakra he was kneading, was definately massive. But once he completed the kneading of chakra, he completed the hand signs, bringing his thumb near his mouth, he'd bit down on it. Drawing blood from his thumb. 

"Summoning: Food Cart Destroyer." he whispered to himself.

He slammed his palm against the ground's surface. Above the Konohagakure Hospital, a large toad seemingly dropped from the sky, and landed directly ontop of the hosptial. Completely obliterating it. If there was anyone within the Hospital at that time, they were probably dead. But Takuma was no fool to stay there for a long time.

They would have to make their escape. "Let's get the fuck out of here, that wasted a lot of my chakra. And people will probably be on our ass. I only wanted to test the destructive force of the jutsu. And damn, that is destructive." he stated to the group of people, as they started to high tail it out of this general area.* - Sun Dec 13 16:26:24 2015

The Large Toad also disappeared in a plume of smoke.* - Sun Dec 13 16:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) traveled with Eiji out of the Konohagakure forest, it seemed that Eiji was probably in a daze or some sort of thing like that. So carrying Eiji was a hard thing to do. He stopped for a quick break, forming several hand signs once more, kneading chakra in his body's system for a short while. After completeing the hand signs, in a plume of smoke beside him, formed an exact replica of himself.

The replica and himself, carried Eiji together. Eiji was a very muscular individual, so his body mass in general was hard to carry. Occasionally, he looked behind him to see if they were being followed, and if they weren't being followed, he'd divert his gaze back infront of him. He had to ensure His own safety, aswell as Eiji's safety, since his life right now was in his hands.* - Sun Dec 13 16:34:04 2015
