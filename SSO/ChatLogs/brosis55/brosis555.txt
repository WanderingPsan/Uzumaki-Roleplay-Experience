<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) rotated his neck.

He stared at Eiyu, a smirk forming on his face. "More than ready." he was excited to finally get some action in.* - Sun Nov 22 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . - Sun Nov 22 00:27:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) jumped into the 'Pit'. When he landed, just a small amount of dust collected. Takuma rotated his neck, stretched his arms, and stretched his legs. He looked at the large Rhino. He utilized his speed, and ran around the Rhino. He formed a quick set of hand signs, doton chakra molding within his body's system for a short while. 

After he finished the hand signs, the doton chakra that was molding within his body's system was also finished. He opened his maw, and out came forth a river of mud, that was being sent directly toward the large Rhino. If this action was successful, he'd hope that while the Rhino was running, it would slid on the mud, and hopefully, it would fall. But, he didn't know for sure. This was just a guess afterall.

He shifted his gaze, from the Rhino, toward Menia, wondering why she would just -watch- with a can of spinach. His gaze, went back toward the Rhino. * - Sun Nov 22 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I wonder if I even need to join. - Sun Nov 22 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I'd probably beat it to fast. - Sun Nov 22 00:49:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Once again, Takuma utilized his speed, quickly, he ran away from the Rhino's general area. But considering there was also a smoke screen of sorts, he was slightly blinded. However, he did hear Eiji's voice, to which, he took into consideration.

He just hoped Eiji didn't get hit by the Rhino at all, but Takuma was also a cautious individual. He quickly did a set of hand signs, doton chakra molding itself in his body. After finishing the hand signs, the molding of doton chakra seized itself. Takuma, held the last hand sign, not yet releasing the jutsu, he was going to wait, and see the outcome.* - Sun Nov 22 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) ||
Out of the very soil, was formed a large Earth Dragon. <. . .This drains me quiet a bit, I'll see if this could give the Rhino the finishing blow.> The earth dragon, let out a mighty roar toward the creature. It then, raced straight toward the Rhino. Takuma, shifted his gaze toward Eiji, who rolled to the ground near him. He hoped, that his jutsu, could finish this Rhino, if not, then he'd have to think of another plan.* - Sun Nov 22 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: If I had to take a guess... I'd say Eiji is more analytical. He was aware getting too close to the animal would be something that would end badly. However, Takuma moved forward, not really caring. It forced for Eiji to compensate for his error while Menia is leaving them on their own. - Sun Nov 22 01:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) scratched the back of his head, he turned on his heels to look at the Raikage, who was sitting at the top of the rather big arena. "Yeah, I forgot about that. Sorry." that was all he could say right now. He looked over toward Eiji. <Eiji, seems to be a close range, and long range shinobi. That's interesting. His ability, is unique as well.> 

Takuma, looked back at Menia. She did absolutely nothing during this session. She seemed like one of those, easy targets. Those types of people that die young. Takuma, placed his hands in his pockets. He wondered, what they were to do next.* - Sun Nov 22 01:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) stood there, watching as the three of them went at it, Eiji seemed to utilize quick speed, but not just that his attack speed, was definately quick enough. However, he did take note, that when Menia ate the spinach, she got slower. Maybe it increased her body's mass? Takuma didn't know for sure. But, the fact of the matter was, Eiji was definately Leader worthy.

Considering he just made the Raikage's body gaurd just up and quit. It just goes to show, that she probably won't help at all during there mission against the renowned wardlord. Takuma still had yet to find out, what exactly Arihs was capable of doing. That was, until the male threw yet, another shuriken toward Menia's upper thigh region.

Takuma squinted at the shuriken as it was thrown. It was definately faster than your average shuriken. However, whenever someone wants to call off a spar, they usually want it called off. Quickly, Takuma formed a set of hand signs, doton chakra once again, molding in his body's system. After finishing his hand signs, the molding of doton chakra was finished.

Takuma, opened his maw, and sent forth a river of mud from his mouth, it was moreso like a projectile toward the shuriken that was thrown. It was to throw the shuriken off of it's primary target, which was the female.* - Sun Nov 22 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Sure, provided you are escorted. - Sun Nov 22 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) squeezed his way through the the exit.* - Sun Nov 22 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) took out a scroll, unraveling it on the ground's surface. He quickly, started to read the scrolls information on the technique named 'Earth Dragon Bomb'. The technique, sounded kick ass. But then again, just cause it's named like that, doesn't mean it would be a strong technique. It could be weak for all he knew. Only one way to find out.

Upon reading the scrolls information, it was said that one would need great chakra reserves, for a technique like this. It was also, B ranked. Takuma shrugged. That just ment more jutsu in his arsenal to use, and he would take that into consideration. The fact of the matter was, he was definately a power house. The amount of jutsu he has, and the amount of damage they could do. Was definately a scary one.

However, by now he was almost done learning the jutus scroll. He was near the end of his paragraph. Here and there, Takuma would sigh. He really did hate reading jutsu scrolls, only because they take forever to learn. And he didn't like it when things were time consuming, which reminded him, that he needed to finish his two remaining missions that he had in his back pouch.

After he finished reading the scroll, he placed it back in his back pouch. And took out the mission scroll's. He sighed, he started to walk back toward the Kumogakure square. The first mission on the list, was to deliver materials.* - Sun Nov 22 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) walked toward the Kumogakure square, he sighed here and there. "Ugh. . .Deliver materials first. . Or take an old lady shopping. . . .Decisions. . .Decisions. . .Fuck it, taking the old lady out shopping first, might as well. . ." he said to himself. Missions were probably the second most problematic thing in the world to do, well, in Takuma's case anyway.

After he walked toward the Kumogakure square, he searched for the elderly lady, his eyes squinting, trying his best to find the elderly lady that he had to take out shopping. Finally, he laid his eyes on the elderly lady, Takuma ran over toward her, waving his hand. "Oi! Over here, Miss!" he shouted, in hopes the old hag would hear.

To which, she turned around, and saw Takuma, a smile appeared on her face. Takuma stopped in his tracks. "Follow me miss, I'm here to take you out uh, shopping. I think." he said this, and gave a smile at the elderly woman. They finally, started to walk toward the first shop they saw, which was on the east side of Kumogakure no Sato.

When they walked in, Takuma gave the elderly woman his money. "Go ahead and uh, buy whatever you want I guess. I'll just uh, chill over here." he didn't see a point in this mission in all honesty. Taking an old lady out for shopping? Why was that even a mission. Takuma would never know, he just wanted to get this done and over with, and get back to training.

The old lady, was finally done shopping. Takuma, bowed to her and said "I hope you enjoyed your shopping. But I must go now. See ya!" he waved good bye, and started to walk back toward his usual training area. The old lady waved back, and said "Do you want your money back!" Takuma, ignored it, and continued to walk down south to train.

Money could easily be attained later.* - Sun Nov 22 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) face palmed. He forgot, he had one more mission to complete. He turned on his heels, and walked back toward the mansion. His hands were placed in his pockets. He mumbled to himself, <. . .These missions take way to long. . .> he said to himself. But, a mission was a mission. He -had- to complete this one atleast, it was his last one. By now, he probably reached the Kumogakure mansion.

To where, he saw the packages he had to take with him, and so he grabbed them, and made his way out of the mansion, to go complete the mission at hand. It was unknown where he had to take the packages, but he'd guess it was toward a shop of sorts. Well, he hoped it was toward this shop. If not, then they'd get something valuable possibly from this. Takuma didn't really know, but he could only guess what it could be.

After he arrived at the shop. He went through the doors, placed the package on the table, turned on his heels, and left the store once again. Not even uttering a word toward the shop keepers. He just wanted to get back to training in all honesty, and just delivering items, was a pain in the ass in itself. He liked doing things that involved some sort of action.

He hated boring things, and that was kind of a boring mission in all honesty. The elderly lady mission, was even a boring one. But the fact of the matter was, he was probably going to get paid for doing these missions. So missions were missions. No matter what they were. His hands, were once again placed in his pockets. He was walking back toward the Kumogakure mansion, to go report of a mission complete.

He just hoped the Raikage was still in. He hoped the Raikage didn't go to sleep or anything like that. <Man, I need to finish reading these scrolls.> he thought to himself. That was something else he had to do aswell, he had to finish reading majority of his scrolls.He probably had atleast, two more scrolls to read that were in his inventory.* - Sun Nov 22 03:46:08 2015
