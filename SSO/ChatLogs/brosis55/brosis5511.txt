<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) raised an eyebrow.

He wanted Takuma to climb up the mountain? That was rather odd. He didn't know what Akito ment by climbing the mountain, so he walked over toward the mountain. Carefully, he placed his hands on the rocky surface, he feet were positioned to where he wouldn't fall off while climbing, carefully, he slowly started to climb up the mountain, while looking back at Akito. "Like this?"* - Sun Nov 29 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: No.. - Sun Nov 29 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) jumped off of the mountain he was on, he wasn't that high up, so it wouldn't have hurt him all that much. Upon landing on the ground's surface, Takuma scratched the top of his head. But then, he nodded his head. "Heh, Alright, let's do this then!" He started to concentrate, closing his eyes. He converted chakra to the soles of his feet, he placed a single foot, onto the mountain's surface, chakra continued to pour into his feet.

The next foot, he placed on the mountain. At first, he stood there for a couple seconds, until, he poured to much chakra. It blasted him off of the mountain's surface. Takuma, literally had to do a back-flip in mid-air. Once he landed, he looked over toward Akito. "You said it was simple . . .This isn't simple at all. " Little did Takuma know, it was really simple, but he was just inexperienced.* - Sun Nov 29 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: .... - Sun Nov 29 18:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: ..Walk on water.. - Sun Nov 29 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 18:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) shook his head. To him, it really wasn't as simple as Akito said it was. However, Takuma wasn't much of a quitter. "Alright!" he shouted. Once again, he had to concentrate. He closed his eyes, he converted chakra to the soles of his feet once more, evenly distributing it. Once he evenly distributed the chakra, he opened his eyes. 

Takuma, slowly walked forward, placing a single foot on the waters surface, it seemed to work, for now. His other foot, got onto the water aswell, having both feet in it. "Hm. . ." he thought to himself. Suddenly, he sunk straight into the water, it seemed that Takuma didn't distribute the chakra evenly. Takuma, swam back to the surface, dragging him body out of the water. He was soaked.

Takuma looked at Akito, wondering how he did it so well.* - Sun Nov 29 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) thinks: Too loud.. - Sun Nov 29 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: ....Infuriating... - Sun Nov 29 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(Iron Zorro) says: It...is a simple..task.. - Sun Nov 29 18:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) tried performing the technique one last time, he closed his eyes, and started to concentrate once more. Having chakra flow toward the soles of his feet, evenly distributing the chakra. Once he finished doing so, he opened his eyes, and walked onto the water's surface. He stood there for a full minute, before he walked right off. Takuma smiled, "Look's like I got the hang of it now! Heh!" he stated, looking at Akito.

"Thanks Haku--- I mean, Akito."* - Sun Nov 29 18:46:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) brang his thumb toward his mouth. He bit down on it, as blood streaked down his thumb. Takuma, formed a quick set of hand signs. And once he completed the hand signs, he slammed his palm against the ground's surface. A large amount of smoke appeared around him, until, infront of them was a small orange/purple toad.

Takuma squinted his eyes. "Is that you, Gamakichi?" he asked curious to which toad he just summoned.

Gamakichi replied "Oh course it is, yo, pick me up." 

Takuma grumbled, he grabbed the small toad, and placed it ontop of his head. Takuma shifted his gaze from the toad back to Akarui. 

Gamakichi, muttered something to Takuma. "Hey kid, is that your girlfriend?"

Takuma, flicked Gamakichi's nose. "No, fool."* - Mon Nov 30 06:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) turned on his heels once more. He waved good bye to Akarui.

"See ya around, Akarui. Stay safe." he stated, hands back in his robe pockets as he began to walk down south. Takuma, inhaling then exhaling slowly. Thinking on what he could do now, considering there really wasn't much to do by this point, everyone in Kumogakure was probaby asleep, or busy doing other things.

Gamakichi, patted Takuma's hair. "Hey, hey, I thought that was your girlfriend, why did ya have to flick me?!"

Takuma shushed the toad. "Quiet, you make everything weird."* - Mon Nov 30 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) left the area, his view soon disappearing for Akarui.

Takuma, wielded a single hand sign, "I'll talk to you later, Gamakichi. Going to go see what the real problem is. . " he stated, as the toad disappeared in a plume of smoke. Takuma, moved around the large mountain, and converted chakra to the soles of his feet. He was utilizing his suimen ability.

<Pretty sure this is breaking an entering.> He thought to himself. He busted through the window, glass shattering against the ground's surface. To where Takuma was careful enough to be wearing double layers. He got up from rolling across the ground, wiping himself off. "Hey." he replied.* - Mon Nov 30 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) smiled at Akarui, it was a friendly smile of course.

"It's not nothing, I can tell Akarui. But, sometimes, it takes awhile to piece the pieces of a heart back together. With time, it can be healed Akarui. Just, don't do anything stupid. I'd hate to see one of my friends hurt themselves over one individual. I plan on teaching you a lot of things." His hands, remained in his robe pockets, he made his way toward the door.

Walking past Akarui, he halted. Turning his head to face her this time. "Stay safe." was all he said, before diverting his gaze away from Akarui, and walking out of the house. Yes, that dramatic enterance he made, was all for nothing. * - Mon Nov 30 06:44:28 2015

Fuck this nigga Eiyu, he a baby dick ass nigga.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) walked around the village of Kumogakure, taking out one of the mission scrolls he had in his robe pockets, he'd take it out, and analyze it carefully. "Picking up trash, what a waste." he said to himself. Grabbed the trash bag, he dragged it across the ground's surface, searching carefully with his eyes, trying to find any trash in the nearby area.

And then, he found himself some trash. Grabbing the trash stick he had on his back, he'd stab the trash, and place it within the trash bag. "Boring. . " he uttered to himself. He looked around the area, Kumogakure seemed quiet as ever, and with the major threat gone--- Which was Edge. The place seemed a lot more quieter. 

However; by now Takuma cleaned up majority of the trash that was around the natural area, and so he walked over toward the usually trash pileing place, and threw the trash in there. To which, he formed several hand signs, kneading katon chakra in his bodies system for a short while. And then, his chest expanded, once he finished the hand signs, opening his maw, out came a large fireball to turn the trash into ash.* - Thu Dec  3 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Brosis55) grabbed one of the brooms that was near kage mansion doors, he grabbed the handle of the broom, and started to sweep the steps. Takuma murmured to himself. "This task is bull shit. . . Why can't we get C rank missions anymore, I liked the mission that allowed us to go to the Grass Village." he said to himself, it was a pretty fun mission.

However; the mission he was doing now, was not fun at all. Sweeping the steps to the mansion? Are you serious? Kind of crap is this man. Takuma shook his head. "I could use my shadow clone to do majority of the work for me. . " he thought to himself. But if he was to do that, that would only drain his stamina by a shit ton, and he didn't want that.

Takuma, looked at the steps, he nodded his head. It seemed he did a good job on sweeping the steps. So he placed the broom back against the mansion doors, placed his hands in his robe pockets, and left the area he was in. He was done with sweeping, and he liked to keep it that way now. He just wished Eiyu would give them a bit more of a difficult mission.* - Thu Dec  3 05:28:06 2015
