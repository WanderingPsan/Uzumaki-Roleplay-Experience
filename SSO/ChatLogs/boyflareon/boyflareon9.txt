Mariana smirked while Hideki made his way towards her. <Does he not know that I am better at close range...?> she thought, looking at his hands doing a few handseals, lightning flickering between his finger tips.. him attempting to slam his palms on the ground as a trail of lightning rushed forward towards Mariana.

<Nope...>

Mariana wasn't going to let him win this quick, she quickly raised her arm on the air before punching the ground as the ground beneath them started to crack slightly. The ground slowly raising into the air because of her immensive strength, as she ran towards Hideki jumping over rocks and attempting to dodge the lightning strike. Mariana quickly grabbed her spear, flipping over a rock before appearing behind Hideki. "Too slow, buddy."

She quickly turned around, attempting to place the spear-- the pointy part of her spear on the side of Hideki's neck. As if telling him if he moves, his neck would be cut off. But Mariana wasn't really going to do that. Hideki was her friend after all.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) totally tasted the Jade-Tea that he recently consumed, as her fingers went up and down his back... going all the way down to his butt, giving it a pinch. Before tilting her head to the side for the kiss to be longer, wetter and very passionate. She didn't care that they were in public or anything. Feeling his tongue going to her neck, made her moan quiet a bit but. lowly for him to hear only. Mariana loves when he did that.

She reached for his own neck with her mouth, licking it before biting it softly while sucking on it to give him a hickey for those bitches that think they can have my man, when they can't. * - Fri Sep 25 20:18:33 2015
