"Mmm? Yeah, we should. I wouldn't mind, haha." 

She poked Shinjin's nose while softly stroking his cheek with her left thumb. "You know... you may be a very strong manly man. But I love this side about you, hehe. I promise, we will get you what you need. The house, the wife and the money. And also.... I don't know but... I like you."

You know.. as in, do missions, come back.. do it, and so on." she asked raising an eyebrow before turning around to look at the hamburgers, beginning to cook it now.

As doing so, Hana took off her jacket, revealing just her battle bra, tying her hair up into a bun "Mmmm."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure. - Sat Oct 10 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) stood up, staring at Shinjin as he took off his upper clothings on. Revealing his muscular chest. <Woah..> 
She thought to herself before walking behind Shinjin to the bathroom. * - Sat Oct 10 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) blushed slightly, biting her bottom lips while staring at Shinjin with a smile. "Mmmmm. Why don't you help the Queen out? Mmm?"* - Sat Oct 10 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Heh..."

Looked down at her bra as it was removed, her breasts exposing themselves with both of them bouncing as soon as he took off her bra. Her pink nipples now pressed against his chest, her arms wrapped around his neck, leaning forward to give him a kiss on the lips. "Mmmm. Heh...I'm kind of embarrased. Never showed someone my twins, before."* - Sat Oct 10 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Your twins? You have twins too?"

Hana asked raising an eyebrow not knowing what he was talking about, especially when the girl was pretty new at this. Her eyes trailed down to see him removing his pants, pulling them down to see the revealed member, it was pretty huge... and it was hard as a rock. "W---Wo---" there were no words for her to say, her mouth just dropped to hell and back. Now, snapping back to reality Hana took off her own pants, revealing her privates as well. And yes, she was all smooth and shaved, not an inch of hair in her vagina. Mhm. 

As the two went into the shower, getting pulled into the shower, turning on the water. Hana quickly wrapped her arms around his neck to pull him closer into a kiss on the lips, feeling his member pressin against her vagina. * - Sat Oct 10 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) pressing her lips, deeper into Shinjin she slowly pulled away to look down at his member squeezing its way between her thighs. It felt warm and really hard-- also huge. It felt.. amazing, something that she has never felt before, and was actually enjoying it. Her eyes going back to Shinjin's she blushed slightly, nodding her head. "Yes.... I do.. and why not loose it to the love of my life, mmm?"

Feeling his hands going to her asscheeks, biting her bottom lips a little bit since it actually felt good when he squeezed them. And her ass was pretty fat for him to grab too, her hands ran up and down his back slowly before leaning forward to give him a kiss on the neck. 

Slowly moving her hips, as it rubbed his member with her thigh...her vagina getting wet by the second. And she couldn't take it anymore. "C-Can we do it?"* - Sat Oct 10 20:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) felt his hands on her ass, blushing slightly by the many slaps that he gave her. "Well damn, someone sure likes my ass..." she bit her bottom lips softly, feeling his cock pressing against her but not in her.. not just yet. Hana slowly inhaled, tryin to catch her breath as his massive cock went slowly in her, feeling the soft head entering her wet cunt slowly. It was a bit painful but she didn't want him to stop, wrapping her arms around his neck, as her teeth went for his neck biting him as he slowly entered her. 

She felt a full and tight sensation, relaxing her legs a little so he could go deeper into her. Though, all the sensation was tight at the entrance of her pussy. Hana loved the feel of her breasts as they rested on his chest, she loved feeling his skin.. but his cock inside her was something else. It wasn't a small cock after-all.. it did actually cause her a bit of pain. Her legs felt like it was wobbling. 

"Hrn...I-I'm fine... but go slowly.. please..."  Hana moaned lowly as her face burried into his shoulder, biting it hard as he entered her. It was painful! * - Sat Oct 10 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) blushes intensely, her fingers digs into his back but not enough to cut him while her head buries into his neck to hide her embarrassment. Her own desires were also out of control, she barely even had control over her own body; just by her soft cute groans, it was clear that was she ready for his long member. The moment he places it and prepares to enter, her hips slides down a little more as if she trying to assist him with the penetration.

Now that he was inside, all of it a bit of blood started to form around their skin, a sign of her virginity being lost, her vagina clamps down on him like it was resisting him yet playing with him whereas her breathing rate increasing significantly. She lifts her head up with a lustful smile and whispers, "I-It feels good... hnnn...." Hana moaned, feeling his cock slowly expanding inside of her.* - Sat Oct 10 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) blushed slightly, as she moved her hips to help him out with their bodies now being connected into one. Her legs would wrap around him, breathing heavier now, grinding on him slowly. Her whimpering moans, twitches and fingers toughly brushing through his hair. Hana's breath was ragged, but she kept urging him on, her hands slid down his body and clutched desperately at his hips. "Oh, fuck me harder, Shinjin.." she breathed.

Her face was flushed and tensed in tight concentration as they both made love. "I-I love you too, Shinjin..." feeling his finger going up to her ass, made the girl arch her back slightly, biting her bottom lips. Never as she felt someting going up that hole. Hana moaned in pure ecstasy, breathing in deeply. She clenched him tightly, locking her arms and legs around him, then in an instant, she arched her back, thrusting her body into his own. "Oh, Shinjin." she moaned when her spasm subsided. "M-Make love to me, I want you so bad."* - Sat Oct 10 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Scratches his back the deeper he went into her. With each thrust, her moans escalate till her head tilts back from pure pleasure. Struggling to catch her own breath, her toes curves the second all of him was inside of her causing her to pee herself, hell, even causing her vagina to twitch uncontrollable. She was now under his control, her couldn’t was too relaxed or you can say filled with lust to the point she gave into him willingly.

Suddenly, right as he pierces her anus, her eyes popped open. She didn’t know if she could have handle such as yet but because she loved him enough, she wanted him to be the first and only person to do this do her, "M-more, I’m horny, make me cum, I want to scream your name!~" she yells at him. Moving her body closest to him, now being pushed against the shower wall, the water raining down to both of their skins as they made love.

Felt the electricity surging through her nipple, her eyes widened as her wish to scream his name has finally come true. "Oh my god, S-Shinjin!" she yelled, biting into his shoulder before speakin once again. "I-I'm going to come...!" she moaned loudly, rolling her eplvis in time to meet every thrust. It felt like she was in heaven, feeling the electricity surging through her body, her climax. * - Sat Oct 10 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "I love you so much, Shinjin..!" 

Hana threw her head back and wailed as she started to cum all over his massive cock, her lithe body clenched uncontrollably against his own, her orgasm rocked her. The feeling of her sopping pussy clamped around his massive cock, she bucked her hips up at him so he would increase his tempo while moaning rather loudly. "S-Shinjin! Ahh!" she continued to moan before feeling his cock being yanked out of her.

His white ropes of semen shooting like bullets all over her stomach and breasts, she slowly cleaned the semen with her fingers, grabbing it all and then licking her fingers that had the semen on it. Hana stood up straight, staring at Shinjin. "That... was so good.. oh and your sperm tastes really sweet too." she giggled slightly, getting the semen from her stomach and breasts and licking her fingers once again. 

* - Sat Oct 10 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) smiled at Shinjin, as she got closer to him resting her head on his muscular chest before wrapping her arms around his waist to pull him closer. "Mmm. So, what do you want to do now? Go train, I am guessing?"* - Sat Oct 10 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright! - Sat Oct 10 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded, turning around to get off the shower her body being all soaking wet and sparkling because of how smooth her skin was. Also, she was teasing Shinjin by exposing her ass to him. Now, entering the room Hana looked for her clothes for today. "So, are you going to train me first or the others?"* - Sat Oct 10 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded putting on some clothes that didn't reveal nothing of her body, she tied her hair up into a ponytail before turning around to look at Shinjin. "You know, next time..... we have sex again... Why not try the other way?" rose an eyebrow, giving him the 'hint'. Hana giggled softly waiting for her lover to lead her to the training area. "Or are we doing training, here?"* - Sat Oct 10 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah, you know.. as in.. the other.. umm.. heh. And uhh! Yeah! Sure, we can. - Sat Oct 10 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: What little trick do you have? - Sat Oct 10 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's called a rabbit punch. - Sat Oct 10 21:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: What? - Sat Oct 10 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Haha, that sounds a bit funny but sure. - Sat Oct 10 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: How does it work, honey? - Sat Oct 10 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Like this. - Sat Oct 10 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) raises an eyebrow, looking at his arm extending-- it missed it was by the side of her. Wondering why his punch missed. "What is this tech--"

Feeling his arm, tapping her behind the head, she quickly nodded her head before it was time to perform this technique herself.  "So, all I do.... is pretend that I am going to hit them, and if they miss I just yank my fist back to hit their head? HAHA! That sounds so cool!" Hana giggled to herself before taking a few steps closer to her lover.

Then suddenly, she sent her arm towards Shinjin attempting to do what he did but instead, her fist collided with his shoulder. "OOPS! Sorry.."* - Sat Oct 10 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah, that's all you do. - Sat Oct 10 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | That body of his wasn't a weak game, it was a strong one. Damn.

"Alright..!"

Nodded her head once again before sending a straight punch towards Shinjin, it was in the right direction but her bracelet got tangled with his shirt. "---!!" Hana quickly removed her bracelet from her hand before trying once again. She was an indeed quick learner after all, right? Yeah! She was a prodigy after all.

* - Sat Oct 10 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) smiled at Shinjin as he smirked, leaning her finger forward to poke his nose. "Alright alright, over powered King." that was their cute nicknames for each other. Hana giggled to herself, rolling her eyes as he made a joke about her bracelet. Stupid bracelet!! "Alright, I got this." Hana nodded before throwing her fist towards Shinjin, sucessfully though, then suddenly! 

TAP

Then she tapped him on the back, nothing big. * - Sat Oct 10 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe, yessir!  What's the next lesson, boss? - Sat Oct 10 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's called Sekken. - Sat Oct 10 22:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Try it. - Sat Oct 10 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright! Hehe. - Sat Oct 10 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Try it. - Sat Oct 10 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You have to move your waist perfectly. - Sat Oct 10 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Use your hips like you used them with me. - Sat Oct 10 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Oooh? - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hehe. - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Kay! - Sat Oct 10 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded at her lover as she walked besides him, looking at his body being straigh up as he instructed her. "Alright... that seems like a good skill, yeah." Hana bit her bottom lips, staring into his body.. god-damn it he looked so good! But she snapped back to reality, focusing on her training. Later on.. that guy was going to be having the best time of his life, when she gets done with him. 
Blushing slightly thinking about a few dirty things, she placed her hand on her hips staring at Shinjin doing the punch. "Mmmhmm....hah. That seems like a very easy technique to do, pft."

Quickly she began to walk by his side, standing in the same position as she was. Her body was straight like a ruler,  but because of her womanly figures it looked like a very curvy womanly body by her sides.
--- [1st RP]

Now, concentrating on her punches, first this was her training, her own training. Hana started to punch the air in-front of her a few times, just getting herself warmed up and all. Her legs spreaded out slowly, while punching the air to get a few hits. If she wanted to do this type of technique it will have to make her hyped up. what better way to get hyped up for a Taijutsu Technique by punching the air several times? Hana wasn't really a Taijutsu specialist herself, but she couldn't really rely on her weapons always right? 
"Hrm..."

--- [2nd RP]

Finally, her legs spreaded into the way that she was suppose to be. Hana looked at her lover's waist, moving in a way that she did earlier on.. when the  two were 'relaxing'. Her shoulders-width apart, closing her eyes to concentrate on the technique that her lover was showing her. It wasn't going to be an easy one but if it was to help her get stronger-- and to actually protect herself with now the village having a new Hokage-- meaning that they would be a main target. She had to learn these techniques before anything.  And with her prodigal skills, the 'Queen' was very fast at learning these type of techniques, even if it takes long.

It was time to finally do the technique on her own, her lover has instructed her what to do already.. now it was on her own to finally practice it. In time, she would be able to master it herself!
--[3rd RP]

Hana quickly steps forward with her right arm, twisting her entire body towards her fist, just how her lover was instructing her to do. "Mmmmmm...." closing her eyes, she quickly sent that fist into the air but forgot to say the word 'Sekken' did she had to say it? That was something that she didn't know what to do. But oh well, there was somethin else inthis technique for herself to do... but what? It wasn't a special punch.. it was the -perfect- punch..! All she had to was try to figure out a way for her punch to be that perfect...!

--[4th RP]

"This can be easy, I promise. All I have to do is just keep focusing on the technique, right? It's not that hard.. it can't be. No! It's just a punch!!"

Hana rolled her shoulders in a circular motion before quickly sending a few more punches towards the air, getting herself hyped up-- yet once again. This was the only way for her to finally do the technique that her lover was trying to teach to her. And Hana didn't really want to let him down...! Besides, they were a couple.. so they needed to be stronger together!

--[5th RP]

Hana cracked her knuckles, spreading her legs-- her shoulders-with apart before once again doing the same thing as her lover was doing. This time, she moved her waist, the same way as he did. She steps forward with her right arm and twisting her entire body towards that fist before quickly sending the punch into the air!

"Sekken!"

But nothing, sadly....

--[6th RP]

"Oh, come on! Why is this happenin to me right now... sheesh. All I want is to do this technique, so I can make you proud of me, baby."

She pouted to herself with a frown as she quickly got back to her position. Thus, staring at the kitchen that was before her, quickly sending a punch into the air. Followed by another one.. and then followed by one more. "Hrnnn..." closing her eyes, she spread her leg apart once again, shoulder-width apart-- same way as Shinjin was doing before sending a straight upper-cut into the air.

"Sekken!"

But it failed, once again.

--[7th RP]

8th time  is a charm right? Hopefully.. Hana wanted to get this technique done now, so she'll be able to train it more into the future.

"Alright...."

Closing her eyes, she focused on everything... her stamina. But mainly her thoughts went into herself and her lover.... all she wanted to do was to protect Shinjin from getting hurt, yeah he was the man but just because she was a girl that didn't mean anything. He was the new reason for why Hana wanted to become a strong shinobi.. and seeing as how he was the strongest in the village.. letting him down was something that she didn't want to do.

--[8th RP]

Hana quickly took a few deep breaths, her legs were spread out, shoulder-width apart. Her right arm is cocked backwards to a perfect ninety-degree angle, she stressed the muscles in her arm and the ones in her legs. Taking a step forward with her right arm, twisting her body towards that said fist, while her eyes were closed.

"Sekken....." She punched the air, as a rough sound could be heard outwards.

Now, reopening her eyes, she looked at her fist.. her eyes widened before jumping up and down while clapping her hands. Turning around, Hana would jump on her lover's body, wrapping her arms around his neck and legs around his waist pulling him tightly into a hug and a very passionate and deep kiss on the lips.

"Told you I could do it."

I don't want to keep you from training em. Besides, I would like for my lover, to have some friends you know? Hehe."

There, usually is the spot where people go to often train their techniques and what not. "Mmmm." if she wanted to train her techniques, it would have to be something that Shinjin has taught her.. so the katana training would have to wait for a while.

Now, clasping her hands, she slowly seperated them from each-other, noticing the sparks between her fingers and then suddenly at the tip of her fingers. Her eyes widened noticing the technique that she just did, too bad Shinjin wasn't here to see her doing it. 

But the sparks quickly disappeared. "Hmph." now, turning around to look at a training dummy.. that was around the area. She threw a straight punch towards it, the punch was meant to be missed, that was when her fist rocket back into the training dummy, taking off its head. "OOP." * - Sun Oct 11 01:55:12 2015
