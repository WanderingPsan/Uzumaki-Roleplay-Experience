<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I guess. - Sat Oct 17 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) sighed, grabbing her scrungy to tie her hair up into a ponytai l just so it won't be on the way while she has this training with Shinjin and the Raikage. It was a bit awkward for her though, but didn't really say anything. Hana wanted to talk to the Hokage but he always seemed to be busy with everything, so she just tends to back off for now. And she couldn't stop thinking about what he did back then with her and Retsuki, so that just made her think of a few things but now it was the time to train up.

First, exercising her lightning, clasping her hand together she slowly started to pull her hands apart from one another.. thus making sparks flow in-between her fingers. 

[1st]

<Alright, that jutsu doesn't look so bad to do...> 

 It was quiet easy, well it did look like it was going to be a piece of cake to bake but that was easier said than done. "Ugh...." closing her eyes, the redhead started to concentrate on her element, lightining. Thus a slow spark started to form in her hands but quickly disappearing from it. "Damn it...." she shook her head, biting her bottom lips softly before tryin it again. Just how the Hokage was doing. 

[2nd]

A few thoughts running through her head about her life, just how she was going to go strong as a shinobi to protect her loved ones and herself. It was a difficult thing to do in this world, especially when she was a shinobi herself.. and having adopted Takeda, a big responsiblity she had now. Not wanting to loose him, Shinjin nor her comrades. This was the only way for her thoughts to be gone, for her to get stronger and recieve these type of trainings from the Hokage. 

Clasping her hands together once more, the sparks were created, Hana's eyes concentrating on that spark. It started to grow a bit larger as her hands moved apart from one another. It was successful but it managed to shoot into the ground instead. 

<Damnit.>

[3rd]

Hana clasped her hands together once again, the spark generating in her hands before it started to slowly grow larger. As so, it was shot in-front of her, almost hitting Shinjin but really didn't. She bit her bottom lips softly before ending the Jutsu to brush herself off, giving her a bad vibe for some reason but managed to play it off. This Jutsu would be quite useful for her in the future. 

"All done." Hana said while staring at the ground. * - Sat Oct 17 03:52:06 2015
