<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Do you believe that? - Wed Oct  7 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) crouched to Heiwa's level, pinching his cheeks with her fingers. "Of-course I believe that, honey. Come on! We should go get some ice-cream or something. OH!!!!! Maybe I can show you this new water technique that I am working with?!" at the outside, she was totaly acting fake.. but in the inside... very worried about Hideki.

Just so he wouldn't be able to get hit by the technique. "Alright. This will be easy!" and with that, she weaved a few handseals before takin a eepbreath and releasing water as it gashed out of her mouth and like a waterfall into the ground. A bit of water -could- splash onto Heiwa but it was a little bit nothing much. "See?! Pretty cool huh?!"* - Wed Oct  7 03:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | Actually.. Lyala was pretty sad in the inside, she was devistated.. not knowing what else to do with her life. Everytime she tried to help Hideki, he always try to avoid her. So this was the only way for Lyala to get out of that and do something to not just sit down and cry. Smiling at her brother, she grabbed two cups, filled with sake before chugging them down just as how he did.* - Thu Oct  8 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | Of-course he had to be impressed, it was his little sister after all!


Lyala hiccuped, giggling to herself before reaching once again for a bottle of sake, looking around her eyes were getting a bit blurry. Her brother-- brothers because that's what she saw when she stared at him. "Haha. I never knew.. I had two SIBLINGS! TWO TWINS!" she yelled laughing out-loud before quickly taking a sip of her sake. But that wasn't all, she wasn't going to let her brother beat him! That was not possible.. it couldn't be. He always win on everything and it was about that time that Lyala won on a game, especially on something that her oldest brother likes to do a lot, right?

She quickly reached for another bottle of sake before quickly chuggint it all down. Slamming the bottle on the table, burping rather loudly. * - Thu Oct  8 04:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) looked around the shop, licking her lips to try and find something more suitable for her brother. Something.. that the hulk or the thing would wear for casual days when they aren't doing missions and shit. Lyala placed a hand on her forehead, feeling as if she was about to faint because of the pain but managed enough to find a good suit for her brother. Instead of blue pants, it was clean long black pants and some casual shoes for h-- "Oh...." he stared at his feet. They were enourmous[idkif u spell it like that.]

"Welp... here we go to find something else..."

She turned around heading towards the shoe store, looking around to find something that would suit her brother.. fit her brother's feet but there was nothing. "Come oooon!" Lyala turned around throwing the black pants towards her brother, obviously she was pretty upset for not finding some footwear for him. 

Quickly standing up from the ground, finding some sandals for her brother she placed them in-front of him. Staring at his chest that was exposed, Lyala tilted her head to the side tapping her bottom lips twice. Thinking of a way to find something for his upper muscular brute body. "Yeah... I don't think they have nothin for that."* - Thu Oct  8 05:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) |  There wasn't really anything else in this village for herself to do.. Hideki wasn't around much and neither was her brother. It wasn't really a good thing but she wasn't going to be crying and shit all alone, that was something that Lyala about to do. Now, going to her original spot-- where she usually trains up her jutsus. A peanut butter sandwhich on her hand with a glass of milk on the other, just a relaxing alone day for the girl to have some time for herself. It was about that time for her to do something like that, especially if she just wanted to spend time alone. 

  Even-though, that always happened.

Now taking a sip of her milk, she slowly stood up from the ground to place the glass and her half eatened sandwhich on the ground. Taking off her jacket, throwing it on the ground, she quickly made a few handseals. Then suddenly, looking at the hole that she had made earlier in the past, she quickly dugged into the the hole, hiding herself before digging herself back up away from the lake. "Ugh..." climbing up the hole, Lyala slowly crawled towards the lake, looking into the water. "Why is it.. so bo--- wait.. that's it!" 

Her boring expression turned into a smiley and happy one! She quickly got up from the ground, dusting herself off before going to get her milk and peanut butter sandwhich. Taking a bite out of her sandwhich, she nodded to herself. Gulping, Lyala spoke. "I'm going to go visit Kono!" and with that, Lyala walked away. Not even thinking about the dangers that were outside of the village, and hopefully she wouldn't get into danger or anything. * - Fri Oct  9 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | As another bite was took of the peanut butter sandwhich, she finally made it outside of the village. Thankfully no-one was around while the girl made her leave, even- if there were people, she wasn't going to just stop for anyone anyways. Lyala finished eating her sandwhich and drinking her milk, as she made her way towards her village. There were many rumors about it being destroyed but she wanted to see it herself. 

Lyala did bring a few things with her, just in-case she needed something or was going to get into a bit of danger. Never know if there is something very dangerous out there! She slowly made her way towards her village now, everything was going good so far too! "Mmmm...."* - Fri Oct  9 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) heard yelling coming from the Village, thing is, she walked right past Kenshin! She suddenly made her way to the villge. * - Fri Oct  9 01:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) was actually following right behind Kenshin because, as she was walking away.. he was going into the village. At first, Lyala thought that it wasn't going to be nothing bad or anything but he was actually destroying the village. Not knowing who he was, she had to go protect the others... right? That was her shinobi way! Lyala quickly continued to run, noticing Kenshin getting closer to the square. "Darn.. there are many people there... " looking at Asteroth's body, her eyes widened.. not ever facing someone like this guy before. "Well... damn it..." 

She moved away from her body and going towards the square, seeing Kenshin attacking the others. For now, Lyala would wait.. staring at the enemy. Whoever this guy was, had to be stopped.. perhaps the Raikage could do so? "Agh, watch ou--!" nothing couldn't have really been done, the guy was too fucking fast. "Out.."* - Fri Oct  9 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: YOU KILLEd - Fri Oct  9 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | There has to be something for Lyala to do.. she couldn't just stand there and see that sonic the hedgehog or the flash beat everyone up while she just stood there. No, that was not going to happen! Lyala noticed the bird being smashed and thrown away like some rag doll-- the shit was huge.. he had an immensive strength.. something that Lyala hasn't ever seen in a while. "Grrrh. I can't just do nothing!!"

 And with that, she quickly made a few handseals-- slowly taking a deep breath before water suddenly gashed out of her mouth and being sent straight towards Kenshin. It may not have been enough, but protecting those in this village was something that she was going to die for, Lyala did become a shinobi for this same reason, right? Yeah! * - Fri Oct  9 01:38:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "Koeki...? Whoever is Koeki, that person must've been someone he deeply cared about.."

 Lyala bit her bottom lips, taking a few steps back to see him going on-to the mountain. "Well.. somebody stop him..! Kage." she exclaimed, watching the guy slowly going to the mountain.. if he was on fire, probably that was another reason why he was acting like this? Something that she asked herself, this was all too weird for her. "Hrn...." Lyala stood there, not knowing what else to do.. he was obviously in rage. Whoever did kill this Koeki had to be the one to get killed, not the whole village. "Just calm down, will ya?!" she yelled, though, he wasn't really going to listen to her. 

 Quickly making a few handseals once again, water would come out of her mouth and into the area of the mountain that Kenshin was going into. This plan wasn't really a good one, but she wanted to at-least cover that part of the mountain into a syrup trap? Making Kenshin trapped there? It may not work, but it was still a good try!!

Lyala was a naruto nub.* - Fri Oct  9 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) thinks: Ah, so they didn't kill Koeki! - Fri Oct  9 01:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "It worked..--- no it didn't... no it didn't..." her eyes widened, taking a few steps back.. as soon as he yelled 'Meteor Night' his body was slowly rising into the sky. "Ooooh. i do not like the sound of tha---" Lyala quickly took a few steps backwards but the explosion was too fast, that caused the whole mountain to explosde. Thus an shockwave occurred sending Lyala flying backwards, away from the others but thankfully was helped by the guy with the hands...

But Lyala was knocked out, passed out. * - Fri Oct  9 02:03:44 2015
