<br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) sat in the forest as usual, her flowing locks were tied into a bun, insects scurried about burrowing into holes almost as if they could sense what was to come. "It's time..." There was a look of determination in her eyes that wasn't seen before, she was ready to stand by her man's side.  Her nimble fingers gently carve out a sequence of handseals and it ties in with the merging of her two affinities, Suiton, and Katon were forcefully compiled in order for her to utilize the element known as boil. With this she is able to condense the steam inside of her gullet and release it through her mouth.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | The mixture was able to peel away the layers of organic lie around her the bugs who attempted to find solace into their burrowed holes were completely decimated. In reality the bugs had no chance of resiting this technique as it effected anything it touched based on the changing of the ambient PH. It didn't even need to touch you directly and you'd be badly scarred by it's intensity. Thus was the ability of something like this, it is why her bloodline limit was so dangerous. 
* - Tue Sep 15 16:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) |  She tries it once more, this time taking the proper precautions of making sure noone else was around. Then, at the last second more steam ascends from the corner of her lips, the corrosive material was able to eat away at any organic matter like before. But because she was building up a level of gradual mastery over the technique it should be assumed that its intensity was also rising. Soon the very ground would lack vitality as nothing would be saved by her irresistibly damaging plum of acidic mist.* - Tue Sep 15 16:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Mariana, this is my sister. - Tue Sep 15 17:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Horrible pleasure... - Tue Sep 15 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We should train. - Tue Sep 15 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 15 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: There isn't much else to do for the time being. - Tue Sep 15 17:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: You two should spar. I'll just watch. - Tue Sep 15 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I was hoping the both of you would try.. - Tue Sep 15 17:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Why the animosity...? - Tue Sep 15 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We're all family... So to speak. - Tue Sep 15 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: It's obvious she doesn't like me. - Tue Sep 15 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: That isn't true.. - Tue Sep 15 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: That's what you say. - Tue Sep 15 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) stared at Aiyana before looking at  the grass, her arms crossed over her chest. Trying to figure out what the fuck was the problem with Aiyana. Mariana never did shit to her but whatever it was.. it seemed like a personal problem and one problem that Mariana wasn't going to fix. "Anywayssssssssss. I'm fine with a taijutsu session, I guess." she shrugged grabbing her spear before dropping it on the ground so it wouldn't be on the way. 

Like a bad bitch she is, hairflipped and strutted towards the field, turning around to look at Ushinawa. "Alright. Let's do this."* - Tue Sep 15 17:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: .. - Tue Sep 15 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: How are we doing this? - Tue Sep 15 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Wait.. - Tue Sep 15 17:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) scoots over to Aiyana.

"We should.. think of a plan.. you know? Ushinawa is... very... skilled." she whispered.* - Tue Sep 15 17:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Every action should be backed up with another action. - Tue Sep 15 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) whispers: Is all i got... - Tue Sep 15 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | "Every action should be backed up with another actio--- Are you serious?" she rolled her eyes before turning around to look at Ushinawa making his way towards them, his powerful legs' as he says, accelerated him towards herself. Mariana was hit, making her clash into Ushinawa's sister. "Why does he have to hit me first?"  Mariana stood up from the grass, rolling her eyes before running towards Ushinawa attempting to send a straight punch at his gut, hopefully his sister would be behind her, backing her up. Hell.* - Tue Sep 15 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: omit - Tue Sep 15 17:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | "Well shit.. it seems that his sister doens't know the meaning about teamfuckingwork!!" she yelled in her head before getting her ass thrown to the ground with the aim of his leg going to her shoulder. Mariana wasn't really good at Taijutsu fighting but if this was a sparring session, it would give her a few tips for her to be better at the whole fist fighting. "Ouch......it's not fair how you hit me first .. and really hard.." she rolled her eyes before standing up from the ground, taking a few steps back to see the two going at it. Trying to figure out a plan to take him down.* - Tue Sep 15 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Konoha Senpu... - Tue Sep 15 18:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: brb - Tue Sep 15 19:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow to look at the two siblings going at it. She heard what Ushinawa's sister said but didn't really get it. "Alright fine...." Mariana rolled her eyes before running towards Ushinawa, using the speed that she possesed she tried to tackle him down to the ground, hopefully to distract him from attacking his sister. Whatever it was that she was going to do. Mariana quickly stood up from Hiru --if it was sucessful-- before takin a few steps back away from him.* - Tue Sep 15 19:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | The tackle missed because he was incredibly fast, but she had a reflex that a nigga can't even catch her. Mariana dodged he grip to her wrist , before quickly turning around, crouching down as she attempted to send a leg sweep under Ushinawa's leg attempting to make the sexy Uchiha fall on his ass.* - Tue Sep 15 19:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You were able to work together. - Tue Sep 15 19:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Right. - Tue Sep 15 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) ose an eyebrow looking at her lover, as she wrapped her arms around his neck to bring him closer into a deeper kiss. "I mean.. like I said.. she doesn't want to get to know me.."* - Tue Sep 15 19:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Hey Aiyana! - Tue Sep 15 19:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I want to get to know my husband's sister. Duh. - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Husband? - Tue Sep 15 20:02:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: So you two should get along. - Tue Sep 15 20:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I grow tired of waiting... - Tue Sep 15 20:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: This war has been a long time coming. - Tue Sep 15 20:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Who is this....? I don't recognize them at all. - Tue Sep 15 20:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: Oh she is training. - Tue Sep 15 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Should probably master our jutsu. - Tue Sep 15 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Which one? - Tue Sep 15 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: ...Well, all of them. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I need to train my sister once she masters the one I gave her. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You've pretty much surpassed me in most aspects of Ninjutsu.. I suppose. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: I should go train as well. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mkay. - Tue Sep 15 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We should pick a more private location. - Tue Sep 15 20:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright, you two should do the training. - Tue Sep 15 20:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I should go to a far away location. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Because, I cannot use my technique around you guys. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It's not always viable to be -so- far. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: We will be far enough. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But if something happens its best one of us is close by. - Tue Sep 15 20:17:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: Well there is a lot of those running around. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: If they return you could be targeted, furthermore, they specialize in Genjutsu which both of you are weak against. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But this person knew what they were doing. - Tue Sep 15 20:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm not weak against Genjutsu. - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You sure about that? - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps I should show you something. - Tue Sep 15 20:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Come. - Tue Sep 15 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sis, you too. - Tue Sep 15 20:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) looked at his eyes, raising an eyebrow before her eyes widened.. she started at him for a few seconds before nodding. As so, Mariana did a few handseals before taking a deep breath using her core to release a mist towards Ushinawa.. showing him her full strength. That's what he wanted after all.Though, the mist was getting closer to Ushinawa.. it was possible for him to avoid it. * - Tue Sep 15 20:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | As he moved away, Mariana still kept her eyes locked at him. He did say he wanted to see her full strength right..? That just meant that she had to keep using whatever she had.. full throttle. Mariana made a few handseals again, taking a deepbreath all the way to her core,  building up a lot of chakra inside her body before sending a dragon head-shaped fireball towards him, manipulating the fire to attack Ushinawa. * - Tue Sep 15 20:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Genjutsu... - Tue Sep 15 20:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) thinks: They are just staring at each other? - Tue Sep 15 20:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) noticed the fireball hitting her lover, her tears started to ome out of her eye, covering her mouth before dropping on her knees. "I.. I can't believe I did that! I thought he was going to dodge it or something!!" she yelled with anger but crying at the same time.* - Tue Sep 15 20:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) continued her cry before noticing her husband standing right besides her. Her eyes widened as she sootd up slowly looking at him. "U-Ushinawa...." Mariana wiped her tears away before wrapping her arms around her husband to give him a kiss on the lips. Though, she was a bit mad...fallen into a genjutgu? That wasn't very nice of him to do! "Yeah.. you not getting it tonight." she whispered at him.* - Tue Sep 15 21:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow as she spreaded her legs apart, he would see her white panties visible and a little wet because of his touch. Her pussy was visable for him to see due to her wearing white panties and being a bit wet. "Hnn..." she moaned silently looking up at her husband, biting her bottom lips. "Just fuck me already..."* - Tue Sep 15 21:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) 's body was revealed. Well not really, though her black bra and white panties were revealed to her husband. He knew that Mariana had a weakness when they did this sort of thing.. and damn it she wanted him to fuck her really good. Mariana bit her bottom lips, looking down at his pants before reaching over to it, massaging his cock from underneath his pants, taking off his pants and underwear as his cock was revealed and because of how big it is, it flopped and slapped her thigh. 

Leaning forward, Mariana kissed the tip of Ushinawa's cock, pulling back the skin to lick around the crown before taking it all inside of him while she took off her bra. Her breasts bounced up and down, placing his cock in-between her breasts  slowly jerking him off with her breasts while sucking him off at the same time.* - Tue Sep 15 22:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | Her saliva was coming out of her mouth, dripping on the ground as she continued to suck his cock before going slowly, licking his shaft up and down leaning forward to his balls, sucking on his left nut before doing the same with his other nut, sucking them both inside of her mouth, covering her mouth with his balls inside of her for a few seconds. Mariana gasped for air, letting go of his balls as she turned around and got into the doggy positon, on her fours.

Spreading her leg wide, she showed both of her holes ready to be fucked in. The two holes exposed to her husband, which one would he choose?* - Tue Sep 15 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) knew that he was going to go for her ass, feeling his member going inside of her hole.. it did cause her a lot of pain but she loved every bit of it. Her eyes widened biting her bottom lips, he slowly continued to go inside of her ass, spreading her asscheeks widenly, feeling his member expanding even more inside of her. Mariana bit her bottom lips, her back arching as she felt her husband thrusting into her. "Shit...."

His ball sack loosely flapping while smacking itself against her rear. Feeling his hands on her waist, she backed her ass up with her stomach on the bed, slowly moving her hips with the same pace that he was going. As he chewed on her lobe, Mariana spoke;

"Slap my ass hard baby..."* - Tue Sep 15 22:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) bit her bottom lips, as she felt her ass being slapped by her husband, she felt his cock push against her asshole, she loved it when he fucked her ass. Mariana pushed out and his cock slipped straight up her ass, he fucked her hard, while she pushed her hips back in unison making sure herself got every inch inside of her. Mariana knew that it wouldn't be long before she'd start to feel those first waves build within her.  "Ahnn.. Ahnn.. fuck me so hard, Ushinawa.. I want you to cum inside of me..." she moaned loudly.

As he pounded her ass hard using his handful of her ass. He buried his cock in her. Mariana could feel the juices from her pussy begin to run down her thigh, her breath becomes shallower, her hips push back into him almost as hard as he's pushing into her. She can feel his cock deep inside start to tense and she can't hold back anymore.

 Just as how he said... Mariana was getting ready to cum.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | "Fu-Fuckkk! Fuckkk!!" she yelled moaning. His dick balls deep in her ass, as if he was giving her time to adjust. She dropped her head down into the bed and bit down on the bed sheets, gritting her teeth. y the time she felt him begin to tense up, she felt his cum shooting a load up her ass.Mariana felt the first shot of his cum deep in her ass, and she's done.. surrendering to wave after wave of pleasure that takes over the body.

Mariana slid out of his cock and onto the couch, his cum started to drip from her ass and on-to the floor. Her head only now begins to stop spinning. "Fuck... that was so good baby."* - Tue Sep 15 23:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) blush.* - Wed Sep 16 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) smiled at Ushinawa as he got closer to him, her arms in-front of her. As soon as he got closer to her, she wrapped her arms around his waist to pull him closer into a tightly hug.. her head resting on his chest. He would noticed that her voice was shaking a bit.. as if she was about to cry. "I love you.. Ushi... I really don't want to loose you.. that trick you pulled on me when I thought I killed you made me cry and think about.. what if it happened forreal?" Mariana burried her face on his chest, holding him tighter. * - Wed Sep 16 20:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Kay, let's do this spar then. - Wed Sep 16 20:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: u lonely? - Wed Sep 16 20:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: its ok - Wed Sep 16 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Wut. - Wed Sep 16 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I suppose here is fine. - Wed Sep 16 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Yes, here is fine. - Wed Sep 16 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I suppose it is your move. - Wed Sep 16 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Kay! - Wed Sep 16 20:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) nodded at her lover, tightening her gloves. As she did this, Mariana took a few steps back before smiling at her husband. "Alright! Let's do this!" the girl quickly took action, kicking her left foot on the ground, sprinting towards her husband as she attempted to send a straight punch towards his gut, followed by a low kick to his right shoulder if sucessful that is. * - Wed Sep 16 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ - Wed Sep 16 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: ^ - Wed Sep 16 20:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | Yes, her movements were quick as fuck but it seemed her husband was faster than she was. "Shit.." she should've knownt hat he was going to dodge her moves but that didn't stop her from trying to win against this spar.  Last time didnt' go so good because she didn't have enough training.. but through out the months, Mariana knew that she improved and could take on her husband. The only thing that would be a problem is his speed. "----"

As soon as he reflexed her moves like a boss, he was now behind her. "What..." her eyes widened, hearing his blade being sheated from its holster but the blunt end of the blade came across her ass. "Oh..." Mariana blushed slightly biting her bottom lips before making a split with her athletic ass, kicking Ushinawa from the ground, attempting to make him fall to the ground. * - Wed Sep 16 20:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What kind of spar.. - Wed Sep 16 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | ..Alright, he had to be using those eyes of his or something because her moves are rather quick for him to be avoiding her like that!! Though.. if he wanted to use his eyes.. then she will have to use her own eyes. Her eyes were more stronger than Ushinawa's! Mariana turned around as the Uchiha was walking away from her. "Fine... if you want to play it that way.. we both can play it..."

Mariana tightened her gloves tighter, clenching her fist before slamming that fist on the ground. As so, the ground in-front of her began to slowly breaky apart, creating a crater with earth spikes slowly going to Ushinawa. Though, Mariana's intention wasn't to hit him with this... skill. It was more to distract him. Quickly, she ran towards the ground coming up from the ground, jumping on each of them before falling down over towards Ushinawa, attempting to kick him on the head, though her strength was back to normal. 

The trees were also hit, so whoever was hiding should move. * - Wed Sep 16 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | <Shit.. he is too fast.. and those eyes of him are basically giving him all my moves.. I need to come up with something that he wouldn't know..." she thought to herself before landing on the ground, looking at her lover creating a few handseals and his jutsu known as the Great Fire-Ball Technique. "Shit..." 
It missed her by little though. This just meant that Ushinawa wasn't really playing around. "If that's what you want.. then fine.."

Mariana took a few steps closer to Ushinawa, trying not to stare into his eyes or else she might be caught in those control of his. "Alright... so, tell me. Is this a spar or are you going to keep cheating with your eyes? Babe?" Mariana rose an eyebrow, placing a hand on her hip before ruffling her hair , looking like a beautiful shinobi that she was.* - Wed Sep 16 20:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | "Hmph.. you didn't need to change your eyes back to normal you know...." she siged walking closely towards her husband before stopping mid-way. "Alright. I say we should take a break for a bit. I used to much chakra in that.. thing..." Mariana turned around to look at the huge mess that she did, the ground was all shattered, a crater was formed and the trees were all fallen down. "I never knew I could do that much...." her eyes widened, then going down to her hands clenching both of her fists. Now, she was terrified of fighting her husband with them.

"Uhhh.... " turned back around, looking at Ushinawa raising an eyebrow as she noticed his hand going to the back of his pouch. "Oh? I'm guessing you want to continue huh?" Mariana reached for her own pouch, grabbing a kunai, staring into her lover's eyes. * - Wed Sep 16 21:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow, staring at her lover for a second before taking a few steps back. Though, he was smart as fuck and that's what she loves about him.. but he was also a slick nigga. "H----" the projectile quickly was thrown to her, the speed was just to fast but Mariana didn't have no type of reflex perk so she couldn't possibly avoid them. Though, she countered one shuriken with her kunai but the other hit herself on the shoulder, slicing her skin off but not too much of it. It was visable and she was bleeding a bit.

"Fuck me in the ass .....!" she stared at her wound, the bleeding slowly dripping down to the grass. Ushinawa knows that Mariana hates blood, and especially when she herself is the one bleeding. "....." the angry girl stared at her lover before walking towards him, her Kunai in her hand, suddenly she threw the Kunai, followed by two shurikens straight at her hubby.* - Wed Sep 16 21:26:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I got it, no worries. - Wed Sep 16 21:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) reached for her wound, closing her eyes as her hand began to turn into a blue chakra. It was herself healing. It will take a few seconds and concentration for the healin to be sucessful. "Don't worry baby." * - Wed Sep 16 21:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) continued to run around the forest before stopping her tracks to see Ushinawa, his cousin and that Medusa girl. "What the fuck happened?" she said arching an eyebrow before quickly running to Hideki checking for any wounds for herself to heal. "What happened?" Mariana turned her head, squinting her eyes at the snake girl.. even if she was 'rather' far away from them. She sure did yell. "What did YOU do?!"* - Thu Sep 17 00:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: This was all my fault.. If only I was stronger.. And not so careless. - Thu Sep 17 00:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) tied her hair up into a ponytail, she tightened her gloves a little before her hands were now surrounded by blue chakra. Mariana started to get close to the girl, before slowly reaching for her wound... something inside her told her to punch the shit out of her and send her maps flying away.. but then another thing told her that Ushinawa might need Medusa for answers or questions about Hideki's problem.. whatever he did to her. So instead... Mariana goes with the second option.. heal her. Placing her hands over the wound, the healing was now processing. She felt disgusted... with both Ushinawa for wanting to help Medusa and for Medusa herself to do that to Hideki. 

A few seconds later it was done. "Done." and with that she backed away, but not to far.. just close enough, just in-case Medusa wanted to try something on her husband. That's someone you can't mess with... * - Thu Sep 17 00:55:15 2015
