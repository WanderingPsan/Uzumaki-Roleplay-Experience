<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) | Hell no, Hideki was like a little brother to Mariana, she just wasn't going to stand there and let her brother be killed or fucked up by Tetsujin. Deep inside, Mariana hated this guy and so, she wasn't going to let Hideki fight him alone. She quickly ran towards Tetsujin, staring at Mamoru, coming into the fight. Though, that wasn't going to stop her from getting what she want.. and that is to either kill Tetsujin or knock him back away from her brother.

Mariana dashed towards the speared guy, sending a straight punch towards him attempting to make the guy fly backwards away from them..that was if Mamoru's attack didn't really reach out. He'll have three attacks coming at him, how would he dodge them? The world will never know. But Mariana had to try in-order for Hideki not to die or get injured badly. Too bad the Raikage was there, seeing them about to get fucked up. * - Wed Sep 30 04:24:57 2015

Opening her eyes slowly, Mariana looked at Ushinawa, speaking softly and a little low. "T-Tetsu-Tetsujin...." her head turned to the left to see her son standing there. "Do not let him see me like this..." the worried mother spoke before closing her eyes once again, slowly breathing heavily. * - Thu Oct  1 19:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) walked around the village, hopefully to find someone she could speak with because this village was seriously a ghost town. There was no one around and many people were -- well they were away. "Hrn....where is everyone?" Lyala placed her hands over her hips, continuing to make her way around the village. As so, she noticed a guy reaching for a woman's purse, running away from the woman trying to steal the bag from the girl. That was something that Lyala will not tolerate! "Hey! Give her that bag back!"

She quickly ran behind the man before making a few handseals as she took a deep breath and shot some liquid on the ground.. it made the man quickly stop as his movements were now being slowed down. Lyala giggled to herself, running her fingers through her hair before slowly making her way to the guy. "Alright.... you do not steal stuff from girls... " she squinted her eyes at the man before snatching the purse from his hands. 

Then slamming the purse on-to the man's head, knocking him out coldly. "Hmph." Lyala turned around to go back to the woman. "Here it is. Trust me.. you shouldn't be walking around with that.. or else more people would want to be stealing it." she sighed, as the woman payed Lyala some yen. "Oooooh. Thank you, that's so sweet." Lyala blushed slightly before turning around to walk away. Towards the center of the village.

As she made it there, Lyala put in the yen inside of her pouch, turning around to see her oldest brother standing about. It was weird seeing him just standing and doing absolutely nothing. "B-Brother!" Layla smiled at him, walking towards her oldest brother before patting his arm. "Y-Yeah! Hehehe... long time no see... how's Lyric and stuff? I miss him too. Oh and uhhh how was your you know.. the whole.. thing you were doing? Oooooh. What do you have here?" 

Layla rose an eyebrow to stare at his weapon, her finger leaning forward to poke his hammer. "Nice. What do you do-- I mean, I kn-- nevermind." she sighed turning around to look at the statue with the first Hokage there. "You know, one day.. I want to become Hokage... and like..... you know. Lead this village. Beeeeeeelieve it!~" the girl smiled to herself, turning around to look at her oldest brother. "Hehe. Do you think I would be a Hokage?" her voice got serious now. * - Fri Oct  2 04:33:29 2015

"AAH!" Lyala's cheeks turned pink, covering her face but quickly removing her hands from her face and reaching for her skirt as she placed both of her hands on the skirt, the part where she held it so her brother nor the others would see what the girl had underneath.

This was one of the reasons why at times, Lyala didn't really like wearing skirts. "Let me down, Maloth! L-Let me down!" the shy girl yelled to her brother, commanding him to let the poor girl down. It was embarrassing enough that her pink cheeks were exposed to those around her because of her holding her skirt so nothing would show. * - Fri Oct  2 05:01:39 2015

I guess, I could go first then?" the youngest sister nodded to herself before making her way towards her brother with the speed that she possesed, thus attempting to send a straight punch towards her brother's chest. Though, her strength wasn't that strong but she did combine it with a swift leg going to his leg, attempting to make the brute fall down.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | That was a bad idea, to actually try to take him out with her fists and legs. She just didn't really want to use any of her ninjutsu on her brother or else that wouldn't really be fair at all, right? The thrust below her neck did send the girl flying backwards, rolling on the ground as she was inches away from her brother. "Agh.... seriously?! Why did you have to do that....." Lyala spoke getting a bit angry, as she stood up from the ground, brushing herself off, the sand, she sighed staring at her brother with a rather angry face. Yeah, he knew what type of angry face she had. 

"Fine!"

And with that said, Lyala quickly did a few handseals, channeling her chakra into her gut before sending a sticky liquid towards her brother's foot, it became sticky for him.. that is if he were to move. The area around him would be effected, as there was an entire pond of starch syrup. If sucessful, this would give the girl a good chance to actually do something else that she had in mind.* - Fri Oct  2 19:51:40 2015

Lyala jumped up and down with excitement, clapping her hands before giggling as she stared at her brother with a smile forming on her face. "Hahahahahaha. I told you, I was super strong! Hehehe. Now that you are trapped...." the sister giggled at her brother, making a few handseals once again before slowly taking a deepbreath, her chakra going into her stomach then...! Lyala opened her mouth as water gushed out from the mouth like a waterful, shooting straight towards her brother attempting to wash him away, if possible that is. 

If sucessful, Maloth would be all soaked up! It was one of the skills that she liked to show off to her brother, since he always said that Lyala was never going to be strong or anything. Guess what? She is! * - Fri Oct  2 20:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) // Being at home while Maloth was out on his mission, Lyala went down to the basement , going into the very training room he had created a long while ago before all the insane crazy events that happend in Kono. "I guess I can train now without having Maloth worry.." the sister of the brute smirked , she only desired to become stronger one day to protect her family much like he did..But in her case, Ninjutsu was not going to be a specialty, she was one to fight with hand to hand combat, being a boxer tier fighter.

By placing weighs on both her wrist and her ankle of course, she went out to begin tossing punches and kicks into the air , all while trying to run circles within the room, laps for her own stamina pools to increase <I can't cry each time I get hit by a powerful jutsu, nope..Not any longer..And if someone tries to touch my brother while I'm around, they'll have to answer to my fist and feet..Hmph! > she was still a bit angry inside.  She kicked the dummy once more and punched it in the face, punching it once more with a jabbing combo , thus giving it a right hook, as the left hand was used for the labs and her right for the power strikes, the woman also made sure to keep her breathing in check, not trying to mess up and lose too much oxygen.. 

Breathing the wrong way could cause someone to tire out easily and quickly, so this was something Lyala had to focus on along with her abilities to react to quick attacks by training her reflex...The dummy had a small feature to use, which it would only strike back in a certain motion, nothing too serious like sparring but rather giving her some form of training her very reflex...This was also good for her close combat experience..She had to focus highly on this with taijutsu being her profession, trying to make it out so that she wouldn't always be defeated by the pesky use of Ninjutsu. Being apart of the Uzumaki clan, she naturally had high chakra reserves , something to give her the very edge she needed when training with these types of jutsu.

Making each and every kick as swift as possible she thought for a second <These weights help me with my speed...I'll need to make them heavier..Or better yet, find something that will stop me from kicking and break away from that level of weight..> this idea came to mind with her punches as well..She soon began to do her push ups later on along the way, trying to perfect each and every strong right, along with a swift and powerful jab with her left..Kicks were the last thing to be trained, as her stamina was running low, she had to be able to perfect each different taijutsu ability.* - Fri Oct  2 23:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | It was nice seeing other people around the village, people that actually spoke instead of her hanging out with her brother and his other friends or whatever. Though, it was finally time to eat some dinner.. something that she really wanted to enjoy. As she made her way there, opening the door slowly yo see her brother sitting down with his friend.. or whoever that girl was. 

"Hey brother!"

Lyala spoke, skipping over towards him before sitting down to raise a leg on-top of the other while looking down at the menu, staring at it for a second while squinting her eyes. "Mmmmmm. I wannnnnnnnt the misu noodles.. yeah. That sounds great right now. WIth some cookies and milk on the side." Lyala noddded, closing the menu as the waitress went to the back beginning to cook.

"Soo, what are you guys doing? Or well, talking about?"* - Sat Oct  3 03:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow to see Maloth offering her some of the meat that he was eating. It almost made her want to puke on the table but she simple stared at him with her head shaking. "No, thank you..." Lyala smiled at her oldest brother before turning her head around to look down at the misu soup that was finally in-front of her. She reached for the chopsticks, beginning to eat it, slowly. * - Sat Oct  3 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) sighed, looking down at her food but then heard her brother choking. "OOP! Are you alright?!" her eyes widned patting his back but he managed to get himself together. "Alrighty then.. that means you are okay." with a nod, she got back to eating her food. "Mmmm? I don't know what you mean, I just like to eat here... the food is very very good." Lyala nodded to herself before grabbing a napkin to clean herself up. * - Sat Oct  3 04:05:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) continued to wipe her lips with a napkin, before standing up to fix her skirt a bit. As soo, Lyala would now be lifted up and tosse over his shoulder, placing a hand on her skirt to pull it down, just so nothing would show. "Can you stop doing that?! And I don't know, where we can go."* - Sat Oct  3 04:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | Finally she was put down, turning her head to look at her brother she rolled her eyes sticking her tongue out at him before walking towards the edge of the bridge. As so, she sighed quickly to make a few handseals as she started to focus into her element. Seeing that she was surrounded by water, Lyala quickly took a deep breath and spit out the water from her mouth as it shot straight to the lake. Thus, making a bit part of the area a little sticky. 

"Hah, I just need to practice this a bit more..."

[1st RP]

Looking around the area, it was beautiful, quiet and her favorite place to go where she can try like crazy. Her brother was here but he wasn't really doing anything, which is good... because then Maloth would take away Lyala's concentration. "Alright, I can do this again..." she said softly before taking a few deep breaths as she weaved handseals, concentrating on her elemental ninjutsu. Thus, creating the same water syrup on-to the lake.. it started to spread slowly but in a couple of minutes would disappear because of the lake surrounding the syrup. 

[2nd RP]

"Maloth! Hey, brother. Watch me do this...." Lyala nodded towards her oldest brother taking a few steps back. "This will be fun, hahaha." she giggled softly before weaving the same handseals, focusing on her chakra as she released the water syrup technique on-to the lake, as it was there. It started to spread out slowly, thus she quickly took a rock and threw it towards the lake. It was now stuck on the middle of the lake. "Hahaha. This is fun..." but then suddenly the whole syrup was now slowly disappearing with the rock sinking down.

"You saw that, Maloth? You see that? Am I good or WHAT?! Do you honestly think that I cannot be a Hokage?"

[3rd RP]* - Sat Oct  3 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | It was nice to have some compliment from her brother, he was a bit -crazy- when it came to expressing his feelings... rather crazy actually. "Hahaha. Yeah! I will become the Hokage and you will be by my side as my assistant! Or maybe my bodyguard because you have the whole body and stuff for it!" she nodded her head before giving him a thumbs up, saying; "BEEELIEVE IT!" Lyala smiled at her brother before his hand slammed into her shoulder, raising an eyebrow wondering what he was trying to do to her. Not raise her again to his shoulder!

Lyala quickly tried to turn away, but that was stopped with the push. As it made the girl stumble back. "AAAAAAH!!!" she yelled but her balance wasn't so good. Thus, making her fall into the water, not knowing how to swim however... so Lyala was basically drowning right now, her hands raised into the air as if trying to swim towards the shore. ---Which, she was right there.

"AGHH!" gasping for air, she splashed like magikarp to the shore before finally laying her back against the sand. Lyala coughed a bit of water, turning her head to see her brother standing there. "GAH! WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DO THAT!!!" she yelled quickly weaving a few handseals, as she sent a water gash straight towards her brother, attempting to make him fall backwards into the water as well.* - Sat Oct  3 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What the fuck... - Sat Oct  3 07:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "Yeah! That's what you get from pushing me away like nothing!"

Lyala looked down at her clothing as it was all soaked up, she sighed turning around to look at a new person walking in. Her eyes widened with her cheeks turning pink, quickly running behind a tree to cover herself. Not that she was naked or anything but didn't really want others to see her all wet. "Gah... are you serious right now?" Lyala thought to herself, peeking her head out to look at Hideki before speaking with a friendly wave. "Hello, new person....."* - Sat Oct  3 07:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow looking at her brother, shaking her head before going back to Hideki. "N-NO! He is just my brother.... though, he did push me into the water but I am all fine now..." Lyala nodded her head, shivering a bit. It was getting a little chilly out here, this was all Maloth's fault! * - Sat Oct  3 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: --- - Sat Oct  3 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You look cold, would you like to wear my cloak? - Sat Oct  3 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I.. uhhh... you d--- yeah. If you don't want to use it... - Sat Oct  3 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) grabbed the cloak, nodding towards him. "T-Thanks...." she quickly put on the cloak, smiling at Hideki for helping her out. Though, her cheeks seem to turn even pink by the exposure of his chest. But it wasn't really nothing weird to see, since her brother is always without shirt. "Phew... I feel better no--" she sneezed, turning around to look at her brother. "YOU JUST MADE ME SNEEZE!!" Lyala yelled sneezing once again, she was getting the cold.. something that Lyala didn't really like, getting sick.

Turning her head back towards Hideki, with a smile, she spoke once again this time introducing herself. "M-My name is Lyala... It's nice to meet you and thank you... for your cloak. I will give it back to you when I am dry-- well I have to wash it first and then give it back to you, hah..." * - Sat Oct  3 07:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I think Hanabi used to call him Big Guy...Instead of by his real name. - Sat Oct  3 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: So, what brings you around here, Hideki? - Sat Oct  3 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Just to visit a close friend of mine.....And to see how Konohagakure is doing. - Sat Oct  3 07:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Sat Oct  3 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) shrugged blushing slightly, looking away. "I don't know, but I should go get dryed up."* - Sat Oct  3 07:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I have to actually go to my home, hah. - Sat Oct  3 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh. - Sat Oct  3 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see. - Sat Oct  3 07:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) nodded before walking ahead to stop next to Hideki, turning around to face him now. "I'll find you and give you, your cloak back, I promise. It will be all washed up and clean." Lyala smiled at him, running her fingers through her hair before giving a death glare to her brother and then returning back to normal as she stared at Hideki for a bit. Wondering who this guy was because it has been the first time that she sees someone like him. With a dagger on his waist and all. He must've been a warrior or shinobi...

"I uhhh... well.. it was nice meeting you again, Hideki." Lyala extended her arm towards the guy, hoping to shake hands with him. "Don't worry it is dry."* - Sat Oct  3 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "Well yeah.. it is just a cloak but it belongs to you, duh..." she smiled at Hideki noticing his smile, which made her blush slightly but quickly brought her hand back. "Alright. It was nice meeting you again!" Lyala told him while walking backwards, that was till she tripped over a rock, falling on-to the ground but quickly getting up to pretend that nothing happend. "What? I mean, yeah! It was nice meeting you, Hideki!" and with that the blondie turned around, crossing her arms over her chest to walk away.

Such an embarrassing moment....and she cursed herself because of it! * - Sat Oct  3 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) whispers: Was real) - Sat Oct  3 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "W---" feeling the hand around her waist, her eyes widened to turn around looking at Hideki, staring into his eyes before sneezing once again but this time covering herself. "What? How did you do that? Tha-- You-- Agh.... pretty fast there... I uhh...." she looked down at the hand around her waist, her cheeks once again, turning into a pink color while staring at Hideki. "Ooop..... welp....I should go... thanks for saving me. Pft, I mean... it wasn't that bad of a fall.. haha. B-But thank you though! That was pretty cool... I never knew someone could be that fast." Lyala was amazed by Hideki's skills, taking a few steps back as he released her she nodded while tying her hair up into a ponytail. "Well.. I should go. Well, I already said that, hah.." sneeze. 

Lyala looked around trying to find her brother but he wasn't around. It might have been that he left, perhaps. "Yeah, well.. you should go find your friend.... I will give you the cloak back, as soon as I see you... mhm."* - Sat Oct  3 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yeah, no problem...Take your time. - Sat Oct  3 08:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "Yeah! And you go umm find your friend... you know. Mhm. Is the reason why you came here, hah. I should go now.... I will see you around?" Lyala rose an eyebrow, turning around to walk away but accidentally bumped on-to the tree not even noticing how close she was to it. Turning her head hopefully Hideki didn't see her doing that, she simply nodded continuing to walk away! "Why do I be such a clutz when I am talking to someone new?"* - Sat Oct  3 08:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) had a scroll on her hand, reading her mission not really looking in-front of her. That was when she accidentally bumped into Hideki. "OOP! Hideki! I'm sorry. I uhh... I don't know." she blushed slightly, looking down at the scroll before rolling it down closed.* - Sat Oct  3 19:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "Alright, so this is what we have to do... we have the materials already, so we just need to go south to bring the items to the samurai and then we will be all set and done!~" she smiled at Hideki, continuing to walk in-front of Hideki, not really noticing what he was looking at because she didn't have eyes behind her head. Lyala closed the scroll, turning her head to look at Hideki with a smile. "----------" her eyes widened staring into his eyes as she stopped her tracks. This was the first time that she has seen someone's eyes like that.

Lyala rose an eyebrow getting a bit closer to Hideki, leaning forward to him to stare at his eyes closer. "What is that? Your eyes were not red...." she asked placing both of her hands on her hips, while staring into his eyes, though, for some reason they were extremely mysterious.. beautiful too. "Woah."* - Sat Oct  3 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow staring at his eyes, blushing slightly before clearing her throat taking a few steps back. "Yeah... I promise, I won't tell anyone. Hehe, it will be between me and you!" Lyala nodded before turning around to head more south of Kono. There, would be a camp up ahead. "Ooh. We might be here..." she said turning her head towards Hideki, motioning him to follow her as she made her way to the samurai camp. Hopefully they wouldn't want to kill them or anything. * - Sat Oct  3 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | As they got to the camp, she handed over the materials to the samurais. They were all giving Lyala some weird eyes, as in wanting to do something with her. But she didn't exactly notice it or anything. "Here is the materials that you guys have ordered." she smiled at them. A samurai stood up, walking towards Lyala, winking at her before grabbing the materials to take it back to the others. "Thank you, sweetheart." one of them said but Lyala just nodded and turned around to go back to Hideki.

"Off we go? We have finished our mission." she smiled at him, staring into his eyes still wondering what kind of ability he had. It must've been something really rare because he wanted her to keep it a secret.* - Sat Oct  3 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "Woah!" she was scooped up, giggling to herself. "Wait, aren't I heavy or something?" and they left!* - Sat Oct  3 20:41:36 2015
