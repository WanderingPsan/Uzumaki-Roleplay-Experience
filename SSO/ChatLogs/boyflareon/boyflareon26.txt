<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) shook her head. If this was some part of there plan, they had to be more... well, more confident. They just seemed like they were all over the place but she trusted the both of them and had confident on them that they would prove to her that they got what it takes to do a good team work. The bells hanging on her hips while waiting for the two students to take it away from her. "Mmmm?"

Heiwa seemed to be the first one to make a move, raising an eyebrow noticing the shurikens flying towards her she strutted over to Heiwa, simply avoiding the shurikens that were coming to her by simply her body flickering behind Heiwa. Quickly, the Chunnin took out her katana and hit Heiwa with her hilt, it wasn't nothing hard or anything. Just a small tap with a giggle! 

"Come on, Heiwa. You can do faster than that.~"* - Tue Oct 20 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Well. You guys just need to find a way... to take off these bells." 

 She said shaking her hips like a belly dancer as they started to jiggle jiggle. "Off me.~ And when you do that, I will give you both rewards!" Hana nodded to herself before taking a few steps back, as so she noticed the water raging towards her. "W---!" the chunnin quickly turned around to run towards the fence, kicking her right foot onto the edge, performing a backflip. Then using her suimen to run through the water raging gun. 

Hana sped in-front of Takeda, poking his nose before quickly crouching down to sweep down her foot to both of his legs, attempting to make him fall down. If successful, the chunnin ran away from the two. * - Wed Oct 21 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) was caught in the trap, hence the two have won the training. She wanted to get some training on her own anyways. "GOOD JOB YOU TWO!" Hana yelled, backflipping away from the two before rewarding them.* - Wed Oct 21 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Uh...Go us I guess. - Wed Oct 21 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Yeah, she knew that they were really smart and not going to go down without loosing. That was something that the chunnin admired to the two. "Mmmm?" she turned her head, noticing the string that was attached to the weapon, though that didn't really stop her from running towards Takeda to attack him-- it did stop her attack since she needed time and concentration to dodge the shurikens.

Hana's body flickered once again, away from the kids but only one bell was off. "Ohhh. I see... you guys have one more bell to take off. Let's do it.~" she giggled softly while running her fingers through her hair to stare down at her two students. Actually proud of the two for using such wonderful technique, team work was the key! And that was something that Hana wanted to teach the two.* - Wed Oct 21 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow taking a few steps back to see the two kids combining their techniques together. "Alright! Let's do this!~" noticing the river full of water syrup and the mud-- it made the technique much stronger, thus catching Hana completely. And now with her being stuck there was no way for her to escape! There was a way but she decided to do it easy for the kids.... just for today.

 "Alright alright.... You guys win this time!"* - Wed Oct 21 02:11:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Understood, but when that money starts to go through the Sunagakure bank, then it's only a matter of time until it becomes a country wide currency. That both Konoha and Kumogakure share. - Fri Oct 23 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: A three country-wide. - Fri Oct 23 00:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: How much weight does anything have in Gezo currency is the real question. - Fri Oct 23 00:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Seeing as the Gezo don't affect our daily lives, it's safe to be more concerned about a three village alliance. And what if Kirigakure joins, that means all major villages are in cahoots, with Sunagakure at it's head. - Fri Oct 23 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Money..is money.. - Fri Oct 23 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: In the end it's Kirigakure's problem. - Fri Oct 23 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I'd say it's more than that. - Fri Oct 23 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: It's a power move. - Fri Oct 23 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: He's already said he's with it. So there's not much to expect from his side. - Fri Oct 23 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I was hoping he'd say no, to keep the balance of power. - Fri Oct 23 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Or..he can put in a safety net. - Fri Oct 23 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: They couldn't stop Konoha and Kirigakure. - Fri Oct 23 00:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Even if Kumogakure and Sunagakure teamed up. They couldn't stop Konoha.  - Fri Oct 23 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Mostly because i'd side with whoever's fighting Suna. - Fri Oct 23 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Lord Hokage, all you would have to do is make it clear that you will still be using normal yen as the main source of Konohagakure's currency. - Fri Oct 23 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: They can convert whatever they wish after it is distributed, but when we accept it. It must be in yen, or ryo. - Fri Oct 23 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You could also deny their bank as a whole. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That'd be a bit more fun. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Kirigakure is in the worst position for this.. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You'd have to deny the bank as a whole. If you accepted the terms and still tried to maintain your own currency, i'm sure it would be an issue. It wouldn't really mean anything to be under the same bank. - Fri Oct 23 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What are you talking about? Of course there'd be a point. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We don't know how they handle their money. If we still wanted to do business with them..it may be needed. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It was just the safer move. I would personally pick to not go with the bank at all.. - Fri Oct 23 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Agreed. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Giving Sunagakure control of anything..is a bad idea. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I've said it once, and i'll say it again. It's a power move to maintain their standard of living. You can't blame them for it, survival instincts. But I wouldn't go for. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Especially my money? Hell..no.. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Especially after Konoha being rebuilt, the point of the village is to be a village and stand on it's own. - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: To depend on another village's banking system and move with their currency is a bit demeaning. - Fri Oct 23 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: If Sunagakure owns the bank they can always deny us the flow of our currency. - Fri Oct 23 00:48:38 2015
