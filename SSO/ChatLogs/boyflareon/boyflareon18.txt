<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Kept smirking, thinking of a few things of what she was going to do to Shinjin, later on when the two are alone at their house. He just broke a promise, but thankfully the kid might've have not heard him. BUT! He still broke the promise, and he had to be punished.. in a way that he would -somewhat- not enjoy it but at the same time feel a bit of 'electricity' if you know what I mean. Winks. 

Anyways time to go back to reality, to training! Turning her head, she would see the child getting hit by the genjutsu.. how exactly did he get out of the genjutsu? Hm. Oh well, that was something that she had to learn now. It was Hana's turn to do so. Now, doing the ramseal.. nothing worked. That was bad. 

[1st RP]

<Mmmmm....one way to get out of a genjutsu would have to be by hurting myself, right?>

Taking a deepbreath, closing her eyes to concentrate on her chakra flow. She tried to surge her chakra rapidly, while using the Ram Handseal.. to use the Kai technique but nothing really happened, and once again. Concentrating on her chakra, sending it through her system but nothing was working. 

[2nd RP]

Now, finally doing it one again...she began to surge more of her chakra through her system, stopping the flow around her body. Then quickly she focused even more, before quickly breaking out of the Genjutsu. Finally, the head would stop, opening her eyes to look at Shinjin. "Well... that was a really hard technique to do.... gah.... I feel like as if my brain is going to die or something. So! Now that we are done with this, where you going, Zeus?"* - Sun Oct 11 02:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) smirked, tying her hair up into a bun before taking off her jacket, turning around to wash her hands in the dish washer. There was something that Hana wanted to do to Shinjin for his bad action, breaking their promise. But...for that to happen, a little tease should be in order, right? Mhm. Hana sighed, getting her acting on before walking towards the closet, taking off her shirt and unclipping her bra, as her breasts bounced being revealed. Turning around to look at Shinjin, raising an eyebrow with her breasts exposed at her lover. 

"Oh, honey. Can you do me a favor and fix those plates there?" 

Teasing mode. ON. He was not getting none of these, oh no no no. There was something else in her head. * - Sun Oct 11 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) giggled to herself, walking towards Shinjin as he began to fix the table quickly patting his butt with her hands. "Soooooo. How do you want your punishment? Mmmm? You have a multiple choice problem. A- Get roped up and let me do whatever I want with you. B- I will be naked around you, tease you and you won't touch me or whatever. C- You won't have sex with me for a few days. And lastly.. D- I'll...." she leaned forward to whisper to him while giving him a kiss on the neck. "I will do something else that you may not like, so that will remain a mystery." 

She nodded before smacking his butt.

"Choose!" Hana turned around to walk towards the closet once again, taking off her pants. * - Sun Oct 11 03:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) noticed his dick growing hard, she poked it to tease him a bit more before turnin around, giving him her back.

Hana rose an eyebrow wondering what he was talking about, before turning around pretending that she dropped something, bending down as both of her holes were exposed to his face to see. "Mmm... where is that thing at?"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: But I admire that, he is listening to me and accepting my punishment. A bit more, and I can drive him off edge. - Sun Oct 11 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) slowly started to rub her breasts against his back. "Come onnn, what is it?"* - Sun Oct 11 04:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Finally, he manned up.

"Well, it was about time!"

Hana felt his hands on her waist, wrapping her arms around his neck to pull him closer to her as she was now being pressed against the bed, wrapping her legs around him while her fingers ran up and down his back biting her bottom lips softly. "Take it all off, now!" she commanded. * - Sun Oct 11 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | That's what Hana wanted... she wanted him to punish her for all those things she has done to him. Teasing him was his punishment for saying her name... but being punished by him sexually was better. "Yes... punish me, I have been a very very bad girl!" Hana bit her bottom lips softly staring down at him as he pulled his pants off, his cock being revealed. 

Hana was pushed further into the bed, her stomach laying on it with her ass being up into the sky. Both of her holes exposed for her lover to punish her however he wanted. Hana was a little nervous about him taking on her asshole-- it was going to be something new... hopefully it won't be that painful! [Yeah right.]

Feeling the softness of his cock's crown pressing against the entrance of her asshole, her mouth bit into the pillow while the bed sheets were held tightly, ready for her punishment.* - Sun Oct 11 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Her pussy was dripping down her thighs by the time he pressed his crown against her entrance. She leaned her elbows on the bed, feeling his hands going up to her breasts miliking them with each moan and breath escaped her mouth. Hana swallowed hard and tried to relax, her stomach was filled with butterflied as he stretched her asshole with his massive cock. Before she could catch her breath, she felt the thick cock pushing into her asshole, invading it, inch by inch.

She sucked in her breath and held the pillow tighter, her soft moans and panting breaths only made her more excited for this. Hana licked her fingers, reaching between her thighs, rubbing her clit as he fucked her ass with ferocity. The loud, slap slap slap of his pelvis pounding against her buttocks, sounded even louder in the stilness of the quiet room around them. 

"Yes, fuck me fuck this bad naughty girl. T-This Queen has been so bad...!" moaned loudly enough for anyone to hear her but good thing that no one was around!* - Sun Oct 11 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) gasped and moaned, her asshole being stuffed, she writhed between them, whimpering as a wave of sensation spread outwards from her core, her inner thighs quivering. Hana couldn't feel most of her legs because of the position that she was in, continuing to finger herself, she felt the electricity once agains surging through her body-- he really did love giving her orgasms. 

Her chest and belly were stippled with a red flush, and her breath was ragged. She was unmistakably close to shuddering orgasm. Hana screamed as her pussy contracted violently, as she came on the bed sheets, thanks a lot Shinjin!

She kept getting fucked through her orgasm and beyonce as she struggled and thrashed and begged him to stop but that was something that she really didn't want. Her toes curled with her back arching, her head thrown back, her clit engorged and sensitive...pussy puffy and swollen the sheets beneath them soaked with her ejeculate. His balls smacking against her rear, as she started to slowly move her hips at the same speed as he was, helping him.* - Sun Oct 11 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | This was the best... sex... EVER!

Hana felt her ass being fucked harder, it was as if her ass cheeks were burning up! There was nothing else that she could do but enjoy it. Her bottom lips bitten, before feeling his cock yanking out of her asshole. A sigh of relief escaped her mouth but suddenly felt his long cock thrusting into her vagina now. 

"F-Fucccck!" That was unexpected, moaning with a few whimpers her face burried into the pillow.

Her warm pussy wrapping its self around his cock as she threw her head back in ecstasy. "God YES!" she exclaimed, moaning and grunts of please escaping her lips. Once again, throwing her head back in pure pleasure, legs locking tight to his own legs as he thrusted deep into her. He could feel her pussy clamp down onto his cock, muscle spasms taking her body as her ograsm tumbled over her. 

As he took out his cock from her pussy, she was turned around. Quickly placing his cock in-between her breasts, as she picked up the pace so he could cum faster. The tip of her tongue found the slit at the top of his cock, and teased against it, tasting his pre-cum. Hana slowly opened her mouth, for the first time taking his cock inside of her while jerking him off with her breasts, closed her lips arond his cock. Slowly, worked her way dodwn on it, taking against the back of her throat. Yes, deep throat with a few gags here and there, as she quicly bobbed her head. * - Sun Oct 11 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "In my mouth baby, in my mouth!" was all she could manage as a reply.

As he pulled out of her, she quickly took his cock in her mouth once again. It didn't take long, only a second or so of her sucking his cock. Hana gagged as she tried to keep all of his cum from escaping past her lips, though some of it went onto her tits and stomach. When the torrent of cum had finally stopped, she looked at her lover and opened her mouth to show him how much she had. Then with a smle, she closed her mouth and swallowed it all.

Looking down at her tits and stomach being covered with cum, she licked it all up by scooping the cum up with her fingers and licking it one by one. Same with her face. Hana grabbed Shinjin's hand and pulled him on-to the bed, with her laying besides him. "Oooh, that was... great. Wow. I love it when you are so rough on me."* - Sun Oct 11 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Mmm. Why not kiss me lips? - Sun Oct 11 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Come onnn.~ - Sun Oct 11 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) was pulled into a hug, as she leaned forward attempting to kiss him on the lips! * - Sun Oct 11 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) was actually surprised, kissed his lips back tilting her head to the side. "Mmm. I wonder, why you kissed me especially when I just got done with your penis in my mouth, hah. But I love you too baby." Hana nodded, cuddling with her lover.* - Sun Oct 11 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Think I mind? - Sun Oct 11 06:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'm going to teach you some Taijutsu. - Sun Oct 11 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Why Taijutsu even though you both may be Elementalists or whatever? - Sun Oct 11 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Because close-combat is unavoidable. - Sun Oct 11 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: At some point in your life, even if it's not the next fight, you'll engage with someone in close combat. - Sun Oct 11 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Well, I guess anything is useful... - Sun Oct 11 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: So you'll need to know some basics. - Sun Oct 11 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: I hate Taijutsu. - Sun Oct 11 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'm going to teach you the Leaf Whirlwind. - Sun Oct 11 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: So damn much. - Sun Oct 11 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Leaf Whirlwind? What does that mean? - Sun Oct 11 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's in simplicity. - Sun Oct 11 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: A roundhouse kick towards the lower-end of your opponent, then followed by a higher kick. - Sun Oct 11 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's supposed to mimic a hurricane. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah, I've learned a bit of it before from something. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then I want you both to mimic me. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: First, observe. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Keep in mind that you don't want to reveal you're aiming for a second kick. - Mon Oct 12 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You force a good amount of pressure in the first kick to make them assume it was the kick you put all your power in. - Mon Oct 12 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And then you transition into your second kick. - Mon Oct 12 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) whispers: I have no idea, what he's talking about. - Mon Oct 12 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: You'll figure it out by watching--both of you are smart. - Mon Oct 12 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: At the same time, you can use this technique in the opposite fashion. - Mon Oct 12 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: By bringing it to the higher end first. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: The reason why I use the low kick first is because traditionally, the Leaf Whirlwind is common. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Therefore, you'll notice many people starting with the high kick. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It makes it too predictable. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: By starting with the supposed end movement and then transitioning into the supposed first movement, you trick your opponent. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: That's all there is to it. - Mon Oct 12 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Try both ways though, so that you get practice. - Mon Oct 12 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Understood. - Mon Oct 12 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright Sh-Zeus. - Mon Oct 12 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Shit, so close. - Mon Oct 12 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded at Shinjin, almost his name was blurrted out but she saved it herself! Thankfully, now it was time for some training to do. Hana wasn't really a Taijutsu specialist but there weren't many people around for her to be practicing a few kenjutsu techniques. But that would be for the future and on. Thus, training would start now. That technique didn't sound so cool but she didn't really care of what she did, as long as her techniques would help her into the future and so on. To protect herself and the people she cared about.

Now, first she took a few steps away from the kid.. just so he won't get hurt over a friendly fire or something. Hana started to kick the air a few times,to get a few practice in. 

--

Quickly she made a high kick followed by a low one, kicking off the dirt. <Come on, Hana. You got this. That technique is not so hard. Besides, Shinjin already did it.. so it didn't seem so hard to do." she nodded to herself with a thought. She squinted her eyes while he did the Whirlwind technique, trying to mimic him but somethin was telling her that it wasn't going to be just as perfect as his was. "Uhhh, alright..." 

She slowly started to do a second kick, forcing a really good amount of pressure into that kick, then going off with her second kick. The girl lost her balance, falling into her butt. Hana sighed cursing herself out before standing up to dust the sand off her butt, tying her hair tighter.

--

Hana couldn't let this kid beat her by him learning faster than she was!

"Hrn..." she quickly launched a low kick in sucession followed by many high kicks, as her body started to spin while a single hand on the ground. Thus creating a whirlwind as the technique was called. As she finished with the technique, Hana stood up straight but felt a little dizzy because of how fast she was spinning. "Ooooooh. All done...." Hana sighed placing a hand on her forehead, rubbing it a bit. "Mmhm."* - Mon Oct 12 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: That really does a number on your hand... - Mon Oct 12 00:24:19 2015
