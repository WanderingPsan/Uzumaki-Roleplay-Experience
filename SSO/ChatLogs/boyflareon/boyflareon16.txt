<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) eyes widened as she quickly moved Heiwa behind her, in a very protective mode. "You are not going to get him...." she said in a serious tone of voice, looking at Heiwa and then towards the Anbu Agent. "I cannot let leave him.... he's my responsibility to protect him." * - Fri Oct  9 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) was still in-front of Heiwa, he might have been just one little kid for some others but to Lyala he was like a son to her. "I can't... leave him." she turned around to look at the little kid, placing a hand over his cheek. "Why can't you do what you are going to do, with me here?" Lyala said turning her head towards the ANBU Agent, raising an eyebrow while holding Heiwa closer to her. * - Fri Oct  9 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) pushed Heiwa away towards the bed, as she quickly made a few handseals, but the attack was super fast, that it didn't give her enough time to react towards it. And her reflex game was too weak, thus getting hit by the attacks, she was sent flying backwards, her back hitting against the wall. "R-Run...!" yelled Lyala, making a few more handseals as water gashed out of her mouth, attempting to push the clones away from Heiwa an to smack against one another if possible to let Heiwa run away? * - Fri Oct  9 19:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "N-No... run... away......" she said trying to push him away but the girl couldn't even move her upper body. 

 All she wanted to do was to protect Heiwa.. that was her duty and she has failed to do so. It was one of the reasons of why she wanted to get stronger in the future, to protect her loved ones. Noticing Heiwa being sent towards the drawer, Lyala tried to get up but then felt the tanto being placed near her neck. If she moves... she'll die. "No......you cannot do this.....why are you doing this...?" * - Fri Oct  9 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | There was no way.. for her to do anythin to protect the child... that was all that she wanted to do.. to save him, so he could be here for the next generation in the future. But she has failed... failed him, failed the village, failed her own brother.. and most importantly.. Hideki. All she wanted to do was to help those she loved, help them become something in life...but that all failed because of herself.. it was all her fault. "I'm sorry, Hideki.....Heiwa.." 

Closing her eyes now... thinking of the future and how she wanted to have a family with Hideki, raising Heiwa as her own too, tears flowing down of her eyes to the ground, drip drop. 

But that all failed, due to her not being strong enough to protect Heiwa from someone whose probably weaker than Heiwa himself. Then suddenly....she felt the sword slicing Lyala's throat. It was an impact death, blood started to splash around like water, falling down on the ground.. she was dead. All of her fighting, hopefully Heiwa would manage to get away... * - Fri Oct  9 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | 
A lonely day in the destroyed village, she didn't even want to go there because-- well it was destroyed and almost no one was practically ever there. But that didn't matter to Hana, right? All she wanted to do was to actually train a little bit, and as far away as she could from the village. There were many villages that the girl would love to visit but instead of going out there and trying to get a death wish.. instead she stayed in Kono, for a little but away from the village. Just incase something else tried to happen within that village-- and she wanted to stay as far as possible.

Unsheating her katana, looking around the area, pretending to think that there were several enemies around her. A bit of target practice you might ask, not only that but she also needed to do somethin to get her out of this boredom.

"One......Two....."

Hana started to slowly count, taking a few steps towards the tree, quickly making a few slashes before hitting the treebark with the hilt of her katana. "HAH!" quickly, turning around she started to practice a bit more of her katana skills. If she wanted to get better at it, that is. Hana quickly ran towards the tree bark, kicking it with her left foot to push her body backwards, thus making a backflip, landing on the grass with a perfect pose. Quickly, the girl turned around to slash the air around her. * - Sat Oct 10 00:21:45 2015

"FUCKING BORED!!" she yelled quickly grabbing her sword and placing it back on its holster, fixing her battle bra a little bit, she walked back to Konohue. Hana fixed her jacket a little before spotting someone in-front of the village, by the gates. "Huh? Well, this is new..." making her way there, she stopped staring at the shinobi.. he did have a headband wrapped around his forehead afterall.

"Huh? Okay, first of all. I don't need you to tell me what to do. I'm from this village. Second of all, what are you even doing here and the village is all destroyed? How the hell are you going to actually stay in this village?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Really? -- I uhh... fine fine fine." 

She sighed looking down at her sandals, tying her ponytail up into a bun. If this was the type of thing that she had to do in-order to actually be strong enough to fight others..? Then so be it. But walking in water seemed... a little to weak to do, hell. Knowing Hana, she could learn anything very quickly! Hana walked towards the water, seeing her reflection before turning her head to look at Shinjin, sighing. "Fine."

Now, looking back at the water she concentrated on her chakra... attempting to put that chakra onto her feet. Now, slowly taking a few steps forward to the water... both of her feet sunk. "--- COME ON! You fucking... ugh...!" Hana placed a hand on her forehead, staring at the sky. "Calm down, calm down." now takin a few steps back...!

"I can do this. It's easy."* - Sat Oct 10 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) turning around to look at Shinjin, she rose an eyebrow, laughing to herself.

"Hahaha. Big strong boy, has a softie side huh? I know, I can do it. I'm a quick learner after all. Besides... I can do anything." she said, pretending to have hairflipped but her hair was sadly in a bun right now. Hana closed her eyes once again, concentrating on her chakra... onto her feet, if she could do it that is. If not, then fail! Now, walking again to the lake.. her feet sunk. But that didn't stop her from trying one more time, right?! Right! Taking a few steps back, she folded her arms across her chest, nodding to herself.

"Watch and learn. I can do this in one more try."* - Sat Oct 10 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Watch this, haha."

Hana nodded before, concentrating her chakra once again on-to her feet, now slowly making her way to the lake.. finally! She has succeded, standing over the water, Hana quickly turned around to look at her instructor. "See?! I told you, I can do it!!" she laughed to herself, clapping her hands but then--- she sunk. Thankfully the lake wasn't that deep, so quickly she got out of the water. 

"WOOH!"

Fixing her jacket a little bit, then untying her hair, revealing her long black ponytail she finally gave her attention to Shinjin. "So! I just have a question for you..... and be honest with me. I won't tell anyone. What's your name?"* - Sat Oct 10 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Well... - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: It's good to know others, right? So, starting with name sounds good. Right? - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I mean, I don't know. - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I suppose... - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Long as you don't tell anybody, I don't mind. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I don't like telling my name to people. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) puts her right hand up. "Scouts honor."* - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: It means, I won't tell no one. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: My name is Hana, I also don't like telling my name to people. Unless they beat me up in a ight. - Sat Oct 10 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You don't say my name and I won't say yours. - Sat Oct 10 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Deal? - Sat Oct 10 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) blinked back at him.

"Yup!" she nodded, extending her hand towards Shinjin as if sealing the deal. "Come on, dude, you have to shake the hand to seal the deal. No telling my name to people and I won't say yours. Mhm."* - Sat Oct 10 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Kids these days. - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Good! - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Does this seal the deal officially? - Sat Oct 10 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded, looking at their hands as they were still touching with one another, blushing a bit she quickly pulled away. 

"Yes, it does"* - Sat Oct 10 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: WOOH. Anyways, can we... get to training. - Sat Oct 10 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Princess...?" blushed slightly not ever being called that, but she just shrugged it off taking a few steps back. "Alright. -- wait, is that possible? I can actually imbue my weapons with electricity.. that would be so perfect!"  Hana giggled to herself clapping her hands once before listening to Shinjin giving off his instructions. "Oh?" taking a few steps backwards, as he slammed his hand on the ground.. electricity would now begin to flood the whole ground.. and going into the water.

Hana's eyes widened covering her face, as she sent a slap to Shinjin's back. But that was just because of her excitement, the slap wasn't hard or anything. More like a pat. "YO! That's so cool, Sensei." this was going to be a very good training! Especially when the guy didn't look so bad either. * - Sat Oct 10 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Your treatment? - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Anyways, that's what I'm going to teach you. How to use electricity. So. We're going to go onto step one.  - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ---- - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Nothing. - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'll be treating you the same way, just calling you Sensei. - Sat Oct 10 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Well..... - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: You know, teacher- instructor, and so on. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Then there's not much of a difference. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Do you act like this around everyone? - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Nope. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Which.. is weird actually. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm more of a bitchy attitude. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Sound more real this way, at least. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But I have no idea, why I don't have it with you. - Sat Oct 10 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Maybe it's because i have that..... - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Electrifying aura. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Step one? - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Right. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Put your index finger in the water. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And try to create a zap of electricity. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Lies. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What? - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I do not want to get electrified. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Just your index. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: ... - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sigh. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And make electricity. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I swear. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: If I die, I will come back somehow and haunt you forever. - Sat Oct 10 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded with a smirk. * - Sat Oct 10 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: --- - Sat Oct 10 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) sighed, crouching down to her knees looking at the lake. "Alright, fine..."
<Oh, god. I hope I don't get burned alive...>
Slowly, Hana reached for the water with her index finger, hesitating a bit but that didn't stop her from placing her index finger on the lake, closing her eyes to concentrate her lightning chakra.* - Sat Oct 10 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) concentrating hard enough, trying to let her lightning chakra out into the waters. That was till she felt the water turning into a more blue-ish color, thus sparks happening as it sent Hana flying backwards, crashing on-to Shinjin. "AH!!" she yelled turning her head to see Shinjin already being behind her. "Y-You knew about that....!" Hana blushed slightly, but from embarrassment. That was so not cool of him to do!

That joke though. * - Sat Oct 10 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) felt his hands on her waist, she blushed slightly to turn around looking at Shinjin, staring into his eyes with a very upset look... but then it turned into a small laugh. Crossing her arms over her chest, shaking her head, she spoke. 

"I am not gullible.. I just thought it was part of training, you know?! I almost died there!"

She rolled her eyes, her cheeks were still turning into a pink color and clearly exposed to the muscular guy. "That.. was not funny! But know what?" Hana squinted her eyes getting closer to Shinjin before patting his shoulder and leaning forward to whisper to him. "I'll get you back for that." 

And with that, she took a few steps away.

"Step two?!"* - Sat Oct 10 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: It's a bit harder, because you won't have the conductor to help you. - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: But you'll get it in no time. - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Fine, I can do that. - Sat Oct 10 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: --Oh, want me to do that now? - Sat Oct 10 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: What do I do, exactly? Just focus on my lightning element onto my fingers? - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Go ahead and try. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Fine. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: So. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Clasp your hands together. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And then slowly pull them out from one another. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: And try and create electricity between your fingers. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I can do that. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Pfffft. - Sat Oct 10 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded at Shinjin with a smile, actually acting pretty weird around him. It was the first time that she has been acting like that. Was it because of his looks? teachings? personality? The world will never know. Though, there was something about him that made her act differently, she even told him her name without asking for a challenge.. and by the looks of it...? He was going to win her anyways, via a fight.

"Alright..."

Concentrating on her chakra once again... Hana clasp her hands together! Thus, she slowly pulled them out from one another.. there could be a few sparks seen between her fingers, excitedly Hana spoke; "I'I'm doing it! I can't believe this, Sensei!"

But it dispersed quickly. 

Frown.
"What happened?"* - Sat Oct 10 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) sighed placing both of her hands on her hips, looking at Shinjin with a smile before tilting her head to the side. "I told you, I am a quick learner. I can do it----" even if she wanted to keep going.. he was right. Hana has lost half of her chakra and is already running a bit low. "Fine... we can take a break...." she rolled her eyes walking towards Shinjin and standing besides him. He looked like a huge tall guy next to her. "So, what do we do now?"* - Sat Oct 10 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: Little does she know, I don't mean actual fisticuffs. - Sat Oct 10 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) felt the arm wrapped around her waist, looking at Shinjin with her cheeks- once again turning pink. "Mmmmmm. Sure! I wouldn't mind having a spar." she nodded, noticing his grin before Hana poked his shoulder. "Think you could beat me up huh? And I am not a princess... I am the Queen." * - Sat Oct 10 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Yes, the Queen."

She nodded in a very proud way, that was till the tickle monster started to attack! Thus, making Hana laugh loudly while being pulled closer to his body. "Hahahahaha, stop itttt!" she laughed while her cheeks were turning even more pink, and also struggling to get out of his grasp for the spar to begin! "C-Come ooooon! This is not fair!" Hana reached for his own armpit to ticklet as well!* - Sat Oct 10 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) shook her head, continuing to laugh as she started to tickle him even more. "N-No!!! Hahaha. You cannot beat me on this!" IF this was their spar.. it was one that she was going to win! Hana started to tickle him faster before reaching for his waist with her other hand to tickle him, the double threat!* - Sat Oct 10 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) giggled smiling towards Shinjin. "Hah, so I wo-!" she was quickly brought up to Shinjin, falling on-top of him. They were pretty close too.. her face-- well her face was just pink as fuck. "I.... I....wow.." Hana was lost..he looked really good upclose but... Hana didn't know what to do but to just give him a smirk. 
"Yeah yeah. I'm very intelligent. Well, we should go now. And don't try anything... I'm not an easy girl."

She smirked biting her bottom lips before getting up from him, reaching her hand forward for Shinjin to grab on, just so she could help him up! * - Sat Oct 10 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Sure, we can.. I don't care. - Sat Oct 10 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Don't forget about me though. - Sat Oct 10 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Wanna go get something to eat or something? Or we can continue to finish our training. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I mean... I would like to train more, but I don't want to bore you. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Or anything-- besides, my chakra is running a bit low. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: -- I'm talking a lot. - Sat Oct 10 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Yeah, I won't forget about you. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: We could get something to eat, I guess. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What do you like to eat? - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Anything, I don't mind. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Ooooh! Have you tasted their steak? It's to die for. - Sat Oct 10 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Steak? - Sat Oct 10 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I haven't tried it. - Sat Oct 10 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: --- - Sat Oct 10 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) placed a hand on her chest, where the heart area is at. "I'm.. going to get a heart attack....." 

She quickly grabbed onto Shinjin's hand, interwining her fingers with Shinjin's as she dragged him along! To the restaurant they go! "COME ON!" This was real!* - Sat Oct 10 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) dragging him into the restaurant, she sat Shinjin down. "Hmph!" quickly turning around to go to the chef. Hana ordered two steaks, very cooked and juicy, one for herself and the other for Shinjin. "Thank you."

A few minutes later, the steak was ready-- finally going back to the table with both plates, placing one in-front of Shinjin and another in-front of her. Reaching for a fork and knife, placing it in-front of Shinjin as well. Now sitting down, in-front of him, Hana stared at Shinjin.. waiting for him to taste the wonderful flavor of steak. "Go on!"* - Sat Oct 10 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Yes! I want you to taste it, trust me.. you are going to love it...."

Looking at him cutting the steak with the fork and knife-- so slow that he do it. It was making her a bit impatient, but nevermind that! Now, he finally took a big bite out of the steak. Her eyes widened, leaning forward to see his reaction.... "Sooo...?"* - Sat Oct 10 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) took a bite out of her steak, raising an eyebrow. 'it was okay'.. that was all? Oh well, everyone has their opinions. Hana shrugged standing up from her sit and walking towards Shinjin, sitting besides him. "So, just a few questions.. if you don't mind me asking...? Why exactly do you want all those things you asked, Hideki to get you?"* - Sat Oct 10 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But aren't you.. like very strong or something? I mean... I'm sorry for what happened to your friends. - Sat Oct 10 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: But, that's not a bad idea to settle down. - Sat Oct 10 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: I'm strong, yes. - Sat Oct 10 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Doesn't really mean anything in the end. - Sat Oct 10 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Settling down is best for me. - Sat Oct 10 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) smile at Shinjin, being proud for the guy. Placing a hand on his shoulder, patting it twice she nodded. "Yeah. I'm pretty sure, you'll do it. I mean. .. you aren't bad looking.. so you'll find a girl soon. Also, with the house I have no idea."* - Sat Oct 10 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Hopefully, Hideki could help you find a few of those things, mhm. - Sat Oct 10 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: He'll find me a house, I'm sure. - Sat Oct 10 06:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: So, what do you want to do now? - Sat Oct 10 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: ...Netflix & Chill? -omit- - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: Anything, really. - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) rests her head on his shoulder. "Like?"* - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What do you want to do, Queen? - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I don't know, King. - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Want to go find the others? - Sat Oct 10 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Or we could go train some more? Really, anything you want, haha. - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Unless you want to have a tickle fighT! - Sat Oct 10 06:42:20 2015
