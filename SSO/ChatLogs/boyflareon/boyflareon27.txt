<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Alright. I got this, don't worry. I'm a prodigy, I can learn things super fast!~"

   Hana walked to the center of the area, concentrating on her lightning abilities before slowly crouching down to the ground, attempting to form a lightning circle around her. If possible that is, she wasn't that good yet with the whole lightning ability using. Hana closed her eyes while doing so, the circle started to slowly appear around her. Now, opening her eyes to view the circle, she looked at Shinjin hoping to see an approval nod.

As the nod was shown, Hana quickly stood up from the ground to jump while the circle was still around the girl. But as she did, the circle disappeared. "Damn it...." there was no way in hell that she was going to do that like her son did. But seeing as how Hana was a prodigy herself, she'll be able to learn it faster.. just how she did with the other skills. "Alright.. I got this.. one more time.... come on, Hana..."

  The redhead closed her eyes to focus on her lightning abilities before forming the circle around her once again. As it was formed, she stood up from the ground and quickly jumped into the air. But the circle wasn't active, it was still down. 

Landing on the ground, Hana sighed punching the circle a few times before slowly getting up from the ground. "I just need a few more practice and I will be good. I will be able to do it just how Takeda did!" she was getting frustrated though, indeed it was a very difficult technique to learn but she wasn't going to just give it all up!

Hana held his hand out, gathering her chakra into it and converting it into lightning. <You got this.. Hana...> once the lightning was formed, she quickly formed a ring of lightning. As so, Hana quickly jumped into the air, holding his hand out to surge more lightning through the ring.  She quickly tried to send the senbons down onto the ground but failed to do so.

"The circle is up.. and I did the right thing, why isn't it work...?"

  She shook her head, already getting pissed off because everytime she tried to do something that Shinjin wants to teach her, never works out..! But at-least the circle was still up and active. Hana closed her eyes, jumping up into the sky, holding her hand out to surge more lightning through the ring.

<Come on...!>

 As the ring started to refine the chakra down, it started to look like senbons. The senbons would quickly drop to the ground, digging themselves on it. Hana landed back down, but quickly fell on her butt. The senbons were pretty far down on the ground and it felt like an amazing technique to use against her opponents in the upcoming future but damn it.. it took a lot of her own chakra to use. "Gah... I feel like, I am all out of chakra..."* - Sun Oct 25 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oooooh right, I forgot I promised to call you Eiyu-sama in public. - Fri Dec 11 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Hmph. It hardly works now since everyone know's that you've said that.. But I guess I will have to endure the laughs until I find a better Moniker. Who's ready to learn...? - Fri Dec 11 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: Well, I should go now. - Fri Dec 11 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) thinks: I hope she does not mention anything that happened a few days ago. - Fri Dec 11 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) | "Tease-kun? That's funny..."
He started to laugh quietly but then quickly his face got back into serious mode. Noticing Menma doing the push-ups, that didn't look so good and besides Dahyun wasn't the physical training type. He didn't know how to do none of that. "No no. It's fine, you know? Like. I have some training to do on my own." Dahyun nodded as he took a front step, taking another and another. "What will the t-training be about?"* - Fri Dec 11 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: *? - Fri Dec 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) | "Chakra Control...?"

He ran his fingers through his dark black hair before taking a few steps towards the Raikage. "Well, fine, but only because I want to be able to walk on water."* - Fri Dec 11 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: About to train some technique! - Fri Dec 11 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Yo, which one of you guys stole my undergarments? - Fri Dec 11 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: Ew. - Fri Dec 11 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Someone broke into my house. - Fri Dec 11 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: And stole my undergarments. - Fri Dec 11 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Ya'll vilage. - Fri Dec 11 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: vile* - Fri Dec 11 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: . . . Go ahead and do it. - Fri Dec 11 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) | "Alright alright.... I'll get to it... sheesh. I mean, I don't know how to do it but I guess I can do it..." 

Dahyun turned around, staring at the mountain as he slowly closed his eyes to concentrate on the chakra that he had. He tried to move it towards his feet, just so he would be able to stick on-to the wall. "Alright. I got this." he took off the fan from its holster, placing it on the ground next to him. Turning around, Dahyun walked towards the mountain, placing a leg upon the mountain.

He tried to walk upwards but instead failed. It made the feminine male, fall on-to the ground. He got up quickly, fixing up his skirt. "Come on, Dahyun. You can do this." Dahyun looked at the others, rubbing the back of his neck as he smiled at them. "I got this!"

Dahyun nodded towards the Raikage, turning around once again as he ran towards the mountain attemping to do what the leader did but instead made the feminine shinobi fall on-to his back again. It pissed him up just a bit though, he didn't want to be here but the need of wanting to learn to walk on the mountain and water was a good skill -and- would help him in the future. "Hrrrrn. No, I have to do this." Dahyun walked towards the Raikage, closing his eyes as the blue colored chakra slowly moved on-to his feet.

Quickly, Dahyun ran forward to the mountain, left foot and right foot got stuck on-to the mountain. "I did it!" and with that, he slowly started to move upwards to the top of the mountain. He didn't want to look back or else, something bad will happen. "See? I knew I could do it. I can finally use my wind techniques from above..... " Dahyun's concentration soon broke, his body fell quickly to the ground, on his buttocks. "Ooooouch!" he stood up, rubbing his butt. 

"I did it! So, do I get money for doing it? I'm kind of hungry and don't have money to buy food."* - Fri Dec 11 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: Oooh! I love carrots, sure! - Fri Dec 11 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) walks next to Eiyu, smiling at him. "Where is this at?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: We'll go after I figure out what Haku needs. - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: It's pretty close. - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I believe that you owe Yu-ch- Yuriko something. - Fri Dec 11 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: ...? I'd rather she just tell me. - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Because I have no idea what you're talking about. - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Unless you mean the prisoners. - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: That is exactly what I mean. - Fri Dec 11 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: O--hm? Thank you, Eiyu-sama.~ - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No problem. - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) grabbed Eiyu by the arm, tugging him. "Come ooon, let's gooo!"* - Fri Dec 11 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Who is that? - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) says: Damn. Your chest though. - Fri Dec 11 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) | "Last time I ate......? Oh, that was like two days ago! Come on!"

He pulled Eiyu closer to the restaurant, letting him go before walking closer to the table. Dahyun sat down, raising a leg on-top of the other, looking around the room. No one seemed to be in the restaurant but he didn't care. All he wanted was to taste that carrot soup! Adjusting his glasses, Dahyun smiled at Eiyu as he stared into his eyes. 

"Alright. I promise, I will pay you back, alright? Like. I just have to work and stuff... and I'll pay you back!" he nodded with a smile, excited for the food to come.* - Fri Dec 11 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Ur S rank is to kill Sanoke. - Fri Dec 11 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) | "No no. I have to pay you back. I mean, we are like... brothers, right? Since we are both male, there are like brother codes right? So, we can buy each-others stuff. Right? Isn't that what boys do to each-other? Sorry, I barely have any friends or anything."

Dahyun shrugged, reaching for the spoon as he tasted the delicious soup. At first it did burn his tongue a bit but after that, the taste was wonderful and it felt nice to finally eat something like this. "Mmm! It's so good. Wow." he shook his head, as he tied his hair up into a ponytail so it won't get on the way. "Mmm." Dahyun  looked up at Eiyu, then towards Takuma. "Oh, hello! Special Jounin. I'm Dahyun."* - Fri Dec 11 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: I saw that. .  - Fri Dec 11 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: You ain't slick. - Fri Dec 11 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No idea what you're talking about... - Fri Dec 11 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) thinks: Spar a lower ranked shinobi. . . - Fri Dec 11 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) | "What? What did I say?"
<They always run or get surprised when I tell them that I am really a bo--->

And suddenly he was headbutted, the brute made the fragile male fall on-to his back with the soup falling on him. It burned his clothing and a bit of his skin. "AHHH!" yelled Dahyun, standing up from the ground as he tried his best to cool himself down. "Why did you do that?!"* - Fri Dec 11 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Hey Eiyu. Can we spar? - Fri Dec 11 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dahyun(BoyFlareon) 's eyes widened, feeling Eiyu's hands on his clothing and some of his skin. He blushed slightly but pushed the Raikage away from him, taking a few steps back. "No don't do that. And it's fine... I just thought that you guys knew that I was a boy. I didn't mean to cause any troubles or anything." Dahyun sniffled as if he was about to cry, fixing his glasses up a bit, he turned around and walked away from the restaurant. Unless stopped by someone.* - Fri Dec 11 03:37:10 2015
