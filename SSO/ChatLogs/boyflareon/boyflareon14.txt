<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) walked in-front of Hideki, though as soon as she got to the door she felt her ass being slapped. "Oh..!" Lyala turned her head around to look at Hideki, blushing a bit. That was the first time that has happened to her, so she just walked away while rubbing her ass cheek. That nigga had some manly ass strength.* - Tue Oct  6 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | "Alright, Hideki is sleeping and now I should go find somewhere to train... and where would that beeee?~" 

She quickly ran south of the village, heading to where the small little lake was, as she did back in the past. "OOOH! Good, no one is here... but wow.. I should really learn how to run faster... wow, I am out of breath...." a sigh of tiredness escaped her lips, placing a hand on the mountain while making her way closely into the lake, she stood there staring at the water and her reflection.

Maloth was her brother, he usually trained a lot, he got stronger than he usually was before. That was something that made Lyala want to be, strong like her oldest brother. An inspiration of some sort. "If Maloth can do it, so can I...." she nodded, running her fingers through her hair before taking a few steps back as she began to do a few handseals. As so, the kunoichi would slowly take a deepbreath before releasing a gash of water out of her mouth and into the ground as it slowly went up to the lake. "Come on, if I keep doing this... I can actually be better than my brother and all those people who thinks they are strong.... I have to do this." 

[1st RP]

As before Lyala looked down at her fingers, cracking them before making a few more handseals. The Kunoichi quickly took a deep breath to move her chakra into her stomach before releasing the same gash of water on-to the ground as it became a bit muddy. The ground that is. Lyala would take a few steps backwards, her back already against the wall.  

Lyala shook her head, turning around to look towards the mountain. She grabbed a few shurikens, quickly throwing it towards the mountain. Her main purpose was to try to hit the mountain with everything she had. If not that then she would try to do something else to take her out of time, because there was nothing else to do in this village. 

Now making her way to the mountain, grabbing on-to the shurikens that she threw. Grabbing one by one, Lyala placed the shurikens back on its holster before turning around to walk once again to lake, staring down at her reflection. "Mmmmmm......" now staring at the ground. 

[2nd]

Lyala rose an eyebrow, wondering what else she could train. Already trained her water technique, did a few target practice with her shruriken. Though, there was something else that she could do.... wanting to master the technique to actually go underneath ground, like she did so earlier on when fighting against Hideki. 

"Alright, so I did this before, I can do it again, sure I can."

She nodded to herself before quickly making a few handseals, suddenly she dugged herself underground with using both of her feet. Now underground, Lyala looked around laughing to herself, heading back to the square.* - Tue Oct  6 05:45:10 2015
