She said to herself to walk towards the lake where herself and Shinjin first started to train. Slowly, the girl clasped her hands tightly to seperate each of her hands apart of one another. A few sparks would be felt in-between her fingers, slowly her fingers went into the lake-- but she thought-- that maybe by doing what she did with Shinjin, him using his electricity inside the water without getting electrified, that was something that Hana wanted to do herself. "Almost there....."

But then, she stopped. There was something that made her want to not dip her fingers into the lake. The sparks of electricity slowly faded away, thus her training ending for now. "Damn it..."

Hana stood up straight before walking away from the lake and making her way to the manor. Wondering if the others were there after all. -- Oh and she had to train how to use her Kai jutsu. * - Tue Oct 13 00:10:14 2015

"Here you go, Shinji-ZEus. And I am so proud of you!"

she nodded kissing his cheek before opening the scrolls. "Mmm. What should we start writing?"* - Tue Oct 13 00:28:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) tied her hair up into a bun, before reaching for his pants to slowly massage his member, starting slowly first.* - Tue Oct 13 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) continued massaging his member before slowly pulling a bit of his pants down to expose the flaccid member, she reached out for his balls to massage it first before leaning forward on her chair, kissing the tip while pulling the skin back a little.
<Oh, how was your day, Hana? How is training? None of that, but I'll give him what he wants then. > Hana thought while she, licking around the crown.* - Tue Oct 13 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) blushed slightly by the sight of his massive cock slowly going harder,  leaning forward to give his member a kiss at the tip, slowly opening her mouth as the crown went inside of it, closing her mouth just to feel his crown, licking the crown with her tongue before slowly inch by inch, her lips went deeper into his cock. It made her gag a little because of how huge it was, even when it was slowly growing from its flaccid stage. It was also Hana's frst time doing this to Shinjin.

She looked up to see his reaction, her hand cupping his balls, slowly massaging his balls by the second. Slowly, his cock slipped out of her mouth 'pop' sound could be heard before spitting on it, wrapping her fingers around the shaft jerking it off a little. Opening her mouth as it wrapped around the crown, slowly going deeper into his hard member as it was growing-- expanding inside of her, thus making her gag a bit more with some of her saliva dripping. 

Taking his member out of her mouth, grabbing it with both of her hands to slap it across her face, licking the shaft. * - Tue Oct 13 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Rose an eyebrow to slowly sliding her mouth out of his cock, looking up at Shinjin. "What do you mean.. you wish you could stay with me forever? Were you planning to leave me or something?" Hana stopped getting a bit serious, but was still massaging his balls slowly. * - Tue Oct 13 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "I understand.. that you are a Hokage.... but that doesn't mean that you need to leave me or whatever.....I mean isn't this why I became your assistant for us to work together...? " It did devistated Hana a bit, because she didn't want to loose the guy that she had fallen in love with....what if he did leave her? Well, that didn't matter now. 

That ruined the mood, but wanting to make Shinjin feel nice, she just went back to what she was doing. Opening her mouth slowly , her tongue extending out to lick around cock's crown, flicking it with her tongue before bobbing her head faster, while his balls were being massaged in a faster pace.

At the same time, she kept spitting on his cock before taking it all in, deepthroating with a few gags and some of her spit falling on-to the bed. Taking his cock out, gasping for her, she licked the side of the shaft, and sucked on just the tip to taste his pre-cum.* - Tue Oct 13 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) reached out her tongue, and lapped around the base as she bobbed up and down just a little, keeping it nearly always all the way in. Taking off his cock from her mouth, hearing to his words made her blush a little but... damn it, it did feel like he was just using her for his own pleasures. Hana does love him-- and she does like his cock, hell yeah she does. But.. she was committed to him, kage or not. "I love you so much....." Hana whimpered before leaning her head slowly, kissing the tip, so very gently.

She kept her lips planted on it as he bucked his hips faster to cum inside of her mouth-- some of it going to her face too. Hana pushed her mouth down firmly again, taking it all the way in once again to swallow all of his cum shot inside of her. 

Releasing his cock from her mouth, she looked at the tip, kissing the tip before licking it and slurping it as if wanting to take the last cum out. Hana's fingers went to her face to clean herself up before licking her fingers that were filled with cum. "Did you even work?" her head tilted to the side, asking him before pulling his pants back up and taking off her jacket to sit back down on the ground, licking her lips. Her swallowing skills got better though!* - Tue Oct 13 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded leaning her back against the chair, raising a leg-ontop of the other, fixing her bra a little since she was wearing a cropped shirt. "Alright, honey. If you need any help, you could tell me." Hana said patting the Hokage's back. "Also.... I.. uhhh. Well.... I just want you to know that I will always be by your side.... and I won't leave you, Shinjin. Unless, I bore you or something and you end up with someone else buuuut I'll be here for you. Anyways, how is the letters going?" 

She laid her chin on his shoulder, extending her tongue to lick his ear lobe, playfully. * - Tue Oct 13 01:14:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Finally something to do, a mission! Hopefully, Shinjin would give her a reward as well because if they need this to escort the villager to Kiri. It would need to be a rewarded mission for Hana. As the two shinobi finally arrived to the escort target, they all exchanged names and greeted each-other as it was finally time to do the escorting mission. "Just, stay close to us, alright?" Hana told Tenryuu before turning around to give a nod to Takeda. "Yes, let's go."* - Wed Oct 14 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Huh, good plan, boss."

 Seeing as how Takeda was the leader of this little mission that they had. It was a good plan as-well for the citizen to be in the middle of the two, just in-case a few bandits try to attack them. "Alright. Let's get this show on the road." nodded the girl before the trio walked away to Kiri, her sword behind her, just in-case she were to use it while they were on their journey.* - Wed Oct 14 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | Of-course Hana didn't really go that far, she did posses a really good type of speed but that didn't matter. Yeah, Hana and Tenryu were at the back talking about a few things, and about him wanting to open up his own miso ramen soup business through out the villages. "Oh? That sounds really good right now." she sighed shakign her head before turning her head to look at Takeda, with a nod. "Yesss. We are doing fine, don't worry, kid.~"* - Wed Oct 14 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Soo, how close are we to get there?" 

Hana asked, raising an eyebrow to look at Takeda, as herself and Tenryuu walked a little far behind the kid. "Come on." she said quickly running behind Takeda with Tenryu, hopefully they wouldn't be so far apart from one another. "Tututu. Oh, so how have you been training, Takeda? Look. I know you may not like me as a friend or whatever. But, you know.. if you need a friend to talk too I am here. Just so you'll know. Not treating you like a kid or anything, buddy."* - Wed Oct 14 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) rose an eyebrow, as she was about to walk out of the field but noticed Ketsuki ready for the training lesson. "Oh! Alright. I see you girl, ready and everything..." Hana giggled to herself, raising an eyebrow before taking a few steps back, taking out her katana. "Alright. This will be a bit... interesting since I never actually taught someone."* - Wed Oct 14 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded her head with a smile. "Ohhh and don't call me teacher.. it is a bit weird..... and make sure that you hold it tightly from the tilt, you know?"* - Wed Oct 14 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) nodded her head. "Yeah! Good job, girl. Don't worry, you'll get this." she smiled at Ketsuki before slowly moving her sword side to side. "Side to side, let's start by going slow, mkay?" Hana would then swing her sword from side to side once again. "Now, just swinging it. But please make sure to keep the tilt tight, alright? I don't want you to hurt yourself, or me." she giggled before looking at Ketsuki with a nod, twirling the katana on her hand and then impaling it on the ground, leaning on it. 

"Got it?"* - Wed Oct 14 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Good! You are doing a good job!" 

She nodded to herself before, picking up her katana and motioning for Ketsuki to come and attack her. "Come on.. let's have a little spar.~"* - Wed Oct 14 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) quickly moved out of the way, and speeded behind Ketsuki, tapping her with her hilt. Hana shook her head, turning the girl around before leaning forward to squint her eyes at her. "Listen, you cannot... concentrate on trying to defeat me. You have to form in one with yourself and that sword. How? Becoming you and the sword, bond with hit. Silly, right?" the Kenjutsu specialist turned around, fixing her bra a little since her twins were huge.

Turning back around to look at the girl, she nodded, tilting her head to the side. "Come on, girl. Remember, don't try to look cool or wanting to defeat me. Move that sword... you can do it!"* - Wed Oct 14 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) (*Ketsuki nods at that, grinning as she pulls the Tanto back at the offer.

"Hai! Coming right atcha, Senpai!" She says brightly, before stepping forwards. She plants her right foot down, then slides her left forwards with her body to put more force into her strike- a stabbing thrust straight for the gut as she lunges straight forwards.

She's grinning wide as she throws the sloppy blow..*)* - Wed Oct 14 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "You know....instead of hurting me, try to act like the sword? Like this." 

 Hana noticed the girl taking some action as she quickly moved out of the way, by swaying her self and turning around to smack Ketsuki's back with just the flat end of the sword. "It's pretty easy you know. Maybe, you should work more on a few things. Swinging the sword at the right moment, your uhh.. speed needs to be more faster and you gotta swing that sword faster, girl. Oh! And pleaseeee!" she walked towards Ketsuki, helping her with the tilt so she can hold it the correct way. 

"Swing, side to side.. side.. to side... now, I should be going because I need some rest. You'll be fine?"* - Wed Oct 14 04:59:56 2015
