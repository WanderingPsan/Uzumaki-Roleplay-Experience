<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) ruffles his hair.* - Sun Oct  4 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | It was a silent day in the village, nothing to do and there wasn't really many people around the village. That was boring, Lyala wanted to go back to Konohue but she thought that it wasn't the safest place right now in the moment. "Well, I guess I could train a bit of my jutsus. That wouldn't be so bad to do anyways." Lyala yawned a bit, stretching her arms and legs before walking to the small lake that resided on the edge of the village. 

"Alright..."

Now quickly weaving the handseals, she slowly took a deep breath and released the water from her mouth that fell on-to the the lake. As it splashed on the lake, making some of the water go everywhere. It even got Lyala's hair a bit soaked up. "Well damn..." she rolled her eyes, cracking her knuckles once again to think of a way to do this. Lyala ran her fingers through her soaked part of her hair, ruffling a bit more as she quickly tied her hair up into a ponytail just so nothing would actually go to her hair because Lyala didn't really want her hair all wet. It wasn't going to happen regardless, duh.

* - Sun Oct  4 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) bit her bottom lips softly, weaving the handseals once again before taking a deepbreath as the water shot out of her mouth and into the lake as before. But quickly backed away so the splashed water wouldn't really hit her. Now getting closer to the Lake, she simply sat there with her feet dipped onto the water. "I could keep practicing but for now, I should relax for a little bit more and perhaps till I stop being lazy....sigh. Oh--nevermind."

The girl quickly stood back up, turning around to walk away and find something else to do. The training would have to wait for a bit more later. Unless, she feels like sparring with soemone... that would do her good if she wanted to learn how to be a taijutsu user as well. And now she was hungry, Layala skipped over to the restaurant that was the closest to her, yawning a bit. "Mmmm... what should I get to eat...." * - Sun Oct  4 19:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) just stood there staring into his eyes, squinting her eyes for a bit before taking a few steps back. He was seriously having something up his sleeve.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) eyes widened to see him doing a handsign, his raiton chakra going through the watergun technique. She had no idea how to dodge it or anything, so instead Lyala made a few handseals, quickly as she dug through it like a mole, avoiding the attack. Thus moving underground and appearing behind Hideki. "That was a close on..."* - Tue Oct  6 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) | It was surprisingly that Hideki actually knew how to use Ninjutsu, seeing as how he was always with a sword and fight with his hands. Though, that didn't stop the red eyes guy to show off his skills. But that also meant that Lyala would have to show him what she can do, just because they are dating Lyala wanted to show her boyfriend that she could protect herself in other cases. Noticing the fireball jutsu, as soon as she was about to do the handseals... it wasn't exactly directed to her but to the area to create a smoke screen.

"If that's how you want to play it..."

Lyala quickly made a few handseals as she took a deep breath in to launch the sticky syrup around her. Circling her just in-case Hideki wanted to be a ninja and attack her from a side. The area around her was filled with the water syrup technique, touch it? You get stuck. Though, she was impressed of this technique he just used.* - Tue Oct  6 00:20:03 2015
