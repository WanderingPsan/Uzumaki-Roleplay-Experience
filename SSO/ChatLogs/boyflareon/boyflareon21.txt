<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't really feel like doing this, you guys don't need me. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I've actually got something of a solid plan brewing, and you're a big part of it! - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Nonsense. We're going against the Kage- we'll need every bit of teamwork and help we can get. - Thu Oct 15 23:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Simple. - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You're suppose to be a team player. - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I'd rather just train alone... - Thu Oct 15 23:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Trust me, okay? - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: ... - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Anyways. Before we talk any further, lets go outside. - Thu Oct 15 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: We got this, Takeda. - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright? - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I'm by your side, come on. - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ...Fine. - Thu Oct 15 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Basically, you two restrict his movement and keep him focused on you as best you can, while I and Hana run for the bells. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I agree, that is quite a simple plan and probably the most logical. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: That's my student, good job girl. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: However, Hokage-sama is much more skilled than me in every way, you will have to remember that. - Thu Oct 15 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. Of course- he's much more silled than anyone here.. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I can't guarantee that I'll be able to hold his attention just on me. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But the idea isn't so much to be winning a fight, as to stall and restrict his movement as much as possible. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: He'll most likely figure out our strategy quickly. - Thu Oct 15 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Simple plans are the best, because you limit the number of factors that can go wrong, and leave things open to adaptation. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We'll just have to adapt as we go, based on how he reacts. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm propably the weak link here, and the weakest of us in terms of raw strength and ability. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Also. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I have seen him fight. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I have spar'd him the other day. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He bust his head wide open. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: The man can throw a hook faster than I can throw a straight. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: But... - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We have our mission, our objective. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Who will be the runner, again? - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hana and myself will run. - Thu Oct 15 23:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: He uses lightning by the way. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: And is incredibly fast. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hana's the fastest of us, and I'm just.. not much good for anything else in this situation. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: I believe that Takeda and I should follow near either of you, a buffer zone so that he can't just run to the side infront of either of you. - Thu Oct 15 23:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: It'll be easier than just jumping onto him, and him just reaching one of you two. - Thu Oct 15 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right... so one of you matched to each runner, then..? - Thu Oct 15 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm.. I can see a lot going wrong here, but.. I guess we'll have to give it our best. - Thu Oct 15 23:53:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Don't be afraid to offer any ideas of your own. - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Let's just wing it. - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Well. - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Takeda, any thoughts? - Thu Oct 15 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Not many, he had the experience, strength and tactical advantage over us. - Thu Oct 15 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can't use doton in there. - Thu Oct 15 23:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Don't be afraid of messing the place up a bit, as for fire though. I believe its best you avoid burning the entire building down. - Thu Oct 15 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: You'll have to protect yourself, you know. - Thu Oct 15 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: To make things easier on the runners, Takeda you should follow up on Hana as her buffer zone while I buffer Ketsuki. - Thu Oct 15 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: Remember, we can't be knocked out or we fail the mission. If you begin to feel overwhelmed, we should group back up. - Thu Oct 15 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: Okay, break! Let's go. - Thu Oct 15 23:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) didn't really do any handseals or anything, all she did was just play along. 

 It wasn't the time to be doing that but whatever. Hana squinted her eyes to look at Zeus, making the same handseals of the technique of him showing her back in the past where he was teacher her a few tricks. "Oh...." she quickly shook her head before running towards the stairs, completely avoiding the jutsu. Hana was that quick too, clearly as she got to the top the redhead quickly looked around for the bells. Perhaps, the plan was for them to get Zeus distracted for her to get the bells? She was the fastest out of all of em. 

<Damn it... if only I knew some lightning techniques. I really have to tell Shinjin to teach me, and fast.>

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She uses her brain well. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: She knows that metal conducts electricity. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: However, that doesn't compensate for the force and pressure that is added onto these electric constructs. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) thinks: It'll absorb a couple and be blown away from excess force. - Fri Oct 16 01:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: If only I was faster... and could throw more of these... Tch. - Fri Oct 16 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) thinks: Damn, Shinjin looks so good from behind. - Fri Oct 16 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Okay, just.. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Stay out of Ambro-Sensei's line of sight, now. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) thinks: Just stay /out of his fucking way/.. - Fri Oct 16 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | "Oh... huh, seems like Zeus isn't going to attack us.... okay.. ummm..." 

 Hana ran her fingers through her crimson hair before quickly tying it up into a ponytail and turning her head to see Takeda. "Okay.... I'll get that bell down there.. and you quickly go for the other, ka-- you know. You are small, hide between the walls, try to be sneaky or something. I'll help the others with Shin-Zeus. Zeus, I mean, Zeus." shook her head, almost -almost- saying the name once again. Good thing, Shinjin didn't hear her saying his name out-loud or else that would've been bad.

  <One.. two.. three.>

The redhead quickly ran down the stairs and towards the bell, sliding on the ground to grab the bell, hiding it at her back pocket. She was going to put it somewhere else but that wouldn't be very.. smart. Don't think negative!! --This was going to be a stupid idea, but why not? Hana looked at the other bell, squinting her eyes before turning her head to give Takeda a nod.  
  
   <Come on, kid. Use your skills..." she thought. * - Fri Oct 16 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) | <Come on, Takeda..... sigh, he must be sleeping or something.> 

  Hana stood up straight, walking towards the other bell but was shieled off by Shinjin. <Damn it...> and quickly, the redhead was placed into a Genjutsu but she didn't know that because of the lack of intell mind perks and shit. Then suddenly, a lot of Shinjin started to appear out of nowhere. Thankfully, good thing that she saw him running towards the other bell or else these clones would've confused the shit out of her. But her main focus wasn't Shinjin himself... Hana already knew where the other bell was at but how exactly was she suppose to get it, now that Hulk here is all over Shinjin trying to fight him. <DAMN IT! I said to control your damn anger...!>

   <Think....Think....> 

A light bulb appeared over her head, as an idea popped up. <Bingo.> Hana quickly ran towards  the wall that was behind Shinjin, walking on the wall, as she sped towards the bell and if successful running the fuck away from the fight. * - Fri Oct 16 02:00:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) was to quick for that shit. "OOP." she stood quiet looking at Ambrocio with the bell on her hand. "Just one more and we are good!" Hana nodded to herself, placing the bell on her back pocket before taking a few steps back. * - Fri Oct 16 02:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) opened her eyes slowly, standing up slowly to fix her top a little before her eyes gazing towards Shinjin. "YOU!! Why did you have to do that?!" Hana shook her head, stretching a bit, rubbing the back of her head before her eyes widened. "Wait, did we win?! Yes, we won." her eyes went to Shinjin now, smirking. "Thought, we wasn't going to win, Master?"* - Fri Oct 16 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sorry, Hana-Senpai- but no. - Fri Oct 16 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Uhm... You? - Fri Oct 16 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) pouted, kicking the ground all cutely. "You should've never have done that, Zeus." her eyes went to Zeus, glaring him with such anger! 

  It was payback time, soon enough.* - Fri Oct 16 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Heh... He did say he wasn't going to hold back, you know, Senpai. - Fri Oct 16 02:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) eyes widened to see him all up on her breast and then on Ketsuki's breast, feeling the electricity running through her body but it didn't really cause her to do anything but to stare at him angry, pushing his hand away. Okay, maybe she pissed on herself a little but that was it. Hana is kind of used to that technique anyway.* - Fri Oct 16 03:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) stared at Shinjin as he left, obviously pretty pissed the fuck off but decided not to say anything and just let him walk away. "You go ahead and do that mission." Hana nodded before fixing her bra up a bit, and walking away. "Come on, Ketsuki." said the redhead to her student, her tone of voice changed to happy, all the way down to her being angry. 

 And she got all sexy for her man, but he ain't noticed that. It's aight. Hana is going to get him later on. * - Fri Oct 16 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) was obviously thinking about Shinjin, so she didn't really pay attention to the question that Ketsuki asked. She sighed running her fingers through her red hair before slowly laying her head on the table. "Gah. I wanna just go home and sleep right now."* - Fri Oct 16 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) sighed  standing up from the chair to look at the ramen miso being delivered. But slowly took a sit back down. "Maybe when I finish eating, I'll go..." Hana nodded to herself, grabbing the two chopsticks and beginning to eat her food. If anything, this delicious meal was keeping her from thinking about Shinjin so much. * - Fri Oct 16 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hana(BoyFlareon) had finished her noodles, placing the yen ontop of the table before nodding at Ketsuki. "I'll see you for our training later on. I just need to rest a little and just relax for a bit. Oh and make sure to train on that sword holding. We will have a spar with em later." the teacher spoke to her student before turning to look at Hiro. "It's nice to meet you." she nodded, now walking away from the two restaurant and heading back to her house. * - Fri Oct 16 04:29:13 2015
