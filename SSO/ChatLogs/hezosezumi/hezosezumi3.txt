<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) moved forward with no emotion in her voice, nor her face. She'd simply raise a fist and aimed to ram it into akira's stomach.* - Sun Nov 29 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) stared down at him as he spilled out blood, she'd walk towards him, reaching down and putting her finger into the blood, before raising it up and sucking it off of her finger. She'd let out a semi-enjoyable look on her face, grabbing his head and lifting him up to her level.

"You are weak."* - Sun Nov 29 02:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) took the male down into the basement, setting him next to ichiro's body as she'd get a chair, putting it down before putting him in it. She'd wrap his arms and legs to the chair (kaneki style if you've watched tokyo ghoul) She'd then make sure he was secure as she'd remove his headband and clothing, down to his underwear.* - Sun Nov 29 02:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) shook her head, heading upstairs as she fumbled in the kitchen before walking back downstairs with a set of pliers. She'd move them around some before getting used to them. She walked up to him and looked at him.

"Would you like your mouth to be filled up, or do you prefer to let your voice be heard?"* - Sun Nov 29 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I see. - Sun Nov 29 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) got out a blindfold as she'd wrap it around akira's head, blinding me, it'd be noted if he was a sensor, he'd feel pretty much 0 chakra coming from her body.

She'd then open the plyers as she'd set one up to one of his fingernails, before squeezing it tightly as she'd rip his fingernail off slowly and painfully.* - Sun Nov 29 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: Master asteroth will like my new playtoy. - Sun Nov 29 02:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I've learned some things after watching the villagers of different villages. - Sun Nov 29 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: You all have loved ones, you shinobi. - Sun Nov 29 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Me..? - Sun Nov 29 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 29 03:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just you and me... - Sun Nov 29 03:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You'll die...like the whore you are... - Sun Nov 29 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) would've taken the pliers once more, ripping one more nail off slowly and painfully, and then the other one off..Of course, hearing his comment, she'd let out a giggle.

She'd slowly poke his eye on the blindfold, "Which one should I eat first...Hm..I think I will have the left one first." She'd nod to herself before trailing her finger down to his genetalia, "I have heard this is also a vital point of the living, I wonder what will happen if it is removed..." She'd continue trailing around his body, before moving to his other hand, putting the pliers on his thumb, before ripping off the nail.* - Sun Nov 29 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Ohh.. - Sun Nov 29 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) put her finger under the blindfold as she swiped off some of his tears, licking it gently, "Salty.." She'd say with a grin, she was enjoying herself, she could find plenty of prey..She didn't know why..But she seemed to extremely enjoy this..She had been told she had a past life..Maybe she was like this back then? Who knew..She sure didn't.

She'd trail to his other hand, ripping off every fingernail slowly and painfully. She'd then walk off for a moment, before walking towards him once again, this time she'd have have a cheese grader, or whatever..She'd use that later.

She'd now sit on her butt, moving her pliers to each of his toes as she'd continue to rip one toenail off after the other, everytime he'd let out a scream, she'd just giggle to herself, the ghoul was enjoying herself.

"Maybe I'll rip off one of your fingers and have a taste soon."* - Sun Nov 29 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Hm? - Sun Nov 29 03:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Am I not giving you the pleasure of pain? - Sun Nov 29 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh no...I was...j-just looking...for a little more... - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: For water. - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: You shinobi drink water. - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Correct? - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Heh, yeah. - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I shall get you some. - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sake might be nice too... - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: No. - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Water. - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) gets up and walks upstairs, opening the door as she'd pour him a glass of water, before walking back downstairs.

She'd touch his chin, "Open up." If he did, she'd pour down the water.* - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) made sure to go slow, as she didn't want him dying yet.* - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) would've moved the glass away, setting it down away from akira.

"Hm...Which hand do you like more."* - Sun Nov 29 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Depends...which hand does the job better for you..? - Sun Nov 29 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Either. - Sun Nov 29 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Pick or I get both. - Sun Nov 29 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Sun Nov 29 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Probably my right. - Sun Nov 29 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That one just got fixed. - Sun Nov 29 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) looked over at his right hand, reaching into her pocket she'd pull out a butcher's knife, she'd reach over to grab his pointer finger before chopping it off with the knife, straight through the bone, she'd toss the knife away before putting bandages on the part that had been cut off, all better now. She'd then remove his blind-fold as he was probably screaming bloody murder. Only to let him watch her devour his finger, chewing it up before swallowing.

"Now then..when you're done screaming, we can decide which eye you like more."* - Sun Nov 29 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Awe.. - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Can my playtoy not function anymore? - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I'll just have one more bite, then I'll end your pain. - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) would've held him still in the chair, putting her leg onto his pelvis as she'd grab his head with both hands, opening up his left eye with her fingers, not letting him shut it, "This is going to be tasty.." She'd say with a giggle..

She'd open her mouth widely as she'd slide her tongue right under his eye, not caring for his screaming, she'd make sure to get a good hold of it before she'd try to pull his eyes out a little. Once she got it out enough, she'd attempt to wrap her mouth around it, suckling on it for a moment before biting it off of the cord that kept it into his head, she'd munch on it as she watched him probably scream and have a panic attack, she was wondering if he'd die from the shock.

"Don't die yet.." She'd say..She didn't wanna find a new playtoy.* - Sun Nov 29 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: Mmm...Juicy... - Sun Nov 29 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) sighed, it looked like play time was over..

"I wanted to have tons of fun with you, but I guess you're just a bore.."

She'd grab his chin, before rushing forward as she'd aim to bite into his throat, biting his adam's apple before ripping it out, sucking the blood out of his exposed throat, as well as ripping any of his meat around there to, the chair falling backwards as she did this, but she didn't care..She'd continue her feast on his body.* - Sun Nov 29 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Mmm.. - Sun Nov 29 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Already over.. - Sun Nov 29 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: A shame. - Sun Nov 29 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) continued to munch on his throat before getting up, she'd then leave his body laying there, she'd go and wash her clothes off, licking the blood of off her, "I'll eat the rest later."* - Sun Nov 29 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) stood there, staring at everyone.* - Sun Nov 29 04:27:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) would've just been walking towards the gate boredly. She'd look up as she'd see a fun gigantic water dragon, nothing out of the ordinary.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) would've quickly moved away from the liquid shot from anguo's mouth, apparently they wanted to fight her? Stupid Stupid shinobi..She'd stare up at the dragon as it seemed to be coming towards her.

She'd be on the move with no emotion shown on her face, master would be disappointed in her if she were to fall here...Plus, a total of several shinobi attacking her at once? Of course they had no class....Shinobi were disgusting.

Baylea would've been caught and bit..She'd be bit into two, but of course..before this, she'd of leap up and changed her pattern, so that her legs were bit off, leaving her falling onto the ground with her upperbody..This was going to be a fun fight..Maybe she'd find a new playmate?

She'd swing out her katana as she'd grab the ground tightly, sitting on her cut-in-half stump body, she'd stare up at the dragon as her cloak slid off, revealing her nude body, but she gave zero fucks about that. She'd grin up at kana and the water dragon, blood just surroudning her, but as before, zero fucks are literally given as she's saying on spot.

"If you shinobi weren't so weak..you'd fight me down here.." She'd said, as she waited for their next move, the female probably wouldn't been stronger but her master decided it was better to upgrade herself first, before trying to make baylea stronger.* - Sun Nov 29 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Is she getting upset, because she isn't strong enough to take us on? - Sun Nov 29 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: But I don't think I'll be able to.. - Sun Nov 29 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: Well..this is weird.. - Sun Nov 29 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) would've stayed stuck as the female knew she was going to die again, her memories of her old life were gone..So her knew ones currently collided in her head as she stared up at the gang of shinobi..Despicable, every last one of them..She wanted to have a nice fun one vs one, and then devour them all..Maybe chew on a few eyeballs? She'd also wanted to see what would happen when you remove the genetalia of a shinobi..She remember how akira was practically begging for death when she had her fun time with him.

She'd look around the area as she was stuck, immobile even if she got out of the liquid..She'd grip her newly-found katana tightly, this wasn't going to help at all. She'd thrust her arm back before thrusting it forward towards kana as she made the handseals, aiming to stab her through the chest or something. 

As the girl did this, her sate was already sealed...She'd do the last thing that came to mind, the only "natural" thing she ever felt..

She'd begin an insane fucking laugh, taunting the shinobi.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) would've been shot by the fireball as her hair burned off for the most part along with most of her skin, her bones and muscles being shown as they'd already begin regenerate as the wires wrapped around her head, only to snap the moment he tried to squeeze, The woman's body was toast for the most part, but kept regenerating the wounds as she'd continue her insane laughter. She'd stare up at the water dragon as it came down towards her.

"ROT IN HELL." The ghoul shouted out, as she had been there, being a satanaist before death. She'd be crushed by the water dragon as her body imploded on itself, similar to how maloth killed her. Her skin suddenly dispersed into pieces as her organs were crushed to a palm, by the end of the attack, all that laid there was the hilt of a broken katana, the female's head still seemed intact though, amazingly..Half of it was crushed as her brain was dripping out of the side, she had a smirk on her face as she looked up at kana, the female already gone.* - Sun Nov 29 21:46:52 2015
