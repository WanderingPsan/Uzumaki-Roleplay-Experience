<br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) calmly reaches into the confines of his satchel, the earthly aromas were acrid, but its composition suggested it was entirely organic. There was a burning kettle at his side - he pours the water into the cup allowing tendrils of smoke to swirl around the brim. The contents of the tea were added in as well. He blows softly and tests the heat by placing his lips against the cup. 

*Sip*...
"..."
He seemed to be in his own world for the time being and what's more he didn't even seem to be enjoying the drink it was more tradition than anything. When he was done drinking he'd simply continue to look ahead with a vacant look on his face.* - Mon Sep 07 17:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) chuckles internally, he didnt really expect for his challenge to be answered. That and he didn't really want a full on battle he simply wanted to see what the others would say. Perhaps he wasn't a conventional man in the fact he didn't go around with an air of benevolence. His aura was perfectly readable from the start, warm but intense. He tooks his mocha colored hand and brushes the dirt that was starting to stain his robe.
"I see..." He mutters before stepping away.* - Tue Sep 08 15:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) "So be it..." Nozumi sits into a corner and begins to speak in a weird and cryptic tongue. "Aria mou dósei dýnami..... Aria mou dósei dýnami...." He could feel his soul recharge itself, his tired muscles once more filled with vitality. "...Amen..."* - Tue Sep 08 15:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) raises his hands into the skies and his chakra reacts in a weird manner. The suns rays react with the epithelial tissue within his being. The consturct hardens several times over, his ebony skin is now glistening with power. He takes his first step forward with his flowing mane at his shoulders.
"Well, then...."
"Shall we begin?"* - Tue Sep 08 18:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) gets flat out ohkoed by the technique because he was forced to drop the technique due to the lack of chakra.* - Tue Sep 08 18:44:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) <What...?> Nozumi's entire form seemed to fade into the mist, and with the obscurity came peril. He could not see inside of the thick mist, nor did he care to. However, he had the unique talent of becoming one with the element he was currently surrounded in. 
His voice comes off a bit distant, almost as if he was several feet away when he was not. "What are you doing?"* - Sat Sep 19 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) thinks: Cant see.. - Sat Sep 19 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) "I am here.." He stands firm in the midst of the mist, his form practically invisible to the human eye. He saunters a bit further upstream, his massive legs crashing into the wooden bulkheads, with lits his arms into the air to signal his presence, but in reality he had totally become with a mist. "Nozumi."* - Sat Sep 19 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nozumi(Anonymous guillotine) was quite frankly annoyed by the woman's continued questions. He didn't think that his form was truly invisible, ironically his form required the sun, or at least to call upon the blessing of his father, Luckily, he had stored enough solar energy within his cells to increase the structure of his skin, hardening to a immense degree. Slowly, he makes his way west, hopefully not being attacked as a result.* - Sat Sep 19 00:51:50 2015

I live it through my pores, and through my being able to tame it I suppose I seem different.. I am not like the others, child.." His right hand ruffles the auburn mane on his scalp, he looks on indifferently.* - Sat Sep 19 01:00:22 2015

But what I mean by that is... You must cloak yourself in this veil, the mist itself and feel the energy from within... You aren't trying to fit in the cover of the mist, rather it is trying to conform to you... It is all about finding solace in your enviornment, it also takes devout meditation. Because of this you will find it to be difficult starting up, but it will help you achieve true stability within your enviornment." The enigma clasps his hands together.

This would be much like me trying to tell you how to breathe.. Or how to walk, it simply doesn't work.. You must feel this as it is something that is internal, do you understand.?"
