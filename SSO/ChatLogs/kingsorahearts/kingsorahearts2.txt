Mamoru's right hand slides to a more comfortable location to potentially draw his tanto should conflict ensue.* - Tue Sep 22 18:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Whichever you prefer. - Fri Sep 25 22:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: This technique is similar to Suimen. - Fri Sep 25 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: However, the chakra that you apply to your feet, is then released to launch you either forward, or upwards. - Fri Sep 25 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It's great for covering distances obviously. - Fri Sep 25 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Suimen? - Fri Sep 25 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Do you not know the Suimen technique? - Fri Sep 25 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What's that? - Fri Sep 25 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It is a technique that allows you to walk across water and climb mountains with ease. - Fri Sep 25 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: To achieve this. - Fri Sep 25 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You simply need to focus your chakra into the feet. - Fri Sep 25 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And balance it evenly. - Fri Sep 25 22:38:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Now, since you understand that technique. - Fri Sep 25 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Would you like a clear demonstration of the Hop technique, or do you think you can perform it? - Fri Sep 25 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Demonstration would be nice. - Fri Sep 25 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Very good, you've got the basics it seems. - Fri Sep 25 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Lord Niza. - Fri Sep 25 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'd like to spar you to test my skills. - Fri Sep 25 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I am ready when you are. - Fri Sep 25 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Right. - Fri Sep 25 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) pulls out his chakra saber and glances at Niza. He suddenly dashes forward, swinging his blade in a lateral fashion towards Niza's hip region. He'd aim for the lower-half, as he did before. He was well aware of Niza's overwhelming speed from their last spar. He was also aware of his practitioning of the Chinese Kempo style.* - Fri Sep 25 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) immediately retaliates. Quite literally, Mamoru's blade is jutted upwards in an attempt to smash into Niza's antecubitus in a rearing fashion to try and divert his blow. Of course, it wouldn't make it miss Mamoru; however, Mamoru was eager to have it not strike him right in the neck. Should that be done, Mamoru's right foot lunges forward to try and smash into Niza's stomach, having avoided a lethal strike to his neck.* - Sat Sep 26 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) is caught off-guard by the strike. His leg is intercepted by the combination of olecranon and kneecap. Mamoru's eyes shudder in pain momentarily, as he attempts to raise his blade in defense. His blade targeted Niza's left arm, which was pinning his leg down. He'd quickly swipe at it in an attempt to slam into it with great strength.* - Sat Sep 26 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Niza's movements were quick and immediate. Mamoru's body turns briefly to try and meet Niza's attack. Unfortunately, his shoulder is pushed and Mamoru skids backwards. He manages to move his feet along with the upper body movement so that he didn't fall over through balance. Mamoru's saber is brought to his chest level once more in self-defense.* - Sat Sep 26 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glides his hands across the air momentarily as his hands aim to intercept the Climbing Silver. His right hand aims to smash into Niza's forearm as it came at him, and his left hand aimed to deliver the butt of his blade into Niza's sternum and blow him backwards just slightly. He was familiar with the technique and had pre-emptively seen the motions for it. Hopefully, Mamoru's quick thinking and guile might work. After all, it looked like initially, he desired to overpower Niza with a frontal attack, right hand against forearm. Of course, Mamoru wasn't physically strong, and desired no direct conflict in terms of butting heads.* - Sat Sep 26 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) slows momentarily and glances up at Niza.

"That'll be it for now. Thank you for sparring me, Lord Niza."* - Sat Sep 26 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Thank you. - Sat Sep 26 00:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Sat Sep 26 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) had to sit on a meeting and take notes. It was simple enough. The district was to have a discussion on lodging issues as well as military issues, which Mamoru, a Genin, was eager to listen in on. He was always very proactive when it came to his village. After all, he was a participant in the village's security as well, and had to do his part. 

He sits in his seat and takes notes accordingly upon each speaker speaking. He takes notes on what they discuss and what they propose in terms of solving the dilemma. "Well, it seems like both are targeting one another's weakpoints in this debate. And they seem to be struggling over the idea of a national wall around the village." He thought to himself, as he jots down notes.* - Sat Sep 26 03:47:24 2015

Mamoru's eyes dart towards the ANBU Agent who had just hit him for no particular reason. Mamoru's right hand reaches for his tanto and his left hand aims to seize hold of the ANBU Agent's neck. Should he grab the tanto with his right hand, he'd twirl it briefly before aiming to stick it in a penetrating fashion against the ANBU Agent's femur.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) found himself in a precarious situation. He hadn't realized or recognized the water transformation less it be too late. The flamethrower was on its way from the single handseal being formed. However, Mamoru's goal was to quickly sidestep towards the side, to elude the attack altogether. He'd have to be more prepared for the next time such a thing occurs.* - Sat Sep 26 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Even if he wasn't able to see, Mamoru was able to hear. His hearing was perceptive and in general, were his five senses perceptive. Mamoru's tanto is already drawn and he quickly aimed to collide with the tanto upon a glint of its light  being demonstrated within the night of the mist's formation. "Unfortunately, I'm not going to be that easy to hit." Mamoru stated aloud. He aimed to simply struggle with the male with their blades and perhaps even overpower him, if successful, and remove his weapon from his hand.* - Sat Sep 26 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Quickly and suddenly, with a movement of his foot, Mamoru's right leg jets out towards the ANBU Agent's stomach to intercept his Water Colliding Wave before its completion. He had merely clashed with the blade to intercept and stop it. While he couldn't suddenly swing back at the ANBU Agent, he was a skilled practitioner of the sword and was able to transition into the movement of his lower-regions in order to disable the ANBU Agent.

Even before the mouth could be faced towards the ground and before the handseal could be made properly--it was upon the figure losing grip on his tanto that Mamoru's foot moves, aiming to slam directly into the stomach of his opponent and perhaps into the solar plexus. This would interrupt any chance of a water technique, and would allow the moves from Hanabi to go uninterrupted.* - Sat Sep 26 07:06:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) draws his blade. It is a chakra saber that shines with white light. * - Sat Sep 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Immediately, Mamoru's blade is drawn and tucked towards his chest, inwards. Defensively, it is slanted into a lateral position. The four Mist Servants were inspected by Mamoru. Quickly, Mamoru dashes towards Hideki, unstopping in his advance. He swings his tanto towards the two that were directly in his path, as well as any stragglers that seemed to pursue him. His goal was to engage with Hideki as quickly as possible in close-quarters combat.

He feared long-distance, as it was dawning upon Mamoru that he could be dealing with a Ninjutsu specialist. When he got near Hideki, he aimed to launch a roundhouse kick at Hideki's right side with his left foot.* - Sat Sep 26 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) had never seen such a rapid transformation take place. He glances at the Agkistrodon with a surprised facial expression. As the kunai came at him, Mamoru's eye trails and flickers behind him. He avoids them instinctively, moving his body appropriately. He notices Hideki's handsigns as well. 

He dashes to the side promptly, trying to evade whatever it was Hideki was holding in his sleeves.* - Sat Sep 26 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Immediately, Mamoru distances himself further. He wasn't about to be caught in a deathtrap. He dashes towards the eerie ninja and swings his blade at the kunais and whatnot. However, he isn't an idiot. He realizes eventually that these weapons and the people he was hitting were being phased through. Eventually, Mamoru became ignorant to their existence and decided to only focus on the actual Hideki, who he was tracking down with his eyesight as the only one holding a handseal.* - Sun Sep 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // The Hidden Snake Hands was a technique Mamoru had not seen before. With his speed though, Mamoru steps to the side, closing the distance beween him and Hideki and quickly flashing his blade upwards. Yes. It was a vertical swing, aiming to slice at the snakes directly and remove of their heads with a good old fashioned decapitation. His skill with his saber was akin to expert, seeing as he had not shown this degree of speed as of yet. 

Should he succeed in beheading the snakes, he would proceed to smashing his elbow into Hideki's chest and forcing him to back away.* - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
