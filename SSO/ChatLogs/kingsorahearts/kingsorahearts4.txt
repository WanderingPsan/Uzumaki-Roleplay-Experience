<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) grips Chiharu by the hilt. "I suppose this isn't a bad idea. It is much more convenient, since you won't lag behind."* - Tue Sep 29 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: So. - Tue Sep 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Let's try this out. - Tue Sep 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) rears Chiharu backwards. His right arm bends at a ninety degree angle briefly, while pointing Chiharu forwards in front of himself. His right leg slides backwards just a tad bit in order to compensate for balance. His right arm suddenly bends at a 45 degree angle and swings Chiharu out at lightning-fast rates. 

"Cloud-Style, Crescent-Moon Beheading!" * - Tue Sep 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) nods at Chiharu. "Well. It's to be expected. We'll get accustomed to each other. Now, let's try something else. A durability test, mainly. But it's just to test this out." Mamoru stated. He reaches into his backpouch and suddenly throws up perhaps a sum of twenty shuriken. With Chiharu, he'd attempt to swing at every single shuriken and knock them out of the air. * - Tue Sep 29 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I see. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: Please don't slam me against anything. Or swing me extremely fast. - Tue Sep 29 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // With Chiharu in his grip, Mamoru wielded her up to chest-level. He dashes forward and swings laterally from the left side. Upon the execution, a screech could be heard as the swing would be fast enough to produce such noise. As it was done, he proceeds to swing her in the opposite lateral direction, slashing towards the right side this time in the same lateral fashion.

Suddenly, after the execution of the two lateral slices, he jumps into the air a short distance and somersaults through the air. With Chiharu still being held, she would accompany him through the somersault. Finally, he'd swing downwards using gravity's momentum as well as his spin's rotation to power the strike. He would only hit air, so that Chiharu wasn't in pain.* - Tue Sep 29 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) digs the blade into the ground after the execution was over.

"I think that's enough for now. Return to your regular form, Chiharu."* - Tue Sep 29 23:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Learning a new taijutsu style. - Wed Sep 30 03:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Chiharu isn't here to practice with me either. - Wed Sep 30 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She was here earlier. - Wed Sep 30 03:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: The fuck is he doing here...? - Wed Sep 30 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) blasts into the scene momentarily. He wasn't about to let Hideki get one shotted by Tetsujin--no way Jose. Mamoru flies into action, drawing his chakra saber. He approaches the Senbons that made up Tetsujin's frame. He begins to swing wildly in an attempt to get them away from Hideki. His left hand reaches for an Explosive Tag laced kunai, which he throws promptly to try and disperse the rest of the Senbon and offer Hideki some time to recuperate.* - Wed Sep 30 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) is fucking onomatopoeia'd to KO.* - Wed Sep 30 04:30:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) lays there limp.* - Wed Sep 30 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: ........... - Wed Sep 30 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) remains limp in his position. His eyes wander over to Reguel, though they return to his own person, since he was in concern for his own well-being at this point in labor.* - Wed Sep 30 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You know, if I wanted to I could crush your head in right now, but why would I do that? - Wed Sep 30 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Besides, I might as well be a medic, I don't know anyone else in Kumo who'd do it. - Wed Sep 30 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Considering our only medic got fucked up too.. - Wed Sep 30 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Wed Sep 30 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) found himself being tapped by the boot. Mamoru's left hand aimed to push it aside. "I can move just fine.." Mamoru stated. Unlike Hideki, he didn't have damage to his legs. Mamoru slowly stood up. However, the standing up process is excruciatingly gradual. After he finished standing up, Mamoru started to walk away. His stride looked completely fine.

But the fact that he nearly took a full minute just to stretch himsefl up vertically.* - Wed Sep 30 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) continues to walk up the cliff, finding it rough to climb up. He had a strong front though.* - Wed Sep 30 05:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh. - Wed Sep 30 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: His name is Mamoru. - Wed Sep 30 05:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . . - Wed Sep 30 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) just sits there with bandages all over his torso and jaw.* - Wed Sep 30 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: HAAAAAAH! - Wed Sep 30 22:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances at Chiharu and points at his jaw, indicating that he couldn't speak.* - Wed Sep 30 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: I bet you can't even speak. - Wed Sep 30 22:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) starts to walk off, deciding he didn't want to stand here any longer than he had to.* - Wed Sep 30 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Mamoru, did you wanna train? - Wed Sep 30 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) notes his injuries with a gesture.* - Wed Sep 30 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) whispers: Let me know if you need anything. Like... a certain gesture could indicate.. - Wed Sep 30 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) nods quietly over at Chiharu, thankful for her presence.* - Wed Sep 30 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Mamoru, what happened with the two of you? I heard you both suffered serious injuries. Was it because of Erebus? - Wed Sep 30 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 30 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) whispers: Are you hungry or anything? I'll try and take care of you until you're better. It wouldn't be nice for me not to. - Wed Sep 30 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: No. - Wed Sep 30 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see.. - Wed Sep 30 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) nodded slowly when asked if he wanted any food.* - Wed Sep 30 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) found his hand grasped and had to follow Chiharu.* - Wed Sep 30 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) sits down inside of the diner. He nodded towards Chiharu, surprised by her generosity and supposed "wealth".* - Wed Sep 30 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Ramen. - Wed Sep 30 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) rose both of his hands. He didn't seem to mind ramen at all. Not that eating would be a joy with his mouth so messed up.* - Wed Sep 30 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) nods. Soup sounded like a suitable food, seeing as he couldn't chew at the moment. He was still surprised and wincing from the trade-off with Tetsujin earlier, since he had never seen him at full power. He nods over at Chiharu. Although, he didn't break his jaw. He couldn't really clarify on its damages though, because he couldn't speak.* - Thu Oct  1 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) takes a whiff of the diner in. The scent wasn't too bad, there was a fragrant aroma steaming from the kitchen. That was usually a good sign for the quality of a place. Mamoru moves his arms, as they weren't exactly damaged, and his right hand slips off his mask, since he was to eat shortly.* - Thu Oct  1 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Of course, Kuro gets more training. - Thu Oct  1 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh.. - Thu Oct  1 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps you should speak with the Raikage about teaching you the basics? - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I should. - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) stares at Kuro with bandages all over his chest, which already delivered an answer to him.* - Thu Oct  1 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) can't exactly wave back to Kuro. He remains there, stoic in his facial expression. He would cross his arms across his chest---if it wouldn't make him grief in pain.* - Thu Oct  1 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Sorry I can't heal ya. - Thu Oct  1 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) examines Kuro and Reguel, who had come to give their apologies on behalf of Mamoru's injuries. Nothing that Mamoru really cared about though. Mamoru slowly opened his mouth, wincing in pain from the fractures in his jaw.

"I'm fine." That's all he managed to muster up in terms of words. However, it wasn't a weak 'I'm fine.' He had managed to sum up enough energy and vocal prowess to vocally project his dialogue. 

After Kuro shook Chiharu's hand, Mamoru would move his own hand out towards her, in an attempt to gesture for her to transform.* - Thu Oct  1 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm Reguel. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Long as I don't strain myself too much and only use my arm muscles I should be okay. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasure to meet you as well.  I see that you and Mamoru are rather close. - Thu Oct  1 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Uhuh, we're partners. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I wonder if I can scare someone someday by talking in katana form. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) held Chiharu now as a katana within his right hand--dominant grip. He proceeds to the side of the arena, deciding no longer to participate in small talk. His only desire was to become stronger than he was originally, so that he wouldn't lose to Tetsujin. He swings Chiharu through the air with a sharp lateral cut, before unleashing a series of thrusting piercing motions.* - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances back over at Reguel and Kuro. He was aware of his presence, at least at the former. Mamoru continues to practice using Chiharu, nonetheless, swinging at the air and piercing at it. Unlike normal, Mamoru was sweating a lot more; a mixture of pain was overtaking his normally relaxed composure when it came to practice. Hopefully, it wasn't anything extremely noticeable. He was alright, with overexerting himself, if it meant that he would become stronger than who he was before. * - Thu Oct  1 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Thu Oct  1 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // He took in for granted Misa's kindred smile, and assumed it to be genuine instead of falsified. The snake that slithered from her sleeve sent a chill down Mamoru's spine, but it was brief. As it struck into his neck, Mamoru felt like he was going to die. However, it was a brevity that translated into a painkiller next, which Mamoru found to be soothing.

He did find that his speaking was relieved of pain. "I see... Not too painful, it appears." Mamoru murmured, nodding his head at Misa.* - Thu Oct  1 05:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // "Place your hand on my jaw?" Mamoru questioned, though his question was removed when Misa's hand was placed upon the side of his cheek, shaving away some of the recovery time for the fractured jaw. Mamoru glances to the side as the process continued. Occasionally, his glance travelled over to the green luminescence that radiated off of her hand.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) grips onto Chiharu's hand, as though instinctive. Mainly, it was because Mamoru was a bit shaken by Ushinawa's death.* - Thu Oct  1 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances over at Chiharu and slowly nods. Depressingly, Mamoru remains in place. However, his grip seems to intentfully tighten even further. * - Thu Oct  1 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: Is it over? - Thu Oct  1 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Thu Oct  1 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances at Chiharu. "Perhaps we should get going. I'm certain Hideki is mourning his master. In his own way." Mamoru stated. * - Thu Oct  1 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) takes hold of Chiharu by her hilt. He begins to waltz off towards the training field, deciding not to associate with anyone in this area: he had to train and he had to train for Ushinawa's sake, not only for his own. Mamoru nods over at Chiharu.

"I've been injected with a painkiller. I can speak properly."* - Fri Oct  2 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Now then. - Fri Oct  2 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: We should practice. - Fri Oct  2 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct  2 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances over at Chiharu. Suddenly, Mamoru steps forward, swinging her in the crescent-shape he so cordially enjoyed using. "Crescent Moon Beheading!" -Mamoru thought to himself, deciding that stating the title of his technique out loud was absurdly corny. He kept it to himself as he swung Chiharu at a breathtaking pace. He'd continue with a second swing, which was vertical and aimed towards an imaginary opponent's headband.* - Fri Oct  2 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) nodded shortly. "Right. I'll place my weight against my hits. And I'll move around as I strike." Mamoru stated. This time, instead of just abruptly swinging, his right foot moved and inches forward. Thusly, he maintains his center of gravity and thus, his center of balance is achieved. He dashes forward, keeping his right foot planted forward before his slash. He swings Chiharu, placing his full body weight on the slice. He retracts afterwards, backpedaling by using his dominant right foot's strength to push him off.* - Fri Oct  2 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: "It" as in physical power... by the way. - Fri Oct  2 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: The only thing he didn't do was regulate his physical strength... - Fri Oct  2 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // "Alright. So you want me to restrain my physical power and not simply put all my weight on strikes?" Mamoru questioned. He swings out, quickly jutting out this time. Instead of placing all of his weight, Mamoru maintained his footwork and swung. At this point, it more or less mimicked fencing.* - Fri Oct  2 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) grunted. "Limit it? Much as possible, and simply remove the pause between slashing and consecutive actions. Alright." He sighs. He continues to swing, though this time, he limits his energy and he limits the amount of strength he does while maintaining his action. He also does not bring his swing all the way back after swinging it; instead, he leaves it with some of its momentum so that he could transition into any swing or parry if needed.* - Fri Oct  2 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // "Alright. I'll keep it up." He nodded. He was sweating profusely. After all, he hadn't recovered from his injuries yet; he was building himself off of painkillers. At some point, after realizing how to remove the pause from in beween his attacks, Mamoru had simply fainted. His body falls on the ground, collapsing under the pressure and strain of the rigorous training he had undergone, which had worked his body to the brink of overexhaustion. His body, fatigued and debilitated, worked hard enough to even keep him up. However, fractures all over his torso, spinal cord, and jaw bone, weren't to be recovered and denied by a mere painkiller.* - Fri Oct  2 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Fri Oct  2 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I never did learn anyone's names. - Fri Oct  2 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) lays down on the ground. His olecranons press against the wooden floor's surface. They were slightly bent either way. A peaceful look was apparent on Mamoru's face, even when hidden underneath his facemask. Occasionally, he twitched, wincing with pain. It was as if he was bordering unconsciousness and consciousness.* - Fri Oct  2 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's good then. - Fri Oct  2 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) is still laying on the ground.* - Fri Oct  2 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, well I can't really use healing ninjutsu now, but I can certainly numb his pain for some time. - Fri Oct  2 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: The only reason we were able to train was because he was using pain reliever.. is it safe for him to have more medicine already? - Fri Oct  2 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I see.  - Fri Oct  2 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'll need to talk to Misa about this. - Fri Oct  2 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, then I'll just allow him to get some rest, if this happens again he won't be training anymore until further notice. - Fri Oct  2 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Okay.. - Fri Oct  2 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: As his partner you're also at fault. - Fri Oct  2 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I know already. I didn't even realize he was tiring out. - Fri Oct  2 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) winces lightly. His eyes fluttered open briefly. Eventually, they remained open, just staring at the ceiling above him. Mamoru was wondering where he was. Earlier, he was in the training grounds with Chiharu. Now, he was suddenly in some room. Was it his house? Mamoru didn't have the energy to stand up though. He just didn't feel it. It was that morning paralysis he was in.* - Fri Oct  2 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) blinks, looking up at Chiharu. "It's nothing, really. Stop worrying about it." Mamoru stated. He had realized what must've happened, upon recognition of Chiharu's facial expression. Her tears and her faltering voice were all signs of what may have happened to him, and they depicted the worry that Chiharu was fostering from Mamoru's incident. His head rises, as he tries to sit up.* - Fri Oct  2 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) examines the senbon that had been pushed towards the side of his face. He nodded obligingly. He was in no condition to rebel, even if he wanted to. Mamoru laid back on the bed.* - Fri Oct  2 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: I'd honestly prefer my house... - Fri Oct  2 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Or if you want I could use you as a test subject for the poison I'm working on. - Fri Oct  2 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . I'm good, thanks for the offer. - Fri Oct  2 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well at least we can finally talk to each other, Mamoru. - Fri Oct  2 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Ah, well let me offcially introduce myself, I'm Reguel, I'm the one who helped you two when I found you outside the mansion. - Fri Oct  2 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I am a genin who's planning to be a medic. - Fri Oct  2 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: However, I'm not as skilled as Misa seeing as welll I slacked off, a lot. - Fri Oct  2 02:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I should've went to an actual market instead of a convenience store... but super markets are easy to get lost in. Plus... It wouldn't have been good for me to leave him alone for an extended period of time. - Fri Oct  2 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances over at the bag. He nodded. It was filled to the brim with various things. "Thanks. I'll pay you back for this. I get some pay from missions after all." Mamoru said, sighing. He felt weird, being taken care of like this. The usually isolated individual decided that he wouldn't have any qualms with it though, deciding that it was perfectly fine; they were teammates after all.

Canned coffees, pain medication, and chocolate chip cookies. He didn't remember telling her he would be able to eat, seeing as he was in pain from his jaw. However, he understood her intentions.

"No, don't worry. That's fine. You got the right stuff." He said, reassuring her.* - Fri Oct  2 03:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I need to think of ways to train with you. I feel useless when you're training, because I just get to sit and get swung... and me trying to give you tips just tired you out.. - Fri Oct  2 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: It wasn't you giving me tips that tired me out. - Fri Oct  2 03:40:35 2015
