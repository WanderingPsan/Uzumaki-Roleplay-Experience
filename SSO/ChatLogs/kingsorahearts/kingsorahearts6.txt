<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) shifts his position. Mamoru's entire body aligns with his opponent's. However, he distorts the mirror reflection by sliding his right arm forward and holding Chiharu close to his opposite, recessive hand side. Mamoru's eyes hone in on Koji with deathly concentration, pinpointing each one of his points. His positioning had allowed him to enter his stance.

"Hiten-Mitsurugi Style."* - Sun Oct  4 02:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // It was impressive. Mamoru could feel some distortion in the air around Koji as he activated the Gate of Opening. As Mamoru was not proficient or knowledgeable in the Gates, he didn't know what just happened. However, Mamoru was an expert in combat. He reacts promptly. As soon Koji nears him, Mamoru's blade is jetted out towards Koji at blinding speeds. 

He aims to quite literally slash across Koji's arm and slice straight through the tendons and arteries. If so, he would have disabled Koji's attacking arm and removed it from the fray. * - Sun Oct  4 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // He had succeeded in landing his strike. However, Koji wasn't going to be done in that easily, it appeared. Mamoru speeds backwards, realizing that he was in a precarious situation. Mamoru's right hand swigs into his holster and tears out three shuriken. He fires off the three shuriken.

His fingers seem to be moving strangely. Small lights glint off of his fingers, due to Koji's visionary prowess. The three shuriken fly towards Koji, aiming to distract him momentarily. Mamoru's entire body shifts to the side, shifting not only his weight but changing his direction. 

"Chiharu, prepare for engage."* - Sun Oct  4 03:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // It was impressive. The wire links were immediately sliced, but the trajectory of the shuriken remained on point, relatively. Mamoru withdrew his hand so that it was no longer necessary for him to do rear the shuriken. He reaches into his holster, yanks out a kunai, and tosses it forward at Koji. However, unlike Koji, Mamoru hadn't hesitated.

It had an Explosive Tag latched to its tiny hole and it was speeding towards him in an attempt to blow up at his feet. 

"You have a neat defensive trick. Can you maximize and minimize the range of its span though?" Mamoru questioned thoughtfully, exploding the bomb meters away from Koji in order to create a -smokescreen-. 

That was his intent. A smokescreen. He wasn't trying to hit Koji. Mamoru zooms to the side and tosses two shuriken at Koji, in an attempt to strike him from the side. * - Sun Oct  4 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Kunai drop* - Sun Oct  4 03:33:45 2015
