<br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) appears to be much more alert now that said accusation had been let loose. Mamoru's right hand reaches for the hilt of his saber which was strapped to his dorsal.* - Sat Sep 05 14:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances at Keyshawn.* - Sat Sep 05 14:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) draws his chakra saber immediately. He dashes forward towards Niza swinging his blade in a lateral fashion towards his sagittal plane. The target was the lateral collateral ligament on Niza's right knee, aiming to penetrate into his epithelial tissue and damage his balance.* - Sat Sep 05 15:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) was familiar with the Climbing Silver technique. The short and close-ranged distance that they were in was Mamoru's comfort zone, despite Mamoru using a rather short-ranged weapon. Mamoru's reflexes kick in, aiming to lean backwards to avoid the initial stroke. Mamoru's right leg would prop itself up to try and kick Niza in the stomach, hopefully forcing him backwards for Mamoru's katana range to come into play.* - Sat Sep 05 15:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) is struck right in the face. He seems to move in tandem with the vector of the strike. Mamoru's blade is held though, and he recovers as quickly as he possibly could, knowing that he was leaving himself open for another strike. Suddenly, Mamoru drops to the ground, ducking and swinging his blade laterally towards Niza's ankles.* - Sat Sep 05 15:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) observes Niza avoiding the strike. Mamoru clicks his tongue incessantly, having gauged the reflexes and the prowess of his opponent. Mamoru knew already he was outclassed. The toughness of Niza's chest also demonstrated to Mamoru that attacking his torso wouldn't be very useful to him; his abdomen was built like a tank. Mamoru had to keep testing though and pressing on to surpass his limits.

Mamoru nears Niza, holding his blade hesitantly. Suddenly, he jabs outwards, a stabbing motion to try piercing into Niza's chest. Mamoru would draw back immediately once the action had been done, wary of a counter.* - Sat Sep 05 15:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Quickly, Mamoru's own hand moved. His antebrachium aims to clash with Niza's backhand, aiming to press against the phalanges before they were to make contact with his neck. Even then, Mamoru had moved at an angle to move his acromial as well, so that his side was now facing Niza to make it even more difficult should Niza somehow break through the guard that was Mamoru's forearm.

Mamoru backs off swiftly, still holding his blade.* - Sat Sep 05 16:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) noticed that Niza was mainly just defending from his attacks. He wasn't going on the offensive. Maybe that was why Niza was winning this fight. If Mamoru wanted to beat Niza, he'd have to fake and pull out Niza's attack, to try and have him parry unintentionally on a feint. Mamoru zooms in, feinting with his blade, though backing out before it could make contact with Niza. He'd then take the opportunity to swing a roundhouse at Niza's leg.* - Sat Sep 05 16:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) played it safe. He had gotten a hit in; that was good enough for the time being. Mamoru backs off, keeping the distance against Niza. He wouldn't be able to get him with a second feint. He'd have to trick Niza though. Trick Niza into having to -guess- whether his strike would be a feint or not. It'd be like reverse psychology.

Mamoru, this time, fires off a stab towards Niza's face. It wasn't a feint. But, perhaps Niza would be too focused on this strike. Because simultaneously, Mamoru would move his leg towards Niza's ankle, furthering his assault on the lower-body.* - Sat Sep 05 16:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // The cartwheel had made Mamoru flinch slightly, due to how unprepared he was to handle this acrobat. Niza's left cross came in to him. Mamoru lifts up his hand; it was a bit too late though. His phalanges aren't capable enough to block Niza's strike and he's hit right in the face with a left cross for the second time, being blown backwards. He isn't tossed to the ground, no, but he skids across it.* - Sat Sep 05 16:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) had good vision of his opponent's frame. He, unlike the adrenaline focused Niza, was more aware of multiple hits than Niza may have been. The only problem was, did Mamoru possess the experience or reflexes that Niza possessed? Perhaps. Mamoru's blade lifts and aims to intercept Niza's foot, blocking it with the flat end. As Niza's left hand reached for his arm, Mamoru aimed to shove his leg against Niza's kneecap, to try and break his balance via the patella.* - Sat Sep 05 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // He too may be described as a stamina demon. However, his was purely genetic from his father. Mamoru remains in his position, having made distance once again. Mamoru hoists his blade and lifts it so that it was near his sagittal plane, bringing it medial to his body after a certain amount of time. Suddenly, he twists it to demonstrate the flat plane, and laterally swings at Niza. This time though, it was a feint. He would spin around in position, swinging at Niza's left side, only to reveal a -second- feint, to try and trick Niza.

If the two swings went without impediment, Mamoru jumps into the air, spinning in a somersault to build momentum, before finally swinging downwards at Niza's shoulder.* - Sat Sep 05 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) sheathes his blade.* - Sat Sep 05 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Interested in Moth's training montage, Mamoru had decided to follow instead of being a creepy bystander who did nothing. Mamoru followed discreetly, which may have been initially stalkerish. However, eventually, Mamoru simply wanted to test himself by following after the two.

Nonetheless, this didn't mean that he saw friends in the two of them. It was more appropriate to say that Mamoru might see a rival in Moth. His hardworking determination seemed to have aroused Mamoru from his dormancy after all, so Mamoru was intent on learning more about this potential rival.

"Oi." Mamoru called out to him, acting as casual as possible, even though it was awkward for Mamoru to call out to him for no particular reason.* - Sat Sep 05 21:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) follows after Moth. "You don't mind if I join you in your training session, do you?" Moth questioned. His voice was a bit harder to hear beneath his facemask, which made it increasingly difficult for his voice to ring out appropriately to contact his desired eardrums. Fortunately, Mamoru spoke loudly, even if his voice was muffled.

Mamoru continues jogging; for some reason though, Mamoru maintained some degree of distance between him and Moth, as though Mamoru was exercising a level of caution around the acquaintance.* - Sat Sep 05 21:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) follows diligently; onwards did he ride with his legs, striding across the barren wasteland and down the slopes of Kumogakure's mansion ground. Mamoru felt challenged by the sudden sprint that the two had taken on; behind the two of them, Mamoru's legs kicked up on the balls of their bottoms. Mamoru kicks up a storm of dust on his initiation though it quickly ceases once he breaks his acceleration and maintains a consistent velocity.

He no longer spoke. What was important was the training; this philosophy was one he may have shared with the hyena and there was no need to express it. Mamoru continued onwards, following the two of them though being certain to avoid any plagues of dust that may harm his eyesight. Mamoru was angled slightly at the side so that there would be no dust cloud gathered from the two ahead of him hindering him as an impediment to his exercise.

Mamoru's knees bent and his legs moved in a rhythm; it was as if he had reached a runner's high if one had observed his facial expression. However, it was hard to discern because Mamoru's mouth was invisible due to the mask covering it. Mamoru nevertheless continues his sprint without any complaint.* - Sat Sep 05 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) continues to sprint behind Moth and the hyena. He consistently maintained his desired pace. Not only that, but a trace of sweat was not visible on Mamoru's forehead; after all, Mamoru had been gifted with the proverbial gift of genetics, this one particular for stamina. He had sprinted down slopes and hills, avoided clouds of dust in order to protect his eyesight and to maintain his cleanliness as well as his hygiene, and also exercised his leg muscles. 

Unlike Moth, he wasn't tired. However, Mamoru cared little for Moth's exhaustion. It didn't matter to him, nor would Mamoru judge him. The only thing Mamoru would judge him for was his effort and his determination. He worked hard unlike the rest of the people he had seen thus far. It was this that may have attuned Mamoru to liking this person in particular. * - Sat Sep 05 22:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) stops the running after the two of them had finished. He heads back to the slope of Kumogakure and sits there patiently, in meditation one may presume.* - Sat Sep 05 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances at Kyushiki.* - Sat Sep 05 22:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) glances at Amai.

"I see no reason to bar you."* - Sat Sep 05 23:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Quickly, Mamoru wastes little time in drawing his scabbard and tearing his saber from its host. "Then, let's not waste any time." Mamoru states, flipping it to its back side in order to not potentially maim anyone in this training exercise. It was the blunt edge and anyone experienced with a blade would realize this. Mamoru slides his legs into anatomical positioning, but his arms contradict his pose by sliding in a comfortable balanced angle intertwined along his blade's hilt.* - Sat Sep 05 23:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) is authentically surprised in his time of brevity in that he recognized the jutsu. The jutsu was Water-Elemental. However, what was worse was Mamoru knew its origins. Why did this Kumogakure ninja know this technique? Perhaps his parents? No, Mamoru doubted this. Maybe Mamoru was in a much more dangerous position than he had assumed. Mamoru maintains his position, glancing back and forth through the mist in case anyone nears him. His vision was perceptive. He'd detect them, surely.* - Sat Sep 05 23:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) quickly notices Keyshawn in the general vicinity. Almost instantaneously, Mamoru's blade had jutted outwards in a lateral fashion, angled in a way to collide with Mancer's right leg, targetting the lateral collateral ligament which was adjacent to his patella. Should he strike it, he'd disable the balance of his target and proceed with a rather heavy kick directed at Keyshawn's stomach to knock him backwards. He had the pre-emptive attack, due to great vision within the confines of the mist; perhaps Keyshawn didn't have experience in his own mist? Who knows.* - Sat Sep 05 23:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) backs off at this point. He could hear the footsteps of Amai since she was so close. He knew he had directed Keyshawn to Amai's position, which is why Mamoru decided to move towards the adjacent left-side of his body. That way, Mamoru wouldn't be caught in any crossfire and he could attack a target from their blindside.* - Sat Sep 05 23:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) waits patiently. He doesn't hear any more thuds to the ground, meaning none of them had gone down yet. Well, until he realized Keyshawn had dropped to the ground. Was it his opportunity? Not yet. He knew their general location. He continues to walk around them.* - Sun Sep 06 00:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // The voice that Amai rang out had given Mamoru enough to go on. Mamoru leaps through the air swiftly but softly. Why did he leap? So that his footsteps made no noise. Quickly, Mamoru's blade aimed to smack itself against Amai's neck and with both of his knees, Mamoru would bring them to Amai's ventral in an effort to bring her downwards like a tower. Mamoru's entire body aimed to press against Amai's and press her against the ground and restrain her effectively. His legs would spread immediately and sprawl should he actually land atop of her, in an effort to punish her femurs with his knees.* - Sun Sep 06 00:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) drags his hands across Amai's body before slowly jumping away from her. The mist would've cleared at this instant in time, as he quickly sheathes his blade.* - Sun Sep 06 00:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) examines Amai and Keyshawn.* - Sun Sep 06 01:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) observes Amai and examines her.* - Sun Sep 06 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) walks up towards the mountain and glances back at Kizu. "You're certain you're alright with being on the bottom?" Mamoru questioned. His right hand clenches onto a ledge of the cliff as he begins his ascent, elevating his height with each consecutive step he takes upon the mountainous edges of the wall.* - Sun Sep 06 21:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) continues to scale the mountain while speaking. He hangs off the ledge for a moment to exercise his biceps, triceps, and overall, the muscles in his brachium. 

"I see. So you basically transform a sock puppet into a lethal machine."* - Sun Sep 06 21:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) steadily continues his march upwards.

"Alright then. I'm just making sure. My name is Mamoru. What is your name?"* - Sun Sep 06 21:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) leads his monks to Konohagakure, in hopes of providing reinforcements.* - Mon Sep 07 01:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) leaps into the fray. Behind him was his army of one-hundred monks. The monks were all in the midst of prayer; naturally, they had come worrying about the safety of their fellow peers and their fellow comrades. Mamoru himself though, had led the charge. His troops come from the sides, aiming to restrain numerous Amegakure shinobi with their various weapons such as ropes, johyos, and nunchaku. 

It appeared there was.... water on the ground? Mamoru's group and him tried to avoid it. And if there was some screen blocking his vision? Mamoru's group relied on instinct and just attacked all those in the smoke. * - Mon Sep 07 02:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // It is an instant in which he acts. Mamoru realized that Erebus was about to perhaps land a lethal hit on Amai. Even though Mamoru never saw eye to eye with Amai, Mamoru felt that it was necessary for him to act for Amai. He swings his chakra blade towards Erebus's scythe, aiming to land in between two of the blades of his scythe and slam into the metal pole. He'd hold Erebus down from there, clashing with him strength-wise. He wasn't equivalent to Erebus, no.

He was going to be pushed back. Which was why Mamoru quickly aimed a dirty kick to Erebus's left foot to break his balance and give Amai some more time to react.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Swiftly, as his kick lands against Erebus's leg, Mamoru secures his blade and flicks it downwards towards Erebus's body. He aims to pierce through Erebus's hand, which gripped onto the scythe, and dig him straight into the ground in a restraining manner. If possible, he'd have jeopardized Erebus's attempt at continual attack and have halted him in his footsteps. Mamoru calmly regards the situation, though it is clear that Mamoru felt death's grip on his neck for a brief moment. Should Erebus have gotten that opportunity on him, Mamoru was certain to have lost the struggle.

Mamoru was only glad that Erebus had subconsciously missed his attention on his kick; it was the only factor that seemed to matter in Mamoru's survival--it was funny how a single move could matter so much. In terms of sustaining his life, Mamoru had succeeded. In terms of winning the fight, Mamoru wasn't sure. He didn't try to kill Erebus immediately by slitting his neck. Not only was it because Mamoru didn't know Erebus was immortal, but also because Mamoru didn't simply kill off the bat without a good reason.
