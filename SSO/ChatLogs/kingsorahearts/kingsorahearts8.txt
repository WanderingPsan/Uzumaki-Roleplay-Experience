<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) | | "Don't worry. My sword is a reverse blade sword." He flicks the hilt of his sword and it exits out of its scabbard momentarily. "You can tell because it isn't bladed on the end it's supposed to be." Mamoru states. "My spare sword is available for your usage." Mamoru continues, withdrawing a second sword from his back. He tosses it over to Ketsuki. Unlike his reverse blade sword, it looked to be a typical iron katana, that could perform well in lethal combat.

"I don't have bokken, unfortunately. So, go ahead. I will give you the first move, Miss Ketsuki."* - Sat Oct 31 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) | | "You may keep the weapon. I have no use for it, ma'am. I believe it will be better off in your hands." He quietly states. The single handseal was surprising, but the Shunshin no Jutsu was recognized. 

Mamoru swiftly twists his body around. Decent enough hearing, experience in combat, and good visionary prowess had assisted him in reguiding him back to the location of his opponent. Respectfully, Mamoru places both of his hands on his blade and refuses to don a one-handed style, which could be considered disrespectful and disdainful to proper Kendo specialists.

He smiles at her. "You may take the first move, Miss Ketsuki." He states.* - Sat Oct 31 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) | | Quite literally, the blade soars and flies for a moment, smacking at Ketsuki's blade with incredibly untrace-able speeds. Mamoru looked to be skilled with the blade; it might have even been an understatement to merely leave him at skilled. His blade had zipped, zapped, and zoomed in countervailing Ketsuki's blow and had not only mitigated the force, but in some way, perhaps had redirected it back to her.

Should it be done, perhaps Mamoru's speed would knock the blade out of Ketsuki's hand. Nonetheless, Mamoru breaks the wind and steps in as his blade clashes with Ketsuki's. Metal clashes against metal and sparks fly, with Mamoru gradually bending his elbow inwards at a fourty-five degree angle into his scapula. Upon doing so, he'd dig deeper inot Ketsuki's defenses, bend his knees, and burrow himself below Ketsuki on the second level.

Mamoru's hilt would be brought up to Ketsuki's stomach and smash into her stomach, avoiding her face intentionally. This had all been done in one single instant. * - Sat Oct 31 03:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) | | Once more, Mamoru parries and counters eloquently. With the dialect of swordsmanship and onomatopoeia being generated with the clash between swords engaged in dialogue, Mamoru spins his blade with a sudden instantaneous movement that could only be described as vicious accelerated velocity. In one swift execution, he had formed a cardioid around his upright fist and aimed to collide the blade against Ketsuki's katana's diaphysis.

Upon collision, he'd perhaps knock it straight out of her hand and end the spar right there. * - Sat Oct 31 04:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) // There he was. He was settling with a broom in his hand. He moved up to the steps of the Kage's Office and started working on cleaning up the front of it. He'd sweep the steps and move his broom in a pendulum-like rhythm, with a gradual pace and a faster tempo as time proceeded onwards. Eiji hummed lightly. However, his hate for the mission grew rather quickly: he deemed it too stupid for his ability. After all, Eiji was a powerful fighter, known throughout the academy; though, Eiji had the lowest grades out of all of the kids in the academy.

Nonetheless, he carries on. He hadn't graduated until sixteen, he reminisced, as he swept the dust off the steps. He hums once again, deciding to focus himself on something else as he worked on it. 

He sweeps heavier as time went on. He hated the steps of the Kumogakure office being so rather dirty. Eiji wasn't a cleanly freak or a hygiene monster, but he did like a bit of cleanliness in his house; therefore, he adapted it to the mansion which he considered a faux home as well. * - Sat Nov 21 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) had to go shopping with an elderly villager now. How irritable! Eiji wasn't some sort of escort for the elderly. Nonetheless, he couldn't complain: it was a mission after all. Eiji heads into the mall and starts to accompany an old man who was shopping for a jewelry present for his youngest daughter. Eiji points out the jewelry and tells him whether they look nice or not, seeing as the old man was actually blind.

Once the old man had decided on his jewelry, Eiji paid for the jewelry for him. They had selected an aquamarine ring, which would be perfect for the girl, seeing as her favorite color was blue. Once they had selected the aquamarine jewelry though, Eiji had the bullshit task to deliver it. 

Eiji delivers the jewelry to the house of the lady. However, when he had emerged from the house, that same lady was being mugged, nearly raped by two hooligan vigilantes. Eiji intervenes, smashing and kicking at the vigilantes to save the girl in question. With brute force and unrelenting force, Eiji damages the pride of those who assaulted her. Once he was thanked, Eiji merely scratched the back of his head and headed back to the mansion, deciding to get his reward. * - Sat Nov 21 00:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) // Now, he had to find a missing cat. Interesting. Eiji wouldn't let up on his prey though. Eiji chases the cat down, deciding that it was likely the catw ould be hiding on a tall location. Eiji searches from the mountains; by logic, the cat had to be up there or it had to be down somewhere on the ground, the elevation would help Eiji out in the search nonetheless.

Once he located the cat, Eiji sets off to try and catch this cat. Eiji jumps off of the mountain boisterously and lands without a hitch. He doesn't even fracture a bone, despite falling off a sixty-foot mountain. Once landing, Eiji rushes after the cat. However, because there is a difference from looking at the cat from the sky, Eiji quickly turns out to be lost.

"Where'd that stupid cat go!?" Eiji muttered, looking around. He'd search around for the cat. Once he located it, Eiji chased after it. He even had to wall jump and climb a fence to get over to seize the cat. Once seized, he brought the cat back to the mission. * - Sat Nov 21 01:01:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) | | He was more amazed that there was a pit nearby Kumogakure no Sato. His eyes land on Menia and his other comrade, Takuma. Eiji might need to cover for the two of them. He was pretty abruptly stumped by the fact that there was a massive beast. However, Eiji had little time to react. He weaves numerous handseals, before stepping forward towards the rhino.

His eyes remain on Takuma once he summoned the Mud Silhouette.

"Not bad at all.." Eiji murmured. At the same time, Eiji slams the ground, erecting spears of carrots underneath the rhino to compliment Takuma's attack.* - Sun Nov 22 00:43:31 2015

His arms are reminiscent of carrots. His carrot blades have been formed, hardened, and sharpened to dangerous proportions. From the side of the Rhino, Eiji quite literally attempts to ram into the rhino and plunge his carrot blades into it; both of them would attempt to knock it down onto its side with a bludgeoning force.* - Sun Nov 22 01:03:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) thinks: If I had to take a guess... I'd say Eiji is more analytical.
