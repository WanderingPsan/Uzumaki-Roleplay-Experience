<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) says: Takuma, let's go. - Sun Nov 22 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) | | He had been initially surprised by the facade of the bandit who heaved his blade up. The Land of Grass was a burly place indeed. Eiji unsheathes his carrot blades in a moment's notice, deciding to protect his ally as quickly as he could. The spikes erupt out of the soil, aiming to launch themselves into them.

Should the blades be swung though, Eiji's carrot blades intercept, of course Eiji himself is rather close to the earth stone bamboo shoot, perhaps a little too close for comfort because of this defensive, protective mannerism he pulled for Takuma's safety and security. * - Mon Nov 23 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) | | Luckily, the shoots had managed to strike into one of them. Kirisaki was bludgeoned in the stomach, and he backs off immediately upon the kick landing against his body. 

"Ooph!" Eiji groaned, as he braces himself once again. The carrot blade is primed and it attempts to slice across the male's chest. Hell, once the slash connected, Eiji would attempt roundhouse kicking his target and sending him down to the ground. 

Eiji would not allow this bandit to escape so easily. He glances back at Takuma.

"Eh, whatever... We'll figure it out... It's a sinister-lookin' building though."* - Mon Nov 23 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) looked to be a bit irked by the vomitting and the disgust. It was awkward to see the bandit killed. 

However, he continues onwards. He follows Takuma. His eyes land on the door.

"What do you mean, open by itself? It's not even open." He mutters, laughing.

"You high?"* - Mon Nov 23 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) rose his blade and attempts to once more, intercept a metal prong. His blade is instinctive. As soon as he had caught sight of the metal prongs emerging from the door with his vision, Eiji attempts to block it before it pierced into him. He couldn't really defend Takuma die to the distance, though.* - Mon Nov 23 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) | | 

He glances at the warlord. He stands behind Takuma. However, the senbon cut short the exchange of conversation that Eiji was expecting. Eij quickly steps into Takuma's shadow to elude the senbon and have the dragon's head absorb the senbons in its muddy maw. Eiji's hands run through a series of handseals.

He slams his hands on the ground and conjures up a field of carrots underneath the warlord's feet, attempting to skewer his feet and prevent him from escaping the bludgeoning mudballs.* - Mon Nov 23 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) | | Suddenly, Eiji noticed that someone had quite literally escaped the building via the windows.

"Hey! Someone's tryin' to leave, Takuma!" He shouted, as he twisted and turned to just now notice the person on the ground. His vision had caught the two individuals. As the child was slain, Eiji quite literally boisterously rushes for the window. He smashes it clear with his foot and watches the man get out of the way.

"Oi! Get back here!" Eiji shouted.* - Mon Nov 23 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) swings his body to the side, avoiding the knife. He drops to the ground briefly as the knife lodges itself in the ceiling. Eiji had opened it up for Takuma and Eiji would follow swiftly after Takuma.

"What are you waiting for? Get 'em, Takuma!" Eiji shouted, as he lept out of the window. Eiji wasn't able to Suimen though: that would probably be a bad sign.* - Mon Nov 23 02:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kirisaki, Eiji(KingSoraHearts) | | He had to fill up holes. It was easy for Eiji. He'd been filling up the holes of young pretty girls ever since he was a twelve year old brat. Now he just had to fill up the holes of another beautiful woman.

Her name was Mother Earth. Gaia. Lady of Nature.

He'd give her a good holing. He conjures up his shovel and begins to dig the head into the ground, penetrating its entrance. Once he got deeper in, he'd start prodding and thrusting into the ground's edges, all around the hole's walls. He broke through the lips that he created with his shovel and started digging deeper into the Earth's womb.

He'd be able to give birth to new plants if he kept on pummeling the earth and digging into it. Eventually, he speeds up, speeding up to such an incredible extent that he finished his hole and Eiji, now pooped, could take a rest.* - Tue Nov 24 19:27:21 2015
