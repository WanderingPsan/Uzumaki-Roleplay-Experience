<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // "Impressive. It appears that you've become a bit more different." He admired the red of her blade as well as the white of her handle. His hand runs across the handle momentarily. Suddenly, he gripped her, and swung her as a testimony to his newfound strength.

[15.5 Strength Stat.] He had become more able to swing Chiharu around. Hopefully, she had not grown in weight or anything, allowing Mamoru to find her much more lightweight than he had been finding her before. "I like the idea of a red blade. Is it to make sure the blood of potential enemies doesn't ruin your leggings?" He questioned. 

He swings her quickly, testing her.* - Sat Oct  3 00:22:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) suddenly, Mamoru yanks his saber straight out of its sheathe. He shines it in front of himself. It shines with a glimmering light akin to Reign's Kubikirihoucho. "I don't know what that blade is, but it won't stand a chance to my chakra saber." Mamoru thought to himself. He zooms forward over at Reign, eagerly engaging him into combat. He shifts his weight and changes his position immediately.

He was mimicking all that he had been taught with his trusty comrade Chiharu by his side.

"Hiten Mitsurugi Ryu." Mamoru closes the distance between him and Reign and unleashes a flurry of strikes, aiming to distract him and allow Niza to use his technique.

We've done nothing to you, but you wish to seize our bodies." Mamoru steadies his blade, breathing heavily. He was sweating as well.* - Sat Oct  3 05:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) // Suddenly, Mamoru jerks for his holster. He withdraws five shuriken in each of his hands. His fingers seem to twirl and jerk themselves, before firing the shuriken towards Reign. He follows the shuriken immediately, carrying his saber in hand. Upon nearing Reign, he swings laterally on the left side and the right side, aiming to carve a wound in both sides of Reign's body. Should he do so, he would leap into the air and somersault wildly. 

"Chakra Saber - White Light!" -He thought to himself, hoping that he could catch Reign off guard with one of the strikes. He was expecting to at least get some damage in, for his allies. * - Sat Oct  3 06:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) had no time to waste. He lands on the ground immediately. Chiharu was thrown at him in a spinning arc. His dominant hand quickly reaches out to grab hold of Chiharu. In a moment's notice, he had unsheathed her and was prepared for the assault of his opponent. Mamoru's entire body is heaved against his opponent, trying to engage him. He was going to try and outspeed him with the speed of his blade.

He'd try to tackle Reign with his shoulder and disrupt the potential arcing of the Kubikirihoucho.

"I won't let you use that weapon of yours anymore. It's too large, and you won't be able to avoid this attack!" Mamoru stated, attempting to thrust his blade through Reign's chest. If it had struck him, Mamoru's blade would be yanked straight out, and following his strike, would be a decapitating blow to the head.

In his kitchen, cups of ramen littered the dinner table. He had a refridgerator, a stove, and an oven. 

In his bathroom, he had a shower combined with a bathtub, a sink, and a toilet. Only the essentials, really. He had no other toiletries besides toilet paper.* - Sun Oct  4 01:24:03 2015
