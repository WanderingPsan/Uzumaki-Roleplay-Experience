A bright flicker of white-ish blue sparks would completely conceal the movement of a certain individual throughout the vicinity.* - Wed Oct 28 02:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) appeared in a massive burst of white-ish blue thunder. She'd look around at the literally vacant village with a sullen gaze.

". . ."* - Wed Oct 28 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: No.. this isn't Kumogakure. - Wed Oct 28 03:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: We're looking for some people, if you got a moment..? - Wed Oct 28 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) surged her chakra, just to confirm if she was in some type of sick Genjutsu. Judging by the results, she wasn't.

This was reality.

A cruel reality.

She looked up at the sky rather blandly, hiding her mixed feelings.

"There is no one. No one left." Her statement wasn't directed to Ketsuki, but it coincidentially answered her. Amaya felt like a failure.

Anger.

Dissapointment.

Depression.

Her orange gaze redirected itself to the ground. Every inch of this ground was covered in remnants of the people that once inhabited the village. She lifted her hands from her side, looking at her palms. She could only see one thing drenching them:

Blood.

She turned her back to the duo, whimpering nearly inaudibly. She bit her lip, feeling her knees buckle ever so slightly.

"No.." She'd murmur.* - Wed Oct 28 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Is that the Kage? - Wed Oct 28 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I worked hard. Just.. to fail.. - Wed Oct 28 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) dropped to her knees, bending forth and remaining silent. Only a few whimpers could be heard. Four tears fell from her eyes, before they just.. stopped. She listened to Ketsuki's words, especially the -name- of who probably attacked her village. "Edge..?" Her voice was hollow, lacking the emotion that her body language displayed.

She'd slowly stand up, balling her hands into tight fists. She had to remain calm like she always told herself to. Now wasn't the time to have an emotional breakdown. Her negative emotions were slowly vanishing. She recalled the faces, the names and the clothing of many of the people that inhabitted the village; now dead. Amaya would stand straight with her back to them, her ponytail flowing freely.

Determination.

Will.

Hope.

"Yeah.. it isn't over... not until I'm dead. And even after that, there'll be someone else. I'll carry the spirits of the fallen of Kumogakure, until I slay him.. or be slain." She'd murmur, 

"That's my last pledge as the Yondaime. I can't afford to forsaken it; like I have to my people."* - Wed Oct 28 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I can't afford to be weak. I'll die like my nation if I continue to. I must get stronger or I'll fall. - Wed Oct 28 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) wiped away the wet lines where her tears descent from. She turned to face the individuals, regarding them with a rather stoic look.

"I'm taking a trip back to Konohagakure no Sato. Make it as quick as possible." She'd state. It was in her nature to be chill, so it was no surprise that she had already abolished her feelings of grand sadness.* - Wed Oct 28 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) sat at the edge of the river, looking down at her rippling reflection within the broad, pale blue surface of the water. She was captivated by it's beauty. The female arose to her feet, allowing chakra to course through her soles. Amaya moved forth, sauntering across the water and coming to a stop within the center. The female looked down with a half-lidded, fiery orange gaze focused upon the liquid. She'd slowly press her hands together. The white haired female shifted her fingers about, molding the necessary handseals for a technique.

Amaya focused her chakra reserves, attuning them more easily due to her usage of handsigns. The female manipulated the water around her, allowing it to seep upright and manifest into a water-composed frame matching Amaya's own. The white haired woman watched as the clone formed into an exact replica of her; the wonders of chakra were displayed. Amaya sent the Water Clone on it's way to scout the vicinity as she peered at her surroundings. The massive woodland surrounding the outskirts of northern Konohagakure no Sato appauled her by far. The thickets of trees were overgrown, and their branches easily intertwined into one another, forming a practical "roof" of trees over the entirety of the massive timberland.

The woman moved across the water, looking around at her dark surroundings. She would lift her right hand, allowing chakra to course to her palm and knead into the form of white-ish blue sparks. The sparks resonated with low, high-pitched chirping noises. Said sparks provided her a good source of light, as she moved around, making sure she was aware of what she was getting into. The water clone returned after she'd went through ten minutes worth of looking around at her surroundings.

"This forest will suffice.."

She would bend her knees, pressing her sandal'd soles to the tall blades of dark, dull grass and taking a great leap with a diagonal-inclination to her midair movement. She'd land upon an olive-brown, broad branch, leaning forth then proceeding to bend her knees once more and bound forth. She dashed from branch to branch, traversing throughout the area. Sparks still shined brightly within her right palm. She got a good observation of what animals consumed the oddly malicious looking forest, and what natural resources and supplies she could use. * - Tue Nov  3 01:32:35 2015
