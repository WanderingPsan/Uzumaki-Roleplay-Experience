"Ten bowls of miso ramen."* - Sun Dec  6 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) walked back in with five bowls of fresh miso ramen in each hand, covered by plastic wrap.* - Sun Dec  6 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) placed all ten of the bowls of miso ramen on the counter.

"Don't be worried if you can't eat them all." She'd remark, beginning to store them in the fridge. The blueish white-haired female would drape a cloak over her frame, settling down on the floor and pressing heself to the wall.

She'd sink her head, drifting off.* - Sun Dec  6 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) slept silently. She seemed very comfortable for the odd position. It was bizarre because there was a bed -right- beside her.* - Sun Dec  6 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) didn't shift or wake up at all; remaining asleep. A pleasant look engulfed her facial features, showing that she appreciated the change in position as she was laid on hte bed.* - Sun Dec  6 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) moaned lightly as she came to. "Nnn..." She was surprised to find that she was on the bed. She peered over her shoulder at Saika, smiling abit before turning her head and laying on her side.* - Sun Dec  6 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) sighed lightly. She slid out of the bed, approaching Saika. She'd ensure she was asleep, before picking her up as docilely as ever and carrying her over to the bed closest to the wall. She attempted to pull the blanket over the girl, tucking her in.* - Sun Dec  6 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) froze when she heard the mumble and felt the clinging of her clothing. It seemed that she was unable to put her down at this point. Amaya would sit on the edge of the bed, scooching back and pressing her back to the wall while practically cradling Saika. The blueish white haired female would lift an arm from beneath Saika, running her fingers through her hair in an attempt to sooth her if there was any notable distress she seemed to be physically undergoing, other than clinging onto Amaya.* - Sun Dec  6 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) could identify by now that Saika was having a nightmare of some sort. She wasn't sure whether to awake and startle her because she was holding her, or hope that the nightmare would pass. It seemed she was starting to awaken, though...

The blueish-white haired female would shake Saika slightly. "Saika... wake up.." She'd whisper.* - Sun Dec  6 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) coudln't help but let out a nervous chuckle. "If I let go of you you'll fall on the floor. Relax, you fell asleep and so I was going to tuck you in." She'd remark. Her grip loosened up.* - Sun Dec  6 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) smiled warmly, her fiery orange gaze focused on Saika's pearl-like irises. "Because I care about you, why else?" Amaya would remark. It was hard not to want to help out the girl.* - Sun Dec  6 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) allowed her to move away.

"I'm not sure myself, maybe it was spontaneous? I recognized that you were someone I could help out, and I never ignore people that I can potentially aid."* - Sun Dec  6 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Were you having a nightmare? - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Not to pry, or anything... - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .  - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I. . .may have. . .but, who knows. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I'll take that as a yes, was it about your kidnap? You said "help" in your dream. - Sun Dec  6 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Mmk.. - Sun Dec  6 05:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: S-She is messing with me. . .she doesn't care. .  - Sun Dec  6 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Are you okay..? - Sun Dec  6 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .Y-Yea. . fine. Stop worrying about me. - Sun Dec  6 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I can't help it, sorry. - Sun Dec  6 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: . . .  - Sun Dec  6 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Ah huh. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I want to sleep. . .I'm so tired. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Are you sure you don't at least want a blanket over there? This place isn't very insulated. - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I won't move you this itme. - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I-I Said I'm fine! - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Tch. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: If that was the truth you wouldn't have been begging for help in your sleep. - Sun Dec  6 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I-I'm fine. . . - Sun Dec  6 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) sighed; she felt like she wasn't getting anywhere!* - Sun Dec  6 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) could notice the fatigue on her this time around. She was -really- debating if she wanted to move the girl this time around... or do what she did before. It was really tempting... she looked so.. at peace, and not paranoid.* - Sun Dec  6 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: If she wakes up on her own she'll get suspicious. - Sun Dec  6 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) sighed, stripping one of the beds of it's blanket. She walked over to the girl, gently coiling the blanket around her then returning to her original spot, glancing at her periodically while she silently sat and thought.* - Sun Dec  6 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) approached Saika. She was a little unsure about what to do at this point. Amaya would lean forth, embracing the sleeping girl. The entirety of the blueish-white haired female's body was cold, but it was physical support for whatever Saika was going through. She whispered some calming words to her. "It's just a bad dream... it's over...long gone.. and it won't happen again.. you're safe with me." She'd state this regardless if the girl was awake or could even hear this.* - Sun Dec  6 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) was astonished by the heat that was immersing Saika. She was surprised by how tensed her msucles were. She checked her pulse after she stopped moving shortly after her cry out in pain. Amaya would rest on the pillow beside her, pulling Saika into her lap and pulling her close. The blueish-white haired female felt ashamed that she could take care of one troubled girl she met -today- better than she could an entire village....* - Sun Dec  6 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) was about to let go of Saika, until she noticed the look on her face. The girl looked the most peaceful she'd ever seen her. Thus, Amaya changed her mind, simply continuing to hold her close and provide her with warmth. Of course, the blanket was still around her frame, but it was distributed between both of them this time around.* - Sun Dec  6 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) couldn't help but enjoy this demeanor emanating from Saika for now, because she knew it'd be completely different when she'd wake up. There'd be plenty of questions needing to be answered, but for now that was set aside. This time around someone else's well being was more relevant to her than her own.* - Sun Dec  6 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) was almost... creeped out by this sweet, girliness. She felt a little uncomfortable being squeezed consistently by Saika, but this was nothing but an act out of kindness and affection, no? Amaya knew that at this point Saika just had a really cold, evasive exterior, but a warm, ordinarily feminine interior.* - Sun Dec  6 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) smiled down at the girl, continuing to hold her close beneath the blanket. She rested her chin atop the female's head. * - Sun Dec  6 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) smiled down at Saika, remaining as silent as ever.The blanket remained draped over the girl's form.* - Sun Dec  6 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) frowned, knowing this was bound to come.

"It's not like I did anything other than cuddle you."* - Sun Dec  6 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled. Her mood had lightened over months of being of being in Konoha and having time to live in peace. Maybe that was why she was supportive of Saika. There wasn't really a response to be given.* - Sun Dec  6 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) would respond with the best of her ability.

"You started saying things in your sleep... and I didn't want to wake you up again so I attempted to help you get through whatever you were experiencing while you were asleep. After that I stayed here with you to make sure you wouldn't start having a hard time resting again."

"And for the record, physical interaction doesn't hurt if it helps calm you down."* - Sun Dec  6 18:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) shrugged.

"I failed to help people and things in the past... and you're another person that I can take the chance of helping. So, I'll do that regardless of how hard it is."

"I mean calm you down as in get you through experiences that you can't handle on your own."* - Sun Dec  6 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) sighed.

"Plenty. I wanted to help people, but I failed to. I want to help you, I'm simply hoping I don't fail at that either."

"If there was nothing wrong you wouldn't have been saying disturbing things in your sleep.... and I wouldn't have come over here."* - Sun Dec  6 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) sighed, remaining silent.* - Sun Dec  6 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: A-Amaya. . . - Sun Dec  6 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Mm? - Sun Dec  6 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I'm only going to say this once. . . - Sun Dec  6 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: T-Thank you. - Sun Dec  6 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: You're welcome, Saika. Anytime. - Sun Dec  6 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hmph. . . - Sun Dec  6 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I-I still don't like people. . .or y-you. - Sun Dec  6 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Like I've said, I'm okay with that. - Sun Dec  6 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: How can this girl be so accepting?? - Sun Dec  6 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I stll don't understand you. A-And move away already. - Sun Dec  6 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) stood up, wrapping the rest of the blanket around her. Amaya retreated to her original position.* - Sun Dec  6 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Mm.. - Sun Dec  6 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hmph. - Sun Dec  6 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Perhaps. . .I'll go buy some tea at the ramen stand. . . - Sun Dec  6 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Going to the shop, I'll be back. . .or meet me there. - Sun Dec  6 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Whichever. - Sun Dec  6 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) stepped into the shop, sitting with her back to the owner.

"One bowl of miso ramen." Her elbows rested on the edge of the counter, and her eyes were closed.* - Sun Dec  6 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) spun in her seat, beginning to eat her bowl of ramen slowly.* - Sun Dec  6 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) continued consuming her bowl of ramen, taking a look at Saika briefly now and then.* - Sun Dec  6 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Mhm.. how's the tea? - Sun Dec  6 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Good. . . - Sun Dec  6 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Nice. - Sun Dec  6 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Mhm. . . - Sun Dec  6 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . Well. - Sun Dec  6 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Want to go back? - Sun Dec  6 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) was done eating by now.* - Sun Dec  6 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Um. . .I dunno. - Sun Dec  6 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Another person. . .mister pervert. - Sun Dec  6 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Whoopie. - Sun Dec  6 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuusei(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Oi, calm your gears.. No need to get worked up. - Sun Dec  6 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) peered at Saika.* - Sun Dec  6 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) lashed her right arm out, attempting to clasp his hand and address him with her fiery, orange gaze.

"She has no intentions of interacting with you, stop."

Amaya's voice was calm, but she was serious. Her half-lidded stare made it hard to discern her true intentions in this action.* - Sun Dec  6 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) simply sighed nonchalantly, her eyes coming to a close. Suddenly, chakra surged from her body. It wasn't normal, raw chakra, it was kneaded... into pure Raiton. A vicious emittance of Raiton-based chakra would zap Ryuusei, as well as the strange thing that lie on his back in bandages.

It was a basic technique, but such a highly experienced Ninjutsu Specialist such as herself could turn it into a deadly technique without batting an eye.

"Shin'eh."

Her words were cold, and so would his corpse be, in time.* - Sun Dec  6 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) whispers: (let me know in OOC or over skype when ur back. "theeternaluchiha" = my skype) - Sun Dec  6 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Hm.. - Sun Dec  6 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Ready to leave. . . - Sun Dec  6 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh.. - Sun Dec  6 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Let's go. - Sun Dec  6 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh yeah. - Sun Dec  6 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Stop. - Sun Dec  6 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: -What-? - Sun Dec  6 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There's no such person as "Akira".. - Sun Dec  6 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Then your Hokage hasn't checked well enough. - Sun Dec  6 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So the real question is.. - Sun Dec  6 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Why were you lying? - Sun Dec  6 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Wasn't. - Sun Dec  6 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..you certainly aren't giving all of the truth. - Sun Dec  6 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Sun Dec  6 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: So.. - Sun Dec  6 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You're technically, getting yourself into trouble. - Sun Dec  6 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: This is why I hate people. . . - Sun Dec  6 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Can't I just be left alone? With some tea. . .and a book? - Sun Dec  6 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: There's only one rule in this village, and that's to not cause trouble and get along with everyone. - Sun Dec  6 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: You're breaking it. - Sun Dec  6 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: There are many rules in this village. - Sun Dec  6 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: YOu're speaking bullshit about security that doesn't exist. - Sun Dec  6 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Shoo. - Sun Dec  6 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What? - Sun Dec  6 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: This isn't going to end well. - Sun Dec  6 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I don't know where you've been raised, but that isn't how you speak to higher ups in this village. - Sun Dec  6 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I honestly do not care about your past with the previous Hokage. - Sun Dec  6 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: A dead man is just that. - Sun Dec  6 22:40:12 2015
