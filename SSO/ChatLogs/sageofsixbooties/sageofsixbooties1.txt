<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) looked toward the white haired female whom seemed to be sulking over Kojiro's corpse. She'd peer at the two corpses, attempting to obtain the attention of any remaining, high-ranking personnel within Kumogakure no Sato. The white haired girl would eagerly hand over the corpses to authority, intending to get them buried in a sufficient vicinity that wouldn't put them in risk of being stolen in the future. Most likely in a vault, if one existed.

She'd proceed to glimpse at the blonde haired female. Approaching Lyala, she'd crouch down beside her, discerning her frame. "Are you okay?" The twenty-two year old would question, simply there for moral support.* - Fri Oct  9 03:53:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) nodded. She'd clasp the female's hands, pulling her onto her back. With a small groan resonating from the snowy haired girl, the kimono-wearing individual would guide Lyala to her own home. The hospital was most likely destroyed within the invader's furious attack.* - Fri Oct  9 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, that won't happen to me. - Fri Oct  9 04:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: I'm a shinobi of Kumogakure. I'm taking her to my house so she can rest. She's battered up. - Fri Oct  9 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: H-Hideki.... take me to your home.... - Fri Oct  9 04:02:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) approached Hideki, removing the girl from her back and handing Lyala off to him.* - Fri Oct  9 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: I hope you didn't think I had malicious intentions. - Fri Oct  9 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You never know nowadays.. - Fri Oct  9 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: I'm loyal to Kumogakure. I never, and never will betray my comrades. - Fri Oct  9 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Easier said than done. - Fri Oct  9 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: That's a self-rule I'll abide by. Especially if I plan on becoming Raikage some day. - Fri Oct  9 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Right. - Fri Oct  9 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Come along, Ambrocio. - Fri Oct  9 04:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) directed a healing pill toward Niza, unless he wasn't conscious to swallow it without choking.

"Senzu Bean---"

oh he's dead.* - Fri Oct  9 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: -omit- - Fri Oct  9 04:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) observes this take place with her arms folded, shaking her head.

<A medic incapacitating her own shinobi.. and relying on a -child- to check someone's pulse. Even if he can do it... dumb. She even decided to abandon that blonde. Dumb. She has the techniques to make up for her mental incompetence.>

The white haired, ponytail adorning female would exit the doorway, shaking her head and closing her pair of fiery eyes. The news of Niza's death saddened her, but it didn't impact her enough to traumatize her, luckily. <This village's in bad shape.> She'd state, thinking about the casualties, the destruction, and now the death of their beloved leader.* - Fri Oct  9 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) entered the room, her arms folding beneath her chest. She narrowed her orange pair of eyes at the turn of events between Lyala and Hideki, sighing lightly while leaning against the door to the traditional, japanese home. She'd announce the news to them in her light, slightly deep, matured tone.

"The Raikage's dead. One of our shinobi is injured because of the medic. Four venomous bites. Unconscious immediately, not sure if the victim's dead. Anyways, I'll be leaving." She'd state, attempting to rest her palm upon Nina's shoulder. The seemingly stoic, silver haired woman would leave shortly afteer.* - Fri Oct  9 04:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled. She showed no intimidation to Hideki's odd pair of red eyes.

"With Niza and the unconscious girl. The medic is the one who did it. Don't do anything rash." The snowy haired woman would state, just in case he intended to kill the medic.* - Fri Oct  9 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Take me to her....I do what I wish, woman. - Fri Oct  9 04:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: Go to her on your own. I have business to attend to. Go ahead and add to the kill count, see just how worse Kumogakure gets from it. - Fri Oct  9 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: There're right in the other bedroom. - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's already gone down to shit since Ushinawa died. - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: Don't know who that is. - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Shame. - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) says: Gonna go see who's alive. - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I won't go, Heiwa. I promise. - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) stepped back, allowing the door to slide closed.* - Fri Oct  9 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Xia Ping(Sage of Six Booties) glimpsed at Genesis.

"I'm sorry for your loss." She'd refer to Kojiro, then keep on walking. She was surveying the village for -any- survivors of the attack.* - Fri Oct  9 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I'm going to go train. - Fri Oct  9 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled lightly. The white haired, dark-skinned female would suddenly begin to surge her chakra. Having applied a decent amount of chakra surged to her frame, she would knead the surging chakra into pale, whiteish-blue chakra. Sparks danced around her frame rapidly. Such sparks were short lived due to her lack of mastery of the Lightning Release technique.* - Fri Oct  9 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) started to regather the chakra she lost from utilizing the unmastered technique. As someone who dedicated a majority of her life to trying to become more proficient at Lightning Release, she wasn't going to give up with hardcore training because of her lack of mastery with a technique. The white haired female would surge her chakra suddenly. She'd proceed to knead the chakra into whiteish-blue sparks, releasing the sparks in an immense, omnidirectional stream around her figure.

Amaya would exhale lightly. She'd then proceed to sit down on her butt, folding her legs. After a sufficient time of resting, the dark-skinned girl would form one handsign. Having formed the single handsign, the Raitori family member would spill a mild-volume of water in the form of a stream. The stream would go a noticeable difference, before sloping downward and simply pattering against the tiles of the training grounds. She'd sit back down, starting to rest again.* - Fri Oct  9 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) stood up, exhaling. Her fiery pair of orbs shifted throughout the vicinity before she focused her gaze on the area in front of her. Amaya would form a single handsign, gathering a decent portion of chakra in her throat. She'd knead the chakra into water, spewing it from her gullet in the form of a medium-volume, thin stream. The stream sloped out a few inches further than it did before, indicating that she was improving.

Amaya would exhale. She'd slowly start to move forward in what seemed to be a jog. Her momentum progressively improved, becoming a full out dash forward. Once reaching her designated location, a stream of lightning-infused chakra would emit from her figure in all directions. White-ish blue sparks of chakra flowed from her form, soon vanishing.* - Fri Oct  9 21:40:28 2015
