<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) had finally been relieved of a majority of her work. She'd arrive at the training fields, proceeding to remove her hat. The girl would bend her knees slightly, proceeding to punch the air as fast as possible. For such a low-ranked shinobi, her punching speed was basic, but her strength was impressive for someone of her level. * - Mon Oct 12 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) continued throwing a rush of punches at the air in front of her with intentions of making them faster and stronger while she did so. The white haired, dark female had lots on her mind, and the tension that'd built up within every fiber of her body was slowly being let loose as she took out her stress on the area in front of her. She was welll concerned about her own life, but for now she was going to try getting stronger so that one day she could manage to protect her village.* - Mon Oct 12 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) lunged forward at a decent rate of momentum. She'd throw her right arm forth, balling her hand into a tight fist. Her fiery orange gaze had a focal point, and that focal point was the neon-green fence surrounding the torn-up training grounds. She'd throw yet another right hook, proceeding to smack her knuckles against the surface of the fence before receding her arm, heading back toward her original position. She had barely any freetime with this duty.* - Mon Oct 12 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled lightly. She'd place her hat back on, then starting working with whatever she had to do. If only her age benefited her strength... The Yondaime would run her signature throughout papers that involved most political things. She sorted out the mission scrolls by color, D-Ranks serving as Blue, C-Ranks serving as Green, B-Ranks serving as Yellow, A-Ranks serving as Orange and S-Ranks serving as Red. She practically tackled the work that she was provided with, trying to sort out Kumogakure politically and gain the trust of her people before she made anymore moves.

All she had to do now was wait for Kumogakure's economy to improve.* - Mon Oct 12 13:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just internal thoughts coming out. - Mon Oct 12 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled lightly. She'd continue scribbling down on nonexistent paperwork, which was really just her placing her thoughts and ideas for the village's improvement down on paper. She'd press the end of her pin to her plump, upper lip.

"Hn.."* - Mon Oct 12 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I underrestimated this job a bit. I already expected that it'd be difficult.. but damn. - Mon Oct 12 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Something the matter? - Mon Oct 12 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: *Mental sigh* This acting nice thing is a bit old, I'd rather go down with a blaze of glory than continue this bullshit. - Mon Oct 12 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) bit her lip slightly, her fiery orange gaze focused on the paper in front of her at the desk she was sitting at within the center of the crater. She'd lift her gaze up to the male, removing her hat and placing it down to her side.

"Hn? Nothing."* - Mon Oct 12 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Mon Oct 12 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) wrote legibly within what seemed to be a teal scroll. She'd raise her right arm into the air, extending her pointer finger out. A pure white pigeon swooped down, clutching it's talons around her finger. She'd guide her left arm toward the pigeon, holding a scroll within that corresponding hand. The white haired female would set her fiery-gaze upon the bird as she allowed it to become airborn once more, ascending a few inches above her right hand. It's talons clasped around the thin teal scroll.

She'd lower her right arm, pressing her right palm against her cheek, her left palm pressing against the desk as she trained her eyes upon the paper in front of her, reading what she'd written down rather quickly. The Yondaime would run her left hand throughout her robes, plucking a small, circular indigo, opaque pill from the confines of her Raikage robes. She'd stop biting her lip to slide the pill into her mouth, allowing it to rest between her teeth briefly before she pushed it in by pressing her tongue against the half of it that was already past her teeth. She'd suddenly remove a napkin from the desk, shoving her napkin covered hand into her mouth and plucking the pill out.

<I almost wasted that.> She'd think to herself, wiping the pill off between her index finger and thumb. She'd slide the pill into her robes once more, getting rid of said napkin. The female would peer at one of the Chuunin in the vicinity, whisking said Chuunin over and whispering to him about 'Kumogakure' and 'economics'. She'd bite her lip and squint when she heard the male's answer.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) glided her hand throughout the drawer to the desk that she sat behind. The female would retrieve a trio of scrolls, two blue and one green. She'd toss the two scrolls the male's way.* - Tue Oct 13 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) peered at the child with her fiery, orange stare. She'd leave her arms folded behind her back, watching as he approached. The muscled individual paid close mind to the kid. A basic Chuunin stepped past Amaya, extending their hand out to take the scroll. If Heiwa would hand the scroll over to the Chuunin, the Chuunin would slip it open while they were a decent distance from the Yondaime, checking the scroll to ensure that it wasn't some type of trap directed to the recently elected Raikage.* - Wed Oct 14 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) // The Chuunin would hand over said scroll.

The female would squint, biting her lip as she typically did.

"So.. he wants a meeting? Tell Hideki that we've already met; there's no need for yet another conference." She'd remark to the child.* - Wed Oct 14 00:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) scribbled down on paper rather legibly. She'd tuck the paper into a scroll, placing the scroll within the Chuunin's grasp. Said Chuunin would hand the scroll toward the child.

//I wish to withhold a meeting until I know for sure that Kumogakure no Sato and Konohagakure no Sato are in an alliance, as one was proposed between myself and the former Hokage.\\* - Wed Oct 14 01:11:15 2015

The sealing specialist regulating the barrier around the crater would peer at the concealed figure. He was a blonde male with freckles and tanned skin, but that was besides the point. The Chuunin was confident that the girl had no bad intentions, but he could never be sure.

The blonde lifted a single brow before speaking in his husky tone.

The blonde would nod. "C'mon then." He'd state, allowing her access into the barrier. A Chuunin would guide the concealed female to Maloth, whom appeared to be at Amaya's side. Amaya herself was writing in a scroll and sending it off rather frequently.* - Wed Oct 14 01:30:52 2015

It'd tuck the scroll between it's talons, flying off in the direction of the Lightning Daimyo's residence.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) looked at Kuro, gently smiling toward him with grace.

"Yes, that would be me."

She'd focus her orange stare upon Shinjin.

"I wish to readdress matters left behind in Kumo, with more clarity behind my decisions. Could we speak in a caravan, perhaps, to enjoy the fresh air as we speak?"* - Wed Oct 14 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) shook her head in response to Kuro.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: It's in both of our interests that we work together to restore our villages.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: What is to be expected? - Wed Oct 14 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: This sounds more like a trade agreement, not an alliance. - Wed Oct 14 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Mutual defense. - Wed Oct 14 04:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: I will aid with defending your village with the three thousand troops in my possession, in exchange for the same treatment. - Wed Oct 14 04:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taka, Shinjin(Psychic_Warrior) says: A mutual training program? - Wed Oct 14 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Indeed. - Wed Oct 14 04:23:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: Alright. How about this... - Wed Oct 14 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) folded her arms beneath her chest. She'd lean toward the male slightly, her orange irises aiming to pierce his gaze, batting her eyes lightly. She'd push her breasts up with her arms, exposing more of what she had to offer.

"Any favors.. just let me know.." She'd state in a hushed tone.* - Wed Oct 14 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) lightened her seductive ways some. She'd still maintain the 'pose.'

"Hn... now... before I return to Kumogakure... could you perhaps tell the Lightning Daimyo to reinstate to Kumogakure?"* - Wed Oct 14 04:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled lightly. She'd leave a Jounin in her place while she went to attend to other duties. Said Jounin would simply prepare a necessary amount of mission scrolls for any Genin that requested them.* - Wed Oct 14 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) nodded, giving him his reward.* - Wed Oct 14 19:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) shoved her hand into the drawer to her desk, retrieving a pair of blue scrolls, and a single green scroll. She'd place all three on the edge of her desk, allowing Kyushiki to get them. The white haired female would withdraw a green scroll from one of the drawers to her desk, pushing it closed and handing said scroll to Khalil.

"Complete the mission in a timely fashion. If you fail to do so there'll be a penalty on your pay for completion." Amaya would state, her firm, fiery stare focused on the blonde trap as she spoke. She already knew that Kyushiki was efficient with mission completion.

"Also, prepare yourself for two more when you get back." She'd state to Khalil, before returning to non-existent paperwork.* - Thu Oct 15 01:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) nodded toward him.

"Indeed, it did."

She slid her digits between one another, resting her folded hands in front of her lower-face. The female was pleased with the results of her meeting with the Hokage.* - Thu Oct 15 02:58:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) ran her hand throughout the drawer of her desk, withdrawing a green scroll and placing it on the desk's edge. She'd press her fingers between one another, pressing the sides of her hands to her lower-face.

"Oh? Her and her troopless village can suffer if they decide not to align themselves because of her opinions, shifted greatly by her own paranoia. Her paranoia will be the downfall of her village."* - Thu Oct 15 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: She's inexperienced, but in due time I believe that she'll be able to lift her village back up. - Thu Oct 15 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: As for the mission, what will I be doing? - Thu Oct 15 03:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I already did show you. - Sat Oct 17 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) coursed a thin layer of chakra throughout her figure. The chakra was kneaded in the form of white-ish blue sparks which danced around her frame. It seemed that she was showing a brief, watered-down preview of a basic jutsu in the branch of Lightning Release.* - Sat Oct 17 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: That jutsu's rather efficient.. - Sat Oct 17 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Psychic_Warrior) says: Both of you, attempt this technique. - Sat Oct 17 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hana(BoyFlareon) says: I guess. - Sat Oct 17 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled lightly. The female recalled the manner in which Shinjin had produced the spark of electricity from his hands. She bit her inner cheek while she recalled the event, taking advantage of her photographic memory. The female would slowly course a rather-levelled source of chakra to her hands. She'd clasp her hands together as Shinjin did.

The white haired individual would slowly knead the chakra into a lightning-based substance. Amaya's main intentions were none other than to generate electricity and course it through her hands. Even though she was an experienced individual when it came to learning, it seemed that wasn't enough. Her orange stare came to a narrow as she found that despite processing the kneaded chakra through her hands it didn't share the same result as when Shinjin performed the tactic. Her hands would part.

She'd try to resolve the 'errors' of her thoughts by telling herself that she should've expected that it wouldn't work on her first try. None the less, her failures as usual, only influenced her to try even harder with her next opportunity. This was a recurring attribute, even a trait, to her personality. The female would bite her lip, pressing her hands together once more.

From deep inside her, her reserves became active. Chakra coursed throughout her hands once more. This time she'd refine the manner in which she utilized the chakra. Amaya furrowed her brow in deep concentration, allowing the effervescence to balance itself within her hands. Slowly, bit by bit her chakra began to knead itself into a lightning-natured manner.

Amaya pressed her hands as close together as possible. The moment she started to notice the balance within the chakra flowing to her hands she'd increase her focus. She practically gave herself tunnel-vision with her immense concentration on the task at hand. She almost applied a lightning-based property to the entirety of the chakra being coursed to her hands.

Now, she'd attempt to generate her own electrical reaction, mimicking what Shinjin had did. The white haired girl would hide her relief as she saw the thin, whiteish-blue sparks dance along the surface of the tanned epidermis of her hands. The sparks would dart outward from her hands periodically to zap at the air. Her orange gaze would drift up to Shinjin as she continued regulating the chakra.* - Sat Oct 17 03:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) drifted her gaze up at Maloth.

"I've been doing work concerning my title rather than sleeping. How do you expect to do the work I've been doing without the required skills?" She'd state; She folded her arms beneath her chest, awaiting for the male's answer while keeping her fiery orange gaze on him.

The guards simply retained their positions, though they were on high alert.* - Sun Oct 18 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) pursed her lips, narrowing her gaze.

"You're already chief. I'm the Raikage. I'm the brains, you're the brawn. You lead the army, I do the paperwork. You're the chief of Kumogakure's army as I've said before, are you not?"* - Sun Oct 18 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) shook her head.

"You'd be Raikage if you had the required assets. You lack them. That's why -I'm- Raikage and you're the military chief. You lead the army when it goes outside of the village, and you take care of their health when they're inside."* - Sun Oct 18 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) 

"Come to your senses."

Amaya would simply state, slowly standing to her feet. The taijutsu specialist that Maloth lumbered at would remain unhostile, looking up at the male with agape eyes.

"Do you even know what purpose you have in usurping me?" Her voice didn't falter at all. Guards would continue to block Maloth's path from her, if not stop him from continuing forward.* - Sun Oct 18 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I'd have handed this title to him in the first place if he could fuckin'read. Or write for that matter. - Sun Oct 18 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) approached the male with what could be described as a calm gaze. She'd look up to him with her fiery orbs. Reasoning without offering something didn't seem to be the way to go in this situation. She assessed the situation enough by now, and she was well-aware that there were certain requirements to it. She shifted her firm gaze back to her guards, extending her right arm in an action that meant for them not to attack. From that point the white haired female would set her attention on him.

"I will hereby grant you the ability to assign missions and utilize village intercoms. End my life here if that is not sufficient enough to quench your demand for more power." Amaya was completely serious about her statement. She remained calm, knowing that she was standing right at death's door.

<May I burn in hell for my inefficiency as the Yondaime if I die here and now.>* - Sun Oct 18 02:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) bat her eyes, allowing a half-lidded facial expression to accentuate her normally emotionless features. She was certain that it was her time to die at this point in time, but none the less she had been spared. An exhale escaped her mouth as she peeked from the side of Maloth's massive frame, peering at the male whom had recently spoke behind him. He was slightly familiar to her.

"Several thousand monks took their departure due to their allegiance with Niza no longer applying. In addition, the shinobi that flee'd during Kenshin's attack have yet to return." She'd slip to Maloth's side, then behind the male, standing a few steps away from Yukio.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) tapped against the village intercommunication mic.

"All available Kumogakure personnel report to the edge of the crater. Stay in position if you're already within the area." She'd state. Once seeing a sufficient gathering of shinobi the white haired woman would exhale, then lurch her head forth, proceeding to speak. Goose bumps consumed her skin, and she was rather nervous. It was her first time doing a speech, afterall.

"We've survived the storm, now for the recovery. Regardless of what separates us, we're Kumogakure shinobi. We either stand together or we fall alone. Rise up and take the stand to aid -your- village, the Village Hidden in Clouds."

She'd go silent, awaiting for the response of Kumogakure's population. She'd pray it was positive.* - Tue Oct 20 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) frowned. She noticed that such "encouragement" wouldn't suffice. The female took another step forth, speaking into the mic.

"There's one thing that I want. And that's the success of our people. Before -we- as a population can receive that success we need the resources to fund it. I will utilize any funds that I attain to work on rebuilding the village. After that? Funds will go to providing shinobi with what they -need-. Weaponry, supplies, medicine, all of that. However. it is out of my power to get the necessary fortune alone to do so."

"As the Yondaime Raikage, no, as your fellow shinobi, Amaya of the Raitori family, I pray that you all may aid Kumogakure no Sato." The white haired female would state, peering at her nation for the slightest sign of reaction. She'd step away from the mic, turning it off. Her stoic, fiery gaze awaited.* - Tue Oct 20 02:03:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) exhaled lightly. She'd proceed to speak to all of her higher-ranks. In what seemed to be a mass migration, Amaya, her desk, all of the guards and other things were moved outside of the crater. The hat-wearing female would discuss rebuilding plans with several construction workers. Their tones were hushed, but key words, such as 'mountain', 'mansion', 'fill', 'crater' and 'rebuild' could be heard. She'd sign the contract necessary, and provide the needed funds.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) addressed Xon with a nod, an orange-orbed glance and a simple statement. Her arms were folded and her lips were pursed.

"Indeed, I am the Raikage." Her voice was rather composed. Her stare wouldn't drift from Xon, though she was already aware of the presence of the masked, white-haired male, in addition to Baen.* - Fri Oct 23 01:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Raikage**(Sage of Six Booties) lifted a white-colored brow at Xon's words. She'd never considered a treaty between Kumogakure and Amegakure, but why not have one? She'd allow him to know she acknowledged his words with a faint nod, her eyes drifting from him, trained on the ground below. Her gaze would drift upright once more.

"I'll gladly accept an alliance; no strings attached."

The Raikage would eagerly await the ambassador's response. She had a slightly laidback stance to her frame, and it seemed that she was incredibly calm. While some could consider that lacksadaisical, the more intuitive could see that she had the calm and collected attitude necessary for more tensed aspects of leadership.* - Fri Oct 23 01:32:09 2015
