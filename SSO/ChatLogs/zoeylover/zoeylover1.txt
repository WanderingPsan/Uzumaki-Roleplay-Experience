<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) opened her visible eye and shifted her gaze towards Yuriko, recognizing her face.

"That's the bitch that attacked Kirigakure . . .-- Hn . . Rias is on the move." She thought to herself, silently following the two by leaping from tree-branch to . . Tree branch, yh.* - Sat Dec 12 04:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) bursted through the door just before the barrier had been constructed, her visible gaze fixating upon the  black haired female/male that stood before her. She took a quick glance at Rias who was recently placed upon the cushion before returning her attention back to Ai. The redhead placed a hand upon her hip and took a single step forward.

"Hello, Ai."* - Sat Dec 12 04:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) shrugged as she walked further into the house, coming across a table with a plant pot ontop. Her attention shifted towards it, placing her index finger and thumb onto a single leaf of the plant as she slightly smiled.

"Well, you know me, I'm always up for the stalking and then killing." She'd say while her visible eye once again shifted back towards the black haired. "So, how's you and that cat?" She'd ask with her head slightly tilted.* - Sat Dec 12 04:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) tilted her head to the side and decided to show Ai instead of speaking about it. A malicious source of chakra coursed around her form, turning into smouldering, translucent aura. The flaring aura was teal, of course as Ai was able to sense she'd notice that it wasn't exactly her chakra but instead the chakra of the beast within her. Her pupils grew less dialated, and became a golden tone glancing towards Ai fiercly.

At this point the chakra around her began forming bubbles which ascended into the air and dispersed constantly. A single tail was formed along her body, swaying from side to side-- of course it was in a strange form unlike a normal tail, it appeared in the same form as the Three Tailed's one.

"Looking good, I suppose."

The redhead took steps forward while slightly distancing herself from both Ai and Rias. * - Sat Dec 12 04:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) simply leapt backwards and formed nine handseals in a swift pace with her eyes narrowing towards Ai. As she was able to sense, she'd notice that Kana built up massive amounts of chakra, clearly one needed for advanced ninjutsu-- an A-Ranked technique. However she didn't do anything just yet, she'd stay stationed where she was.

"Oh you know . . A few coins . . Food . .-- And Hokage. Hand over Rias, Ai . . If I use this technique believe me when I say this house and our surroundings will turn into an ocean and I'd rather not have sweet Rias die. I have a great advantage over you, I can release my enormous turtle partner and having him destroy this village-- I don't think you understand how much of an advantage I have over you. So . . . Pass her over."

Her hands remained joined together on the last seal. She coursed chakra to her feet, it was clear that Kana wasn't in the mood for fighting but if she was forced to . . Yunnoe.* - Sat Dec 12 05:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) 's tail swayed from side to side as Ai tried to reason her way with Kana, she had nothing against Ai personally though it seemed as if she'd need to use force to take Rias. Almost immediately an enormous amount of water was created around her frame in a circular motion. The technique was usually used by a pre-existing source however with the amount of chakra Kana currently had, she was able to exert her chakra into the surroundings and convert it into water as a use. Her lips pressed into a thin line as the amounts constantly begun multiplying, she had no clue that Ai had requested for help but even so she knew that she could take on anyone that came her way-- especially with the ocean that was to be formed by this technique.

She decided not to use anymore words as chakra coursed to the soles of her feet and without any hesitation the large scale of water was sent forth in a spiralling motion towards Ai. The enormous force and pressure of the technique exceeding Kana's expectations as she hadn't use it in her one-tailed state. The technique seemed almost avoidable due to the range and Ai being in the middle, also the speed at which it went at was also exceptional. As soon as it collided with Ai's frame, she'd be sent off unable to escape from the spiralling vortex technique. The pressure of the technique itself is able to leave the opponent unable to move and if they're body was extremely weak, practically kill them with sheer force.

The technique would collide against the frame of the wall and destroy it upon impact, allowing it to continue on. If they were still sucked into the spiralling vortex of the technique by this time, it'll venture on to colliding against the large outer wall of Konohagakure. The pressure of the technique would weaken by then so upon impact of the outer wall it'd simply settle down leaving an aftermath of a lake almost.

". . . . . Should've listened." She'd mumble beginning to sprint her way through the destroyed wall and eastward.* - Sat Dec 12 05:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) narrowed her eyes as she made it out, the 'natural disaster' was bound to draw people in, especially ones that she wanted to avoid. A slight sigh was released from her lips as she regretted coming into Konohagakure. However her escape was halted by an agent stationed in the air upon a familiar platform she recognized. 

She stood still as her eyes narrowed, her head tilting slightly-- it certainly did bring back memories however now wasn't the time to go through memory lane. She was once again about to kick off into a full sprint until she saw his transformation, the sand covering half of his frame and with that she placed two and two together though it seemed as he appeared before her as an enemy rather than an ally.

She watched as the large fist was materialized above his head and was sent towards her in attempt to crash into her frame. Despite the fact that it was moving at a fast pace, she knew she was able to avoid it by using the techniques in her arsonal. Swiftly she'd form a couple of handseals and release a jet of water with large pressure while kicking off the ground, this way she was forced backwards avoiding the large fist. Though knowing Tetsumi, he was able to control where exactly the fist could move meaning that she needed to remain a grave distance away.

Her lips pressed together as she subconscious asked for the assistance of Sanbi which was granted as he slipped his chakra out to help her. At that point she felt everything darkened around her, she was warned about tapping further into his power but she didn't exactly have a choice. She aimed to enter her Second Version state producing a mass amount of teal chakra around her in an enormous dome type. 

Once it dispersed it revealed her on all fours, the chakra now wrapped around her body in a layer somewhat form. The chakra being a dark teal, almost black color and two tails formed along her tail bone smashing against the ground continuously. Her eyes were circular and was glowing pure white and her mouth opened releasing steamy chakra almost. Her gaze shifted towards Tetsumi as her eyes narrowed,  it was time for shit to go down.* - Sat Dec 12 07:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) was in control of the form, well-- not complete control instead only slightly. Her first response to his words were her tails slapping against the ground and once she did so, she pushed off the ground leaping towards the tree above her in attempt to escape the sand. However that wasn't the true purpose of doing this, her hands stretched forth taking a hold of a branch using it to pull herself away even faster yet she didn't let go.

Once she flew passed the branch, she tilted her body backwards and her streched out hands remained around it refusing to let go and at this point it was clear what Kana's motive was. She stretched herself backwards as far as she could and used herself as a slingshot towards Tetsumi with enormous speed. As she had slight control, she knew how his sand worked-- in a way where it automatically protects him which meant she'd have to catch him with speed.

She shot forth somewhat like a rocket releasing the branch as soon as she passed it. It also worked in her favor as Nigen moved to stop Tetsumi from his actions thus distracting him. Her fist propelled forth and grew in size largely aiming to collide against his frame, the size of the fist being slightly larger than his body.* - Sat Dec 12 08:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) narrowed her eyes as the iron wall was formed, she possibly could've broken through it however Kana used her slight control as an advantage. Almost instantly the large chakra fist decreased in size back to it's original and at the same time, her other hand shot forward. She aimed to grasp onto the wall of sand at the same time and propell herself forth even more, though it was only a quick grasp-- the fact that he could manipulate the sand had her worried. In this case, she'd completely fly passed Tetsumi overhead inwhich her eyes would notice Yuriko and Osuda sitting against the fence.

It was slightly annoying that she was still airborne-- ah well. As her lips parted ways, a massive amount of water gushed out in a jet like-form in attempt to collide against the two below. After doing so, she'd tilt her body so that her head was facing upwards which would give her an advantage in falling faster. She'd aim to land on all fours and immediately take movement towards the walls of Konohagakure.* - Sat Dec 12 08:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) was running along the lake that she had technically formed and she used this as her advantage. She lifted herself up so that she was instead running on her feet rather than all fours and began forming handseals with her feet hands swiftly. It was a quick succession and it was possible due to her relationship with her tailed beast. As she landed on the last one, she once again went back to running while she manipulated, gathered and created water to circle around her.

She was once again using the technique however this one being exceptionally more powerful as she was in her Version Two state and not only this, she had chakra in her reserves to spare. The exetremely enormous-sized amount of water was sent spiralling towards Tetsumi aiming to collide against his frame and send him off flying, in all honesty if his guard was able to tank then it was nearly impossible to kill the motherfucker.

In anycase, she continued running towards the wall. She was practically near enough to climb it, both hands would stretch forth in attempt to grasp the top of the wall and aim to use her as a slingshot to fly her over. Fuck fighting that demonic nigga.* - Sat Dec 12 09:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) twisted her body around, her hand remained grasped ontop of the wall aiming to pull her over with speed-- the only way that she was going to escape if she could escape both the Tsunami and hand. Her lips parted ways as once more water propelled from her mouth almost with absolute force, she applied a high amount of chakra to amplify the force and send herself back. Of course whether or not it worked was down to Uptown.

In anycase if she was caught by the sand, she'd be burried within with no place to turn to.* - Sat Dec 12 09:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) made it over the walls of Konohagakure successfully and now entered the outskirts. She was about to land on a branch before she suddenly felt the chakra begin to leave her and she drifted off into an exhausted state. Almost immediately she was shifted unconscious and collided into the tree branches, hopefully cushioned by the leaves before she fell and hit the ground. Her skin was peeled off by the chakra leaving her ug- ew I dont want to describe it.* - Sat Dec 12 09:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) 's visible eye shot upon, she'd immediatey back up against the tree as her gaze shifted around her surroundings before finally landing upon Tetsumi. Of course it was slightly blurry however eventually her sight fixated on him. Her head tilted to the side as she desperately tried to remember the last thing which happened however her mind was playing games.

"What do you want?" She'd question, beginning to stand to her feet.* - Sat Dec 12 10:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) narrowed her eyes.

"I'll stop attacking when you stop attacking Kumogakure with Sunagakure." She'd respond. She had remembered and recognized Tetsumi due his his clothing, voice and also the iron sand ropes though she didn't anything about it-- after all he was acting like a dick.* - Sat Dec 12 10:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) winked towards Sanoke with a sly smile.

"That sounds like the start of a love story, not the end of one." She'd say before swiftly joining her hands together to form a single seal in such a swift pace that possibly would've left Sanoke unable to react.

It was a new technique to her but it certainly was useful at moments like these. She kneaded her chakra within her and converted it into water before releasing it at once. Her lips parted ways and the water was released excessively fast, chakra was coursed to the soles of her feet allowing her to access the suimen technique. The water came out in waves propelling her upwards while it moved out in a omnidirectional way, mostly being manipulated to go eastward and westward.

Her aim was to wash away Sanoke all the guards, possibly flood Sunagakure and the desert while she was at it as the amount of water that was released was enough to form a large ocean. Once all the water was released, Kana didn't waste a second into diving into the ocean that was produced as it was the safest option. She didn't bother to make it into a water prison, she needed to wait an extra turn for that but she was planning on making her escape.

"See you."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) // Rudely, Sanoke decided to trap her inside a fricking dome, what a noob.

She shifted her gaze around as a dome was formed though she didn't stop her technique and allowed it to continue flowing. It'd eventually fill up the dome and cause it to explode due to the pressure allowing the water once again to travel in waves in an omniversal direction. It was time for her to make her escape once again.

She formed a series of handseals in a fast pace, that being of five and formed a shark around her frame from the water surrounding her. Her hand was extended forth as an order for it to swim away, due to her being inside the shark she too was carried off. 

The swimming speed of the shark was amazing and it was clear she was going to make an escape, however her eyes remained upon Sanoke through the small ocean that was formed-- it was blurry but she could see his frame. Due to having no idea what he was capable of.* - Sun Dec 13 09:12:03 2015

It was time for her to make her escape once again.

However before she could do anything, she was greeted by an enormous turtle, annoyingly enough. As soon as she saw the turtle's leg lift up into the air, she sweatdropped-- it was fairly obvious what was about to happen and so she did decided to fight back. In a mere subconscios second she requested help from the three-tailed turtle within and it was granted.

He poured his malicious chakra out to her allowing it to cloak around her frame. A tail was formed along the end of her body from the teal chakra and her eyes shifted into a golden tone. She'd swiftly leap up into the air aiming to escape the range of the Earthquake and at the SAME time form a single handseal, the exact one she formed before. At this point, she just had to keep flooding until Sanoke let her go.

"I can do this all day, I have so much chakra in my reserves, love." She thought to herself.

She built up her chakra once more and released yet another large wave upon Sunagakure and the enormous turtle aiming to wash both him and Sanoke away. It was kind of strange fighting a summon from your own summoning race. However inside of launching the water southward so it spaced out in all directions, she aimed it towards Sanoke so at the same time-- the force of the water would push her back and away.
