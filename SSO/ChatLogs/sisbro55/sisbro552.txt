<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Sisbro55) started to form seveal handsigns. He started to mold katon chakra within his bodies system. And upon completeing the hand signs, his chest expanded slightly, Takuma, opened his maw, and out he sent forth a large fireball jutsu, that went straight toward the water he was near. Once it impacted with the water's surface. It obviously got extinguished by the water, having a steamy mist appear around his natural area. 

By the time Takuma was done doing this, he was on one knee. The technique obviously drained him. He was panting, and sweat was already dripping from his face. "..Man...I need to work on my chakra reserves..." he stated to himself. He decided to take a quick break from practicing jutsu from now. Considering the amount of chakra he just wasted, he needed the break. It seems like he's limited for only one per use.

For now anyway.* - Mon Nov  9 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Sisbro55) started to meditate, he needed to regain the chakra he just lost. If anything, by now, Takuma needed to think strategically about how he'd use his jutsu's in combat for right now. Considering, he was limited one per use with his Fireball Jutsu. The amount of chakra he lost while performing the jutsu was indeed great. But then again, he needed to work hard if he wanted to be the best. Takuma, stopped meditating, and slowly got up.

He then, stated to once again, form the hand signs for the Fireball technique. Katon chakra started to mold within his bodies system. And after he finished the hand signs, his chest once again expanded. He opened his maw, and out came forth a large Fireball, that once again. Came crashing down into the water's he was near. Once it made impact, it got extinguished by the water, sending forth a rather misty steam once again around the area.

Takuma, started to pant. "...Damn...." was all he said. Getting down on one knee, he continued to sweat, it dripped from his face. But for now, he'd once again, start to rest. The jutsu, was really taking it's toll on Takuma's body. It was offical now, he really did need to think about his chakra consumption.* - Mon Nov  9 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Sisbro55) got up from being on one knee. And made his way back toward the Kirigakure Square. And once he reached that location, he would sit down on one of the benches there. He was pretty tired from training his Fireball technique, he needed to work on his chakra reserves. Cause god damn, if he was to get into a fight. He would surely lose.* - Mon Nov  9 22:56:00 2015

Takuma, had his hands in his pockets. Readjusting his tanto, he walked toward a nearby tree, leaned his back against it, and looked up at the sky's.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Takuma(Sisbro55) walked into the mansion, and made his way toward the wall, from there, he decided to lean against it. Observing the area infront of him. Although, the current Mizukage that was there, seemed to be resting at his desk, or was he in a daze? Takuma didn't really know which was which. However, his hands remained in his pockets, as he stared at the wooden flooring.* - Thu Nov 12 14:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) walked into the meeting room, hands were in his pockets. He scanned the very room, he noticed the two individuals at the desk infront of him. He also noticed, there were people everywhere. But then again, this was a meeting after all. Yori coughed a bit to clear his throat, then gave his full attention toward the two at the desk.* - Mon Nov 23 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) nodded his head.

<There certainly is a lot of people present right now.> he thought to himself. He took note of their names. Making sure he had them memorized. He just realized, he was still standing, he observed the area trying to find a seat. And when he spotted an open one, he sat on it. He observed the two of them carefully.* - Mon Nov 23 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) listened carefully at Thirteen's words. He raised an eyebrow when he mentioned that no one was to go outside of the island. But then again, he was also right about one thing, the outside world, was definately a threat.* - Mon Nov 23 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
An eyebrow continued to be raised by this point. It seems that Thirteen was taking this very, very seriously. He couldn't blame the boy. He was also right about another thing in his speech, everyone here is definately family, and they had to look out for each other. But a construction process that is going to take ten years to finish? That's a long time.

"Seem's we'll have to be very alert." he muttered to himself.* - Mon Nov 23 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) got up from his seat, and made his way infront of the stage. He was going to apply for the general position. Thirteen, was really good at speeches he found out. The man could definately persuade people if he tried man.* - Mon Nov 23 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) cleared his throat.

"My name is Yori, Fifteen, currently I am the son of a gaurd." he stated this, and coughed shortly after, to once again clear his throat before speaking. "I want to hold the position of General, mainly because at a young age, I was taught to be tough, and stern. I could create training programs for the security gaurds, to help them get stronger, faster, better in all categories. I don't accept failure either. I want the best for our family here at the base." * - Mon Nov 23 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Family. - Mon Nov 23 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: If I fail? I will take direct punishment. The leader, will decide what punishment should be given to me.  - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I eat people who I punish. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Then I will be eaten. - Mon Nov 23 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 23 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) approached the podium.

Once he saw the gaurd hand the male a sword, he knew what was going to happen. He did was he was commanded. He got on his knee's, and looked directly into Thirteen's eyes. If he was to die right here and now, he wanted a good look at his killer. Yori's facial expression, was blank. He accepted death with open arms. And if this was how he was going to die. Then so be it. Not a single word is uttered.* - Mon Nov 23 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: OOooouhh.~ - Mon Nov 23 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
The male's expression, remained the same. It was a blank expression. He accepted death with open arms. When the blade came close toward his neck, he didn't even flinch. He stayed stationary. Remaining on his knees, continuing to stare at Thirteen. "What composes me, is life itself." he stated.* - Mon Nov 23 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) stood up, his hands went into his pockets. His gaze, never once left Thirteen.* - Mon Nov 23 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) bowed respectfully toward Thirteen. 

"You will see that the gaurds in the base, will have increased their strength ten fold. I will not disappoint you." he stated this, continuing to look at Thirteen, his gaze shifted however, toward Yuriko, then back at Thirteen.* - Mon Nov 23 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Too bad I don't want to eat you, I bet you taste good. - Mon Nov 23 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: . . . .Okay then.  . - Mon Nov 23 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: It will be done. - Mon Nov 23 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Tell me of your abilities, Yori, Your past and your motivation. - Mon Nov 23 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: I can manipulate shadows. My past mostly consists of my father constantly yelling at me, telling me to better myself. To non stop train. My motivation, is so that I surpass not only my fathers expectations. But also yours. - Mon Nov 23 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Manipulate...Shadows? - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: And surpass my expectations? - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You flatter me. - Mon Nov 23 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: I try my best. - Mon Nov 23 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: I'm looking forward to it. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: The rest of your day is to yourself. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You start tomorrow. - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) turned on his heels. 

"Understood."* - Mon Nov 23 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) walked outside with a few hundred, to maybe a thousand security gaurds behind him. Yori turned on his heels, taking a glimpse at everyone who was around the area. "Alright maggots. First things first, I'll have each and every one of you. Run some laps around here. And by some laps, I mean one hundred laps in total. Anyone caught cheating, or taking a break, -will- be punished. Do I make myself clear?" he stated this, loud enough for them to hear, his voice booming across the area.

The Security gaurds, got to work, the thousands of security gaurds started to run their laps around the area. Yori, smiled in amusement, he was going to take this General position very seriously. He wanted to whip the security gaurds into shape, and this is -exactly- what he was going to do. Occasionally, he heard grunts from some of the security gaurds, even hearing a few of them sweezing. "I KNOW IT HURTS NOW, BUT YOU'LL BE IN BETTER SHAPE. COME ON, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!" he shouted.

Yori clapped his hands. "IT'S GOING TO BURN, BUT IT WILL BE WORTH IT, COME ON, LET'S GO!" he was trying to persuade the security gaurds in the area, the best way he could. Motivation was always key, and that was definately a key player for the gaurds to like Yori. By now, majority of the gaurds would probably be breaking a sweat.

Yori took out a whistle, and blew on it. It echoed through-out the area before it died down. "Alright, one minute break." Yori kept track of what lap they were on, now, they only had to do about fifty more laps, before they were going to move on to push ups, sit ups, and cruches.* - Mon Nov 23 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) clapped his hands once more, he grabbed his whistle and blew on it. "Alright, break times over. Let's go! Fifty more laps, move it!" And with that, Yori placed his whistle in his pocket, crossed his arms and observed the thousands of security gaurds that were in the area. He was not going to disappoint his leaders, he ment what he said. And he was going to do just that. However, one of the security gaurds stopped.

Out of the thousands of security gaurds that were running and doing laps, -one- security gaurd stopped running. Yori shook his head, he formed a single hand sign, as the base of Yori's shadow, came to life. It quickly made it's way toward the security gaurd that was resting. Once it was done, he reached down to grab a kunai. However, Yori's holister was placed in a different location, so in this case, the security gaurd had a kunai in his hands, to where Yori did not.

The security gaurd, basically mimiced the same principal, the kunai was hovered over his own throat. Yori spoke toward the male. "I told you, no -fucking- breaks. I will release this technique, but next time you take a break. . .Your death will be intimate." he stated. As he made the security gaurd drop the kunai, and he released his shadow, as it retracted back toward his.

The security gaurd that was taking a break, quickly started to get back to running the laps. By now, Yori had a smirk on his face. "Alright, stop! Drop and give me one hundred push ups. Go! Go!" He hoped they complied, if they didn't , then they'd be in some deep shit. But, they complied of course, all the security gaurds dropped down and started to do the push-ups. "I want to hear you guys count! Start!" and with that command, they did so.

The place echoed, as the security gaurds shouted the numbers "One! Two! Three! Four!" Yori smiled, and clapped his hands again. Shortly after clapping, he placed his hands in his pockets.* - Mon Nov 23 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: Good, good. - Mon Nov 23 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: This is turning out nicely. - Mon Nov 23 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
The security gaurds finally finished their push-ups, slowly they stood up, standing at attention, awaiting the General's command on what they should do next. Sweat, was dripping from their entire body, the work outs Yori was giving them, was certainly one they would never forget, and just to think, the punishments Yori had in mind, would definately be worse. 

Yori, cleared his throat to speak once more. "Alright, maggots! Next we're going to do sit ups! I want two hundred fucking sit ups. I don't want no loligaging. If I see you fuckers screwing around, you -will- be punished." he shouted. The security gaurds, looked rather panicked. But none the less, they got down on their bottoms, knees up, arms crossed their chests, and started to perform the sit ups. Panting, and grunting was obviously heard through-out the vast area. It reeked of body odor by this point.

Yori spoke. "Damn, you pussy's need some god damn deodrant! Jesus fucking christ!" he shouted. He continued to clap his hands, this was only for motivation, he tried to get them as pumped up as he could. He scanned the vast area once again, until he spotted yet -another- slacker. I guess they didn't learn the first time.

Yori, quickly performed a single hand sign, the base of his shadow, once again came back to life, as it charged straight toward the slacking security gaurd. Once caught, Yori sighed. "I fucking -warned- you, not to mother fucking slack off! WASN'T I CLEAR!?" he was screaming at the security gaurd, but, Yori couldn't afford to kill security gaurds to get his point across. "I will give you. . .This last. . .Warning. . .This goes for everyone. NO MORE SLACKING OFF!" he stated, his shadow retracted back to his.

He crossed his arms, and continued to watch them, carefully, and throughly.* - Mon Nov 23 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) clapped his hands once more, to get their attention.

"You're all dismissed. Tomorrow, we'll start more of the training." he shouted, as his voice boomed across the area. The thousands of security gaurds, finally got up, sweat dripping all over their body's, and left the area. Yori snapped his fingers for the janitors to listen. "Alright, clean this up gentlemen." he stated, as he walked out of the area.* - Mon Nov 23 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) took out a single shuriken from his back pouch. Carefully, he examined the tool. "I should buy a bigger shuriken." he said to himself. But before he did anything, he placed the shuriken down on the floor. He did a quick set of hand signs, molding chakra within his body's system. Once he finished the hand signs, he picked up the shuriken, and threw it at a near by security gaurds shadow. This, alarmed the security gaurd, but unabled him to move. 

This jutsu, did drain him of his chakra quiet a bit, so sweat was obviously seen on his face. Yori was also panting. The jutsu that was used ont he security gaurd, subsided. The gaurd quickly ran over toward him. "Are you alright General?" Yori, pushed the male to the side. "Of course I am fool!" he struggled to get up, but managed. He went into one of the rooms, to rest for now. The jutsu obviously did a lot to him.

The fact that a gaurd was trying to help him up, seemed to show weakness toward Yori. And he couldn't let them happen. He had to show them that he was no weakling. In fact, he had to show them that he was strong, and stern. Just like how his father was. Although, Yori was one of the gaurds son. So this could come back to bite him in the ass.* - Mon Nov 23 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Sure. - Tue Nov 24 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Ninjutsu is always an option. - Tue Nov 24 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Although, Yuriko, if you don't wish to lean this I can start you on another technique. - Tue Nov 24 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: learn* - Tue Nov 24 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: No, I will learn it. - Tue Nov 24 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ... - Tue Nov 24 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It's a treat. - Tue Nov 24 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Though I didn't know that. - Tue Nov 24 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Is it human? - Tue Nov 24 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It is. - Tue Nov 24 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like real human, or petri dish human? - Tue Nov 24 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Why do they look like marbles? - Tue Nov 24 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) grabbed the scroll.

"Alright, I guess I'll start studying now I guess." he stated, as he slowly unraveled the scroll infront of him. Carefully reading the scrolls details. He didn't know what this stance could do yet, so he guessed studying would probably be the best bet. His eyes, scanned the scroll carefully. Making sure he understood the stance properly. He didn't want to rush reading the scroll, he wanted to take his time.* - Tue Nov 24 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: It may be 'grown', And as for that. Maybe to imitate candy? - Tue Nov 24 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...okay. - Tue Nov 24 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) continued to read the scroll’s contents. He continued to carefully read the information within the scroll. However, in some of the details, it seemed one needed good amount of stamina to even perform this technique. Stamina, that Yori probably didn’t have yet. That could definitely be rearranged if he just trained on his stamina. Yori sighed. He didn’t know what was worse. Reading scrolls, or finding his security guards slacking.

The again, he did teach those security guards a thing or two, he made sure that they were to never slack off again. And if they were to slack off, punishments were to be given. Good times, which reminded Yori, after he was to learn from this scroll, he would definitely start training the security guards. Instead of one hundred laps, they will be doing one hundred and fifty laps. Just to show them that Yori plays no games. 

Yori shook his head, he had to focus, he continued to read the scroll’s information. “Hm. . .” he rolled up the scroll, but before he did this, he placed a bookmark on where he last left off. Yori inhaled, he balled up his fists, he sent straight forward strikes in front of him, his left arm, extended forward, he was basically hitting just the air by this point. He retracted his left arm back. The next strike was with his right arm.

His right arm, extended outward, once again his fist attacked the air. Yori, exhaled, and retracted his right arm. He shifted his gaze toward Thirteen. It seemed he was doing the same exact thing. Yori, spaced his legs apart. He raised his right leg up, at about waist level. Then, he extended his right leg forward, his foot, was faced in a vertical position, when he completed this action.

Yori, slowly retracted his right foot back, and firmly placed it back against the marble flooring. He was panting, this showed that Yori was definitely out of shape, and needed to get back into shape. This could be seen as a weakness in front of the guards, that was, if he was training them right about now. This could not happen. He -definitely- needed to train his stamina, because jesus christ, if he was already tired from just doing that, then he would definitely be fucked in a real fight.

Yori sighed, he sat down on the marble flooring, he took out a water bottle from his back pouch. He slowly, twisted the cap on the water bottle, opening it, and taking a drink from it. “Refreshing. . “ he muttered to himself. He placed the cap back on the water bottle, placing it back in his back pouch. He continued to pant however. This was not an easy task, and even if he learned the technique, it would drain him greatly in combat.

Yori, opened up the scroll once more, and continued to learn from it. Upon reading from the scroll, it seemed one would need great speed, and one's attack speed, would probably need to be vital for this. That was something Yori didn’t have either. Shame, it seemed like he had to work for a lot more right now. He’d have to focus on close combat, he never thought about close combat.
He was so worried about long range abilities, that he completely forgot about close range attacks. And come to think of it, if he was to face off with someone that was good at close range. He would definitely be fucked as well. He would need to work on his reflexive abilities, that would be the second best thing to get, reflex. But, they -were- in a secret location, inside a base, that was unknown to the world.

There was one thing that was on his mind however, he wondered what was outside these walls, he was raised within the base, and trained within the base itself. So he had no idea what it was like outside. Yori shook his head. “I bet it’s nice out there. . “ he muttered to himself. He had better things to do right now, and that was to focus, and read the last part of the scroll, he was just about done.

He was finally on the last paragraph of reading the scroll. He read it carefully, and thoroughly once again. The technique, needed a lot of practice, if anything, Yori would need to practice technique every single day, in order to get the hang of it’s drawbacks. That was something every technique seemed to have. Even his shadow possession jutsu, has it’s drawbacks, and it can take it’s toll.* - Tue Nov 24 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) rolled up the scroll, and walked toward Thirteen. "Finished, here you go." he stated. The technique, would prove it's usefulness, when he would be in combat. And if that day was to ever come, then he would surely atleast give the technique a try, and see how good it truely can be.* - Tue Nov 24 21:18:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) walked out of the area, and went into the Science department. Upon walking into the science room, his hands remained in his pockets, as he scanned the individuals in the room. "Alright, Tranquilizers. Give them to me so I may give them to Thirteen. They -better- be ready." he stated this, with a hint of aggression in his voice.

To where, the scientists gave Yori, the amount of tranquilizers they had in there inventory. He made his way back toward Thirteen, and Yuriko's position. He handed, the tranquilizers to Thirteen carefully. "Here you go." * - Wed Nov 25 00:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) stood there. Just chilling, hands in his pockets. Shifting his gaze from Thirteen, toward Yuriko. Then, shifting his gaze back at the marble surface. What was there to do at a time like this?  He had nothing to do for right now, but then again, he could always go train the guards. That could probably waste a little of his time.* - Wed Nov 25 01:50:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) walked over toward Hokori.

"Yo, Hokori. We're going to go to the training area." he stated.* - Wed Nov 25 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: No? - Wed Nov 25 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) walked closer toward Hokori. 

He formed the rat hand sign, his shadow sprang to life. It sprang forward, making it's way toward Hokori's current position. Since his head was lowered, and his eyes were shut. He wouldn't have seen it, unless he lifted his head last second, and opened his eyes.* - Wed Nov 25 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Ooohhhhh. - Wed Nov 25 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: He seems confident, maybe I shouldn't eat him yet. - Wed Nov 25 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
"Why don't you follow my orders, Hokori." he asked rather curious. The shadow, was still in play. He made Hokori place down the gord he had on his back, which he did this, by having him copy Yori's own movements.* - Wed Nov 25 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: He's demonstrating restraint? - Wed Nov 25 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: Resistence.. - Wed Nov 25 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: Intriguing.. - Wed Nov 25 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) shook his head, which caused Hokori to mimic Yori.

"Did you not hear the rules I gave on the first day of basic training? You are to follow orders from the general, without question. Unless the leaders, Thirteen and Yuriko, state otherwise." he said this, and sighed. He thought he showed discipline, he even used other guards as demonstartions, if they were to resist.* - Wed Nov 25 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You may release him. - Wed Nov 25 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
The shadow technique, was released, the shadow retracted back toward Yori. "Whatever you say, Thirteen." the sudden throw of the gord, that reached the other side of the wall. Which shattered against the wall, or did the wall shatter? Yori didn't know for sure, that was until he turned around, and saw a massive load of sand on the floor.

<. . .Hm. . .Interesting. . . Very. . .Interesting.> He walked back toward the wall.* - Wed Nov 25 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Wow he makes things really fast. - Wed Nov 25 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) nodded his head.

He grabbed the scroll, and placed it in his pocket. "Understood. They will be taught the technique." he said this, and shifted his gaze toward Hokori. Then back at the marble flooring. He smirked. < Hokori, could be a great ally.> he thought to himself. * - Wed Nov 25 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: You two are free to do as you please, for the rest of the day. - Wed Nov 25 03:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: This.. is going to get annoying.. - Wed Nov 25 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keibetsu, Hokori(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Quick.. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) stopped leaning against the wall, he left the area.* - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: When do I get to eat real people instead of these ...petri dish things. - Wed Nov 25 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) made his way toward the announcement area, he tapped on the mike. "Attention, I need two hundred and fifty guards at the training area immediately. That is all." His voice, boomed through the speakers. Yori, made his way toward the training area. He placed his hands behind his back, his foot, tapping against  the marble flooring. 

By now, two hundred and fifty guards made their way to the training area. He tossed the canopy method scroll toward one of the guards. He then gave them instructions. "I want, each and every single one of you, to learn this technique. And I want it done  -now-." he stated this, with a hint of aggresstion in his voice. He saw that the guards, nodded their heads in agreement. 

Yori smiled. "Good, now get to fucking work, maggots." Yori, continued to stand in the middle of the training area, watching the guards carefully. The first guard, started to read the scroll, the guard, was nodding his head, like he understood the technique. Yori smirked. <These guards aren't as stupid as I thought huh.> he thought to himself.

The first guard, got the technique read, and ready to teach the other guards the technique. The process, however took a couple of hours to accomplish. And once they accomplished this, Yori shouted at them. "Now, start training the jutsu. I want it perfected." he stated. His eyes, scanning everyone in the very room, making sure they nodded their heads in agreement. They knew better than to argue against him.

The guards, did as they were told. Each and every one of them, started to perform the jutsu, the jutsu itself was a sensory technique. So they would be able to sense any hidden chakras around the natural area. Yori, crossed his arms this time. He was making progress. And progress, was always good. "Continue to do this, until you feel the drain on this technique, isn't as bad. Do you all understand?" The guards, once again nodded their heads.

Yori, felt like he was being a good general by now. He had to be strong, and stern. But not just that, he had to be a strategist. You never know when one of these guards could cause an uprising. An uprising, was never a good sign. He wanted to prevent that from ever happening. Which is why he deals with giving them punishments, if they don't comply.

All in all, the guards continued to do as they were told, continuing to practice the jutsu, and what not. And after they felt like they got the hang of it, Yori clapped his hands. "There ya go ladies and gents. Now, go near the edge of the islands. I want you guys to rotate when performing the technique. I know it can be a drain in ones chakra, so it would be smart to rotate. Don't over do yourselves." he stated.

This made it seem like he cared for the guards, even though they were just mere tools. Wasn't everyone this way though? As Shinobi, everyone is a tool. We're all just mere tools in this live or die game. It was all about survival of the fittest. And Yori, had to make sure he would live in this deadly game called Life. Damn, this was getting deep for a second.

He went back inside the base, and leaned against one of the walls. He inhaled, and exhaled slowly. Today, was rather a productive day.* - Wed Nov 25 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) was released, he went over and grabbed Hokori's gord. And placed it over his shoulder. <. . .Kind of light.> "Where do you want me to put this gord, burn it?" he asked rather curious on what to do with it. Today, was the day that Yori, finally saw the dark side of Thirteen. 

It just goes to show that, you should follow orders. You shouldn't just betray them. Yori didn't know what Hokori or Yuriko had going on, but obviously it was a close bond. How could the two of them accomplish such a close bond, in such a short amount of time they've known each other? That was yet another mystery he couldn't fathom. But it wasn't none of his business, he walked toward one of the walls, and leaned against it.

Matter of fact, he didn't lean against the wall, he actually grabbed Hokori's corpse, and dragged it through-out the halls. The males blood, was surely going to leave a trail on where Yori was going to go with the corpse.* - Thu Nov 26 22:53:00 2015

Yori,  spoke out toward one of the guards. "No messing around maggots. Clean up this blood trail immediately." he stated.

"If you talk about him again, I will punish you. Until you won't be able to coherently speak the word friend again for a few days." He stated,  staring into her eyes. As he watched her expression, her hate? He loved it.*)

The first guard, read the note, their eyes widening greatly. The guard then rotated the note, and gave it to the next guard, the process continued itself for a long while, until every other guard has seen the note given to them.

He sat down on the dock, looking out toward the ocean. Yori inhaled, then exhaled slowly.

"Damn. . .It literally. . .Happened within seconds. . " he said to himself. The sad truth. It did happen within seconds. The death of one of his best guards, Hokori. He facial expression, remained blank. He balled up his fists, out of pure anger. "I have to let it go. . .If anything. . .I'm going to have to go into hiding, again. . They'll probably try and search for me. Bummer." he said to himself. There may be a chance, that Thirteen, or Yuriko, would probably send people after him.
