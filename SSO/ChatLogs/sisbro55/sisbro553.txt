Upon entering the room, Yori feasted his eyes upon the experiment. His hands, remained in his jacket pockets. Yori took note of the room, one side looked like winter, while the other side smelled like smoke. "Interesting." he muttered to himself. His gaze shifted from the new experiment, toward Yuriko. Then back at the experiment that was in the room.

Yori smirked as he looked at the experiment.* - Thu Dec  3 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) cleared his throat and spoke.

"His mutation? Unknown. I didn't keep much tabs on him, I had the other guards do that. His number however, is Sixty-Nine." he stated, his eyes still set on the mutated fellow.* - Thu Dec  3 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: Yuriko has definately changed. - Thu Dec  3 22:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) nodded his head.

Yori made his way toward Sixty-Nine's chains, taking out his key, he'd unlock the chains that were binding the experiment. And once he unlocked it, the chains fell straight toward the floor. "There ya go." he stated, placing the keys back into his pockets.* - Thu Dec  3 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) turned on his heels, and started to walk out of the room.

"Let's open the rest of the rooms." he stated, he took note of Thirteen's presense, but continued on.* - Thu Dec  3 22:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Twelve(Parris111) says: I'm game. - Fri Dec  4 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Soooo. - Fri Dec  4 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: This place is a stupid rock where people eat up your dreams. - Fri Dec  4 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: What should we do? - Fri Dec  4 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Fri Dec  4 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) says: Introduce ourselves of course. - Fri Dec  4 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) raised an eyebrow.

"Where people eat your dreams?" he asked rather confused.* - Fri Dec  4 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes, they are terrible people and they steal each other's dreams and GOBBLE THEM UP! - Fri Dec  4 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) felt his shoulder get touched by Yuriko, why she touched their shoulder, was unknown to him. But none the less, he continued to walk forward. From his periph, he saw the large wave of water hit against the gates, and against the guards. Yuriko probably killed them with that jutsu. Yori however, continued to make his way toward the gates.* - Fri Dec  4 23:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) followed behind Yuriko once again. His hands remained in his pockets, his eyes scanning the area around them. The amount of damage Yuriko unleashed, was definately powerful. None the less, it seemed now was a great time to get practice with his jutsus. Which, he planned on practicing a specific jutsu in general.* - Sat Dec  5 00:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
Yori spotted his first victim, forming several hand signs, the base of his shadow, finally came to life. Out came forth four shadow tendrils. They made there was toward the D ranked Shinobi. Two tendrils, impaling the shinobi's heart. He would hope that it killed him instantly. And as for the other shinobi that was next to him, he'd also be impaled at the chest. Once the impaling of the shinobi was done, the shadow tendrils threw them to the side, and retracted his shadows back toward Yori. 

Yori, stood back up, and continued to walk back toward Yuriko.* - Sat Dec  5 00:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Poison.. - Sat Dec  5 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Need to be careful with him. - Sat Dec  5 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
Turned on his heels, hands in his pockets. He looked at Thirteen, and spoke. "Nicely done. You never fail to amuse me." he stated this, and finally laid his eyes onto the two individuals that were behind them. Yori didn't say much, he just stared at them. If the individuals had good sight, they could see sweat dripping from the side of Yori's face. Mainly because of the usage of a technique he just used.* - Sat Dec  5 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) kept his hands in his pockets. He didn't feel the need to attack just yet. It seemed as if Yuriko had everything under control. But for now, he just eye'd his opponets. However, if things -were- to go down south, then he'd definately jump in.* - Sat Dec  5 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Oh yeah suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure, just stand there and look cute Yori-kun! - Sat Dec  5 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: I just came here to have a good time. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: And honestly. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: I feel so attacked right now. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: These people didn't even say hi. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) thinks: Demanding pricks. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thirteen(Jjking217) thinks: I wonder what these people will look like when dead. - Sat Dec  5 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: We've gotta do something. - Sat Dec  5 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
Yori's options were very little by this point. And he knew that. However, he formulated some hand signs, kneading chakra in his body's system for a short while. After he finished kneading the chakra needed for the techique, he held his last hand sign. He jumped back, only to see a red headed woman to jump from a building. Her loss.

His next attack, would bring his shadows to life. Shadow tendrils, came out of the base of his shadow, and went straight for Kana. The general area they targeted, were as followed. (There were about 4). One shadow tendril, striked the female's right thigh, the second tendril, striked her right foot. The third shadow tendril, decided to strike against the female's stomach region. As for the fourth tendril, aimed to strike the female straight toward her heart.* - Sat Dec  5 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: so iwatobi's attack and anguo - Sat Dec  5 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: eh like probably 10 tiles would be enogh to claim you were like out of our range of knowing you were here - Sat Dec  5 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
It seemed some sort of, white foam protected Yori. And with this, he fled the scene with the army that was at the scene by now, using them as cover. He had to thank Yuriko later on, if they ever were to make it out of this alive. He also, had to thank Sixty-Nine. 

//

However, if this -didn't- work, and if the water dragon -was- aimed toward Yori. Then it would probably kill him. From reading Kana's rp earlier, I couldn't tell who she was aiming at, and to be honest, it was probably Yori. But if it wasn't, then it wasn't. Who knows.* - Sat Dec  5 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yori(Sisbro55) says: Fuck that nigga Rich, you see that Dragon fam? - Sat Dec  5 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
Upon being tossed, the guards would've caught Yori. By this point, he was sweating pretty bad. He knew one thing for sure, and that was Kirigakure no Sato, was mother fucking gank city. Do you -SEE- these nigga's fam? But, none the less, Yori slowly got up, he looked at his shoulder, which contained a white foam humanoid stature. 

He raised an eyebrow, and looked over toward Yuriko. < Thank you, Yuriko. I owe you one.> he thought to himself. He motioned over toward Sixty-Nine, basically he was calling him over, he also called for a retreat. And nigga, there was something covering the damn sun. Was it a meteorite? Hell did he know fam, -fuck- this shit nigga. Survival of the fittest my boy. You see how fast ya boy was running? Put my ass on the 100 meter dash fam.

-Fuck- this nigga,* - Sat Dec  5 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) ||
The army by this point, made a retreat. Fuck this shit nigga, Yori was running like he was a track star. Fuck you mean fam? You -seeeee- the gank here in Kirigakure? I demand this village be named Gankakure no Sato. The amount of ganks that go on in Kirigakure is no joke fam, this ain't no game, this looking like Chiraq. Niggas just poppin out of nowhere. Kana had that AK strapped. Anguo, had that Rocket Launcher, YOU SEE THIS NIGGA JUST SUMMON A RASHOMOUN?!* - Sat Dec  5 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) finally made it back to the base, sweat was dripping from his body. They made their way through-out the hall ways, sitting on the chairs that were provided, he slammed his head against the hard wood surface of the desk. "We lost another team mate." he uttered to himself, it probably sounded muffled, since his face was buried into the desk. To be honest, he didn't know what happened all that time he was gone at base, when Yuriko and Thirteen were alone together.

But when he came back, things definitely changed when he came back. He didn't know how, or why. He decided to not question it yet. He raised his head from it lying on the desk. He turned his head to face Yuriko. "Is there anyway. . . . .Any possible way. . .For me to get experimented on?" he asked, curious for that matter.

Then, that's what Yuriko spoke about Thirteen. Stating that he tried to 'own' her. "Was, that true?" he thought to himself. He didn't know for sure, he would ask Thirteen himself, but he's dead by now. If anything, he only had one objective, one -main- mission. And that was to protect Yuriko. If anything, Yori would've gave his life, to ensure that Yuriko was safely away from harm. But instead, it was Yuriko who saved him.

Yori, cleared his throat, and spoke up. His gaze shifting from the thousands of people in the room----- To twelve, who was healed by Yuriko's medical treatments. "Thank you, Yuriko." was all he uttered.* - Sat Dec  5 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ...He wants to be experimented on? - Sat Dec  5 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) placed a hand up, it was at chest level. "No thanks, I'm not hungry." he stated. He returned his gaze toward Yuriko. "I noticed, how I'm the only odd ball out of our little group that we have going on. I want to be unique myself, I'm currently, to weak. I want to become stronger, better, faster. I want to crush those that dare harm my friends." he said this, and looked at the desk. He vowed to never show any emotion, and he kept to his vows.

"Just like, how I was weak, I was too weak to even save my best guard, Hokori. . . ."* - Sat Dec  5 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) looked at Yuriko, noticing her smile.

". . . .Yeah. . . Is. . .There any possible way, I could somehow, get advanced healing on myself? To where my cells regenerate? Or is that no possible?" he asked rather curious on the topic of experimentation.* - Sat Dec  5 04:26:40 2015
