<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) walked into the building, bumping into Sabo, giving him a quick glare as he started to walk around the counter toward the employee, he leaned and whispered something to the employee. The employee's eyes widened and quickly grabbed a brown bag full of valuables, and gave it to the man. He smirked evily as he grabbed the back and placed it inside his back-pack that he had.

After putting it in the back pack, he grabbed it and wore the back pack. He looked at the two shinobi infront of him.* - Sat Sep 12 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) started to walk back toward the door, his hands in his pockets. He looked at Sabo, then at Shin. The man took out twenty thousand yen, and placed it on the counter as he then waves at the employee and says "Pleasure doing business with you." under all that bundle of cash though, was explosive tags that were hidden quiet well underneith some of the bundles of cash. If someone was to have a keen eye, they could spot the tags.

The unknown man started to walk toward the door.* - Sun Sep 13 00:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) looked at the man and said "I don't speak broke." as he formed several handsigns, a large gust of strong wind was emitted and sent forth toward the two of them. Yes, the wind technique that was casted was indeed great breakthrough. It could knock any shinobi off of there feet momentarily that is. The unknown man wielded a single handsign and said "Explode!" as the paper tags that were hidden within the bundles of cash exploded in flames. 

The unknown man hustled for the door.* - Sun Sep 13 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) continued to run out the door, he completely ignored the clones that seemed to be coming out of the walls, and ground. If anything he was focused on his escape. That was his mind set as a criminal.* - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) continued to run out of the building he just robbed. His back-pack rattling with the jewlery he just stole. The unknown man saw something coming out of the ground, as he quickly jumped over one of the people, he examined the area and scratched his head and said to himself "What the fuck is going on here.." he was curious to what was happening. But he seemingly continued to see these odd people popping out of the area. He just wanted to sell this shit on the black market.

He attempted to continue his escape, if unsuccessful, he would've formed more handsigns and sent another great breakthrough.* - Sun Sep 13 01:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) continued to do his run path, but seemingly he got hit by the two shuriken as they hit his legs, causing the male to stumble and fall over. Having his back-pack fall off of his shoulders and get sent sliding across the grounds surface. But upon stumbling this caused for some of Shin's fire jutsu to miss him, but many of them also hit the man. Causing some serious burns on his upper body.

The unknown man quickly wielded a handsign as he shouted "If I can't have the jewlery! No one can!" as the back-pack had two sections, one contained the jewlery he stole. The second section contained explosive tags. The back pack of course, exploded. Sending the jewlery flying everywhere, including debris. Some of the debris that hit the male, was the jewlery, it hit the male right square in the forehead. It of course was made of pure gold, so when it hit the male. 

It pretty much knocked him out.* - Sun Sep 13 01:41:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) looked at Shin and said "Tsk, I'm my own boss! I don't take orders from you! Baka!" it could be easily shown that this man, had an arrogant attitude, and was seemingly disrespectful. Although it was getting quiet hot, and sweat continued to drop from his face as he was getting interrogated.* - Sun Sep 13 02:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misson EC(Sisbro55) ||
The genjutsu indeed was doing it's trick, it was burning the man alive. Screams could be heard from the man, he then shouted "I already told you I'm my own boss you baka! I do what I want, And I rob what I want! I used explosive tags to blow up the counter, I hid it underneith the bundle of cash! Get me out of this thing!" the man was crying like a bitch.* - Sun Sep 13 02:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Storm(Sisbro55) was amazed by Kojiro's speed to catch up to him, he thought he was faster than most people in Kumogakure no Sato, but it seems as if he was wrong, Storm got punched in the face, having him fly straight intot he ground, having his body slide across the grounds surface, as dust would start to pick up from his sliding. He slowly got up wiping off his nose which was bleeding by this point. He smirked "Were not done yet!" Storm however, was very persistant.* - Sun Oct  4 02:59:37 2015

"That's it!" he quickly ran on all fours, and jumped into the air, he spun rapidly. <Tsuuga!> this technique was definately devistating, however he didn't want to kill the man his true intention? It was to scrap it against Kojiro's body, if anything he wanted to send Kojiro flying away from him, but after he used this jutsu however, he would be knocked the fuck out cause of the chakra loss.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Storm(Sisbro55) got on all fours, his nails growing a tad bit, as his fangs began to show, as they went over his bottom lip. Quickly Storm ran straight forward, and upon running, he jumped into the air and spun rapidly, he made direct impact with the ground below him, ripping and shredding away at the grounds surface, dirt and other debris was flying everywhere, followed by dust gathering around the general area. And after he was done, he climbed out of the large hole. If anything it was pretty deep by the time he got out. He had his hands on his knees and started to pant.

He used a lot of chakra and stamina on the technique, however it would prove great if he was to master it later down the road. After he was done, he checked under his shirt, his puppy was still sleep, which was reasonable. His dog hasn't really done anything lately, he wondered why. But none the less he continued to practice his jutsu, repeating the process over and over again. He wanted to get the technique down and be done with it. He pondered one thing however, when would he would get a misson, did they do missons within squads? 

This was indeed a question he'd have to ask Niza when he isn't busy, however when Storm was done training his technique, he made his way to the clothing shop, he needed to buy a new jacket, his previous one got dirty and he refused to clean it himself, considering he was a lazy ass. He smirked. "We'll have our rematch, Kojiro..." he murmured to himself, as he made his way to the clothing shop.* - Mon Oct  5 00:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yori(Sisbro55) walked toward the Kumogkure Square----- Until he saw a bunch of dead bodies. He looked at all the dead bodies, he was in shock. He wondered who could've done this. The area itself smelled of death, he also noticed there was a lot of white feathers on the ground. He shook his head, it was a shame that so many people have died here-- If anything it was probably from last night, and from the looks of things, people got fucked up.

Yori quickly got to work, looking around for a shovel; and once he found one, he quickly dug up some holes, about 8 feet deep and 4 feet wide. Carefully he placed the bodies of his dead compatriots into the holes. Yori started to shovel the dirt right back into the holes; then he stabbed the ground with his shovel. After everything was done, a single tear came down his face. He didn't know these people, but they were fellow village members from the looks of things. Shortly after, Yori walked out of the area.

He continued to walk down south to see if there was any other damage anywhere, he hoped there would be survivors so they could tell Yori was exactly happened here. He was clueless on this whole situation.* - Sun Oct 25 17:04:51 2015
