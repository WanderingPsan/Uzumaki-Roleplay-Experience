<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) placed her hands together, still resting on the surface of the table. She would lean over onto the table, resting her head on her hands. Her eyes began to wellup with emotion. "Did...Did I make a mistake? Did...Did I just ruin my life?" she asked, water slowly starting to cascade down her cheek.* - Fri Sep 25 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was still crying, the table starting to gain small droplets of water. "..B-but...You're making it sound...like it was the worst idea..." she said trying to control herself.* - Fri Sep 25 07:21:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would quickly lift her head up to look at Hideki directly. Her eyes were read, and trails of tears could be seen running down each cheek. She quickly began to sniffle, stopping her crying in the process. "Wh-why...would you lie to me....to...to make me feel this..~badly~" she said before immediately starting to cry even harder. She would then lean forward towards Hideki in an attempt to basically headbutt his upper body, and if successful, she would lean her head against him and cry.* - Fri Sep 25 07:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: My cloak is probably going to get wet now.. - Fri Sep 25 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's cold-like symptoms began to kick in causing mucus to run down her nostrils. Although, because she had her face now buried into Hideki's clothing, it would most likely smear onto that. She of course could barely hear him causing her to continue to cry.* - Fri Sep 25 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Fuck my life.. - Fri Sep 25 07:31:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) sniffled slightly before making a crooked smile. She gave a soft chuckle between sniffs. "I'm...I'm sorry..." she said before attempting to give Hideki a hug, because it just felt right.* - Fri Sep 25 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would push away, remaining seated at the table. She wiped whatever was left on her face with her sleeve before turning away. "i...I think I should go home...I've been hit with too much today."* - Fri Sep 25 07:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) marched herself over towards the group she was becoming more familiar with. Her apperance, apart from the norm, looked tired. Her eyes and nose were red, as if she had been sick for quite some time. She simply glanced the four other shinobi there before leaning against the rock wall. ". . . hey.." she said with a weakened voice.* - Fri Sep 25 20:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: As much as I thank you for having me, Niza. - Fri Sep 25 21:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You know what I mean. - Fri Sep 25 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked up at Hideki, her eyes red and filled with tears; her cheeks sporting tear trails. "Please...." she muttered as if she needed someone to save her, because apparently no one was bothering to save her.


~~ Then Hanabi just released her ass cheek causing Misa to rush at Hideki in an attempt to hug him. She would then whisper, "take me.."* - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) took the napkins, quickly raising them to her eyes. Instead of wipe, she would dab. "...Thank you.." she managed to say as she looked down at her lap. She was sitting uncomfortably seeing as how her ass was sore as could be.* - Fri Sep 25 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) took the cloak, using it as a cushion. "Thanks..again.." she muttered before reaching out to grab a menu on the table. "Can...Can I get anything?"* - Fri Sep 25 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) pointed at the veggie ramen on the menu as if to indicate that that was what she wanted.* - Fri Sep 25 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could feel the warmth from the soup that sat in front of her, the steam brushing up against her face as she peered down onto it. She grabbed a pair of chopsticks that were on the table and began to slowly poke at the floating noodles before picking them up and eating. Between a small break of chewing, she asked, "Are you going to be eating?"* - Fri Sep 25 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) stopped eating. "Wait...what do you eat?" she asked nearly dropping her chopsticks in the process. "Does that mean...Does that mean I'm going to not be able to eat?" * - Fri Sep 25 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Then why don't you get some fish? Sushi? - Fri Sep 25 21:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Don't worry, I ate earlier today. Hehe! - Fri Sep 25 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) went back to eating before asking, "Why...why is Hanabi like that?"* - Fri Sep 25 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) stopped eating for a moment. "You...you just let her..do that?"* - Fri Sep 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Of course not, I tried resisting. It's useless really. I'm not strong enough yet. - Fri Sep 25 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: I feel the same way.. - Fri Sep 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She likes to put on an act, flirt with others. And that's where she gets you in her trap. - Fri Sep 25 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: i ddont like it... - Fri Sep 25 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had been slowly shoveling what was left of her Veggie Ramen into her mouth, enjoying the time she was having with Hideki, however quiet he may have been. That's when she walked in, Hanabi of course. Without hesitating she looked down at her lap, as if embarassed or ashamed of herself. This time she wasn't going to cry, she couldn't, she had run dry from the several times she had wept. 

"...Hi...Hanabi.."* - Fri Sep 25 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Fri Sep 25 22:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And it was all thanks to you~ - Fri Sep 25 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) kept her gaze fixated on her lap, not even looking up at Hanabi. "Right.." she muttered as she began to fiddle around with her fingers. Her stomach making loud growls and churns as it somewhat didn't agree with the food she just ingested.* - Fri Sep 25 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) slowly shook her head, gritting her teeth as her stomach was starting to hurt. She placed her hand on Hideki's leg, digging her fingers into it if successful. "I..I'm okay here...Honest."* - Fri Sep 25 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmmm. - Fri Sep 25 22:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) quickly began to feel dizzy, as she bent over to rest her head on the cool table. "I just...need to lie down..." she said letting her hair scawl onto the table.* - Fri Sep 25 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Oh don't be a baby~ - Fri Sep 25 22:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: How long ago was that, though? - Fri Sep 25 22:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I told you that I would teach you more when you had mastered your summoning technique. - Fri Sep 25 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Right... - Fri Sep 25 23:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded before quickly placing her hand on her stomach, which churned one last time. Her eyes were closed, quickly wincing. "I...I feel it...slowing down.."* - Fri Sep 25 23:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You could come over here and I could help you feel better~ - Fri Sep 25 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I could even make you feel good~ - Fri Sep 25 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) internally sighed as she slid out from her side of the table and moved over to the opposite side. "Please...don't grab me like you did outside....i'm...I'm so sore.." she said with sadness and exhaustion in her voice. As she slid onto the bench, she simply waited to see how Hanabi would help her feel better.* - Fri Sep 25 23:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was hesitant about Hanabi rubbing her belly, but it was oddly soothing and therefore let her continue.* - Fri Sep 25 23:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked around at the gathering of shinobi. It seemed like she was at the center of their gaze, unaware of what to do. She could feel the pressure of having to choose, with only Kuro being the one to understand that it wasn't right. She would find herself having a tough time breathing, *I...I can't...I can't!* she repeated in her head as she continued to turn, looking at everyone, feeling as if they were all looking back at her. 

"I can't!" she finally shouted before pushing off the ground in an attempt to run away. A build up of chakra would be bubbling inside of her, noticeable by anyone with sensing capabilities. If unhindered, she would have run away.* - Sat Sep 26 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made it to a nearby cliff, leaning against the rock structure with both hands. She was breathing heavily trying to catch her breath, but more importantly, keep everything inside. "I can't....I can't choose." she repeated over and over when suddenly, it happened.

During one of her rapid exhalations, she released a steady stream of half-chewed vegetables and ramen; the food she had eaten recently. The cut of broccoli and carrots splattered alongside fluids and the stringy ramen. She could feel a sinking feeling in her stomach as another wave of vomit pushed its way out of her mouth colliding with the wall of stone she was leaning against. * - Sat Sep 26 01:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I thought you were against her being with Hanabi. - Sat Sep 26 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would continue to spit and allow whatever was left over to flow out of her mouth. She could feel Hanabi's touch, realizing at least someone cared about her, allowing herself to be comforted. "Thank....you.." she said trying to take deep breaths.* - Sat Sep 26 01:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had let everything she could out, swallowing whatever content clung to the roof of her mouth. She turned, looking at Mariana with her bloodshot and watery eyes. She was in disbelief at what she was saying to her. She reached out, trying to grab onto Hanabi's hand.* - Sat Sep 26 01:56:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well, I guess that works. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded, taking note of how Hanabi had performed the technique. She felt she was ready, quickly forming the few handseals Hanabi had just performed. She began to build up the chakra from within her stomach. She felt if build up and churn inside her, causing her to feel uneasy, believing she was about to throw up again causing her to expell the rushing chakra as fast as she could to alleviate her stress. Instead of releasing a flamethrower from her mouth, she was only able to release a few embers instead.

Realizing she needed to be more confident in her abilities, she performed the same handseals again, feeling the chakra within her build up. Pushing past the sensation of vomitting, she expelled the chakra from her mouth. Aiming upwards, she released a small flow of fire that looked like a wildly weaker version of what Hanabi had performed.* - Sat Sep 26 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would have successfully performed the technique when suddenly, she felt a pulse throughout her body. She dropped down to her knees, her eyes widening as wide as they could. She let out a single scream as her body began to produce reddish scales until she was eventually covered in patches of scales, each patch that appeared feeling as if her hundreds of pimples were popped in that localized area. Once the transformation was complete, she panted quietly, looking up towards Hanabi.* - Sat Sep 26 03:02:11 2015
