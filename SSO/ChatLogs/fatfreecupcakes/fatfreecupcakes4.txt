<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Mamoru is also injured, not as sever as Hideki. - Wed Sep 30 06:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) seemed frozen in place, her eyes closed.

"How did it happen?"* - Wed Sep 30 06:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I don't know, and Reguel doesn't seem to know either.  I just found out not too long ago about their conditions. - Wed Sep 30 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . . - Wed Sep 30 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You're asking a lot of questions, but you've yet to introduce yourself. - Wed Sep 30 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) let out a deep sigh, realizing she had failed Hanabi. *I wasn't there to protect him....Hanabi I'm sorry...* she thought as she ignored Reguel. 

"I have to go.." she stated before attempting to rush out of the room.* - Wed Sep 30 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: The edge, it hurts. - Wed Sep 30 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I mean, if I was there before this stuff happened, or much much later I probably wouldn't let my friend all this far into depravity. - Wed Sep 30 06:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It's a difficult situation. - Wed Sep 30 06:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) hadn't heard a single word he said as she continued making her way downtown, walking fast, faces past and she gone now.* - Wed Sep 30 06:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) sat herself down at the table, using a nearby pin to prick her finger. With a few seals, she slammed her hand onto the table summoning a single snake. "Hello there."* - Wed Sep 30 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) watched the rather small snake slither around the surface of the table. "You know..." she began to speak, finding it rather easy to tell this snake everything that was happening.* - Wed Sep 30 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) gave the snake a quick pet or two before talking to it. "Hideki is injured...and I wasn't there to save him...I could be helping him...but...I can't." she said, a tone of sadness in her voice.* - Wed Sep 30 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Using leftover blood, formed the seals again to summon another snake. She didn't want the first snake to be lonely. "I promised Hanabi...but It's too hard...I can't be everywhere.."* - Wed Sep 30 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Sighed.* - Wed Sep 30 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made her way to the fridge, opening it and taking out products necessary for a sandwhich.* - Wed Sep 30 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Sighed allowing the snakes to disperse with a puff of smoke.* - Wed Sep 30 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) she looked directly at the table, knowing she wasn't ready for what was to come. "I need to be a better medical shinobi...I just need to...I need to save this village.." she said slamming her hands against the table.* - Wed Sep 30 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had made her way into the office, quickly taking note of Hideki in what seemed to be a wheelchair. Without thinking she would rush towards him taking notice of nobody else but him. "Is...Is the wheelchair permanent?" she asked the room, hoping for a positive response.* - Wed Sep 30 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Kuro, you never ddi tell me what you wre studying to be. - Wed Sep 30 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) poked Hideki.* - Wed Sep 30 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) sighed, realizing that Hideki was possibly passed out. She would take note of Kuro, making her way towards him. "Hi.."* - Wed Sep 30 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hello. - Thu Oct  1 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) sat herself down on the cushion, turning to face Kuro as she did so. "How have you been? Been Training?" she asked her voice having a hint of worry.* - Thu Oct  1 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked past Kuro to notice Reguel sitting there. "I would help..." she said not really knowing where the injured shinobi were, except for Hideki.* - Thu Oct  1 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: But? - Thu Oct  1 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: it doesn't seem like Hideki is awake...and I don't have any information on the others or their injuries.... - Thu Oct  1 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I told you that Mamoru has a broken jaw. - Thu Oct  1 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: That doesn't tell me where he is, does it. - Thu Oct  1 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: You little shit. - Thu Oct  1 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: He went somewhere with some girl. - Thu Oct  1 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) sighed. "Right...Right..." she said before turning away from the boy. She would turn her attention to the chair bound Hideki. "What about Hideki?"* - Thu Oct  1 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) watched Reguel release a few senbons at the nearby wall, her eyes perking up slightly. "What mechanism is on your arm?" she asked looking towards the boy. 

"That's good.." she added in reference to Kuro's training.* - Thu Oct  1 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess the asswhooping he got gave him brain damage -omit- - Thu Oct  1 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess we can start calling him Timmy -omit- - Thu Oct  1 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Reguel, have you met Marianna yet? - Thu Oct  1 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: No. - Thu Oct  1 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I met her sister. - Thu Oct  1 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Her sister - Thu Oct  1 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: ? - Thu Oct  1 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I think it was, her name was Misa. - Thu Oct  1 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was caught off guard, nearly dropping the mechanism as he tossed it. Luckily she was able to  catch it, quickly turning and rotating it to get a better look. "I see...There's cylinders that can release senbon...How are you releasing them? I'm assuming some sort of release is needed."


"Misa?" she asked having no relation to Mariana.* - Thu Oct  1 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh, that Misa.  - Thu Oct  1 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Apparently she's  been in this village for a while, or was from this village. We picked her up when we went to Konoha.  - Thu Oct  1 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: She's Marianna's sister in law. - Thu Oct  1 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well we need to call her something. - Thu Oct  1 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, we'll call the blonde Misa, Mia. - Thu Oct  1 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Well...I have a last name.. - Thu Oct  1 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Surname* - Thu Oct  1 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) shrugged, catching the stack of senbon. She loaded about four into the cyllinders before strapping it to her arm. She was able to find the thin string that was attached to the mechanism, quickly tugging at it. The senbon fired into the table, quickly piercing it and quickly becomming stuck. "Hmm...I could try and think of a way to make it automatic...but no promises.." she said before tossing back the equipment to the boy.* - Thu Oct  1 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm fine with calling you Mia, what say you Kuro? - Thu Oct  1 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: Mia? Okay..Guess I wont try and find a way to make it automatic.. - Thu Oct  1 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, I've always called Misa, Misa. - Thu Oct  1 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: The other Misa, I'm not too fond of to be honest. - Thu Oct  1 00:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I was training with Niza, and Tetsujin appeared out of no where asking to spar. - Thu Oct  1 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So he charged at me. - Thu Oct  1 01:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: He broke into thousands of pieces.... And used those broken pieces and turned into steel senbons and impaled my body. - Thu Oct  1 01:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm lucky, Kuro. - Thu Oct  1 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: His body also turned into steel. - Thu Oct  1 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Which is odd.. - Thu Oct  1 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Think of this as a lesson. You faced death's door but didn't walk through.  Now what would happen if you desided to follow the path of hatred? - Thu Oct  1 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm a ninjutsu that turns your body steel. - Thu Oct  1 01:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I guess that's why I haven't seen her.  I wonder if she's able to treat her self, even a little. - Thu Oct  1 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I got the worst part... - Thu Oct  1 01:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) heard Hideki finally speak, having been unconcious for what seemed like hours. "Hideki!" she shouted attempting to wrap her arms around him, forgetting in that brief moment that he was most likely broken as fuck. "How could you....What were you thinking?!" she asked, but rather loudly.

That's when it connected, quickly releasing him before covering her mouth. *Shit!* 

"I Can help you...I just..I just need to know what exactly is broken or hurting...Okay?"* - Thu Oct  1 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Right...Raikage, are there any leftover medical scrolls you can lean me? I need to self study. - Thu Oct  1 01:33:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: ...Right. - Thu Oct  1 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) shook her head. "I doubt my abilities can repair broken bones...I'm so sorry Hideki...But I'll find something for that pain." she said before turning to the others. "Kuro..You're training with the Raikage?"* - Thu Oct  1 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) gave a warm smile. "I was just asking...That's all." she said placing her hands on her lap. "It's just must be an honor to train with him."* - Thu Oct  1 01:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) chuckled slighlty. "Nonsense."* - Thu Oct  1 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Thanks. - Thu Oct  1 02:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) started to blush before turning around. "I'm a medical shinobi...I care....about everything..okay?" she stated still turned away.* - Thu Oct  1 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) turned back, her face full of confusion. "What? I never said that..." she said  looking down at him. * - Thu Oct  1 02:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Sighed. "So...Now that you're going to be bed ridden...or at least chair ridden.....Have anything else you can teach me...something from Hanabi?" she asked lifting her arm, hand made into a fist. * - Thu Oct  1 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded. She reached up to her ponytail (see image), pulling on one of the senbon that seemed to hold her hair together. She wasn't carrying any weapons at the moment so she would have to improvise. Wielding the senbon in hand, she pricked her left index finger before putting the senbon back. As a blood began to pop out from her finger, she formed the handseals before placing her hand on the edge of the bood. In a small puff of smoke, a single snake seemed to scurry its way onto Hideki's chest.* - Thu Oct  1 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: She has a senbon in her ponytail.. - Thu Oct  1 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: That's clever as fuck. - Thu Oct  1 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) //the snake would continue to slither up Hideki's body, before trying to slip in under his clothing.

"What do you mean? No I didn't...I'm going to hit you.." she said lifting her fist up again.* - Thu Oct  1 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I like your hair like that, Misa. - Thu Oct  1 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's eyes widened. "Ugh..Ugh..Thanks.." she blurted before pulling her hair back into a ponytail, and sliding in the senbon. Her brows would then furrow. "I'm not being defensive.." she said before trying to tap Hideki in the shoulder with her fist, a rather weak tap. "I'm...going to go make you some tea.."

She would then start to head towards the kitchen.* - Thu Oct  1 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Thu Oct  1 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made her way into the kitchen of the home, quickly grabbing a cup to fill with water. She heated it up using her chakra flow before putting in the tea bag. WIthin minutes, it would be prepared.* - Thu Oct  1 02:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Hey... - Thu Oct  1 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hey. - Thu Oct  1 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had in her hand, a single cup of tea, plate included. Steam seemed to rise from the cup indicating it was hot. "I used my chakra flow to heat it up nice and hot." she said before extending it towards him . "Here..take it."* - Thu Oct  1 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) stayed silent. "Yeah...about that....I don't know how to unsummon them..." she admitted, giving an awkward smile.* - Thu Oct  1 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) //The snake had actually crawled up his butt.* - Thu Oct  1 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would most likely find the snake. "Okay..So how do I make them go back to wherever they're from...I know nothing.." she said pulling up a chair and taking a seat. "I'm ready to learn."* - Thu Oct  1 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Right. - Thu Oct  1 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) began to take mental notes of this. "What else can you tell me? Where do they come from?" she asked eager to mentally engrave it.* - Thu Oct  1 03:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Where they come from I have yet to know. Hanabi had yet to tell me, to be honest. - Thu Oct  1 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) quickly lost the smile that was on her face. 

"Oh.." * - Thu Oct  1 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was shocked by the sudden forehead tap that she flailed her arms a bit in a spastic manner more than likely spilling the hot tea all over Hideki because he deserved it.* - Thu Oct  1 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ------------------------ - Thu Oct  1 03:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's eyes widened. "You silly sausage....why would you spill the tea on yourself?" she asked reaching over to grab a rag from the nearby drawer. She would begin to dab at Hideki's crotch to absorb as much of the tea as she could.* - Thu Oct  1 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) stopped dabbing at Hideki's croth, having felt the sudden rush of wind from the flying snakes. She turned to see a bleeding Bernadotte, having several wounds caused by the impalements. *How is he still talking....* she thought before rushing to him. 

"Oh my God...I'll take you to the other bed..." she said trying to usher the wounded victim into the other room.* - Thu Oct  1 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Tossed that hoe onto the bed.* - Thu Oct  1 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) began to rub her hands together, before revealing her palms cloaked in Medical Chakra giving off a green hue. She would then begin to place her hands over the wounded areas. "I don't know how well I can help you...But at least I can make it stop bleeding.." she stated before taking her time to mend the wounds.* - Thu Oct  1 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: Didn't mean towalk in on you wanking him off. - Thu Oct  1 03:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Still hurts. - Thu Oct  1 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Why? - Thu Oct  1 04:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Thu Oct  1 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) smiled rather widely. "I've been working on a new technique ever since I heard you were hurt...In the long run..It should help overall...but..." she stopped talking, placing her hands together. She formed three handseals, before executing the jutsu. from her right sleeve, a single white snake slithered out, wrapping itself around her arm. "This is a special snake..." she adived Hideki , " so don't dispel it.."

The white snake would slither onto the bed from her forearm, making its way onto Hideki's chest. It was a lightweight snake so it shouldn't hurt him as much. Misa walked over towards the man, "I'm...going to undress you okay....?" she asked as she was already reaching to pull open his cloak and kimono. The snake would then slither onto his flesh, the bandages to be exact. "It might sting a little.." she mentioned as the snake opened its mouth before attempting to bite Hideki's wounded body. He would quickly begin to feel a slight soothing sensation as the pain slightly became less.* - Thu Oct  1 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's face started to turn a soft shade of pink. "I...Yes..." she muttered, fidgiting with her fingers. "I care about you...Oddly enough.." she said looking at his broken body. "Does it still hurt? I can do it again if you'd like.." she said watching as the white snake that bit him immediately dispersed after releasing all of the chakra within.* - Thu Oct  1 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was pulled in by Hideki, her green eyes fixated on him, making quick glances at the man's muscular build. Her heart made a few quick beats before she was released. "Mhm....No..No problem...I'll just do it once more....So you can sleep comfortably..."* - Thu Oct  1 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would form the same three handseals, causing another white snike to coil out from her arm. She let the snake fall onto Hideki's lap, before it aimed it's gaping jaw at his inner thigh in an attempt at injecting him again.

"Two..Should help you sleep." she repeated.* - Thu Oct  1 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was quickly wrapped, coughing from the sudden loss of breath. "I just...wanted...to...make...you comfortable..." she said constricted in movement.* - Thu Oct  1 05:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Hmmm.... - Thu Oct  1 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Looked at the orange haired boy. "I'm going to try and help....If I do...do you promise to not tell anyone about the techniques I use?" she asked desiring this session to be private.* - Thu Oct  1 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Thu Oct  1 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) smiled. "Okay...It's a new jutsu...so....be warned...It's not perfect." she stated, forming three handseals, one of which would be unknown to all but Misa. Having performed the technique, a single white snake slithered out from her sleeve, wrapped around her wrist. It was a thin, harmless looking creature, its black beaded eyes glancing at the oranged haired boy. "It's going to sting...." she stated as she extended her snake wrapped hand closer to the boy's face. 

The snake would open its small mouth, hissing before striking. It attempted to bite into Mamoru's neck with it's rather small fangs. If successful, Mamoru would feel a strong sting, as if someone was pinching him. The snake would then release a combination of chakra and venom designed to act as a pain killer. If allowed, Mamoru's jaw would hurt less, possibly even allow him to speak without being hurt.* - Thu Oct  1 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Now... - Thu Oct  1 05:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) ///After the snake finished releasing all the chakra and venom it had, it dispersed into a small amount of smoke that quickly cleared. She rubbed her hands together before having her right hand give off a green hue. "Now I can place my hand on your jaw without it hurting...Aha! I knew that jutsu would be good.." she stated with a cheerful laughter.

She would then attempt to place her right hand, glowing with Medical chakra onto his jaw in hopes of performing minor healing, possibly shaving off a bit of recovery time if possible.* - Thu Oct  1 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Really? - Thu Oct  1 05:59:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had walked into the room, quickly noticing Hideki sleeping at the table. *Why doesn't he use the bed to sleep?* she thought.* - Fri Oct  2 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) formed handseals, having pricked herself with a fork to allow some blood. Performing the seal, she slammed her hand against the table bringing forth a single plain snake.* - Fri Oct  2 04:16:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) reached out to grab his left hand. Your eyes may have seen those...but they have also seen light, joy, and lo.....I don't care that your eyes are red...Why should others?" she would finish saying, her crytal green eyes already crying small streams of tears. She would try to lean her head on his shoulder with a sudden sniffle.* - Fri Oct  2 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would try to reach around Hideki, trying to give him a half hug.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could see a noticeable difference within his eyes, as if he was lost inside. *Please..* she thought quickly moving her head in, trying to place her lips softly onto his.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's heart began to beat rapidly, having performed a rather risky attempt; her mind completely cleared as her lips felt his tenderness.

She would instead try to go in for another kiss.* - Fri Oct  2 07:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could gather a faint taste of what Hideki had recently eaten, before quickly pulling away.
