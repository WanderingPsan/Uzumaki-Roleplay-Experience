She would then extend her right hand over towards Mamoru's resting body. If allowed, the snake would open it's mouth wide before attempting to bite at the center of Mamoru's chest, latching itself to his skin.

"Alright...My hands are a little cold right now so don't be alarmed." she warned, rubbing her hands slightly together before covering them in a light green hue.

She would attempt to place her hands onto Mamoru's body, sliding them across his arms, chest, abs, neck, and jaw. 

"Where did it hurt the most?" she asked, her body basically almost ontop of his by her positioning.* - Sat Oct  3 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) swallowed whatever cake she had left in her mouth before placing the plate onto her lap. "So...I was with Hideki....He told me about Ushinawa and Mariana's death....and I could see a different Hideki in front of me...I could feel it.


I...I...Kissed him...Thinking it would bring the real Hideki back...and I felt so guilty about it....because I was doing it for the wrong reason...So I told him I felt like I was taking advantage of him...Because he was emotionally vulnerable.."

She paused, taking a few slow breaths. " After that...He's been acting as if I'm less than human...and makes crude remarks.."* - Sun Oct  4 02:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) tried to place her left hand on Hideki's shoulder. If successful, she would whisper, "Hideki...please..stop acting like this..," her green eyes starting to grow a faint tint of red as if ready to cry.* - Sun Oct  4 06:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would have her hand thrown off Hideki's shoulder, his words cutting her like a hot knife. Her already reddened eyes quickly began to secrete tears that seemed to come without stopping. Her body quivered from this action, believing Hideki's words to be the worst thing she had heard him say, and he had said several things before. Her teeth gritted slightly before her whole body collapsed, her knees striking the ground as she began to audibly sob. *My medical jutsus can't fix a shattered heart..* she thought as she realized she had now lost everyone she cared about more than anything: Hanabi, Ushinawa, Mariana, and now Hideki.* - Sun Oct  4 06:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's eyes were bloodshot red by this point, her cries seemingly ignored by most as she struggled to pull back her fueding emotions. *Hanabi...why did you leave me like this..* she thought remembering her old teacher and caretaker. Her hands seemed to placed on the ground, perching herself up, *I..I need to stop...stop caring....But...it's...too hard.* she said in her mind as she pushed off the ground, slightly pushing against Reguel, attempting to shove him. 

"Leave me alone...!" she shouted at the innocent boy.* - Sun Oct  4 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) says: Are you. - Sun Oct  4 06:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) took a few steps back, having her head flicked by Reguel. * I swear if he does that again...* she would think, taking a few more steps back. "We are all going through hard times...He doesn't have a monopoly on that...Fuck him, that selfish bastard!" she shouted to the sky. "Fuck all of you!" she shouted, this time to the rest of the shinobi that were there. Of course she didn't really mean it towards Kuro, but the rest...who knows...

She would then storm off.* - Sun Oct  4 06:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) formed three handseals, her body still facing Mamoru. A single white snake woud slither out from her sleeve, coiling itself around her right hand. It would hiss a few times, although because of its relative size and non-violent tendencies, it sounded somewhat adorable. It's mouth quickly became unhinged as it lunged towards Hideki's shoulder in an attempt at biting at him through his clothes if he had not removed them before hand. It would sting slightly before releasing a wave of relief.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would quickly rummage through her bag, pulling out a single glass of sealed milk. She placed it on the table in front of her, performing a single handseal. Her hands would give a green glow, placing them onto the glass of milk immediately. She held them there for a few seconds before they lost their green color. "Alright..Drink this, it should help."

She would then hand him the glass.* - Mon Oct  5 02:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made her way closer to the group, giving Hideki a lackluster look. The green of her eyes slightly faded. "Hideki...When are we going to train....?" she asked caring very little if she interrupted.* - Mon Oct  5 04:06:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) watched him perform the technique, physically forming the same handseals that he had just performed to better memorize them. "That's it? No blood?"* - Mon Oct  5 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: None. - Mon Oct  5 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded. She formed the handseals that Hideki had performed, making sure to take her time with each one, engraving the chain of commands with ease. She was learning to control her chakra, releasing too much in this instance causing her attempt to produce no outcome; her sleeves remained snakeless. She looked at Hideki, almost as if glaring; her squint game was on point. "I'll get it...don't you worry."

She ran through the seals once more, This time using the necessary chakra to perform the technique. She would thrust her left arm out towards Hideki causing three snakes to fly out, swirling and thrashing about between them. They would almost instantly poof, signifying that Misa was in no way a master of the technique. * - Mon Oct  5 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I owe you one. - Mon Oct  5 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) reached into her bag, pulling out a single glass of sealed milk. "Here, hold my milk in your hand." she said extending it out towards him. If he grabbed it, she would form a single handseal causing her hands to glow a slight green hue. She would then place her hands onto the milk, close to Mamoru's own hands; her hands would rest there for a bit.* - Mon Oct  5 04:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) took in a deep breath before releasing it. "Alright..I trust you." she said closing her eyes. She would then try to mentally distribute her chakra downwards, seeping through her feet. "This...this feels so odd." she complained, the ground beneath her, which was stone and not floorboards, allowing it to turn into sand. Her body seemed to seep into the ground, slowly, ending at her ankles. The ground beneath her would return to stone. "Oh god...Oh god!" she began to panic as she was unable to wiggle free.


She would try to calm herself down, taking in breath after breath. She would release the chakra once morel the ground turning into soft sand once more. She would allow her whole body to sink into the sand, her head being the exception. As she realized how far she went in, she would allow her body to rise back out, ot wanting to go all the way down. "I..I think I did it..right?"* - Tue Oct  6 02:11:50 2015
