<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked over towards the lone male. "Why are you out here all alone? You must be rather bored just standing here..." she said, her silky black hair dangling gently over her shoulders.* - Tue Sep 22 01:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I'm Kuro by the way. And you are? - Tue Sep 22 01:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's soft green eyes looked onto Kuro's figure. Her soft complexion seemed warmer, reflecting the light off her cheeks, or whatever was showing as her hair continued to cover most of her face.

A smile slowly started to form on her face, her soft peach lips cracking open to reveal pristine white teeth. "I'm Misa...It's nice to meet you." she said joining the boy in meditation. She would quickly close her eyes and take a deep breath. "This is relaxing.."* - Tue Sep 22 01:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had sat down, dirtying her rather onyx kimono. She had doven into the world of meditation as she heard Kuro's words enter her thoughts. "Hmm? Do you mean meditating...or joining strangers?" she asked  giving a playful smirk as she had been in a way, playing with the boy. * - Tue Sep 22 01:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had suddenly released a small giggle, quickly halting this display of laughter to continue her rythmic display of breathing. "Sometimes...and No...I just don't like seeing people be lonely when they can be with company." she said placing her hands together as if to pray.* - Tue Sep 22 01:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded, her eyes closed casually, without any strain to keep them closed. "That's very nice of you to say. I would like to think of myself as a kind person...It's what pushed me to become a medical shinobi." she said now smiling amidst her meditative stance. She remained seated on the floor, her legs crossed and her hands placed together. She could feel her inner chakra aligning perfectly.

* - Tue Sep 22 01:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would blush slightly, tilting her head downwards slightly, causing her hair to fall forward, covering up her warming cheeks; she didn't want him to see. "You're too polite...Although I feel like there are medics who are the opposite of what you say...I want to change that...because, helping someone is the best thing you can do..you know?" she said having now taken a break from her short speech to take a deep breath. "So, what do you do? Are you a medic as well? Seeing as how you're so polite and friendly?"* - Tue Sep 22 01:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) let out another soft chuckle. "I like your view, and I too believe that violence is unnecessary; which is why I became a medic. I know that violence is a staple of life and will never leave...,but...At least I can tend to it...You know?" she asked as if to reconfirm her own beliefs. "Know what...I'll let you in on a secret.....I don't know any medical ninjutsu..." she said with a louder cackle after her last statement.* - Tue Sep 22 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded, this time opening her eyes. Her emerald eyes glancing around the area to see if anyone was watching. "Well....Yes. I never got around to learning the basic medical ninjutsus, but instead came up with my own technique." she said, her voice becoming more pleasant. "I would show you, but I don't entirely know if you can keep a secret...." she said extending her arm out to try and poke Kuro in the arm with her index finger.


"But yeah...I use bandages...Weird right?"* - Tue Sep 22 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded slightly aggressively. "Right..Right..You're so wise." she said attempting to nudge, possibly even push the boy while still seated on the floor. "Have you always been this lax?"* - Tue Sep 22 02:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded, having begun to slightly doze off by how calm and comfortable she was. Quickly waking up, she bluttered out, "But that's what makes you wise. " she said slowly leaning forward allowing herself to push off the ground and stand up. "It's been really nice meditating with you...It really has, but I have to get back home...My mother must be worried."* - Tue Sep 22 02:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) gave him a polite bow before making her way towards her mountain-top home. "See you around sometime...right? Next time we can get some tea!" she shouted once she was too far to speak normally.* - Tue Sep 22 02:46:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had bought a new outfit, believing it would somehow impress Kuro, the boy she had met the other day. It was almost constantly lonely in the village and she had finally found a friend she liked, or possibly more. He was a rather handsome boy, and a gentleman at that. She wasn't sure if she would be able to obtain such a fine boy, but she promptly moved onward in hopes  of finding someone else that could help her in her medical endeavors.* - Tue Sep 22 14:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made her way to the top of the highest mountain. Thats's where the Raikage's mansion was, but it seemed that there was nothing and nobody there. It would surely mean she would have to wait quite a while to meet someone.* - Tue Sep 22 14:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) decided to meditate like the time before.* - Tue Sep 22 14:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) continued to meditate, making sure to regulate her breathing. She also seemed to wait for anyone or anything that appeared to be aother Kumogakure shinobi. Alas, the planet seemed empty with little to no inhabitants.* - Tue Sep 22 14:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) continued to remain in her meditative stance. She truly wanted to learn more about the medical field, it seemed she could never stop learning. She loved to learn and knowledge was a factor that continues to push her.* - Tue Sep 22 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) wondered where everyone was...* - Tue Sep 22 15:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked down at her feet. "I like these shoes."* - Tue Sep 22 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was starting to get annoyed by how deserted the village seemed.* - Tue Sep 22 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would find a rather odd patch of ground, seemingly changed in the past few days. Her ability to think far superior than a few other shinobis allowed her the knowledge to tell something was recently buried in the churned ground. Anyone could effectively figure out that that exacty patch of ground was different than the rest of the surrounding enviornment. Leaving to find a shovel, she returned and began to dig up what eventually appeared to be a young female body. *I guess I now have something to study with...* she thouht as she dragged it back home.* - Tue Sep 22 16:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked down onto the girl's body, it was filthy as ever avin been buried. Dirt and grime seemed to cover every crevice of her body. *I'm going to have to clean this...aren't I...* she thought as she looked around the kitchen she had dragged the body into.* - Tue Sep 22 16:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) took a shower to remove all the dirt on her frmo digging up the grave.* - Tue Sep 22 16:29:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made her way back up the mountain that seemed almost always empty, except this time it seemed that there were actual people there. At first glance, it looked like a couple of average individuals, she didn't know better and therefore continued to move. Once up close, she gave them a warm smile, her eyes nearly squinting with how happy she was to see people. "Hey there." said said with a polite wave.* - Tue Sep 22 22:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's face quickly returned to normal from the sudden ubrupt rudeness given by the male leading the seemingly together pack. "I'm Lady Misa....Up incomming medic of of Kumogakure....It's a pleasure to meet you....ugh..." she stopped allowing, better yet, giving the man a chance to introduce himself and his brotheren.* - Tue Sep 22 22:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Blade to the neck. - Tue Sep 22 23:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Tue Sep 22 23:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Really? - Tue Sep 22 23:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Where is he now? - Tue Sep 22 23:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Resting probably, and considering how he is so.. - Tue Sep 22 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Gifted physically he is free of his injury. - Tue Sep 22 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps he is praying. - Tue Sep 22 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I know not of what he does anymore, nor do I care. - Tue Sep 22 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked at the leader. "You don't seem to be very fond of him..." she said softly, her voice at half its strength.* - Tue Sep 22 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I am the Sandaime. Or was. - Tue Sep 22 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: May I ask what happened? - Tue Sep 22 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 22 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No, he is a good person. - Tue Sep 22 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I gave the title back to Niaz-Sama. - Tue Sep 22 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Just like that? - Tue Sep 22 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Of course. - Tue Sep 22 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I cared nothing for the title itself. - Tue Sep 22 23:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Can't really say I cared for the people either. - Tue Sep 22 23:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You're probably wondering. - Tue Sep 22 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Why I took the title in the first place, right? - Tue Sep 22 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: That hadn't really crossed my mind...but...go ahead, tell me? - Tue Sep 22 23:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I see.. - Tue Sep 22 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well, it was to disgrace the first Raikage, Niklaus. - Tue Sep 22 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But enough. - Tue Sep 22 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Perhaps since Mariana has taken you under her wing. - Tue Sep 22 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You two should spar. - Tue Sep 22 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: While I destroy Hideki. - Tue Sep 22 23:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Destroy him anally? - Tue Sep 22 23:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Or perhaps Hideki? - Tue Sep 22 23:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Would like to test his hand. - Tue Sep 22 23:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I know you're a Medic. - Tue Sep 22 23:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But you still need to know how to defend yourself.- - Tue Sep 22 23:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Ugh....I'm not that good of a fighter.. - Tue Sep 22 23:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Then you'll improve. - Tue Sep 22 23:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was suddenly left al-* - Tue Sep 22 23:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You can learn to be a good fighter. - Tue Sep 22 23:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Go forth then, Hideki. - Tue Sep 22 23:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Are you sure? - Tue Sep 22 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had no idea what was going on. "I'm ...ugh..more into learning and studying...." she tried to input.* - Tue Sep 22 23:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Well, what elements do you have? - Tue Sep 22 23:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Fire and Earth. - Tue Sep 22 23:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm. - Tue Sep 22 23:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: No no no. - Tue Sep 22 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Let her learn her medical techniques, first. - Tue Sep 22 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Tue Sep 22 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright - Tue Sep 22 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: She cannot be doing many things at once. - Tue Sep 22 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Trust me. - Tue Sep 22 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: Does that mean she's going to teach me? - Tue Sep 22 23:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: ^_^ - Tue Sep 22 23:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: >_> - Tue Sep 22 23:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked over towards her new queen. "Well, Lady Mariana, will we be starting my training then?" she asked in a rather excited tone. * - Tue Sep 22 23:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sigh. - Tue Sep 22 23:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I suppose this means Hideki and I will spar. - Tue Sep 22 23:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: Both of them look so similar....He could be fighting a clone for all I know... - Tue Sep 22 23:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Yes, again. - Tue Sep 22 23:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: It wouldn't be fair to fight him with the Sharingan. - Wed Sep 23 00:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Come. - Wed Sep 23 00:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Damn right it wouldn't. - Wed Sep 23 00:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: So..Where are we going to spar at. - Wed Sep 23 00:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Uh, farther down. - Wed Sep 23 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I've been meaning to try this new jutsu. - Wed Sep 23 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Shinra Tensei. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Read it, and learn it. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Can we watch? I haven't seen a good fight in days. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: That scroll. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: We roll a dice to see who goes first. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Odds or Evens. - Wed Sep 23 00:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Odds, I go first. - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Evens, you got last. - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Yes... - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Sounds good. - Wed Sep 23 00:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) bows to her apparent queen. "Thank you Lady Mariana, " she said with grace and happiness in her voice. She began to unravel the scroll, quickly gluing her eyes to the paper in front of her. Her crystal clear, green eyes fixated on every word transcribed on the parchment.* - Wed Sep 23 00:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) continued to scan the text before her, reading about the healing hand technique. It was one that was really popular amongst medical shinobi when they first start out, making her chance to learn the technique extra exciting.* - Wed Sep 23 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Did I miss anything? - Wed Sep 23 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Had been reading her scroll, patiently and enthusiastically, her face going through the motions of performing several expressions as she was enjoying her reading adventure. Suddenly, she heard a foreign voice near her, catching her attention. Looking over towards the source of the noise, she was able to make out a strange figure. She let out a screech, quickly covering her mouth to muffle out the rest of her scream. The almost alien appearance of the masked being had frightened her.* - Wed Sep 23 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) started to calm down, her hand removing itself from her mouth. "I'm sorry...I just...Didn't expect you..or really anyone here..." she said, her eyes barely making contact with the foreign mask. She wasn't sure what to do, being slightly disturbed. "Wh-..Hi.." she ended up saying.* - Wed Sep 23 00:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had been looking at Hanabi the entire time she was transforming. She had never seen anything like this in her entire life, but this transformation was extremely disturbing. A shiver of electricity ran through her body as each inch of her body twitched with disbelief. *Oh god...what is...she...* she thought having seen her humanoid breasts become displaced by scales. She was disturbed, but at the same time intrigued by the unknown, and this lady...person...thing...was one giant unknown.

"I'm...Misa..." she managed to say between each stare.* - Wed Sep 23 00:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) thinks: Hideki use the force. - Wed Sep 23 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: You play to much. - Wed Sep 23 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had her cheek poked by the creature before her. Her body visibly shivered at the touch. She didn't know what being 'Another Hideki' meant and she wasn't sure she wanted to know, her pursuit of knowledge may not run that deep. "ugh...May I ask...what....=are=...you?" she asked with no disrespected intended...just curiousity.* - Wed Sep 23 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I just tol dyou to stay away from her, Hanabi. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Ddon't mess up my child. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I mean, my servant. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I mean my slave. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: UGH. MY STUDENT. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: You already messed up ur child with this drain. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Don't mess up my student. - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: -omit- - Wed Sep 23 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 00:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's eyes seemed fixated on Hanabi's finger, her inability to focus on anything other than the physical contact the supposed human was giving her. This caused her to barely catch onto the fact that she was secreting something from her 'skin'. She couldn't focus on the rest of the woman's body, her eyes still glued to her finger. She didn't know what to say or what to do and simply looked uncomfortable.* - Wed Sep 23 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...I feel as if Hanabi is being awkward... - Wed Sep 23 01:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Quit being a bitch, - Wed Sep 23 01:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . .. . , - Wed Sep 23 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 23 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) didn't even see anything because of how fast she was. "Right.." she said unsure of what was happening seeing as how her teacher had somehow brought forth what seemed to be an oversized slug. * - Wed Sep 23 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What was your name again girl? - Wed Sep 23 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Misa.....Wh-what was your name?.....girl? - Wed Sep 23 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am Hanabi. - Wed Sep 23 01:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The feathered serpent~ - Wed Sep 23 01:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . .Right...It's been...Different...meeting you. - Wed Sep 23 01:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And it has been a pleasure meeting you~ - Wed Sep 23 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hydro(Dillion13) says: .......Uh. - Wed Sep 23 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Can..Can I ask...why you're secreating fluids? - Wed Sep 23 01:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Why? - Wed Sep 23 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hydro(Dillion13) says: Weird group.. - Wed Sep 23 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I don't really know. - Wed Sep 23 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Just curious. - Wed Sep 23 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It just happens. - Wed Sep 23 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Oh...That's...odd. - Wed Sep 23 01:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It is normal for me. - Wed Sep 23 01:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: ..Right. - Wed Sep 23 01:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Who are you? - Wed Sep 23 01:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: It seems she's moved on to someone else....Kind of hurts... - Wed Sep 23 01:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had suddenly clicked something in her mind. "Wait...Hanabi of the feathered serpeant....Snakes I'm assuming...Like the kind Ushinawa and Hideki were using? Are you three related?"* - Wed Sep 23 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hydro(Dillion13) says: I'm Hydro. - Wed Sep 23 01:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had been looking at her own hand, making sure she hadn't been secreating anything out of the ordinary, to see if it was normal for her too. Her palm would glow green from her palm, starting to practice her newfound jutsu, making sure to only use a little bit of her chakra. "Hmm? Private? Yeah that would be okay...Could I take a sample of that fluid though?" she asked wanting to later be able to investigate more into it.* - Wed Sep 23 01:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Follow me. - Wed Sep 23 01:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hydro(Dillion13) says: Mhm. - Wed Sep 23 01:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would quickly become engulfed by Hanabi's rather cramped home. 

"Cozy.." she said taking a look around, observing everything she possibly could. *So far...Normal.** - Wed Sep 23 01:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had taken two quick look arounds before settling back onto Hanabi.

"I don't know..I'm at a loss for words." she said, her face slightly flushed from this unexpected moment. She was always naturally curious, but this rather odd phenomenon . 

"I'm sorry...It's just...I've never seen anything like this...can the others do this? Hideki and Ushinawa?"* - Wed Sep 23 01:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) seemed petrified after seeing Hanabi's unique but disturbing facial appearance.
She seemed to quickly freeze upon being touched, unsure of what the protocol for this was. "So you are in a way...A clan of snakes..right? This is your snake den?" she asked with a slight chuckle afterwards. 

"Lycanthrope...Interesting...So they are summoning...I've only heard about that in books but I've never really seen it. Lady Mariana....She can summon as wel right? Slugs?" she asked really hoping that her teacher wasn't just creating or possibly carrying around slimey slugs.


"Would it be out of place to ask why you chose to be a 'Lycan'?"* - Wed Sep 23 02:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It is a long and complicated story that I will not bother getting into. - Wed Sep 23 02:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But I became a lycan to live. - Wed Sep 23 02:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would glance at the slime that seemed to stretch itself between the space alloted by Hanabi's hand and her cheek. She was slightly grossed out on the inside, but the outside seemed more and more paralyzed with disbelief at what she was witnessing.

"W-wow..." she let loose from her mouth as she quickly tilted her head upwards to avoid looking at the woman's naked body. She was slightly embarassed, her face turning a little bit more pinkish with the situation that was happening. "You're naked...." she mentioned, as if she hadn't known.* - Wed Sep 23 02:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could slightly hear that she was putting on clothes, quickly returning her gaze; her cheek still a bit slimey. "I haven't really heard of searpents having wings...." she tried inputting her opinion, ignornantly assuming it was correct. 

"A....what?" she awkwardly asked, pretending to not have heard the woman.* - Wed Sep 23 02:25:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: they would also be lycans like I am. - Wed Sep 23 02:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hell of a dream isn't it? - Wed Sep 23 02:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 23 02:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: a rather...unique dream. - Wed Sep 23 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: So that means you have been teaching others how to summon snakes? I mean...that would have to be a requirement..Right?" - Wed Sep 23 02:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I have thought Ushinawa and Hideki the summoning only. - Wed Sep 23 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I gave up on that dream long ago. - Wed Sep 23 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded. "Sounds too erotic anyways.." she said looking down at the floor beneath her. She was a rather conservative person when it came to topics involving sex. "So what do you plan on doing now?" she asked finally reaching up to her cheek to wipe away the slime that had still been there.* - Wed Sep 23 02:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) fixated her emerald eyes on the female's movements. "Right, I'm sort of glad I found them....this villlage had been rather stale and they're a rather nice breath of freshness....You too." she added, referring to her odd ability to transform. "Hopefully Mariana can teach me everything she knows so I can help others, and be there for them." she said, her right hand reaching towards her chest. A singular emerald hung low on her neck, resting atop her breasts. She would touch it, hold it softly as if it meant something to her.* - Wed Sep 23 02:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 23 02:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Well, what about Hideki? - Wed Sep 23 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Ushinawa? - Wed Sep 23 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Teaching them surely is helping them...no? - Wed Sep 23 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Helping others can even save them...even those you care for. - Wed Sep 23 02:53:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I need to impress a certain someone that is always nagging me. - Wed Sep 23 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And I do not really have anyone I care for. - Wed Sep 23 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The last person that I cared for, my ex-girlfriend tried having me killed. - Wed Sep 23 02:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) hadn't known who this person was, but it quickly caused Misa's face to go from somewhat passionate to a more depressed manner. "You can't really have that much hate for someone...Can you?" she asked.* - Wed Sep 23 03:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Oh I do not hate her at all~ - Wed Sep 23 03:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What is your story? - Wed Sep 23 03:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) scoffed slightly. "Nothing special....My father was mugged when I was six, broke down the door one night, bleeding after having been stabbed by the mugger...He died in front of me." she stated, looking down at the floor.

"That's when I vowed to become a medical shinobi; so I can save whomever needs it...to save a life," she paused before continuing. "It's been my mother and I ever since, but she's fallen ill...mentally and uncurable..She's basically forgotten how to do any and everything....I take care of her as much as I can, but...it's no use." she said with sorrow in her voice while reaching for the emerald dangling from her neck. 

* - Wed Sep 23 03:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: But I can try. - Wed Sep 23 03:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) smirked slightly. "Maybe I can save you." she said playfully, her green eyes looking at the covered figure.* - Wed Sep 23 03:31:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well Ushinawa cuts me up with his Katana whenever we fight. - Wed Sep 23 03:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: So you can save me then I  guess. - Wed Sep 23 03:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Right. - Wed Sep 23 03:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 23 03:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 23 03:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) gave a sudden and quick yawn. She noticed a spare bed and quickly slumped over to it, quickly laying her back onto the surface. "Is it okay to take a nap?"* - Wed Sep 23 03:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Take the spare bed. - Wed Sep 23 03:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) appeared beside Kuro, giving him a warm greeting.* - Wed Sep 23 13:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) shrugged slightly. "I don't know...a bit off I guess." she said not really in the mood to meditate. She seemed to stand there, almost hugging herself in the manner in which her arms were crossed and hands holding onto her elbows. Her blonde hair done in a ponytail fashion as her green eyes peeked out from beneath bangs.* - Wed Sep 23 13:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked down at the boy. "Problems? No...I don't have any at the moment.." she confessed before turning slightly towards him. "I just encountered this woman...creature...thing...The other day...Her name was Hanabi. Her body was so mutated...it was both disturbing and interesting...It's just a little hard to get a grip on." she said, having let loose the dam holding back her words.* - Wed Sep 23 13:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded. "She had scales across her body...even wings...Can you believe that!?" she near shouted at the boy trying to get across the notion that she wasn't at all normal.* - Wed Sep 23 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked confused. She didn''t sound disgust, better yet, she sounded rather enthusiastic about her. "She told me she's a lycan, tht she can transform into this creature form. " she said trying to change Kuro's incorrect perception.

"Anyways...that's what happened to me yesterday.."* - Wed Sep 23 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: A lycan? What is that? - Wed Sep 23 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) cleared her throat.

"The way she put it was that she can transform into an animal...that's about it."* - Wed Sep 23 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded. "Yeah. She msot definitely is." she said with confidence.* - Wed Sep 23 14:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see. - Wed Sep 23 14:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Better news? - Wed Sep 23 14:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) tried to place her hand on Kuro's shoulder. "Ready!?"* - Wed Sep 23 14:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded back at him, her naked hand slowly beginning to give a green glow. It was medical chakra as it began to supposedly heal Kuro's not so injured shoulder.* - Wed Sep 23 14:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) scratched her hairless chin once before saying, "Her name is Mariana."* - Wed Sep 23 14:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I never heard of her. Is she good? - Wed Sep 23 14:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: She's decent for now. - Wed Sep 23 14:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had began to smile, still looking at the seated boy. "So, what have you been up to? Meditating as usual?" she asked thinking that she already knew the answer.* - Wed Sep 23 14:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Yep. - Wed Sep 23 14:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I've been meditating for a while. I also tried to stop a shinobi from leaving the village and going down the path of revenge, but my words didn't reach him. - Wed Sep 23 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I just hope that he finds the light before it's too late. - Wed Sep 23 14:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Besides that, there hasn't been anything new. - Wed Sep 23 14:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's eyes widened slowly. "You stopped someone from abandoning the village? Who was it?" she asked rather curious of the situation.* - Wed Sep 23 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I tried to. I didn't stop. But I honestly hope the departing words I gave him stuck. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: It was someone named Maloth. Apparently he was displeased with recent events within the village. From what I understand, it was due to the death of a friend. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So he is looking for the men who took her life. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: that's saddening.... - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded before looking down the mountain. "Hopefully your words did stick, and he doesn't fall to the darkness within his heart."* - Wed Sep 23 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Indeed it is.  And I hope so too.  - Wed Sep 23 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked back to the boy. "Of course...what else could you do? If you fought him and won, what good would that do? He will eventually leave when you aren't around to stop him...If he wants to leave, he's going to leave." she said with confidence, she looked down at her empty palm, its surface glowing a soft green hue. * - Wed Sep 23 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: theres only a certain amount of talking one can do. - Wed Sep 23 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: But to resort to violence would push everything back. - Wed Sep 23 14:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Mhm. - Wed Sep 23 14:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) turned towards Hanabi with an odd expression. "Be a snake? What do you mean by that...?"* - Wed Sep 23 15:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I wouldn't suggest it, Misa. - Wed Sep 23 15:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Really? - Wed Sep 23 15:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I think I may've found someone though. - Wed Sep 23 15:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who's this someone? - Wed Sep 23 15:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: .-omit- - Wed Sep 23 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded towards Hanabi, quickly looking down at her palms. By channeling her chakra, her empty palms quickly gave off a faint green hue signalling she was using medical ninjutsu, although barely enough to do any real healing.* - Wed Sep 23 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A very beautiful woman. - Wed Sep 23 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: That's cool, I'm happy for you buddy. - Wed Sep 23 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But I need to ask you for a favor, though. - Wed Sep 23 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 23 15:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'd like to speak in private about it, though. - Wed Sep 23 15:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) whispers: What did he do? - Wed Sep 23 15:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) whispers: I did not want to really reveal any information about anything regarding me when he is around. - Wed Sep 23 15:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) whispers: He is just a general dick. - Wed Sep 23 15:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) whispers: Oh, I guess that's good to know. - Wed Sep 23 15:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 23 15:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 23 15:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I can tell you more about it in private though. - Wed Sep 23 15:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Doesn't seem like anyone is around, but if you need more privacy..Sure.. - Wed Sep 23 16:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) arrived.* - Wed Sep 23 16:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Like yourself? - Wed Sep 23 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yes and no. - Wed Sep 23 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You would become a Lycan. - Wed Sep 23 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But the snake you become would be different. - Wed Sep 23 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: That sounds kind of scary.. - Wed Sep 23 16:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It isn't really. - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The process is rather simple. - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You injest a fluid - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: and you undergo a transformation - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The transformation takes time. - Wed Sep 23 16:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Would it hurt? - Wed Sep 23 16:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: No. - Wed Sep 23 16:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You would feel sick though - Wed Sep 23 16:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked directly at the girl. "I...I'll do it.." she said taking a rather large gulp of saliva.* - Wed Sep 23 16:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'll think about it~ - Wed Sep 23 16:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I might even begin my dream after all~ - Wed Sep 23 16:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked down at her hands. "She doesn't seem to like me anyway..." she said with a bit of sadness. "You saw what she said, how she said it..."* - Wed Sep 23 16:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: She is just overly jelouse of anyone trying to make a move on Ushinawa. - Wed Sep 23 16:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: If she has thought you something then that means that she must like you. - Wed Sep 23 16:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: But...If she pushes me away because of a choice like this...then she doesn't like me. - Wed Sep 23 16:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) wasn't sure what that would entitle her to do, but she knew she would have to be strong for the future; to better save others in their time of need. "I...I understand..."* - Wed Sep 23 16:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Very well. - Wed Sep 23 16:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made her way towards the bed somewhat cautiously. She seemed to glance at the woman's body, seeing her undress. She was rather shy about her own body, but seeing someone else's body only made her compare. "Ready.." she said, laying down and opening her mouth slowly.* - Wed Sep 23 16:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) felt her mouth quickly become filled with fluids. Misa tried to effectively take down as much as she could, hert mouth quickly becoming overflowed with the liquid she tried to keep down. She gagged once or twice, spitting up a few liquid here and there. Fore the most part, she was able to take the whole liquid or at least a good portion of it. The method in which she was being fed the ooze was odd in itself, but she kept that to herself, she didn't want to offend her in anyway when she was this vulnerable.* - Wed Sep 23 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could feel the slime trickle down her cheek, before suddenly being kissed. This made her eyes widen before setting back to normal. She was speechless, having never been kissed. She stood up, using her shirt to wipe off any excess fluids. "I wont..." she said in reference to telling Mariana. 

She could feel a faint amount of movement inside of her, or it was possibly just her imagination.* - Wed Sep 23 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'll be going out now so you feel free to stay here if you want, I don't really ahve anything of value so yeah. - Wed Sep 23 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) leans up against the wall, feeling somewhat odd on the inside.* - Wed Sep 23 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: YAo - Wed Sep 23 19:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yo* - Wed Sep 23 19:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am going to visit Konoha. - Wed Sep 23 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Wanna come with? - Wed Sep 23 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yo. - Wed Sep 23 19:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Long time no see big guy. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: How have you been. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And I would not say I am Amai's friend. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: She tried to have me killed. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would be hurt internally from hearing the stranger speak. *Oh God...* she thought as she remained silent and behind the comfort of Hanabi.* - Wed Sep 23 19:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yo. - Wed Sep 23 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) simply waved.* - Wed Sep 23 19:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I don't know, and I don't care right now. - Wed Sep 23 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: But, you're welcome. - Wed Sep 23 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) felt a sudden tug at her waist, causing her to instinctively look down to catch Hanabi wrapping her arm around her. *What is she doing?* she asked herself simply looking back up to the several people that seemed to swarm the field. She didn't really know what to say, and again, remained silent.* - Wed Sep 23 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) whispers: Who are these people? - Wed Sep 23 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm the behimoth behind us is Maloth, he is from Kumogakure. - Wed Sep 23 19:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I know, I killed his friend. - Wed Sep 23 19:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The white haired male infront of us is Baen, he is from Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 19:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The female next to us is someone I have not met. - Wed Sep 23 19:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You killed his friend? - Wed Sep 23 19:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Whose friend? - Wed Sep 23 19:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Maloth's friend Amai.. - Wed Sep 23 19:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: ..... - Wed Sep 23 19:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You... - Wed Sep 23 19:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Killed... - Wed Sep 23 19:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Amai? - Wed Sep 23 19:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Saved me the trouble of having to do it~ - Wed Sep 23 20:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) gave Hanabi another look before just going with the flow. *I wonder why we're here....I guess it's better than Kumogakure..* she thought.* - Wed Sep 23 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would start to become dizzy, whether it be because of Hanabi's grasp or from other means. She staggered forwards slightly before swinging her upper body forwards causing her to bend over quickly. With that, she vomitted, a small rush of inner fluids and undigested noodles slammed into the dirt ground. All she could really do was wait to see if more came out, and hold her hair back away from her face.* - Wed Sep 23 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would spit, trying to get everything and even the taste out of her mouth. She seemed to heave slightly, drool dripping from the corners of her mouth. Her eyes seemed to water as it became hard to see through the tears. Suddenly, more came out, flowing onto the ground with a brownish tint to it; the ramen's stew mixed with the chocolate bar she had for dessert no doubt.

* - Wed Sep 23 20:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I wish I could tell you it will get better but you will continue to feel like this Misa. - Wed Sep 23 20:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) while bent over, would place her hand over her stomach. Her hand would glow green as she tried to stop her stomach from being upset. "Ughhh.." she let loose as she collapsed onto the floor, basically sitting down next to her vomit.* - Wed Sep 23 20:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That wont really help you. - Wed Sep 23 20:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Hngh - Wed Sep 23 20:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) seemed to feel better, whether it be because of her technique or because she just didn't need to vomit anymore. She remained seated, just waiting to feel better. "Right..."* - Wed Sep 23 20:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: --- - Thu Sep 24 01:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: How are you feeling, Misa? - Thu Sep 24 01:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: So the effects are aleady taking it's course. - Thu Sep 24 01:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: That's not the Misa I know... - Thu Sep 24 01:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Niza. - Thu Sep 24 01:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Why am I being arrested again? - Thu Sep 24 01:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Because I attacked you? - Thu Sep 24 01:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: For betrayal, necessary investigation, and endangering the lives of others. - Thu Sep 24 01:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ---- - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'd hate to interrupt this.. But do you have any missons available, Niza? - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm? - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ushinawa attacked you. - Thu Sep 24 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What do you need to investigate? - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Ushinawa. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Challenged me. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And I had accepted. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well here I am. - Thu Sep 24 01:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Thu Sep 24 01:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had begun to make her way into the room when she suddenly feel into a dizzy spell, crashing lightly into the door's frame. "Ugh." she moaned lightly, her eyes nearly rolling behind her head.* - Thu Sep 24 01:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: What's wrong with.. Misa? - Thu Sep 24 01:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was caught, having nearly collapsed entirely if it wasn't for the silver haired savior. "I'm...I'm fine.." she muttered, look up at the man who was helping her. "Just. A little under the weather.....Yeah..."* - Thu Sep 24 01:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Take her to a bed, I'll take care of her. - Thu Sep 24 01:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was quickly lifted, seeing as how she barely had any physical strength as this unknown illness spread and was seemingly changing her or possibly just drained her. She would be laid down on the cushioned seats behind the Mansion's desk, only being able to see the lights hanging on the ceiling as she had fallen onto her back. "Wha-...What's happening?' she managed to ask in her drowsy state.* - Thu Sep 24 01:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ... - Thu Sep 24 01:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) whispers: [Now Mariana going to kill me Q__Q] - Thu Sep 24 01:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Take her to the bed. - Thu Sep 24 01:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could feel an unknown substance begin to crawl onto her body, massaging her with their own bodies causing Misa to make slight jiggles and twitches, signifying that she was being tickled. She would be too weak to even  take the medicine and water, needing someone to feed it to her. She seemed to be be unchanging in her health as she remained laying there in her weakened state. She could barely speak now, simply staring at the blurs that were Mariana and Niza.* - Thu Sep 24 02:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Well.. - Thu Sep 24 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I think she is having a fever.. - Thu Sep 24 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Her tempature isn't that good.. - Thu Sep 24 02:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: But a few bed rests, some medicine and she'll be fine. - Thu Sep 24 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: The slugs are helping her out too. - Thu Sep 24 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: She's my student, trust me.. I won't let nothing happen to her. - Thu Sep 24 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I see... - Thu Sep 24 02:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: She'll be fine. - Thu Sep 24 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Mmmmmmm, I see you are so worried about her, mmm, Raikage? - Thu Sep 24 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I... - Thu Sep 24 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Just don't like to see people in harm... - Thu Sep 24 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) is unconcious after having been fed the medicine.* - Thu Sep 24 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: She should be resting for a bit. - Thu Sep 24 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: ...Right... - Thu Sep 24 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I suppose I should get my own rest as well. - Thu Sep 24 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Alright. - Thu Sep 24 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: I'll be here. - Thu Sep 24 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made her way slugishly towards the desk. "Wh-...what happened?" she asked, her hair disheveled as ever.* - Thu Sep 24 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) felt much better than yesterday, having enough strength to sluggishly make her way through the room. It seemed everyone was either busy or just asleep. Her clothes were unkempt, and her hair was just a mess. She maade her way towards the exit, in dire need of a wash, "Hey..Kuro.." she said almost running into him.* - Thu Sep 24 21:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded, not really wanting to speak in case it aggrivated anything in her stomach. Her cheeks turned a soft shade of pink with embarassment as she realized she was so unpleasant with her current appearance, and Kuro was able to see this. "I just...I just need a shower..." she managed to say as she tried to avert her gaze away from him.* - Thu Sep 24 21:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded again. "I'm going to go...shower" she said making her way out of the room, slowly; dragging her left foor here and there. She of course still felt ill, Mariana's "excellent" medical work could only help so much. 

As she reached the door, her cheeks plumped up as she just vomitted, containing the fluids within her mouth. With the little strength she had, she swallowed down as much of her vomit as she could before spitting up whatever was leftover.

Pass by a mirror that for some reason was just there, she could tell her lusterious blonde hair was fading in color, and her skin complexion was losing tone. Her eyes looked tired, nearly bloodshot, as she made it to the hallway.

That's when she lost all strength in her legs, collapsing forward and slamming into the ground. The thud she made would be clearly audible from within the Kage's mansion.* - Thu Sep 24 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Her suffering will only get worse.. The only sort of solace she will have is consuming more of the stuff, ironically, it will increase the rate at which she turns. - Thu Sep 24 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ...By any chance. - Fri Sep 25 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Are you Misa? - Fri Sep 25 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was passed out on a bed.* - Fri Sep 25 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) was passed out because of being sick, not because of sleep, but you wouldn't know that anyways.* - Fri Sep 25 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: How's Misa doing? - Fri Sep 25 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) begins to mutter slightly.

"H-........hana.........Bee...."* - Fri Sep 25 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ....Well then.. - Fri Sep 25 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could barely see who she was talking to, her vision having been blurred. She lifted her left hand upwards attempting to grab onto something, shaking in the process. She began to whisper, or at least try with how exhausted her body was. "Too....-elp..."* - Fri Sep 25 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: W...ere.....is....S..e... - Fri Sep 25 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Who? - Fri Sep 25 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: ....ana...i.... - Fri Sep 25 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: .... - Fri Sep 25 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Jesus christ...I don't think mine was this bad. - Fri Sep 25 04:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I think, you should lie down.. - Fri Sep 25 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: *was lying down* - Fri Sep 25 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: *looks like an idiot now* - Fri Sep 25 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ... - Fri Sep 25 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I'm not an idiot I swear.. - Fri Sep 25 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hmm. - Fri Sep 25 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yo. - Fri Sep 25 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am out of jail. - Fri Sep 25 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Arent all of you glad? - Fri Sep 25 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) is dying, but is happy.* - Fri Sep 25 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'd suggest giving her another dose. - Fri Sep 25 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) didn't want to talk, and simply rolled her head side to side as if to imply she wasn't feeling at all well.* - Fri Sep 25 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) made a face only a mother would love, before raising both hands with fingers extended, revealing only eight out of the ten were held up. She would then allow her hands to fall to either side as she tried to look up at Hanabi, slowly opening her mouth like before.* - Fri Sep 25 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's eyes opened slightly wider than normal. "H-huh?" she asked somewhat confused. It was something she wasn't expecting, and was slightly embarassed about suddenly stripping in front of so many. *If...If it stops the pain....* she thought as she began to peel away every layer of clothing, revealing a white laced bra and white panties; moving her coat and skirt to the side, groaning slightly.* - Fri Sep 25 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Fri Sep 25 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) reached up towards her chest, quickly tugging at the front hooking bra which quickly popped open. The cups of the bra sprung open revealing a modest B-sized cup, which caused her to start crying softly. Wiggling her lower half, she was able to push and slide off her panties revealing a well tamed and groomed field of pubic hair and her womanhood as well.* - Fri Sep 25 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ?_ - Fri Sep 25 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: I know I'm naked and everything...but Hideki, teach me some jutsus. - Fri Sep 25 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: -omit- - Fri Sep 25 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I see.. - Fri Sep 25 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) thinks: Hideki could have seen some good stuff. - Fri Sep 25 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) thinks: He decided to turn around. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) thinks: Pussy. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: So there are tomoe's on the gunbai aswell. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Followed by a chain attatched near the end...So it's possible for ranged attacks aswell.. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Interesting. I'll thank you later, Ushinawa. - Fri Sep 25 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would position herself just as Hanabi had desired, making sure to remain still as much as she could. Her mind began to wander, wondeirng what the new method of injecting the odd fluid would be. She would then suddenly feel the several bites on each of her limbs and sides, each bite like two parallel needles stabbing her with no regards to comfort. She clenched her teeth as the fluid flowed from the fangs and into her bloodstream as she could feel the burning of said fluid spreading. Her eyes began to tear up a rather good amount before she groaned in pain.  

After the bites and pain subsided, filled with mixed emotions she looked towards Hanabi who had commanded her to get dressed. Wiping the tears away from her eyes, she slowly began to dress herself, having noticed Hideki facing the other way. She would eventually get fully dressed.* - Fri Sep 25 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Done? - Fri Sep 25 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: M-Me? - Fri Sep 25 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mhm. - Fri Sep 25 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . .  . Yeah. - Fri Sep 25 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Fri Sep 25 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I wonder... How far I could throw this... And I wonder how bad it would hurt. - Fri Sep 25 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You could have taken a peak. - Fri Sep 25 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Tch. - Fri Sep 25 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It was a really wonderful sight. - Fri Sep 25 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Fri Sep 25 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: .... - Fri Sep 25 05:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked over towards Hideki, extending her arms out towards him. "Co...uld you take me...outside?"* - Fri Sep 25 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Sure... - Fri Sep 25 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Oi. - Fri Sep 25 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hideki. - Fri Sep 25 05:53:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What do you think she will become? - Fri Sep 25 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ...I'd rather not think about it - Fri Sep 25 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Dragon, Obviously. - Fri Sep 25 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: =omit= - Fri Sep 25 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: She lost her humanity. - Fri Sep 25 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: And that's one thing you can't get back. - Fri Sep 25 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Where to, Misa? - Fri Sep 25 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Outside. - Fri Sep 25 05:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: We're outside. - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Thanks.. - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Misa. - Fri Sep 25 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I have one condition. - Fri Sep 25 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Yes, Hanabi? - Fri Sep 25 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Only transform when your life is in danger. - Fri Sep 25 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You may have wanted it but keep in mind that you will be a lycan. - Fri Sep 25 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Nodded. "Understood." she said looking over towards Hideki, reaching out as she tried to grab Hideki's arm.* - Fri Sep 25 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: How is your training progressing Hideki? - Fri Sep 25 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Decently. - Fri Sep 25 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked up at him. "I assume you weren't looking...Thank you..."* - Fri Sep 25 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Good. - Fri Sep 25 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The same condition goes for you too Hideki. - Fri Sep 25 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: hm? - Fri Sep 25 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: What condition? - Fri Sep 25 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: As much as you may hate it the transformation will help keep you alive. - Fri Sep 25 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Think of it as your trump card. - Fri Sep 25 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Tch.. - Fri Sep 25 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Don't 'Tch' me. - Fri Sep 25 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am telling you this so that you can get out of a certain situation alive. - Fri Sep 25 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's whatever I guess. - Fri Sep 25 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Not like you gave me a choice. - Fri Sep 25 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well~ - Fri Sep 25 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) smiled towards Hideki, feeling her stomach softly churn. "Well...If it's a trump card...I'm going to have to learn to defend myself." she said placing her hands together. "Can....can you teach me anything? ....I ...I have fire."* - Fri Sep 25 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ushinawa can teach you Katon techniques. - Fri Sep 25 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) felt comfortable holding onto Hideki's arm and therefore continued to do so, seeing how he hadn't moved or signaled that he wanted it to stop. With her free hand, she took the scrolls, looking at them as best she could with a single hand. "Seeing as how I...I don't really know any...This should do." she said giving him a smile.* - Fri Sep 25 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) continued to smile, this time letting go of his arm so that she could turn her body to look at Hanabi. "Hanabi, can you teach me anything? I..I also have earth." she managed to say before grabbing onto her churning stomach. "hngh.." she muttered.* - Fri Sep 25 06:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: What would you have done? - Fri Sep 25 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: back* - Fri Sep 25 06:33:23 2015
