"Wait..so the Raikage needs treatment?" she asked know noticing it was going to be a clash of morals as to who would be treated first.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) got on her knees, rubbing her hands together in preparation. A green hue began to radiate from her palms as she placed it on the unconcious girl's chest. She couldn't do much else, seeing as everyone seemed to be autistic, or a six year old when it came to knowing what happened to her. There were no details of her appearance, so she couldn't infer or spot any abnormalities.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) scanned the girl's body, noticing that this bitch had a rather bulky looking shoulder compared to the other. Without hesitating, she placed her hands on the mass and pushed it back into place. It would hurt like a bitch, but who knows if she actually felt it, she didn't care. She would then get up. "She should be fine...I'm going to go help the Ginger." she said running south.* - Fri Oct  9 03:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had barged in, noticing the now ill-fated Raikage laying on the bed. Nearby was the girl that everyone had seen take the man, fan matching the description. *She killed him...She took him away from the medical shinobi present...she did this..* she thought as she immediately formed two handseals before releasing a swarm of rampaging serpents towards the unsuspecting female. The close proximity and the size of the room would make the attack rather devestating as the snakes attempted to bite onto each limb of the girl, two on each arm, leg, chest, and one to the face making a total  11 snakes that had been released for their feeding.* - Fri Oct  9 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would have used the Jutsu to throw the girl across the room. The bites would sure cause deep wounds causing her to bleed. Misa began to huff and puff, trying to regulate her breathing after witnessing what she believed to be an assassination by the girl. "Heiwa...please....check to see if the Kage is breathing...he...he can't be gone." she stated making her way towards the previously attacked girl. She formed three handseals before allowing four snakes to coil out of her sleeve appearing almost like an alien-like hand over her own. The snakes themselves were white in nature, with beady black eyes. Without hesitating, the four snakes would fly out towards the girl in an attempt to bite onto her body, their fangs being able to break through simple clothing.

If successful, she would surely fall into a comatose state seeing as how the medical chakra and venom inside each snake would cause an adverse reaction within the girl causing her to painlessly fallinto this state. *We...We can deal with you...later.* she thought turning back to the boy and her lord.* - Fri Oct  9 04:23:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) thinks: I sent him to get Hideki....but he's in the other room? - Fri Oct  9 04:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: He was wounded, and she took him away from all of the medics. - Fri Oct  9 04:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) felt as if Hideki cared little for his own Raikage. "Hideki...listen...What are you doing?" she asked unsure of what he was trying to do.* - Fri Oct  9 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I know what I'm doing, no one is to touch the raikage's body. He is to -stay- here until further notice. I want to question this woman, if she -truly- killed the Raikage. - Fri Oct  9 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And I understand we have had some bad bonds as of late. - Fri Oct  9 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: And I'll apologize for that. - Fri Oct  9 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) grit her teeth slightly. "Fine." she cracked, making her way towards the near-death kunoichi. Her hands placed nowhere near the girls wounds. She didn't want to heal her,  her back facing Hideki making it hard for him to notice. 

At one moment, she retracted her right hand, brushing her hair away from her neck. As she did, she would rub the back of her neck lightly before returning her hand's position onto the girl's body. The moment her hand left her own neck, a tattoo became visible. To those who were able to see, it was a white and red fan outlined in black; it would quickly become hidden by her blonde hair once more.* - Fri Oct  9 04:59:31 2015

Her look of shock transformed into a glare as she gave a small smile. She took in a deep breath before opening her mouth and releasing a chemical that was built up in her mouth, instantly transforming into a mist the moment it came out of her mouth. It would be aimed towards Shoji, releasing enough from her mouth to not reach the two by the door. After the mist was released, she would jump back onto the table behind her to get a better positioning.

The mist would attempt to engulf the boy in a 3x3 tile range, with him being at the center. If he took in any bit of the smoke, he would surely be in danger. His body would slowly begin to shut down.* - Sun Oct 18 00:29:26 2015
