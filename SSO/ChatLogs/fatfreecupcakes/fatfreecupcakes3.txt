Mustering whatever strength she had left, she made her way over to Hideki, sitting beside him. Without saying anything, she tried to reach out and grab any free hand he had, and just hold it.

Her anger building up inside, rapidly becomming too hard to control. That's when her body quickly rose a few inches having Hideki still hold her and be lifted by the Hercules known as Mariana. This sudden sporradic derailment of her posture caused her anger to spill slightly out of the boiling pot causing her chakra to fluctuate through her hand; causing her hand to quickly cause fire natured chakra to coat it, whilst still holding firmly onto Hideki.

She placed her hand onto the scroll , her finger moving around, signing her name onto the parchment. "Hanabi..." she muttered underneath her breath.* - Mon Sep 28 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ... - Mon Sep 28 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Before Hanabi died. She said you wanted to show me something. - Mon Sep 28 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded silently. She closed her eyes holding them shut for a few seconds as she took in a few deep breaths. Her skin, or at leas the visible skin, would begin to turn slightly reddish in nature as scales begin to form in patches. She would then open her eyes, revealing reptilian-like eyes, staring at the boy. "I...went through the change."* - Mon Sep 28 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Right... - Mon Sep 28 04:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: And they are gone. - Mon Sep 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: . . . - Mon Sep 28 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked down at her hands, lifting her left hand upwards. Her index finger was placed onto her tongue, as she began to suck on it, to stop the slight bleeding that was occuring.* - Mon Sep 28 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Kuro... - Mon Sep 28 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) formed a single handseal causing a stream of fire to be released from her mouth. At that same moment she would begin to channel her chakra throughout her body making sure to maintain the flamethrower. *Butterfly Art...* she thought, chakra wings appearing like extended eyelashes on the sides of her eyes. * - Mon Sep 28 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) took a heavy breath, taking a lot of herself. "No...I will become stronger....I will!" she shouted out into the tiny, empty room. She formed the handseal once more, releasing a jet of fire from her mouth. She would once again activate her ability causing a burst of chakra to rush through her mind and body, granting clarity. "Ahhh!!" she shouted as her chakra seemed to dissipate like nothing.* - Mon Sep 28 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Fell to the ground from exhaustion, her ability returning to normal. "No....I...I can't maintain it...not for long..." she said smashing her hands onto the ground immediately wincing from the pain. "I...I can't let Hanabi down...I can't....No...I wont..." she stated closing her eyes, sitting on her knees as she tried to regain chakra.* - Mon Sep 28 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) opened her eyes, placing her hands together. She formed the singular seal releasing a jet of fire from her mouth like a flamethrower. She would begin to shout as she spit the fire, causing it to be more radical and spread farther. Closing her mouth, the fire would subside. "Why did you leave me Hanabi!" she shouted into the empty space.* - Mon Sep 28 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Why! - Mon Sep 28 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would try to regulate her breathing. "Why....WHY!" she shouted over and over again.* - Mon Sep 28 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Began to form the handseal over and over again, releasing spouts of fire here and there. The flames lighting up the darkened room with each flicker.* - Mon Sep 28 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) got up from the floor. "I can't continue to fail...I...I will be the best....I will heal the world....No more tears...That's my motto...No more..." she declared forming a single handseal once more. THe fire burst forth from her mouth, immediately causing the chakra wings to appear on the sides of her eyes.* - Mon Sep 28 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would bite into the flesh of her finger, forming handseals afterwards. With a quick slam of the blood on the ground, a puff of smoke would appear, revealing a single snake. "Hey there little guy..."* - Mon Sep 28 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked down at the snake. "You're adorable...an adorable little one....I'll help you...Help you grow.." she said peering down at its defensless body, coiled up like a pyramid.* - Mon Sep 28 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) 's finger was still bleeding. "alright...Another snake!" she shouted with confidense and anger in her voice. Another string of seals, as well as the slamming of her hand onto the ground caused another snake to appear, totaling two.* - Mon Sep 28 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would begin to ponder several ways in which she could utilize snakes, several jutsus and the likes. "Now..." she softly spoke, kneeling down to pet her snakes. "Come to mommy..."* - Mon Sep 28 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) gave each snake a quick pet, feeling the scales' texture against her fingers. "You have promise...you do....When I can summon a personal creature...I will dedicate her to Hanabi..." she said promising to her baby creatures.* - Mon Sep 28 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Using the remaining blood that lingered on her finger, she formed the handseals again and again, this time summoning two snakes for a complete total of four. "I want you four to keep a watch on this house...I feel it has promise...and...I want to keep it for the family..."* - Mon Sep 28 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) nodded, smiling towards the snakes. "Go."* - Mon Sep 28 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Lord Raikage? - Mon Sep 28 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Yes? - Mon Sep 28 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) says: Is it possible to have a mission? I know...we're in a time of possible crisis...but I just need to clear my head. - Mon Sep 28 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) Caught it, quickly opening it to examine the mission she would embark. "Thank you..." she said before departing.* - Mon Sep 28 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) walked up towards the supply closet of the mansion. Grabbing a single broom, she made her way back towards the steps that met up with the entrance of the mansion. "Alright...I guess there's nothing to do but clean.." she said to herself before beginning to sweep the dust from the steps.* - Mon Sep 28 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) would continue to sweep, releasing a lot of dust into the air quickly causing her to cough, exaggerating as well. "Hanabi...I can't stop thinking about you....I just can't." she said tightening her grip on the broom with each sweep she gave. She would knock more and more dust into the air. "It's as if these steps have never been cleaned..."* - Mon Sep 28 06:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) could see the barnished wood beneath the dust that seemed to be layered immensely. "Whelp.." she said finally noticing the few steps that were left . With vigor in her blood she swept the steps crazily until they were all cleared. Once that was done, she couresed fire through her palm igniting the broom, effectively getting rid of it.* - Mon Sep 28 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) ran back to find the Raikage.* - Mon Sep 28 06:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) couldn't find that bitch ass Raikage ass.* - Mon Sep 28 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) finally found the Raikage, taking a few steps towards him. "Finished, Lord Raikage."* - Mon Sep 28 06:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) looked at it with empty expressions. "I didn't even know she had a katana..."* - Tue Sep 29 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) continued to look at the katana, not even giving Hideki a glance. Her voice began to crack slightly as she spoke, "I know we haven't talked....about what happened," she said coughing afterwards to clear her throat. "...But, we need to talk about it..=You= need to talk about it..."

She would at this time, look up from her gaze, staring at Hideki and his posture. "I want you to know...I'm here for you.."* - Tue Sep 29 02:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Misa(FatFreeCupcakes) had already cried too much, unable to muster up a single tear at the moment. "It's not your fault...if that's what you think...You couldn't have done anything to change the outcome...You couldn't have.." she said still focused on Hideki's person. "We can band together..we will...band together. We can take Erebus in a group...United we dominate...United...we rule."* - Tue Sep 29 02:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: If you roll five or six, you give some information about yourself. - Tue Sep 29 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) says: That sounds fair. - Tue Sep 29 02:44:41 2015
