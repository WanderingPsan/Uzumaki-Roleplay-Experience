"Let's begin!" in a deep voice and body which had a feeling of high chakra and physical energy.. His guantlets shining a bright bright luster silver and black, pants acting as armor as well as the upper body he possessed.. Though his form was heavy and strong, he lacked in some things but made up for it with such strength and cunning..* - Tue Nov  3 08:03:24 2015

He knew that there would be those who'd try to fuck his mind with these little arts of illusion.

<Dishonorable...Shame..SHAME ON YOUR HOUSES!!> He rushed towards her now with what seemed to be incredible running speed for his size in one blitz of his chakra enhancing speed ability in order to close in after the little girl.. (T3 like speed, 15 tiles) only in this attempt to try and back hands Izanami..However when doing this..He did not strike her directly, in face he was 1 tile away, using the force within his guantlets of converted chakra to deliver a shockwave amplified by his strength to knock her back..And he was holding back.* - Tue Nov  3 08:16:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) laughing lightly as the child was sent on her ass flying , but now standing where he last left with her casting out a jutsu of her own.."So bright.." he acted as if they were lights of candles <Not sure if my guanlets can take this...> he'd have to play such safe for now , backing away he'd charge his right hand guantlet which was for the offensive, it shined three lights upon the surface, he'd then leap into a sprint down south of Izanami's fire ball direction trying to not just avoid it but examine it so that he'd know the power behind such..For now he'd simply try and close in on the girl once more..

Punching the ground in order to use his shock wave guanlet of the right to send out a minor sand wave at the girl to toss her off balance.* - Tue Nov  3 08:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) watching the girl react, the land now alittle bit shadowy from the sand.. His eyes and body acting in sync with his mind "How troublsm..A strong brat.." he now readies the other guantlet, the converter...Now walking up towards Izanami's direction in a slow pace...

"Your skills are polished..But you lack much before you could even beat me..Aklys, champion of the Labyrinth! " he lifted his right hand up.. Mocking someone within the past  <Flexu, Flexu! FLEXU!!!!> before punching the ground in his cause to form a minute long earthquake within the area ..<Calculating this, none should be able to walk in this none other than myself..> now rushing towards her in an attempt to toss a knock out blow, a strong jab to her body! This likely giving her a feeling of having been dazed!

Is this!>  he thought to himself now looking back, his bulky body feeling the heat from the in coming attack, getting into a position in an attempt to try and block her coming attack with his forearms, not looking to reveal any further power just yet, channeling his chakra in the attempt to hold off the masterful flame, but alas he was too short on time, an explosion came about, catching him in the fire, knocking him back, only for him to slowly get back up, some burns here and there as he said ...

"Though I am holding back..You are skilled.." he claps his hands for now and slowly with a small smirk on his face.. Now looking at the lot of shinobi..

"What a worried lot..You have that right..Heh..This isn't even the finale of my oblivion art..But before I'd put any unregistered fighters into the hospital..I guess I can call this a night.." he casually dusted himself off.* - Tue Nov  3 09:03:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) cracking his knuckles , placing his guantlets on at a higher setting than they would be usual..His large body and eyes focused on Marrisa's form as he thought to himself <Ninjutsu ...Doujutsu...How cute..They'll know the wrath of Aklys..True Champion Of the Labyrinth!> when really he lost the challenge, took way too many reties and Phoenix Dawns to actually get a pass.. He stood there in his stance, now waiting for the first move to be made..He'd rush forward towards the woman in incredible speeds for his size (T3, speed gene) , looking to punch her with his right hook...

HOWEVER the punch would not need to land, concealing this fact but once fully swung, a shock wave would emit from the guantlets in an attempt to both knock her back from sudden burst and surges of chakra to his guantlets..While providing some mild damage to her, enough force to knock her back a few meters. (Attack Speed 12, Strength 18, Ninjutsu 25, Control 22) but at the same time, he was holding back by a mile..* - Tue Nov  3 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) spotting the woman move, for now he held off the shock wave strike for the moment he took to try and counter her air attack by using his left guantlet to block as durable and with the converting properties it had, he'd continue to twist his body to punch at Marrisa's direction now releasing the very shockwave punch, the sudden shockwave being wide in range for up close combat.. His body taking some hits from the wind bullets, thus damage being delth as well on him...This shockwave however being used up close was aimed to send her flying on her ass with his force of strength place into it along with the current ninjutsu power..

<She's fast...Shinobi show skill but little HONOR!> he mentally mocked.* - Tue Nov  3 22:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) eyes focused on the girl, he thought to himself <Oh this is gonna be grrreat..> he soon rushed towards the fireball enhanced wind with its blades of fire only to cock his RIGHT fist back and punch forward with a concetrated sum of force to send out towards her attack barely even being enough to fully counter due to the combination of hers and the level he held back in order to counter back at her <Ninjutsu...Is Cute..But how much longer do I need to hold back..> 

He figured he'd go and try to end this game...In a follow up of the counter attack with another punch however he rushed in at maximum speed with this one ,not even bothering to give Marrisa any time to catch a breath of air, only to strike again with an enhanced blow of force, much higher than before he aimed to strike her with his fist of the shockwave to knock her deeper into the stone wall..If it left off to his fist driving into her stomach past her hot flames, he'd have one damaged arm..It it led to an indirect hit them she'd have to roll for what damage was likely to be taken.. As his body was bruised and cut from her wind and flames already.* - Tue Nov  3 22:50:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) now watching as the one named Koji came into play, having wasted no time coming at Aklys nearly catching him off guard which such an attack at this speed with his large build and size, coming to face Koji, he'd try and use his left guantlet as a shield to block his initial attack but failing to do such caused him to be hit in such an area taking the effect damage of the strike but not too much as the first seemed critical and enough to strike out a single point but not all with the gentle fist strikes as the rest were 3 and 2, 2,, ..Aklys was not having any dishonorable acts today! 

From this, he declared "DISHONORABLE PENALTY!" now  attempting to grab the boys leg  after blocking one of the kicks ,taking damage however from it , lookin to grab him and his waist with such sudden speed and acts of reflex to seeing him in clear view now..He'd go and raise hip up while upside down, hiis guantlets held tightly on the slender hips of Koji, a firm grip strong enough to gain much control for any mans passions before he'd fall to a single knee , coating the guantlets with Koji's body in his own chakra for this strike.. 

"Shockwave Smash!" very similar to liger bomb or a body slam but in a shockwave in this sand, likely being enough to daze Koji's sense of direction and sight from taking such a heavy hit to the back and body being slammed on the ground itself..* - Tue Nov  3 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Remy(SS2015) thinks: Why're we here? - Wed Nov  4 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) having done his part in such an attack, he was taken by surprise with what Koji had done, the air palm, being too late to block such because of his reflex he was sent back, even leaping back some himself a bit only to regain his stance and then strike the ground, trying to cause a minor sand wave to cover Hoji! 

"I'm Sick Of Your Surprise Attacks!" he exclaimed at him, now leeping back a bit, holding his stance.* - Wed Nov  4 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) looking at the boy he finally slammed his fist together "Yes...And with you being a close range fighter...This means trouble..Sorry but..I am ending this.." he rushed towards Koji during his counter aiming to strike Koji's lower abdomen with a shockwave punch and knock him to fly into the rock wall behind him or into Ivel right behind him, this was an attempt!  But the  punch could be dodge, the shockwave would be much more difficult to do such with!  

"PERISH!" his right guantlet however...No more shockwaves for him as he needed to absorb more power from out or inner supply..And using his own chakra would be costy without any convertions.. But he risked it but Koji would see that it was weaker and felt like a half assed shockwave.* - Wed Nov  4 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) spotting on Koji, the man would two take into his own fighting style, striking in ana ttempt to counter his strieks with punches, a series of rapidly thrown ones with his bulky arms they'd have some great impact of force to his body, damaging him due to both his size and power if he manages!

Both roll 6 times.. 

1-2 Blocked Or miss

3-4 Hit Normal

5-6 Critical!!!!!* - Wed Nov  4 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) taking the hits being 3 criticals and 3 of them he managed to block and dodge from, the man delivered back a trade of his own blows as well during this he'd finally cock back his right hand like a loaded shot gun. He may of not had much chakra to dish out because of the Hyuugas ability, but he still had his taijutsu as he would then throw this arm forward after Koji "AGGHH!! DAmned Brat!" his fist going right after Koji, a normal strong right due to there being little hope of chakra to be surged in this strike, he aimed at Koji's chest with this blow hoping his guantlet had one last shockwave left to knock him back and out, or if Koji got brave and decided to fight back and clash their fist together, things would turn out even more so differently.* - Wed Nov  4 01:53:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) now fully charged and due to the dice roll of a Lucky 5..The shockwave emitted from the glove at the cost of his own chakra and last bit of charged convertion..This would be the unexpected change Koji may of thought of, once done, Aklys would roar with might from such a punch to send Koji away , his clothing likely being shredded up from such sheer force, So far he was the only one to release such power on and not hold back because of his taijutsu profession fighting against taijutsu made things all the more challenging than anyone with ninjutsu. "Home Run..."

Home RUn for the champion of the Labyrinth! The man fell down to a single knee, reaching into his back pouch because of Koji pushing him to a limit, taking his old guy pills and inhaler, a deep breath it was when he did this.. 

"Take me out..To the ball game..Take me out with the crowd..Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks.. I don't care if I never get back.." he laughed hardily! Standing tall now ..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) chuckled lightly as he turns around to Trilliam coming towards him with a full arsenal of jutsu all so bright and muddy, he held out his right fist as he thought <Foolish Kiting Ninjutsu users...> this LEFT glvoe was in the 1st Setting of course, if they did not notice the special trait it had by now, Trilliam may notice that the lightning, the chakra within the mud making it normal mud, being drained away as a fuel for this mans weaponry, but not only that..He had managed to piss him off!

"DISHONOR ON YOUR FAMILY FOR SNEAKING UP ON ME! FOOLISH BOYY!!!! " the ground would tremble from such, he leap into the air to avoid the actual damage of the mud, his body surging chakra, refilling all points except for a few on his shoulder that Koji struck.. His body now flickering a bright but dark light.. His body bringing out a corruption shroud, a Shroud Of Utter darkness and Pride! He soon descended upon the ground only to punch the very surface with his increase of speed, power and brute force from his anger..

THis was literally..The 3rd straw someone has pulled trying to attack him from behind and by surprise..THis attack alone caused an earthquake, sparks of black luster emitted from his form as energy shrouds him of darkness..The ground splitting apart from an attack of enhanced strength..One massive shock wave to knock each and every one of them back suddenly...He wsas PISSED.

First he would step to the left, twist his body to the right..And then thrust his arm right towards Trilliams direction in an uppercut...Now unless someone could see chakra or sense it, they'd not be able to tell where or whats coming at them seeing that shockwaves are invesible, he actually did more to AMPLIFY  this attack, making it even wider to the point of which those below would feel a slight implosion ..

Now looking to Ivel, he'd rush towards him "Patty Cake..Patty cake.Bakers.." he punched at his direction to send a shockwave that would have him rolling in the sand. "MAN!

When punching these two what SEEMEd to be normal lefts and rights.. The people around this radius in front of him would be in danger of being hit....Meaning they would have to roll or duck..Like..GET DOOWWIIUUUNN.* - Wed Nov  4 03:49:32 2015

Calling for help! This was dishonorable penalty!  Due to the shockwave before, this would of caused that mud wall to shatter, successfully knocking back everyone behind it , with an added threat of rocks being flown at them...This was because of the 3 rolled... Clones probably being destroyed, if not careful.

In the meantime, the being would punch once more to generate another punched out wave which was much more wider and stronger in order to knock them all back into the mountain, but the main focused was Yan! Because of his clones attacking and him performing many acts of DISNORABLE CODES In the game of Honorable combat. This man moved quick on his toes  but stood in mid air only now to back away to the center of the arena and stand tall..

"Honorable Combat is One on one you honorless Shinobi....Even your leader has more honor than that.." he'd state.. 

Everyone would have to roll 2 times..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Aklys(Sephiroth3000) wasting no time with the two, the man immeditately leaps into the air with a chakra enhanced jump going sky high about 30 meters, using the force of shock to his advantage while looking down, he did this to avoid the attacks thrown at him..He saw no point in fighting two people at a time, that only went against his pride and code..

"For as llong as we stand within a arena, I will only face a single person...That is my vision of honorable combat.. Two or such of the likings shows dishonor and disbeliefs in your own strength.." he cocked his fist back, now only charging the next attack at hand from how high up he was in the sky..Koji would be able to see that his chakra was decreased by 20% but he would see a massive build up in both his hands... The ground and  mountains likely shaking ,but..

He stopped..Upholding his levity, he'd take his flee for now as the night only got later .
