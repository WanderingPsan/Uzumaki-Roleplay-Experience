"All workers continue to dig to the east, any fuck ups and you will go without water for another hour in the heat.. Carry the cargo with HIGH care for what could happen to you!" she threats , it was obvously an older woman.. The workers slaved with their axes and digging through the cave..All had on similar hats to prevent the sun light and flash lights from getting in their eyes... All had campers to stay in for the night ..

Though this was day one of the mission, it could get bad.. Iza and her companions would need to find a way to smuggle their being into the fray without being noticed.* - Thu Oct  8 03:56:48 2015

"Oi, old hag, get to work..You're not even dirty yet and you're just walking around as if you need a break..GO ON! GET!" he'd push her roughly , the large work enforcer... Considering that they had no sensors aside the leader herself, no one out of the bandits had a reason to suspect this..

50 bandits in counting, the tunnel was deep, a ungeround HQ it looked like in the making for drug trading... Izanami was handed an axe to get to work and help the others dig along with a bucket to carry small rocks away.* - Thu Oct  8 04:21:32 2015

"You all hear this mans agony?...Work any slower and it'll be the same for you."

We are on red alert!" if the leader could sense them it meant she herself was close by, there probably being a stair way around, multiple ones along with the guards now currently checking each slave one by one.* - Thu Oct  8 05:24:41 2015

Despite the possible lightning that would numb her movements, it was not like she did not have a place placed for such an event of her being attacked..Paper bomb tags were tossed into the roon by kunai by the bandits who rushed in to help their leader, with three aimed at Izanami and three to Trilliam, however this being a cave ,it was likely to cause a rock fall to danger them all.

No warning but rather her own succession of combos with her two Genin Bandits.. Meanwhile during such these were being used.

Though the explosion from the clash of their attack was grand, the woman had rushed in with her follow up to be sure she had gotten some of their blood, extreme focus and the skills of a marksmen to hit her mark with the manipulated wire.. Rushing towards their direction shortly after, trying to use her other bandits earthly eleemnts to raise a slab or pilar of earth to grant her a great leap, enhanced with her high speed, shunshin came along, as she was a Jashin Flicker fighter..* - Sun Oct 11 07:17:45 2015

Meanwhile two of the earthly bandits would dig and use their hiding like a mole jutsu to hide under the ground itself, traveling on through..

While the circle was being drawn..The womans features turned into a complete black... Her eyes focused on Trilliam now.. "You've been cursed..." she'd smile sadisticly..Standing alone there, soon she'd thrust her dagger deep into her leff shoulder.Twisting the blade.* - Sun Oct 11 08:11:31 2015

 the two bandits with the lightning element would begin surging chakra through the dome to destroy any possible spider bombs as well as the dome itself to fire a series of more Lightning balls , this time at the direction of Izanami once after the dome was broken of course.

The two lightning bandits fighting Izanami found themselves to be in quite the hassle, but  as they tried to counter, one of which jumped away or atlease tried to, in an attempt to fire a set of 3 lightning balls towards Iznamai if he had managed to perform the hand seals needed, while the others hand was captured , trying to back away.

Now with the skills of the leader, due to her superior speed and reflex, she'd manage to slash Trilliam with her dagger, considering her speed of attack was 14 to his reflex of a 4, added with her shunshin, she likely took the team of shinobi by surprise..The Flicker fighting Jashin then tried to make way  to gain distance from the shinobi to prepare of course, licking the blood from her dagger, fleeing from Kilm with a mastered shunshin and speed of 10 tiles to be enhanced and thus gaining a greater distance gap between them , heading to the very edge of the mountain with her suimen to stand steady on the cliff..

In this attempt to draw her circle for her ritual, it could be assumed that she escaped with her great speed.

The woman soon stabs her leg through her right hand, piercing through with a long sharp blade which went into her upper thigh..Looking to Kilm, seeing him rush towards her as well as the bird , she kept herself at guard, trying to cause Trilliam pain, while looking to do the same to Kilm...<Get closer...Come on..> she'd throw at him a spear from her back attached with a long wire, trying to get blood from that ass as well..

"You are all worthy sacrifices!" she laughs with her new black form, only wearing her bra now the female Jashinist laughed in her circle..Probably not long at all before the bird had came, exploding about to her and  probably knocking her out of the circle she had drawn, the dust from the explosion likely masking the being of the woman..However Trilliam was likely going to feel this pain with the curse already taken place.* - Sun Oct 11 10:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Clone, Fujitora(Sephiroth3000) shows off blade a bit.

Ryujin, Fujitora just activated Ryushini no Yari: The Dragon Locksmith Blade generates the chakra flow of fire with minimal cost. Due to Fuuinjutsu seals lining up the blade from the lateral edges, fire is conjured easily and it appears that the flames that attach themselves to this blade are increasingly powerful. The blade itself is extraordinarily durable, crafted from refined magnesium reinforced steel.

[Adds +5 to Damage Calculation when using Chakra Flow Fire Only.]

"Tremble..In your own obliteration, for that is the greatst change, you pathetic youths will ever hope to accomplish in this world..." he desired to end them and mae them suffer within the grasp of deepest ,darkest pandemonium ...Because of alll that has happend within the past up to now..Oh how the Labyrinth has changed him and how the view he once had on the world did as well..He passively sparked a surge of pure chakra on the surface of his sin, with the byakugan now full at use...* - Sun Nov  1 03:11:34 2015

" he exclaimed, byakugan at full potential to see such clearly , first grappling his wrist with one hand  and jerking it to the southern direction to throw his body off , spotting Ai's Paper coming towards him he'd act quick...

There was an expectation of many coming towards him , so he'd do what no other has done before..A Play off kick the Dallas Cowboys  will never hope to accomplish in their life long careers as NFL players..This was done but however Koji's secondary and 3rd strike may of landed, but he'd notice something tin particular that his strikes had little effect on the being of this man..When Kicking Koji towards Ai with much brute force and precision to drive his big ass size monsta feet up his stomach into the very ribcage without penetration of the skin but just all force all together...He'd send Koji towards Ai's direction in hopes of knocking down two birds in one stone..Koji would continue to fly from this force at Ortho's direction, if this managed to go as far as planned then he'd achieve something the Lousiana Saints never did without Drew Brees and get a field goal touchdown!

But then there was Mizora...If the papers continued to come at him along with the girl..He'd begin to spin around to the point of which a rotation would begin the formulation process.... So much of a chakra output that a crater would be formed as it spreads out to a 15x15 tile radius...This was done to get everyone away from him and so that he'd be able to single them all out..* - Sun Nov  1 03:44:00 2015

Ai's paper shields protecting her and her party..Meanwhile, his eyes were set on other things..This beast of a man soon broke into a sprint, heading up north where it was more open to take a place of battle in, he was heading to the captial of the land...His chakra being focused on his jolts, the sprinting speed would of been enough to get him near by to the mountain....IF HE WAS GOING THERE!!! NOPE!

As Mizora was likely knocked away by his attack, he sprinted at her, full with speed to grapple her head and slam her body into the buildings wall south of them..In doing so, he used his byakugan and hyuuga ability to send a palse from his hand to her head , blasting her in with a fatal air palm..If he mananed to snach her up in time that is!..She still had a chance but for how long as seconds were passing!* - Sun Nov  1 04:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Tribus(Sephiroth3000) going after Mizora, he was stopped within his tracks as the course of direction had changed, though he could still see the other massive chakras  within the area with his sight and byakugan, the man changed course towards the direction of Shin, not that he feared anything of this direction but eventually he was taken up and stopped once more by the very paper manipulation that had threatened to bind him, he paused in such a chase to deal with this or atlease attempted to with such speed he possessed... Attempting to go and punch away some of the paper!

But alas! He was taken by surprise at this kids Koji's air palm which would of blown by away into the building behind him if powerful enough, taken off guard by the wind...However getting back up after such a fall or if he was so binded, he'd be struggling against the paper..But for now, this tyrant of a man stood stationary...

"Fools...The game has only just begun.." he then gave  them a sinister glare..Placing up a guard for now as chakra began to gather up around his body ..Perhaps a shockwave was coming...Perhaps he was going to do something else entirely...Perhaps this meant to run..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Labyrinth, Tribus(Sephiroth3000) still being held by the restriction, the mans chakra had been building up for some time with how high his chakra control was, the man would eventualy begin to slow a bright golen light with the concetration of a breahing method <Seven Heavenly Breaths! First Breath!> for those who did not know, this was the Sunagakures verson of the Eight inner gates but much different in appearance, this adjusted his strength much like the 1st gate but with him, being twice as deadly..

Now having the strength he needed to move, there was a sudden attack for his groin! He'd try to block this with his forearm but producing the same effect of him being hit into the skies above, likely feeling the shock of the force impact being striken to his nuts!  Then there was  the flames of Shin threatening to come after his direction as well..He continued to focus on his formation rather than worry about the attacks coming, he kept his guard up to try and block...However since he was by this building, it'd attempt to use it as a platement and push himself towards the northern direction , attempting to clear himself of the area! *Dice roll for this one on my part if acceptable*

Once this was done, the other run away prisoners would come out, all holding explosive tags, and kunai tossing them after the crowd...PRISON BREAK!!!

Meanwhile...TO gain some order...TO gain some sense of the area around him he was fighting in, this man would utilize his immense speed to head on out towards the northern area near the mountain...In doing so, he'd be there waiting...Having already given a taste of his power to  those who previously fought him, anyone else new would have a chance to enter...However whom he waited for in particular were those of the taijutsu profession..He felt a strange turn on from fighting such others like him..* - Sun Nov  1 06:56:51 2015

His eyes set on Tetsumi now, blitzing with the speed of his to attack from behind thus surpassing his own defense to deliver a round house kick to the very rib cage of his...His body however half burned, this proving that the strategy worked from their combined tactic nearly containing him..However the plan he had set in motion with this massive work of fuuinjutsu...Someone would of had to break it and prevent ti from coming again if they wanted their ninjutus at full power...For now..They'd all be halved..* - Sun Nov  1 08:06:49 2015

However this meant nothing to stop his attack, first going towards Hassan to rush at his direction with the speed of his 3rd Gate in order to deliver a LEAF HURRICANE , something to react to the both of them, Jiki and Hassan to cause chakra point damaging and tissue damaging attacks to their body with high attack speed and power behind hid strikes, aiming for Hassans torso and legs, while Tetsumi he aimed for the face and his chest!

Being taken by Tetsumi's own sand ability and unable to fully move due to the bijuus grip, his rageful eyes glaring at the kid..He said "HOW DARE YOU!-----" being hit by the combinations of explsoive attacks and taken off guard into a sand coffin that he struggled against..His durability proved worthy but he was dazed for a few seconds..Though during this..

Shit got real...As he struggled, he began to enter into the 4th Art of breathing (4th Gate to the 5th in this attempt) trying to do this in order to break out the sand and reek more havoc, however his body..Was fully scarred, he had pain to deal with ...Bleeding to tend to...There was just much going on..

However once he managed to break free from sheer strength which was nerfed due to the explosions...He'd reach out suddenly and quickly for the very neck of Tetsumi in front of him, a crushing grip, he'd try to finally rid himself of the coffin in order to brutally  LINGER BOMB Tetsumi into the ground at Hassans direction...

LABYRINTH'S CURSE!

There's a reaching hand to Hassan and Tetsumi's neck, and death in his eyes! With the surging of the Gates going towards an ascending limit, the cursed man spoke with blood spewing his eyes and mouth in an attempt to crush their necks and slam them both face first into the ground, this was done once majority of them had their guard down..His body burned in a bodily flame..Cursed soul...The branded Sin!* - Sun Nov  1 09:50:56 2015

The curse did not take away pain, only did he not take his mind off the goal, his true dedication to taking out the enemy!

Now having no arms or hands ! Now the beast man was left at the mercy of Jiki and Hassan, dazed and mentally zombified..
