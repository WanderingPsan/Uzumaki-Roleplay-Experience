<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled. It was clear that she didn't feel like wearing all of her armor. It was the only thing stopping her from getting egged, however.* - Sun Sep 27 03:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) geared her attention toward Violet once more after the boy made his departure. She'd glance at him out of her peripheral, taking a more indepth look at the boy's hair. The female would briefly recall his facial features, identifying the striking resemblance he had to Zetsumo.

<Ah.. right. I do remember -someone- mentioning that he was Zetsumo's kid. Either Fujitora... or... ?> She'd think.

The girl would stop thinking intensely, looking toward Violet once more.* - Sun Sep 27 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) approached her apartment, pulling out a key and unlocking the door, pushing on through, closing it as Violet most likely entered after her. Setsuna'd eagerly remove a majority of her armor, collapsing upon the velvet sofa nearby. Despite how comfortable it felt to relax, she was tensed, considering she was about to be scolded for her actions.* - Sun Sep 27 03:22:14 2015

The blonde would extend her legs out, applying her upper body strength for the task. She'd descend downward at a decent pace, her natural movement being put to the test as she performed a pushup in below a quarter of a second.* - Sun Sep 27 18:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) bent her right arm completely once more. She continued to perform pushups at a high rate of speed, training her body's endurance and ignoring the burning sensation she was receiving due to her lack of upper body strength. None the less, she continued to descend her body beneath the arching of her right arm. It seemed that she still had the opportunity to keep going with one-handed pushups.* - Sun Sep 27 18:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly removed her left arm from behind her back, shoving her left palm firmly agianst hte ground below. She'd extend her arms out completely, pushing herself from pushup position. The blonde would bound to her feet, standing up. The female would apply a small bounce to her stancing, leaning forward. She'd remove her armor, dropping it to the ground with a clang, considering it was weighing her down slightly.* - Sun Sep 27 19:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued bouncing up and down, performing small bunny hops. She'd throw off her gloves into the pile of armor beside her. The female would continue teh bunny hops with one leg while she was removing one of the military-quality boots from the other. Having lightened the amount of clothing she was wearing, the blonde shot forth, vanishing in a flicker of high-speed movement.* - Sun Sep 27 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: ...Yeah but you're walking around half decent. - Sun Sep 27 19:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shot by them, appearing to be that of a blur of black, mixed with dull pink and platinum blonde.* - Sun Sep 27 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shot down the road at an excruciatingly quick momentum. She left dust on the path in which she ran, shooting by the inn in a blur of movement. Even with the tunnel vision impairing her maximum capabilities of moving at full speed she was easily able to evade any civilians that were at risk of being ran over by her. She'd perform a great leap, her foot thrashing upon the top of a streelight as she stood on it with one leg, looking down at the civilians.* - Sun Sep 27 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) cracked her knuckles, performing rather simple stretches that were capable of being done on the small area of space that she had. The blonde would suddenly leap off the streetlight, landing upon a rooftop. She would continue running forth at an exponential rate of movement, making sure that she evaded any obstacles that came her way, the world around her none other than a massive blur.* - Sun Sep 27 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly performed a quick somersault when she reached the edge of one of the fifty roofs that she had been running on. The girl would go short, her feet pressing against the edge of the wall as she shifted the direction of her movement at the last moment, beginning to run upon the side of the building. She didn't even need to apply chakra to her feet, because she was more than capable of moving away before gravity could affect her descension.* - Sun Sep 27 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) reached the front of the building in a matter of seconds, her bare feet paddling upon hte windows as she ran across htem, taking a diagonal leap off of hte edge of the building and performing rapid somersaults throughout the upper air, landing upon the rooftop of a building across the street in a crouched position. She was breathing rather heavily, but she didn't let that weigh down the intense endurance training she was undergoing.* - Sun Sep 27 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) threw her arms out behind her, continuing to move forth at a high speed. Now that she was no longer on road she could officially elevate to a rate of momentum that she deemed necessary for this task. With a small jolt of stamina awakening her from her daze-like movement she bursted forth, officially moving as a flicker of speed. She easily bypassed several rooftops in under a rooftop at this speed.* - Sun Sep 27 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had officially passed the residential area in a matter of seconds. She hopped off the edge of the last roof, landing upon the small area of grass. The blonde would continue speeding forth, taking a suimen-applied leap as she neared the waterfall at her brisk levels of momentum. With ease the female would scale a quarter of the mountain, running up the rest of it in a few moments and reaching the top, at which point she'd come to a stop, breathing heavily.* - Sun Sep 27 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly stood to her feet. She'd shoot forth once more at the speed of a jog, which was a slight blur for her average. She literally ran down the waterfall with the chakra applied to her soles, removing the veil of chakra the moment she was only inches from the water. She smashed below the surface of the water, displacing it with her form. Part of the lake arose immensely, collapsing back down.

She arose from the water in a burst of speed, gazing up at the sky above with her right leg arched and her left extended out completely under her, her arms extended out behind her. She arose her arched arms and bent her knees, landing upon the surface of the water. She'd rush forth in another burst of momentum, easily shooting across the surface of the water.* - Sun Sep 27 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly closed in on the wall behind the mansion. She'd dash up the wall with raw momentum alone, applying a thin veil of chakra to her soles. She'd leap off the top of the wall the moment she reached it, somersaulting nimbly toward the front of the mansion, landing on the soles of her feet firmly, having applied chakra to her feet to soften the landing.* - Sun Sep 27 19:27:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) somersaulted from behind the mansion, landing with her feet pressed to the ground. The thin layer of chakra at her soles would disperse. She seemed to be lightly breathing.* - Sun Sep 27 19:28:12 2015
