<br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) retreats to Violet's side. She wasn't taking anymore chances with sparring Koeki. Not until she improved some more, at the very least.* - Sun Sep 20 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I need to harness the power if these blades tomorrow - Sun Sep 20 02:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I need to improve my taijutsu experience tomorrow. - Sun Sep 20 02:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: And start trying to master the techniques I learned... - Sun Sep 20 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hey, Lera. - Sun Sep 20 02:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hey Setsuna - Sun Sep 20 02:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Elemental clones are limited to the element they're made from, right? - Sun Sep 20 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: If so, I have something to teach you. - Sun Sep 20 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah? - Sun Sep 20 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh? - Sun Sep 20 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: But.. I kinda need to learn some Fuuton-based jutsus... so I'll teach you the jutsu I have for you now.. then you teach me the Fuuton.. sound like fair game? - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, fair enough. - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright.. - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Let's go to the waterfall, for this. - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure - Sun Sep 20 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Ram handsign, her departure concealed by a thick, maroon mist.* - Sun Sep 20 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright... - Sun Sep 20 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Have you heard of the Shadow Clone Jutsu? - Sun Sep 20 03:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I haven't no. - Sun Sep 20 03:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright... - Sun Sep 20 03:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) showed the seal to Lera in every aspect she could provide.

"It's a special jutsu, considering it has it's own, personal handsign."* - Sun Sep 20 03:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Basically it's an elemental shadow clone technique, minus the elemental limitation. - Sun Sep 20 03:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see. - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: So with this clone-based technique you can use all four of your elements with the clones. - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That would....be useful. - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) smirked.

"That's why I'm teaching it to you."* - Sun Sep 20 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm..This changes a lot of things... - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: hah...wouldn't Hassan be surprised... - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm sure it does.. but, form the handsign, and invest a fraction of your chakra into a clone. - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Like this. - Sun Sep 20 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) already formed the seal previously. She'd simply surge her chakra, distributing it evenly in fractions. Twelve plumes of smoke emerged around her figure, and when they faded, twelve clones of her stood. She'd poke one of the clones. "Because of the chakra I put in, they're solid.." She also pointed to their shadows. "They're good for scouting, and useful decoys. They also help in taijutsu-based combat."* - Sun Sep 20 03:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: They fool sensors too, I believe. - Sun Sep 20 03:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Perfect. - Sun Sep 20 03:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: mhmmm...thank you, this is going to help me a lot. - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: When do you want to learn these Fuuton jutsu? - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: When you aren't busy, I guess. - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'll have to ask hassan if I can teach her one of the forbidden ones... - Sun Sep 20 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 20 03:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Clone handsign in unison with her copies, dispersing them within bursts of smoke.* - Sun Sep 20 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How does the 'scouting' part work. These can travel far from us? Unlike the Elemental ones. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And how do you know what they've seen? - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Once they disperse you gain all the knowledge they obtained. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: So it's handy for training, too. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehehe, now I understand how you've been mastering your techniques so quickly. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Like if you don't feel like training, you can make two of them and let them fight eachother for say... hand to hand experience. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Naaaah, I recently learned this, honestly. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Fair enough. - Sun Sep 20 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Still, this is just getting better and better. - Sun Sep 20 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its going to help a lot. - Sun Sep 20 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It doesn't do much for me, but it means I don't worry about needing a sparring partner often. - Sun Sep 20 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see, hopefully my chakra pools will help me there. - Sun Sep 20 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: They should. - Sun Sep 20 03:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Has Hassan taught you how to infuse weapons with Fuuton? - Sun Sep 20 03:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No he hasn't. - Sun Sep 20 03:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Maybe I should ask him... - Sun Sep 20 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Though, I can control shuriken with fuuton. - Sun Sep 20 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah, you used that on me before. - Sun Sep 20 03:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its useful, though I don't really use it much. - Sun Sep 20 03:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Why not? - Sun Sep 20 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Honestly...its because I know so many jutsu...its difficult to decide which is the best for a situation. - Sun Sep 20 03:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And shuriken are very easy to knockdown. - Sun Sep 20 03:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Though...with these clones...I could mask their approach with a Fireball jutsu. - Sun Sep 20 03:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah, probably. - Sun Sep 20 03:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You've opened up quite a lot of possibilities with this jutsu... - Sun Sep 20 03:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Those were my intentions by teaching it to you, so I'm glad.~ - Sun Sep 20 03:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thank you~ - Sun Sep 20 03:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No problem. - Sun Sep 20 03:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: YOu said you were learning Fuuton without the affinity for it right? - Sun Sep 20 03:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No, I inherited the affinity as of recent. - Sun Sep 20 03:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I just need to learn Fuuton jutsus. - Sun Sep 20 03:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ahh I see. - Sun Sep 20 03:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can teach you all of them that I know. Theres only two that I need permission for.. - Sun Sep 20 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Since they're....lethal and pretty dangerous. - Sun Sep 20 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Lethal..? - Sun Sep 20 03:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhmm, both have high killing potential. - Sun Sep 20 03:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Ahh... - Sun Sep 20 03:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: For example. - Sun Sep 20 03:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) lifted a brow. She wanted to use the technique, but she had -no- understanding of what Lera did.* - Sun Sep 20 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It took me a -long- time to learn this. - Sun Sep 20 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Fuuton has cutting potential like that.. but... damn. - Sun Sep 20 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I also learned to combine this with fire...the rock thats in pieces over there is the result of that. - Sun Sep 20 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But yeah, I need permission from Hassan to teach this one and one other. He actually ordered me not too. - Sun Sep 20 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Makes sense. - Sun Sep 20 03:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Perhaps I should see if Hassan is awake...I've completed the steps he asked of me. - Sun Sep 20 03:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll ask him If I can teach you some of the more lethal jutsu as well. - Sun Sep 20 03:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 20 03:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Looks like he's dozing again... - Sun Sep 20 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey there, Lera... how you feeling? - Sun Sep 20 03:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm feelling....better. - Sun Sep 20 04:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: ...Thats good. - Sun Sep 20 04:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'm sorry for what I said before... - Sun Sep 20 04:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I was just...bitter. - Sun Sep 20 04:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Huh? Nothing to apologize. You didn't offend me, and I'm just glad you're feeling better. - Sun Sep 20 04:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: All the same, it was no reason to act the way I did. - Sun Sep 20 04:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Fine, I forgive you. Then, I'm sorry I couldn't help. We both still have things to improve and change. - Sun Sep 20 04:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We always will. - Sun Sep 20 04:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Hehe. - Sun Sep 20 04:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Can't change that haircut nigga. -omit- - Sun Sep 20 04:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: What? - Sun Sep 20 04:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I mastered the tecnique you gave me Sensei. - Sun Sep 20 04:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Not bad. - Sun Sep 20 04:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And I have a question. - Sun Sep 20 04:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Would I be able to teach Setsuna the first technique you taught me? The first lethal one I mean. - Sun Sep 20 04:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You know the answer to that question. - Sun Sep 20 04:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright. Sorry Setsuna. - Sun Sep 20 04:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's fine. - Sun Sep 20 04:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Sorry to stack in the questions Hassan, but mind showing me that shuriken trick you have. You know the one where you make the other shuriken follow behind it? - Sun Sep 20 04:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uh... Hassan, are you holding any of those Fuuton lessons again, anytime soon? - Sun Sep 20 04:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If you have time, I can teach you my other ones. The ones I'm able to teach. - Sun Sep 20 04:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I almost forgot... - Sun Sep 20 04:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You want to? - Sun Sep 20 04:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah. I'd love to, actually. - Sun Sep 20 04:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Lets go then. - Sun Sep 20 04:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay - Sun Sep 20 04:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright.. just demonstrate them one by one. - Sun Sep 20 04:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We'll start with the easiest and work our way up. - Sun Sep 20 04:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded, acknowledging the flaws and advantages of the trio of Fuuton-based jutsu. With that being said, she'd form the one handsign necessary for the Godly Wind technique. She took into account the manner in which Lera utilised the technique. Judging by it's simplicity, Setsuna was aware of why it was usable by palm or mouth. She'd proceed to knead a decent amount of chakra into compressed wind.

Her cheeks would puff up, and her lips would part. From her mouth shot a condensed wave of Fuuton-based chakra. The particles of wind provided a good gust to the area in front of her. While the technique was simple, the small vortex was efficient. She had many ideas in mind as to how she could utilize it in situations. Her cheeks would contract to their normal size, and she'd close her mouth once releasing all of the chakra in the form of the stream of wind.

Setsuna would move on to the next technique. She recalled Lera's rather simple explanation of the technique. Considering it was a better form of the Godly Wind from the Mountains technique with more power put behind it, the blondette assumed that using it would be easy. She formed the handsigns required in what seemed to be a slight blur of hand dexterity. She'd begin to course her chakra throughout her body.

Shortly after, the blonde girl would use the produced chakra to knead into wind particles. With the buildup of wind particles, she'd open her mouth wide and spew an intense, wide-range blast of Fuuton-based chakra to the area in front of her. Though the technique was new to her, the range was wonderful. It seemed that Lera's explanation of the technique was accurate. She had easily used the technique.

Without a word, Setsuna would form the few handsigns required. She'd withdraw a few shuriken from the confines of the backpouch pinned to her lower back. After doing such, she'd clench the small pieces of metallic weaponry between her fingers. She'd course her chakra throughout her body, manipulating it's flexibility. Using said flexibility, she'd direct the chakra to her hands.

As the chakra flowed into her hands, she'd knead it into wind particles. The Fuuton-based chakra clumped together in the form of a breezing aura around each of the weaponry. She'd let go of the shurikens, guiding them into ascension utilizing the Fuuton-based chakra as her source of such a factor. With accurate concentration of her chakra, she'd allow the shurikens to whip down toward the lake beneath the waterfall, using her free manipulation of her chakra to her advantage.* - Sun Sep 20 04:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A fast learner as always~ - Sun Sep 20 04:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Why's this nigga standing on ashes? -omit- - Sun Sep 20 13:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Naw they can handle it. - Sun Sep 20 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Clone handsign, allowing her shadow clone to approach the left side of the mansion, while she ran up upon the walls, applying a thin veil of chakra to her soles to make this possible. She'd stand in a decent position where the flames weren't too intense. In a trio of handsigns being performed at a slight blur, a thin stream emerged from herself and her clone's maws, as she attempted to put the flames out.* - Sun Sep 20 13:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Seisuke. - Sun Sep 20 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Do not let him stay here. - Sun Sep 20 13:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You mean nothing to me anymore. - Sun Sep 20 13:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll ask Koeki to put an arrest warrant up for Erebus. - Sun Sep 20 13:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Lera. - Sun Sep 20 13:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Are you ok? - Sun Sep 20 13:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) removed her red and white, porcelain mask. The girl would step in front of Lera, attempting to clasp one of the female's hands with her own. The girl would look up at the female, crouching down slightly in an attempt to gather the black haired female's attention.

"Lera..." She'd utter.* - Sun Sep 20 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) extended her arms out, attempting to embrace the seemingly traumatized female. Her action would lack the words that often went with it.* - Sun Sep 20 13:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: We've lost Tethys, Jin and Niza still hasn't come back or bird messaged me... - Sun Sep 20 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) thinks: Ushinawa is on his way with an army of around six thousand... - Sun Sep 20 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) released the embrace, looking into Lera's eyes. "Everything'll be fine..." She'd half-heartedly whisper. It seemed that now they were just desperate. Seisuke's suggestion made it seem it'd be easier, survival-wise.* - Sun Sep 20 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) would attempt to clasp the female's hand and guide her toward the bench. The blonde was well aware that Lera was forsakening her emotions. Setsuna didn't really know if that'd be good or bad, considering she still wasn't sure if she was better off with or without her emotion.* - Sun Sep 20 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) glanced at Lera briefly. She didn't really know what to do. Setsuna had saved herself from the path Lera was taking by falling in love and opening up to the person she fell in love with. She experienced the same feeling as Lera did, just in a different manner. She'd whisper some encouraging words to Lera.* - Sun Sep 20 14:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sun Sep 20 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Lera.. you're super strong... if you're concerned about your strength then.. there's no need. Don't give up.. not on your emotions.. - Sun Sep 20 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned, her gaze toward Lera faltering as she redirected it to her own lap.

"I just... you shouldn't.. I don't know."* - Sun Sep 20 14:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: You always need your emotions... you can make them less necessary in your life.. but don't ever abandon them.. that'd be a terrible mistake... I made that mistake once.. but I resolved it. Just... I don't want you to deprive yourself of friendships and all of the greater things in life like I did... - Sun Sep 20 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Ikarus. - Sun Sep 20 14:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Don't worry. I just won't care anymore...I decided to enjoy everything instead. - Sun Sep 20 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Yes, why? - Sun Sep 20 14:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I don't. - Sun Sep 20 14:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Everyone I know came here. - Sun Sep 20 14:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Exactly. The little things. The things those pesky emotions of mine didn't let me enjoy. - Sun Sep 20 14:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: The only people I know that are outside of here are Dravae and Chiyari. - Sun Sep 20 14:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: But no one knows where they are. - Sun Sep 20 14:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I can't remember which one you said you were from. - Sun Sep 20 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Sunagakure. - Sun Sep 20 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: You're still my friend. Friends forever~ - Sun Sep 20 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: What's the status over there? - Sun Sep 20 14:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's been taken over by one of Sunagaure's enemies--Edge. - Sun Sep 20 14:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Which is one of the reasons why we came here. - Sun Sep 20 14:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: He's deceptive and manipulative. - Sun Sep 20 14:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm. - Sun Sep 20 14:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Tries to turn people against their initiative, and align with his. - Sun Sep 20 14:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: He may be allied with Zetsumo, as far as we now. - Sun Sep 20 14:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: The way I see it, there is no way we can kill Zetsumo. - Sun Sep 20 14:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Without him dead, We die. - Sun Sep 20 14:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) produced the Clone handsign, sending off a shadow clone to give her a scroll.* - Sun Sep 20 14:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) wrote down in what seemed to be a small scroll, obtained by her shadow clone. The shadow clone formed the Clone handsign, dispersing itself in the midst of a plume of smoke. The masked individual would proceed to sign the innards of the scroll after she wrote down what was necessary. The blondette would roll up the scroll, placing it between the talons of a pidgeon and sending it on it's way to the person she intended to give it to.* - Sun Sep 20 14:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: He could possibly be moving around, or tailing Ushinawa. - Sun Sep 20 15:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: We have a multitude of boats prepped for evacuation. - Sun Sep 20 15:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So you're thinking that we should flee in the end? - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: We take what forces we have go to SUna put an end to this edge guy  use it resources to by time and then  when the moment is right we but an end to this big bad zetusmo guy who ever he is. - Sun Sep 20 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That sounds like a bad plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's a terrible plan. - Sun Sep 20 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'll explain why I believe the plan is bad. First off, we don't know of Edge's location, nor his forces strength or size.  Second, we are currently in war with Zetsumo's forces who is allied with Ame. They are positioned around the village, as far as I recall.  - Sun Sep 20 15:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, Edge is more powerful than you think, Flexus. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Doesnt this place have like an ecaoe tunnel or something? - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: As of right now, we need a secret place to go to. - Sun Sep 20 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Suna is not that place. Our presence and activity there will alert Zetsumo, plus I think the adjustment from a place like Kirigakure to Sunagakure is the worst, especially with resources being sapped constantly. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ...Is this where I laugh? - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: The moment we send a large force out to locate and deal with Edge, they will spot and attack.  Then there's the problem of war fatalities. We are already pressed with our forces. We don't have enough strength to split between Zetsumo and Edge. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm just curious. - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Wasn't this the course of action -I- Reccomended, Several weeks ago? - Sun Sep 20 15:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Well, if you did recommend this several weeks ago, I don't think Lord Tethy was dead then. - Sun Sep 20 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I just know that in our curent situation, it's best to deal with what's before us first.  Also, what advantage would we gain from dealing with Edge? - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You gain no advantage, Honestly, Edge is better left alone. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Edge only wished to Unite Sunagakure. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That rests our case. - Sun Sep 20 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: However, if we were to say contact Edge and have him join us, I'm sure that would give us an advantage in some form. - Sun Sep 20 15:41:26 2015
