<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The Brawn is nothing without the brains. - Sun Sep 13 10:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: The fact that he escaped the battle in Konohagakure with no troops and already had one-hundred to just guard Himura when I arrived tells me we're in a run for our money. - Sun Sep 13 10:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: But that gives us another thing to work on. They'll need to either see us or us see them for their trigger. If we can somehow, make an attack on them while their view is disrupted. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: We would have quiet the advantage. - Sun Sep 13 10:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Smoke, or poison bombs... The numerous traps that all line the village, which I'm sure that people of their level can avoid but it slow them down. And, ninjutsu users will be great in being able to give sweeping attacks that won't need direct line of fire. - Sun Sep 13 10:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We should have more sensors... - Sun Sep 13 10:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: It might be a good idea if some of us that can go underground, scout the outskirts periodically. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Yeah, they could also notice if their in genjutsus or not with their abilities. That way it be a awareness and protection. - Sun Sep 13 10:38:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stood on the surface of the descending water. The white haired girl would remove her hands from tucked away in her pockets, forming the Clone handsign. From a plume of gray-ish white smoke at her side emerged a perfect replica. Her pinkish-purple orbs would shift between the individuals in the vicinity. She showed no signs of offense toward Yan's inability to correctly define her gender.

"Huh... this'll be useful." She uttered. It was clear to her that unlike elementally based clone techniques, the Shadow Clone technique allowed the clones to perform techniques outside of their own specialty. Unlike the Earth Clone technique, she could rely on these clones to utilize all of the elements in her arsenal.

<This'll be more useful for Lera than it will for me.> She'd think to herself. <Still... it'll be efficient for scouting and reaching places that I don't intend to go to..> It seemed that for once she got an ace in a hole when it came to randomly copying techniques from people nearby.* - Mon Sep 14 16:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yes sir - Mon Sep 14 16:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Hopefully the drain'll be less terrible by the time I master it, though. - Mon Sep 14 16:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) tilted her head, raising one of her brows.

"I don't know anything basic. You'll have to check in with the hospital if you want to get started with medical ninjutsu." Setsuna would remark. Her shadow clone would seat itself against the flowing waterfall, shutting it's eyes and folding it's arms, remaining quiet and content.* - Mon Sep 14 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I only know the more advanced techniques, honestly... - Mon Sep 14 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: A what? No. I haven't even learned that technique. - Mon Sep 14 16:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Where did it pop out from then? - Mon Sep 14 16:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I've recently learned water clone but it requires too much chakra for me to use it. - Mon Sep 14 16:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: For a B-Rank this requires less chakra than most techniques.. - Mon Sep 14 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: A plume of smoke. - Mon Sep 14 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Interesting. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It has no element. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Could ya teach it to me? I could trade it to you for earth or water techniques. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Or even a genjutsu defense technique. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't teach people what I know unless I've learned all I can from knowing it. - Mon Sep 14 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fair enough, good thought process! I will wait then, I have many mastered techniques that I can show you. - Mon Sep 14 16:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Try again Violet. - Mon Sep 14 16:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You'll get the trick. - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Think about the connection between the water and your chakra. - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: If the water flows... - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Bad analogy... - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well, you'll get it. - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... I will - Mon Sep 14 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) walked down the waterfall, proceeding to move across the surface of the water itself. Her shadow clone followed behind her. She tucked her hands into her pockets, smiling at Violet then proceeding to speak. "Stabilize the chakra you're applying to your feet, but don't increase or decrease the amount. Evenly distribute it throughout the width and length of your soles and keep it that way." She'd elaborate.

"If you do it incorrectly, this'll happen." Setsuna said, looking at her shadow clone out of her peripheral. The thin veil of chakra applied to her clone's feet suddenly increased slightly. The small jump in chakra resulted in the clone falling beneath the surface of the water. The clone would climb ashore. Setsuna would close her eyes and exhale slightly.

"That's what happens when you increase the chakra, whether intentionally or accidentally. This is what happens when you decrease it." The shadow clone would state, dropping into the lake once more while still dripping wet. The clone would re-emerge, a slightly irritated look plastered to it's features. The only reason the shadow clone was displaying the results was because Setsuna had no desire to do it herself.

"And this is what happens when you don't evenly distribute the chakra beneath your feet, or don't keep it distributed evenly." The shadow clone sunk into the water once more, it's pinkish-purple orbs setting themselves upon Setsuna. Setsuna would nod, and thus the clone formed the Clone handseal, dispersing.

"So basically, you end up wet if you incorrectly perform the technique, alright?"* - Mon Sep 14 16:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Also. Try not to get too wet in this weather. I can regulate your body temperature but can't stop you from getting hypothermia. - Mon Sep 14 16:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You'rekinda supposed to learn that stuff on your own but what Setsuna said is correct. - Mon Sep 14 16:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's not efficient, time-wise, to let her figure it out on her own, though... - Mon Sep 14 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I guess, I was just teaching the way I was taught. - Mon Sep 14 16:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: thanks love... - Mon Sep 14 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No problem at all..~ Do your best. - Mon Sep 14 16:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Very nice Violet. - Mon Sep 14 17:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You'll get better with practise. - Mon Sep 14 17:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Well I have great teachers... - Mon Sep 14 17:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah, Setsuna is a good teacher. - Mon Sep 14 17:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Anyway, I'll be over here if you guys need me, I've got some of my own training to do. - Mon Sep 14 17:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ok. - Mon Sep 14 17:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yea - Mon Sep 14 18:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hnm.... - Mon Sep 14 18:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Just some training go on here? - Mon Sep 14 18:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Im relaxing at the moment - Mon Sep 14 18:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I saw you the other day, who might you be? - Mon Sep 14 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: My name is Ikarus. - Mon Sep 14 18:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: And yours? - Mon Sep 14 18:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Mura. - Mon Sep 14 18:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: What village are you from? - Mon Sep 14 18:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Nice to mee you, Mura. I'm from Sunagakure. - Mon Sep 14 18:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, So how are you liking Kirigakure? - Mon Sep 14 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm sure it's quite different from your village. - Mon Sep 14 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: This village is amazing. It's radically different from back home. - Mon Sep 14 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: There's water everywhere--not to sound stupid or nave at all. - Mon Sep 14 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: No no, As I say we must be quite the opposite to what you're used to. - Mon Sep 14 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Most definitely. - Mon Sep 14 19:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's different than what it looks like in textbooks and whatnot. - Mon Sep 14 19:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Mhm, You usually have to see things to experience the real thing. - Mon Sep 14 19:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'd like to visit all the villages one day. - Mon Sep 14 19:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Agreed with both statements. It's on my list to visit each village. - Mon Sep 14 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I have only been to two so far. - Mon Sep 14 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: This is my second, excluding Sunagakure. - Mon Sep 14 19:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I've been to Amegakure...mostly because it was the closest I guess. - Mon Sep 14 19:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Wasn't that great to be honest. - Mon Sep 14 19:11:21 2015
