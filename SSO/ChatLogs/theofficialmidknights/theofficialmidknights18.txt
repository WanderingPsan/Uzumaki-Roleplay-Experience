The blonde would remove the blade from the position she had it in, landing in a crouched manner and rushing forward eagerly. She'd perform a trio of thrusting motions with the piece of lightweight weaponry, as though it was intended for fencing.* - Tue Oct 13 22:39:21 2015

Setsuko would put the girl on her feet, then position herself near the entrance to the mansion.* - Tue Oct 13 22:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) met her destination, finding a decently sized hole within what seemed to be a construction area of the village. The blonde would yawn lightly. She'd peer down at the hole, trying to make a light assessment of how deep the hole was, and how wide it was. She had an idea in mind as to how she could fill said hole, but at the same time she wasn't -too- eager to deal with this task.

She'd settle down, pressing her supple butt to the thick blades of torched grass and ruined earth, sitting at the edge of the crater-esque hole in fronf of her. The breeze felt good, as it ran throughout her long bundles of blonde hair. She'd set her blonde gaze down upon the grass. The female would slowly rise to her feet, seeming rather unenthusiastic about the task she had to attend to.

The female would form a single handsign. Shortly after forming said handsign she would spew chakra kneaded in the form of mud from her mouth, allowing said mud to consume the bottom half of the hole. The amount of chakra she invested into the wave of mud wasn't sufficient enough to fill such a massive hole. It seemed this mission would be more of a burden than she wanted it to. The blondette would sigh, forming yet another handsign.

She'd concentrate a much larger amount of chakra than she initially did. After doing so, the girl would knead the massive amount of chakra into what seemed to be thick mud. She'd spew the thick mud in the form of a wave, allowing it to fill the hole. The hole would e completely filled, and shortly after the mud would solidify, easily settling to fit that of the ground around it, melding itself with said ground as well.* - Wed Oct 14 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) yawned lightly. She'd start heading away from the location. She'd move down the remnants and rubble of the residential district of Kirigakure no Sato, looking around with her golden stare. She'd take a sharp left, peering into a dark alleyway that she could easily look in due to her boosted sight. The blondette would notice the small shape of an animal within a pile of trash, asphalt and rubble.

She'd squint slightly, then peer down at one of the three scrolls within her possession. She'd open one, her golden gaze peering down and scanning the paragraph long explanation of the mission that she had to do. "Locate.. a runaway dog.." She'd state, looking up at the shadow of an animal within the darkness of the alleyway.

The blondette would cuss lightly, slowly deepening her distance within the alleyway. She'd approach the small animal with open arms, calling out to it. "Come on doggy." She'd state, noticing the slight shiver to it's scruffy figure as it remained beneath the large amount of rubble, clearly tucked away under it as though it was protecting the small animal.

Setsuko would keep moving forward, her movement faltering when she heard it's whimper. "There's no need to be afraid." She'd murmur. The blondette was pleased that the little dog wasn't a runner, though. She'd slowly approach it, crouching down in front of her and holding her right hand out. For once, a smile that wasn't engulfed in arrogance filled her features, accentuating them much more than her sadistic, cocky manner ever did.

The dog's whimpers would falter as her true beauty, revealed by the genuine kindness that she revealed captivated it's scared stare. The dog would slowly scooch from the pile of rubble into her grasp. She'd gather the dirty little mutt into her grasp, standing up and stepping out of the alleyway. The girl would be alarmed by the sound of crumbling rubble, right where the dog had originally been a few seconds after she picked it up.

<That probably would've killed the dog if I didn't get it..>* - Wed Oct 14 02:23:47 2015

A malicious sneer captured her facial features, which coursed with obvious frustration. The half-hearted grin was an obvious facade. Her golden gaze frequently drifted between Lera and Violet.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) simply grinned. Her face had 'savage' written all over it. The blonde's golden gaze would pierce Violet's stare. "Fufufu... don't do anything stupid? Sounds hysterical to me... if I wasn't infuriated by recalling the near-death situations I've been put in because of you I'd laugh..." She'd murmur with a hint of toxicity to her tone. Her grip on her weaponry never faltered, as she simply gazed fiercely at Violet with her piercing, gold glare.

She'd press her blade against Violet's in a manner that'd make it clear that she had no intentions of attacking, but rather preventing herself and the tangerine-haired girl from attacking one another. "Maybe if I wasn't far down the road that I've already taken, you'd perceive my love for you as sincere." She'd state, propelling off of her heels and performing a large backflip, distancing herself from Violet. Her grin became a foul frown.

"You're a beacon for madmen. You attracted me, didn't you?" Setsuko would state, opening her left hand from a tight fist and allowing three indigo orbs to descend. Plumes of smoke would spew from the orbs as they came in contact with the ground.

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Setsuko your action irrational please, I need you to understand - Mon Oct 19 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) unsheathed her blade, her dagger-like, golden gaze shifting toward Amiel.

"Maybe you should deal with death then. Then you'll know how bad I feel."* - Mon Oct 19 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Until then you're fucking completely ignorant of just how pissed I am right now. - Mon Oct 19 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: ........ - Mon Oct 19 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Lower your blade Setsuko. - Mon Oct 19 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: She does not have to respond to your feelings if she does not want to. - Mon Oct 19 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) only became even -more- infuriated with Nina's words.

"Fuck you.. and fuck Lera.. fuck everything that you care about, since you wanna say fuck you to my feelings. You rotten, heartless....BITCH!" Setsuko would shout, throwing her right arm forth and balling her hand into a tight fist, attempting to blindly punch Violet anywhere in the face. She had completely lost her composure, as well as her patience for this.

A feral look overtook her, blinding her rational thinking as she set her malicious, golden stare on Kirie, her teeth clenched together tightly. Her lack of weaponry wasn't enough to stop her from being mentally incapable of maintaining composure.

"FUCK my feelings, right!? They don't fucking matter, right!? How the -hell- are you going to put it on me for catching feelings when you crossed the boundary!? And then what's even worse that none of your actions meant NOTHING, they were EMPTY.FUCKING.LIES!" Setsuko shouted, balling her hands into tight fists. The shred of humanity she had left was the only thing stopping her from attacking Kirie or Violet.* - Mon Oct 19 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) became more angry when Violet proceeded to easily counter her attack with a punch of her own. The pain of contacting Violet's fist debillitated her momentarily, but not before her rage burst once more. At this point she'd smack firmly against the ground as Violet forced her to do such. Setsuko would thrash her palms against the earth, forcing herself toward Violet. The feral, beast-like blondette would try propelling off the ground, aiming to headbutt Violet in a manner that'd make her lose footing or ruin her balance.* - Mon Oct 19 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) winced. Her rage had been qualmed. She closed her eyes, whimpering.

"I... prefer not to talk.." She'd murmur. The fact that she was lying was -completely- exposed to the tone in her voice.* - Mon Oct 19 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I... don't care if my arms break at this point. My heart's already been broken. - Mon Oct 19 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Nina. - Mon Oct 19 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Come here. - Mon Oct 19 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Let them be for a moment. - Mon Oct 19 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: But I wanna stay with mommy. - Mon Oct 19 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Nina. - Mon Oct 19 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Please listen. - Mon Oct 19 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) moved along with her gaze never drifting away from the ground.* - Mon Oct 19 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I will be back Nina ok? - Mon Oct 19 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: ..... - Mon Oct 19 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Dont be mad at me... I will get you a present later ok? - Mon Oct 19 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Uh huh... - Mon Oct 19 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) continued looking at the grund. She disregarded the aching of her back.

"I don't want to be anything to you. I don't want to be anything to anyone. I'm tired of living. If you're so mad at me kill me now, it'll end my pain." She'd murmur dejectedly.

"I'm not going anywhere in life, or getting anywhere in life, with the way I am. I'm too broken to continue." She'd state. Her voice was emotionless and hollow. Her stare at the ground didn't falter one bit.* - Mon Oct 19 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Is that what you truly want? - Mon Oct 19 01:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) laughed dryly, her laugh devoid of the reason why anyone would perform the action.

"I... I wouldn't have asked you if it wasn't what I wanted. Having no one to love or having no one that loves you tears you apart more than you think..." She'd state, her figure suddenly beginning to tremble. Sadness started to immerse her frame. Her gaze came to a narrow as she struggled to maintain her depression.

"I-I want love.. I feel weak without it.." Setsuko murmured, her voice faltering.* - Mon Oct 19 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Cant you love someone else? - Mon Oct 19 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I've...tried.. - Mon Oct 19 01:48:22 2015
