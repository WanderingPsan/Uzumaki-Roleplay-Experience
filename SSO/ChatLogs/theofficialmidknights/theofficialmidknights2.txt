<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) briefly overlooked the scroll shortly after accepting the scroll from Tethys. She'd flicker her eyes over the description of the technique. Her pinkish-purple orbs set themselves forward, as the white haired girl rolled the scroll up and pocketed it. Shortly after, she'd form the Ram handseal. Using her raw chakra reserves she'd attempt to reinforce her body's speed utilizing said substance that she was building up initially. Of course, once reaching the designated location she'd be dizzy.* - Fri Sep 11 16:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: A spar? - Fri Sep 11 16:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) didn't acknowledge Tethys' explanation of the technique at all. Instead, she focused on reading the scroll, ensuring that the dizziness was something that naturally came alongside utilizing the technique without being proficient at it. Soon after, the female would close and roll the scroll up, placing it within the backpouch on hwer lower back. She'd face the direction where the others were. Performing the Ram handsign, a thick mist wrapped around her figure.

A thick mist, much like the one nearby had emerged at Violet's side, as Setsuna's shadow became visible within it, and she herself did as well when the mist dissipated completely. She'd yawn, not even acknowledging the immense drain of chakra she'd suffered. She was -very- accustomed to having her chakra drained immensely by now.* - Fri Sep 11 16:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled. Using her medical shinobi-tier chakra control, she'd meld chakra to her feet, similar to that of the Water walking technique, a technique she didn't possess as of yet. Using the concentrated chakra, she'd attempt to soften the ground to the point that she was capable of traveling throughout it. Unfortunately, she hadn't applied the necessary amount of chakra for doing such a thing. The ground beneath her smushed beneath her clad, multi-terrain military-based boots. It flattened out after.

She concentrated double the chakira she initially used to her feet. Shortly after doing such, she softened the ground utilizing said chakra. The female would then watch as the ground contracted beneath her feet. She slowly 'phased' into the ground below, descending beneath ground-level. After some moments she'd re-emerge from below ground. She tucked her hands into her pockets.

"How badly did I mess up with using it?" She questioned.* - Fri Sep 11 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Practice and you'll get it down quick~ But still, you got that pretty fast. - Fri Sep 11 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Wasn't good enough. Fast doesn't mean it's perfected. - Fri Sep 11 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No, but thats why you practice. - Fri Sep 11 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Of course. - Fri Sep 11 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You'll have to practice that one alot before I can teach you how to trap people underground. - Fri Sep 11 17:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No point in doing that. I simply asked for the point of remaining alive in a battle. - Fri Sep 11 17:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I simply have to keep the mindset of knowing that if I go down my squad'll be considered down without me to support them. - Fri Sep 11 17:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: At the same time, I need to know how to defend myself. That's my reason for wanting to take advantage of the affinities that I possess. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Not sure how to take her... - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its the same for me. I wanted to learn a jutsu for all of my affinities, so I did. - Fri Sep 11 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm not too keen on wanting to die either. It'd be cruel of me to abandon Violet. And I know for a fact that I wouldn't do that. It seems this relationship I'm in with her has affected me. For the better, obviously. - Fri Sep 11 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Yeah...Violets Nice. I like her a lot too. - Fri Sep 11 17:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Like her a lot? That's an understatement for my feelings about her. I don't date people unless I love them deeply. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I uh...don't really understand all that stuff. - Fri Sep 11 17:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) followed Lera's handsign movement at a relatively decent pace. She'd proceed to face the area at her side. Summoning a plume of chakra, she attempted to meld it into mud as it exitted her mouth. Unfortunately, she'd failed to do such a thing, and instead she wasted an immense amount of her chakra. She grumbled slightly, before forming the handsigns that Lera produced once more.

After forming the couple handseals she spewed chakra from her mouth again, kneading it into mud this time successfully. The mud spread throughout the ground in front of her. She yawned nonchalantly, shifting her head to look at Lera as she demonstrated the Earth Clone technique.

The white haired girl formed the one seal necessary. The mud that she produced utilizing her own chakra slowly melded into a relative shape of her. When the clone was about to appear as a complete replica of her, the lack of necessary chakra for the technique caused it to dissipate. The mud fell to the ground once more, remaining a pool of mush.

Her pinkish purple irises watched as such a thing occured. Shortly after, the white haired female would form the hand seal once more. She plumed her chakra, kneading it into mud as it exited her mouth and splat against the pile of chakra-produced mud at her right. Using the pile of chakra-based mud she'd evenly split the substance between the clones she was making, forming a total of two Mud-composed clones. The mud formed into her relative shape, becoming perfect replicas of her.* - Fri Sep 11 17:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Got some stuff to do... - Fri Sep 11 18:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sighed. She formed a couple of handseals, walking over toward the shore before spewing a wave of pale, translucent water from her mouth. The water was like goo, and after spreading across the ground in front of her it solidified into a sticky substance. The female proceeded to form a couple more handseals, making a puddle of mud in front of her. After doing even more handsigns she produced a clone composed of the mud she spat out, using said clone. The clone ran toward the field of stickiness, engulfing it's feet in chakra and attempting to run upon the surface.

Instead, the clone became stuck, as it had failed to utilize the Surface Walking technique in a proper manner. The white haired girl allowed the clone to revert into a pile of mud, as she herself approached the sticky area, engulfing her feet in a cloak of chakra, allowing herself to walk across the sticky substance with ease. She'd proceed to climb a tree, and even walk across the water with clear success.* - Fri Sep 11 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stood on the surface of the water nearby. Utilizing the source that she was standing on, she immediately flowed her chakra throughout the water as awave crashed against the coast. The wave became more thick in texture, and solidifed with a syrupy appearance. The female ran across the small sticky area, climbing to the shore by softening the earth with her chakra.* - Fri Sep 11 18:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed several handseals before pluming her chakra. She spewed a wave of mud from her mouth, allowing it to splat against the ground. She formed more handseals, producing a perfect replica of her composed of mud, from the mud that she had recently produced. The female exhaled, being able to recognize that her chakra was pretty exhausted from performing this feat.* - Fri Sep 11 18:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Ram handsela, focusing on the area in fronit of her. She warped forth, cloaking her high-speed movements by utilizing mist. Shortly after her reappearance she quickly formed handsigns, attempting to burrow herself underground and travel beneath it while doing such, as she had body flickered to an area that was not on water.* - Fri Sep 11 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) traveled below ground. Shortly after her underground travel she emerged, having appeared to be distant from the area she was originally at. She formed a couple handseals, spewing a wave of mud out in front of her on the ground at her feet. Utilizing the mud to her advantage, she manipulated the chakra-composed mud to form a clone that became a perfect replica of her. She distanced herself from the clone, before beginning to weave a couple more handsigns.

She conjured a decent amount of chakra, before spraying it from her motuh in the form of a gooey, water-like, translucent substance that was colored blue. The wave of goo landed on the ground, solidifying in the form of a syrupy fluid pressed to the earth. The earth clone moved forth at a decent pace, as did Setsuna. Both herself and the clone applied a cloak of chakra to their feet, forming a series of handsigns.

Suddenly, both of them sunk beneath the ground. They re-emerged, unsheathing their weaponry and clashing against one another. Setsuna leaped back, contorting five handsigns in a blur of movement as her clone charged back towards her. She attempted to punch her clone, only to find that it intentionally reverted into it's mud form, traveling from her knuckles to the entirety of her body, binding her in place. Suddenly, a log took her place when the mud was only partially overlapping her figure.

She reappeared behind the binding mud, distancing herself by forming the Ram handsign and body flickering to a distance sufficient. SHe watched as the syrupy field and the mud began to dissipate from view.* - Fri Sep 11 18:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Ram handsign. The white haired girl concentrated a decent amount of chakra after doing so. A thick mist concealed her, as well as her shadow. While said mist concealed her, it concealed her movement as well, and in what seemed like moments she reappeared at a considerable distance, the thick mist dissipating around her, previewing her shadow to those nearby before previewing her as she emerged from it.

The girl formed two more handseals, before spitting a wave of mud from her mouth shortly after conjuring a plume of chakra. The chakra-composed mud at her feet slowly began to morph to the shape of her body, but this only happened after she formed a couple more handseals. The mud became a perfect replica of her shortly after this.

She then proceeded to soften the ground below her feet utilizing her raw chakra. After doing such the girl submerged herself below ground-level, traveling beneath the ground at a pace that would suffice for quite awhile. When she noticed that she could no longer hold the control required for the technique, mainly because she was distracted briefly, she emerged above ground.

The girl allowed the mud-composed Doton-based clone to revert to it's original form, a clump of gathered up mud. The mud dissipated from view as the chakra fueling it began to fade. She then formed two handseals, before spewing a thick, gooey water like fluid from her maw. The gooey fluid solidified into a sticky, syrupy substance hte moment it hit the ground. She moved across it, mainly due to the fact that a veil of chakra was over her feet, permitting her to do such a thing.

"Good.." She mumbled.* - Fri Sep 11 18:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was aware that there were precuations to take for future situations that she was involved in. THere were many things that she always pondered how they felt. She always wanted to know what it'd feel like to drown, or suffer a major injury, but had never felt it, or had any desire to test it out. The female formed a single handsign, before spitting a wave of mud from her mouth. The mud pressed itself to the ground in a clump.

She formed two handsefals shortly after this. Utilizing the charka that was already out, and formed into a clump of mud, she attempted to manipulate it's shape. She allowed the mud to form into that of a perfect replica of her, after melding itself to match her shape. The mud-composed Doton-based clone then proceeded to remove the veil of chakra over it's feet. The clone immedialely leaped into the water at her feet, submerging itself deep within the river.

She observed as the clone began to drown itself. All of the traits of it's facial features, as well as emotions were creeping her out, specifically because it looked exactly like her. The clone suddenly reverted from it's perfect replica of her, becoming a pile of mud again at the bottom of the floor of the pool of water. The female proceeded to form the Ram handsign, concealing her movement with a thick veil of mist as she reappeared on the other edge of the river in the same veil of mist.

The girl then melded the ground below her. Using her chakra, she allowed the ground below her to soften. After softening the ground enough she submerged herself below ground-level. Traveling beneath the ground, she traversed beneath the earth, emerging a few feet away from her initial location. The training was slightly chakra taxing, but it was well-worth it. Every fiber in her body was feeling stronger from this training.* - Fri Sep 11 18:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) appeared to be relatively tired after all the trianing she'd done. Her eyes lit upo with passion as she found that she still wasn't quite tired enough to stop training. She formed a couple handseals, spewing a thick, gooey fluid much like water from her mouth. The fluid solidified in the form of a syrupy, translucent blue liquid the second it hit the ground. She nodded silently, acknowledging how easily she had progressed with attempting to master the technique.

The white haired girl proceeded to conjure the Ram handsign. Shortly after a veil of mist would hide her shadowy figure as it traveled at a heightened pace. She'd reappear in a relatively distant place. A veil of mist concelaed her reappearance, up until it faded away and exposed her figure. She smirked, noticing that the technique -barely- drained her chakra.

Setsuna pressed the soles to her boots firmly against the ground. The veil of chakra at the soles of her feet multiplied, increasing immensely. She softened the ground below her feet, before submerging herself beneath ground-level with little difficulty. She'd traverse beneath ground at a heightened rate of speed. The girl would then re-emerge, looking around and noticing she'd gotten an impressive distance from her original location.

The white haired girl formed a couple handsigns. She concentrated a massive plume of chakra within her throat. After doing such she puckered her lips, and then she released a small stream of mud. By the time the mud completely exited her maw, a pile of it was at her feet. The generous amount of mud she produced was perfect.

She formed two handseals, then she started manipulating the mud. Using her connection with her chakra, she slowly began to change the mud's shape. The mud expanded and stretched vertically, forming into a shape that matched her own. With little difficulty the mud had composed itself into a perfect replica of her. She allowed the chakra to mold itself back into that of a pile of mud once more.

The girl breathed in a manner that was mild compared to her average breathing rate. She slowly reapplied a thin veil of chakra to the soles of her feet, walking across the small river before producing the Ram handsign and looking off into the distance. A thick veil of mist concealed her as she traveled at a high rate of speed, toward the mansion.* - Fri Sep 11 19:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) materialized from a thick veil of mist in one focused area. Her shadowy figure emerged from said mist, as she perched herself beside Violet, breathing mildly. Judging by her slouch, and slightly tired, half-lidded stare, she had just came back from intense training.* - Fri Sep 11 19:26:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: I'm not throwing myself into your situation.  If you don't like my comments, then either ignore them or just don't sound like a spoiled brat. - Fri Sep 11 20:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't see how disliking a man that can't mind is own business classifies as being spoiled. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Did she even listen to me. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hnf. Men. Always trying to justify their annoying tendencies. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Think what ever you want. In my eyes, you seem like a spoiled brat who wants everyone to drop what they're doing to serve you. - Fri Sep 11 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Just stop it Kida, I'm sick of fighting at the moment. Its an important skill everyone needs to know. - Fri Sep 11 20:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) focused her pinkish-purple gaze upon Jin, watching as he demonstrated the technique. "So.. like this.." She'd utter, forming the proper seal. Shortly after, she'd stop the flow of her chakra, then attempt to surge it. Unfortunately, she unintentionally failed to surge her chakra. She exhaled, looking at Kida with a dagger-like stare. She disregarded his statement, and instead took regard to just how annoying he was, in her eyes.

"Mind your business, loser." She'd remark. Shortly after, the white haired girl would set her sights upon her hands. She'd form the proper seal,  then halt her charka flow. Shortly after halting the flow of her chakra she proceeded to surge it. This time she'd successfully performed the action, efficiently using the Genjutsu: Dissipation technique in succession.

"That seemed right.." The girl murmured, recognizing the validness of her performance.

"Thanks." She'd said in a tone that was as bland as always.* - Fri Sep 11 20:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I don't trust men. I dislike them, as well. - Fri Sep 11 20:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Do you know anyone who is good with taijutsu? - Fri Sep 11 21:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And I mean in terms of skill and technique, not brute strength. - Fri Sep 11 21:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: No not really... - Fri Sep 11 21:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly seeped her chakra from the soles of her feet, a thin veil of the substance engulfing her feet. The ground below her softened as she submerged beneath ground-level. She exited the area underground, far beyond the range of most sensors in the process.* - Fri Sep 11 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly emerged from below ground-level. She sighed nonchalantly. The female spewed a wave of mud from her mouth shortly after forming handseals. Using the pile of mud, she formed a Doton chakra based clone of herself. Shortly after doing such, the female would distance herself from the clone, intending to go toe and toe with her clone for the sake of training. "Ready when you are." Setsuna would remark, before rushing toward her shadow clone.* - Fri Sep 11 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slashed hroizontally, though her earth clone easily parried the attack. The clone had easily knocked her tanto downward utilizing a veritcal slash, then proceeded to slash at her diagonally, aiming to cut her right shoulder. Setsuna leaned back, evading the attack just barely. With a quick upward slash she made her clone stagger. With the clone's balance off, the white haired girl rushed forth eagerly, with her pinkish purple orbs focused on her mud-composed clone.

She attempted to slash her clone in it's side, but unfortunately the attack was evaded with relative ease. Setsuna spun around, skidding across the ground and just barely blocking her clone's descending, vertical slash. She struggled temporarily, then before she knew it she managed to escape close range with her shadow clone. She then dashed back toward her clone, barraging it with endless slashes that were easily parried.

"Hyaaaaaaaah... !"* - Fri Sep 11 22:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) leaped upward, slashing downward at her clone and slashing it's right shoulder. She quickly blocked the attack that her clone suddenly attempted to land on her. She landed on tbhe ground, leaping back then proceeding to parry, block, and narrowly dodge the barrage of slashes that her shadow clone approached her with. She'd quickly barrel roll out of harms way when her clone attempted to thrust it's blade into her stomach.

The earth-based clone suddenly whipped a kunai knife at her, then formed a trio of handseals, spewing a stream of highly pressurized water toward her in the form of a funnel-shaped wave. Setsuna quickly deflected the kunai utilizing the sharp edge of her tanto. She quickly softened the ground below her utilizing her chakra reserves, traveling beneath the ground and proceeding to emerge beneath her shadow clone, smashing the butt of her tanto into the shadow clone's chin.

The shadow clone shot high into the air, before vanishing in a plume of gray smoke. She climbed from the hole she made, resealing it by re-hardening the ground. The white haired girl would sigh nonchalantly. She seated herself on the shoreline, looking across it. The female would slowly form the handseal necessary, stopping the flow of her chakra then unexpectedly surging it, practicing her genjutsu breaking method.* - Fri Sep 11 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the necessary seal once more. After doing such a thing she halted the flow of her chakra reserves. Shortly after doing such, she surged her chakra reserves instantly. By doing such, she had once agani imrpvoed her knowledge, and experience with the Genjutsu: Dissipation technique. The white haired female stood up.

She formed a couple handseals and spewed a wave of mud from her mouth, then formed a couple more handseals. The mud slowly formed into that of a perfect replica, producing a Doton-composed clone. The clone distanced itself from her, usnheathing it's tanto as did she. Both herself and the shadow clone rushed forth eagerly, clashing with their tanto blades. She slashed hroziontally, and her clone slashed diagonally, reuslting in another collision.

The collision this time, was brief. They jumped back, sheathing their tantos. Herself and her doton chakra-manifested clone sprinted at one another eagerly. She took a punch to the right cheek, whiel she landed a punch to her shadow clone's left cheek. They staggered back some, initiating close combat with one another.

Both leaped back again. Setsuna rushed forth, performing five handseals in a blur of movement. Her clone unexpectedly removed a kunai from it's backpouch, thrusting it into her chest. Setsuna suddenly dispersed in a plume of smoke, being replaced by a wooden cylinder. She suddenly emerged from the ground, leaving a crater in the place. She thrashed all four of her knuckles into her shadow clone's chin, uppercutting it into the air and making it disperse. She climbed from the hole, sighing nonchalantly.

"Easy.." She said. It seemed that she had been cold for the past few hours. With that being said, she pressed her palm to her chest, utilizing her chakra to stabilize her body's temperature with relative ease. After doing such, she leaned against the tree, sighing. She removed a small, indigo sphere of nutrients from her backpouch, popping it into her mouth. She then proceeded to swallow the pill. She had temporarily warmed herself up, yet she knew for a fact that she may've been coming down with something. Training constantly did that to you.* - Fri Sep 11 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) entered Kirigakure's hospital, trancing down the pale white hallways, filled with all types of interns and staff. Setsuna's hands were tucked away in her pockets, and her pinkish-purple eyes flickered from left to right as she peered into every room that she passed, wondering if there was anyone who hadn't gotten attended to yet. As a highly qualified nusre within the hospital, it was natural for her to do such.

She wore a tight white dress shirt with white buttons, three of which were unbuttoned, exposing some of her chest, which wasn't very impressive, unless some considered a B-Cup pair good. The collar to the dress shirt was folded, and she wore a white skirt, as well as a white pair of heels. A clipboard was hugged to her left armpit, and a pair of plastic gloves adorned her hands.

She stepped into a crisp, white room with a patient that appeared to be a middle-aged man balding, with the typical guido style, slickback, greasy ass hair, euro-associated clothing, and money to accentuate his faggyness. "And you are in for...?" Setsuna said in a slightly enthusiastic tone, though she wasn't very pleased at all about attending to this job. Regardless, it was extra money.

"I've had a severe fever for a couple weeks now... it's terrible.." He murmured, his voice seeming to be relatively deep. "A fever for weeks? Shouldn't someone have attended to your illness by now?" Setsuna said, approaching the side of the male's bed. "The personnel's been busy... they barely check in.." The male uttered, curling up under the covers, his figure's inconvenient shudders capable of being previewed even with the blankets shrouding his form.

"Alright..." She remarked, scribbling down on her clipboard and setting it aside. The white haired girl would approach the side of his bed once more, pressing her palm against the male's arm. "This'll only take a moment.." She'd say, setting her pinkish, purple orbs upon the patient in front of him, his back facing her. Utilizing her chakra, she easily regulated his body temperature, so that he wouldn't be cold or hot. After performing such an action, the girl would do her basic prognosis, scribbling down his status on her clipboard.

She then provided him with a small dose of medicine. "You should be fine. I'll check in later. For now, stay in bed and get some rest. That medicine'll take a few minutes to kick in, but it should last for the rest of the evening." Setsuna remarked, exiting the hospital room. Setsuna would traverse down the bright white hallway, changing into her normal clothing and exiting the hospital. She'd only be able to do such after some hours of work, and treating patients, though.

She'd exit the hospital, sighing in boredom.* - Fri Sep 11 22:41:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) pressed her lean, pale figure against the brown, dim wall of the immense Mizukage mansion. She peered at the plethora of individuals gracing her pinkish-purple visage. A bubblegum-flavored lollipop rested within her mouth, the white stick peeking from the right side of her mouth, her lips slightly parted by the object.* - Fri Sep 11 22:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was too upset to interact with anyone physically. She'd soften the ground beneath herself and Violet, allowing both of them to seep below ground-level and leave.* - Sat Sep 12 01:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) emerged from the ground near the waterfall, scaling it alongside Violet. She'd look toward Violet with partially closed eyes, her pinkish-purple irises drifting to the ground at her feet. "I... think I should tell you why I dislike men.." The white haired girl murmured, thoughtlessly running her hand through her own hair. Whatever the reason was that she hated men, it had to do with her hair. Her other arm brushed against the opposing arm's forearm in anxiety. Her skin had to do with why she hated men, as well.* - Sat Sep 12 01:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded slightly, uncharacteristically jittery. A look of fear overlapped her normally impassive facial features. She'd simply murmur to Violet.

"I-I... alright..."

She'd start to whisper.* - Sat Sep 12 01:21:16 2015
