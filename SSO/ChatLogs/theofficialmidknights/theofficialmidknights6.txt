<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned slightly after noticing how much more of her potential she could've unleashed if she hadn't lazed off for an immense time period in her lifetime.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) coiled her arms around Violet, pinning her body against the brunette's. Whimpers erupted from her as she pressed her face to Violet's chest, wetting her clothing with her tears. Upon being kissed, Setsuna was calmed slightly, but only a slight calm wasn't enough to remove her from her grotto of emotions. The white haired girl closed her eyes, tears falling from their corners endlessly.

The second that the kiss would've ended she'd probably start bawling.* - Thu Sep 17 19:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued crying, though she managed to speak. Her words were barely coherent, though.

"I.... I... w... wh... what's wrong with me.. !? I.. I ca..can't... c.. c.. c.. control my emotions an.. anymore!? I.. I'm... s.. so afraid.. a.. a.. about t.. th.. this w.. war a.. an.. and ever.. everything!"* - Thu Sep 17 20:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stopped talking, continuing to sob helplessly. She didn't know how to control her emotions, having been used to living without them in life.* - Thu Sep 17 20:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was gaining better sense of her emotions, thanks to Violet's explanation. She continued to cry, but her sobs weren't as hectic and sorrowful as before.* - Thu Sep 17 20:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) felt her sadness slowly turn into lust. She'd tense her muscles at the feeling she was getting, being overwhelmed by her own libido from the moment she'd completely re-attained her mental bearings. "Mmh.... kyaaa....~" The white haired female would moan. Her half-lidded, pinkish-purple gaze set itself upon the brunette, as Setsuna practically begged for more with eye contact alone.* - Thu Sep 17 20:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was practically intoxicated by her pleasure. Violet's teasing of the sensitive parts of her body was giving Setsuna a hard time with maintaining herself. She tightened her arms around the brunette, clutching against her at close as possible. The girl buried her face in Violet's breasts, unable to maintain eye contact, or rational, bodily movements for that matter. The feelings she was developing were amazing, if anything.* - Thu Sep 17 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) "Nn...nnnuhhh..." She'd utter, burying her face in Violet's shoulder and continuing to embrace the female. She moaned in satisfying pleasure as the female caressed her breasts and thighs, only showing signs of wanting more when the brunette repositioned her to sit in her lap.* - Thu Sep 17 21:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) smiled. Her pinkish-purple orbs glistened with passion and appreciation of Violet's comment on her eyes. The white haired girl would loosen her grip around the brunette, though her arms were still comfortably around the girl. She'd affectionately smooch Violet on the lips, giggling slightly. She had managed to become a lot more chipper over the time that had elapsed. It seemed that she was no longer a pile of gloom and uncontrollable emotions.

"I love you, Violet.." She'd whisper, her cheeks flushing faintly. Setsuna cocked her head back, "Nnnhmm..." She'd moan as Violet kissed her neck.* - Thu Sep 17 22:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) scanned Niza's frame for injuries, removing herself from the bench and approaching the male.* - Thu Sep 17 23:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had identified the fact that someone had at least managed to attempt healing him. The girl moved forth, performing several handsigns and engulfing her hands in a pale aura of light blue chakra. She'd crouch down, emanating his wounds in the vibrant chakra and beginning to repair the torn and punctured flesh. She'd heal the injuries within his neck first, before proceeding to heal the stab wounds.

The white haired girl would most likely heal the stab wounds at the most, especially if they were moderate. It'd be hard to believe if they were anything beyond that, considering he was still alive when she checked his pulse. She performed a basic checkup on the male, giving him a small dose of medicine. The girl would fish throughout her beige backpouch, bringing forth a sufficent amount of gauze then parting it from the rest with a quick slash of a kunai knife she had on her person.

The female would have efficiently clotted the blood within his wounds, preventing any further blood loss than he might've already suffered. In addition, she'd sanitized the wounds as well. The girl wrapped the areas where he'd been afflicted by the harsh wounds in gauze. She spoke in what seemed to be a radio.

"Tethys, come to the hospital." She'd state in an utter, removing a small indigo pill from her pouch. She'd place the pill within the former Raikage's mouth, forcing him to swallow it. She'd form the Clone handsign, producing a replica of herself from a plume of smoke. The Shadow Clone would dash into the hospital, attempting to receive medic personnel.* - Thu Sep 17 23:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) paid close attention to Niza's wounds, ensuring that they weren't bleeding. In the meantime she awaited for the medical personnel that her clone called.* - Thu Sep 17 23:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: The fuck happened..? - Thu Sep 17 23:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: *sigh*.. - Thu Sep 17 23:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: How damaged is he? - Thu Sep 17 23:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: He's suffered from mild stab wounds to the back, in addition to terrible damage to his neck. Luckily his jugular is intact. - Thu Sep 17 23:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I stopped the bleeding, cleaned the wounds and checked him for any more injuries. His pulse is a little slower than it should, but other than that he'll be fine after receiving necessary recovery. - Thu Sep 17 23:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Hiru...and Hanabi... - Thu Sep 17 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) looked back at Violet, giving a reassuring grin before shifting her attention to Niza. Her shadow clone dispersed, engulfing her in knowledge. It seemed that medical personnel was busy at the moment. Apparently they were too busy to get a stretcher for a prominent village leader.

"Tethys, carry him for me.. I'll get him into a hospital room." She'd remark.* - Thu Sep 17 23:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Be careful... I hope he gets better... - Fri Sep 18 00:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: What in the world is going on? - Fri Sep 18 00:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) would direct Tethys to place Niza on the hospital bed. She'd hook up machinery that was basic, simply because of the time period they were in. The girl would proceed to hook up various wires to the male's arm, one of which served to provide his bloodstream directly with the same ingredients used to produce healing pills. Of course, the dosage was limited, because she had no intentions of letting him die of overdose.

Another wire literally sounded a beep, should the patient with it hooked up to it, had their pulse come to a halt. She fixed up Niza's gauze, considering she'd sloppily applied them, as she was in a hurry to put them on before he started bleeding again. The girl would scan his frame frmo head to toe, mentally questioning if there was anything else to attend to.

The girl would approach the side of the bed once more, pressing her two fingertips against the male's neck and checking his pulse, then placing her palm against his forehead, checking to ensure his temperature was regular. If it had any irregularities she'd pulse her chakra throughout him, stabilizing his body's inner temperature. She'd set her pinkish-purple orbs upon Tethys.

"He'll be fine for now. With his wounds he'll probably need stitches or a more experienced medic like Koeki to take care of him." She'd drift her attention to Niza, folding her arms. "I don't want you up and about until she does. Get rest, and don't stress over anything." She'd instruct, exchanging another brief glance with Tethys. She exited the hospital room, assuming that the two men wanted to talk alone. If they didn't, it didn't really matter, she had patients to attend to.* - Fri Sep 18 00:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sauntered outta the hospital, leaving with Violet.* - Fri Sep 18 00:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) // Setsuna's hands were trembling, and so was her bottom lip. She didn't know why, though. The white haired female's entire body was shivering. The shudder of her hands came to a halt when Violet grasped them. Her pinkish-purple irised eyes lowered slightly as she looked off to the side.

"My gut's telling me it's not a facade.." She'd murmur, whimpering slightly.* - Fri Sep 18 16:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 
"Hey, let's take a trip to the hot sprin--" She'd suddenly be interrupted by the tickles. Though it was untimely, it still make her raucously laugh uncontrollably.* - Fri Sep 18 16:24:57 2015

"The dye..." She'd utter.* - Fri Sep 18 16:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 
"Hold on." She'd sink her head beneath the water. The water became foggier than before as the dye cleared out. She'd soon lift her head above the water, revealing her head of platinum blonde, as well as slightly pink hair. She'd rest herself between Violet's legs, hugging close to the brunette.

"Yeah." She'd smile.* - Fri Sep 18 17:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shook her head. She was still warm and comfortable here, though the chilling story of her past that Violet told her gave her the impulse to do and talk abotu happy things. Setsuna leaned back within the hot spring water, her arms folded together. She had a pair of B-Cups, and her body was well shaped, her hips above average and her butt at a near-perfect size and shape.

"Let's relax here for now... we can go out and eat after this, if you're hungry." The blonde would state.* - Fri Sep 18 18:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) saw that the Miso Ramen had finally arrived.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly slid her hand into the backpouch pinned to her lower basck. The blondette would proceed to remove a scroll from said backpouch, observing it briefly. She'd unravel the scroll, opening it completely and squinting her pinkish-purple pair of irises. She attempted to gain an accurate understanding of the technique that was being explained in the scroll. None the less, she seemed to have a hard time doing such.

It was literally a more advanced form of the Novice Healing technique, it seemed. None the less, she was well aware that it was out of her expertise, for now, at the very least. If she became capable of interpreting the technique's proper usage she'd easily utilize it in situations. Thus she did what was natural, and tried a hands on approach at learning it. She rolled the scroll up, placing it in the backpouch.

Having memorized the handsigns at the very least, the girl prepared to surge a decent amount of chakra. She would then form several handsigns, emanating her hands in a pale, light blue aura of chakra. Being quite the intellectual individual, she had very capable observational skills. Setsuna would squint, narrowing her eyes and attempting to see further than what was visible, when it came to looking at the scroll.

"Eh....?" She'd raise a brow, realizing that such a thing didn't help. At all.* - Sat Sep 19 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled slightly, allowing the auras of chakra around her hands to fade from visage. She'd proceed to dash out of the courtyard, intending to come back later on. Setsuna's movements were quite brisk, indicating that she had much more potential for fluency when it came to motion, but hadn't unlocked it. None of it, if anything.* - Sat Sep 19 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) arrived in what seemed to be a random location in the village. She tranced throughout the small percentage of slums located in Kirigakure no Sato, stepping down an alleyway while breathing at a mild pace. The blondette would discover a very messed up cat that looked as though it's stomach had been carved open by... a really nasty parasite. The truth to the matter was that it had been.

Setsuna crouched down in front of the cat, doing standard procedure when it came to treating animals. She'd check it's pulse, stabilizing it's body temperature using a slight surge of chakra injected via. physical contact. She would form several handsigns, producing a translucent, vibrant yet light blue aura of chakra around her hands. She hovered her hands over the stomach wound, allowing the chakra to lighten up the wound and engulf it in the chakra. The cat's healing rate exponentially increased, as the torn, infected flesh seemed to immediately be sanitized, and healed.

Though this technique was impressive in itself, it was nothing compared to Koeki. Judging by Setsuna's newbie level experience with the jutsu, she exhausted lots of her chakra while utilizing it. Also, she was healing -much- slower than the technique's maximum capabilities had. She had seen Koeki's healing ability, and it was quite impressive in her eyes. She'd look down at the snow white cat, now having recovered from the terrible treatment it underwent while unattended to.

She saw that the cat hadn't been fed in a long while, and that it was dehydrated. The girl would proceed to head back to the mansion with the small furry, yet boney feline in her arms, stopping at a convenience store to purchase a cat-friendly food, as well as some bottled water. Rehydrating the cat, as well as feeding it, she'd carry the sleeping feline back to the courtyard.* - Sat Sep 19 01:25:58 2015
