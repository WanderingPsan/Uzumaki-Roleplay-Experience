<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) lurched forth, rapidly trying to coil her arms around Violet, a small, half-hearted, gloomy smile cascading her features. She'd press her form against the orange-haired female, murmuring to her.

"I..I do."* - Mon Oct 19 02:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) whispered to the female. "I... I love you.." She'd murmur.. holding Violet tightly. She'd accept the kiss with all it had to offer, though it seemed she wasn't delighted up until the point that she died. Setsuko had a blue scroll on her, that was intended to be given to Kirie, to inform the female that Setsuko had asked Violet to kill her.

In the time that she still had consciousness, which was a little less than a second, her last moments would be her blurred visage set upon Violet. Her eyes would flick open, their golden stare piercing Violet for one last time before coming to a close before she lost consciousness and died from the separation of her head from her body. Her headless body would've fell into Violet's arms, her body's grasp loosening greatly.

The blondette wouldn't have been happier in the afterlife. She'd have no one to greet her. In all honesty she told Violet to kill her to force herself out of the carrothead's hair. It was the last thing she could do to prove her devotion and passion to the one..

The one that she loved.* - Mon Oct 19 02:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cortel, Mia(TheOfficialMidknights) folded her legs, her nails digging into her thighs as she sat in a kneel. Mia's eyes were trained on Shoji and Baylea. She'd lick the saliva draining from the side of her mouth. "Nnnnhh..." She'd murmur, her eyes becoming half-lidded. Her juices soaked the floor below her.* - Wed Oct 21 03:29:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cortel, Mia(TheOfficialMidknights) felt her tongue slip from her mouth as she observed despairingly. Her fingernails would scrape upon her thighs, drawing blood. "Nnnnnnhhhhaaa..." She'd moan, digging her teeth into her bottom lip. Her ability to put up with this 'test' was wavering. None the less she'd hold onto ability to withstand this 'torture', her gaze never faltering.

"I'm so hot and wet.." She'd utter incoherrently, perspiring. Her juices continued to leak from the drenching, pink walls of her vagina. Her despairing ogle locked onto Baylea.* - Wed Oct 21 03:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Cortel, Mia(TheOfficialMidknights) wasn't jealous, but surely watching two other people aside from herself elope was getting her hot. She'd dig her nails as much as possible into her thighs, squinting as she struggled to continue watching without having the urge to masturbate to it. Her inner thighs were clammy and dripping with vaginal juices.

"Nnnhhhh...." She'd moaned harder.* - Wed Oct 21 04:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) approached Mirai's side, appearing to be wearing a less loose-fitting, turquoise kimono that exposed some of her cleavage and her curves.

"Hi, Mirai." She'd state, beaming at the white-haired Hokuma.* - Mon Nov 16 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) noticed how Mirai seemed to be surprised by her bubbly mood.

She folded her hands together, her hands folded at her waist. She maintained a rather calm, happy composure, her smile growing slightly brighter. "Well... I don't feel stressed out at all, and I'm in a relationship now..~"

A pleased giggle emitted itself from her throat. It was almost creepy that she was this happy for the first time in a long time.* - Mon Nov 16 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) smiled, as though she'd accomplished something. Though she actually did, in a way. She whispered to Mirai giddily.* - Mon Nov 16 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) entered the room, two guards behind her. A sticker with "VISITOR" inscribed upon it was coiled around her right wrist. She smiled lightly. The black-haired female was sure she never interacted with Trilliam before, but now was a good start. One guard left, while antoher stayed close behind.

"Hi Trilliam. You probably don't know me, I'm Koji's cousin, Mizora. I apologize I've never taken the time to meet you.. outside of an environment like this. Other than that.. how long will it be before you're out?"

Her hands were clasped together at her waist. Her smile was genuine, not a hint of falseness or half-heartedness to it.* - Tue Nov 17 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) smiled. She'd walked in with low expectations, especially of someone so young and in prison. None the less he already gave her a good impression. The black haired female lifted a brow, her smile growing a little brighter. "Oh? You get guarded twenty four seven? I couldn't imagine never being alone.." She stated, giggling a bit while actually being honest. That'd be unfathomable.* - Tue Nov 17 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) peered over at the figure. She had her doujutsu active still, and thus she noticed the chakra swarming the Liger figurine. She lifted a brow, looking back toward him. "That's... a lot of time.. and Galgus? That's a nice name.." She responded. The female shook her head, but only if he was offering the chocolate.* - Tue Nov 17 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded, listening closely as he explained the Liger figurine to her. She shook her head when he asked if she was on the police force. She seemed quite pleasant, even while informing him of her choices. The Hokuma ran her fingers through her lengthy bundles of jet-black hair.

"I'm actually a retired shinobi. I'm just a civilian now, mainly because of some issues I had as a shinobi. I've missed being one though.. so I'm thinking about attempting to regain my position as a Genin.. maybe even try to become a Chuunin."* - Tue Nov 17 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) couldn't help but smile abit about his clan's "immortality". Maybe it was a joke, maybe it wasn't, but it amused her in the slightest manner.

"Your Grandfather's hospitality's the main reason why I'm here. I'm sure that any other Kazekage would've had me killed. I left Sunagakure and was declared a rogue.. but I was let off the hook just this once. I need someone's personal opinion, should I have a go at being a shinobi again?" She questioned the boy, curious of his answer.* - Tue Nov 17 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded lightly, acknowledging his answer. She'd have to think on it, though. The guard made his approach, speaking in his gruff tone. "Your time to visit is over, you may exit the premises, Hokuma." The guard stated, guiding her out of the door. She looked back, waving at Trilliam before exitting the prison cell.* - Tue Nov 17 03:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I might try becoming a shinobi again. I visited Trilliam's cell because I wanted to meet him, and see the view of someone who doesn't know me, for an unbiased opinion. He said I should give it a go again.. I'm still debating it, though. - Tue Nov 17 03:29:29 2015
