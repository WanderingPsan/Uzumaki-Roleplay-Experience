<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) conjured the Clone handsign with sufficient accuracy. Two bursts of gray smoke manifested themsleves at her right side, producing two shadow clones. Both of the shadow clones distanced themselves from Setsuna, standing in the small area to the left of the mountain's perimeter. Both shadow clones would unsheath theri tantou, rushing forth eagerly. Setsuna's shadow clones slashed toward one another, parrying eachothe'rs strikes with near-equal precision towar done another.

Both of them staggered some, faltering with each intense collision. Her second shadow clone performed several backflips, forming a multitude of handsigns and summoning a river of mud from it's mouth. Her first shadow clone manifested an immense volume of water from a thin, highly-compressed wave. The two projectiles collided, small pieces of mud, as well as bundles of water shooting outward omnidirectionally. The thick mass of the river of mud easily rendered the force of the water futile.

Her first shadow clone dashed to the left, then shot toward the second shadow clone in a straight line. They exchanged physical blows, kicking and punching at one another. Setsuna's shadow clones then proceeded to distance themselves, then dash forth once more, dispersing one another with a firm jab to their jaws. Upon their disperse, Setsuna retained knowledge on combat that her clones developed, able to recognize just how strong her own attacks were, as well as the outcome of a Suiton versus Doton-based collision.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) coiled her arms around Violet, looking at the female with a light smile. "Show me then."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was swarmed by intoxicating love. Setsuna felt immersed by the great feeling of being caressed in parts of her body she had never been caressed before. Any form of physical contact for her was rough and ruthless in the past, but this tender, affection-filled manner of touch made her desire more. She wrapped her tongue around Violet's, exchanging saliva with the brunette haired girl and staying as close to her as possible. Her hands contracted upon the cloth that Violet was wearing, clenching it. It was hard to maintain levelheadedness in such feverish heat, conjured by the love shared between them.

"M..Mmmh...." The white haired girl would utter, proceeding to french kiss the female.* - Tue Sep 15 23:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) almost cocked her head back, though she didn't want to break the kiss, so she decided against it. A moan, stifled by the kiss, was released from her, as she ran her hands up Violet's arms, her chest arched forth. A deep blush engulefd her cheeks.* - Wed Sep 16 00:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) buried her head in the female's chest, keeping her arms tightly coiled around Violet. "Mmmmmmmmhmmmm..." Setsuna would murmur.* - Wed Sep 16 00:20:41 2015

"Should I come, just in case he needs to be healed?"* - Thu Sep 17 17:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That way our forces would not have to risk going on foot in the ocean, but rather have some monsters do the fighting for us as well. - Thu Sep 17 17:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded. She'd form several handsigns, emitting her hands in bright, pale blue chakra. The white haired female would press her hands to the male's leg, proceeding to emanate it in the chakra, repairing moderate pierce-wounds, completely healing the torn flesh in the process if the wound wasn't too major. She'd proceed to repair his arm shortly after if his injuries were minor on it, as well.

She'd go through a basic prognosis, examining Fujitora's frame to ensure that there were no other injuries. Shortly after, Setsuna would give him a small dose of medicine.* - Thu Sep 17 17:43:02 2015
