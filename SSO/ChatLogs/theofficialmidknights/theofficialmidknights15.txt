<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Farewell. - Tue Sep 29 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) moved forth at a relatively impressive rate of speed. She'd dexteriously remove a kunai knife from her backpouch, wielding it with her right hand. She swiped at the air rapidly, immersing the kunai in a shimmering whiteish blue aura of translucent chakra. The female would pivot on her heel, performing a quick kick to the air, placing her leg upon the ground as she lifted the other in a rapid kicking motion that imployed the usage of her flexibility.

After doing so she'd slam her foot back down to the ground, taking a quick leap back. The blonde rushed forth rather eagerly, unsheathing her katana from her sheathe strapped to her left hip. She'd slash rapidly at the area in front of her, performing a series of rapid thrusting motions. In one last movement she'd take a leap upward, performing two somersaults as she did so, before slashing in a harsh, accurate and quick downward arc to the area in front of her.

Setsuko would sheathe her katana once more, exhaling lightly as she shoved her hands into her pockets. The golden gazed female would shift her stare from left to right, taking a quick scan of the area nearby before beginning to head back towards that of the Mizukage mansion. She was coinfident that no one was there, but she could at least try. On her way there, the girl would sniff the air, finding that the scent of fresh donuts was calling her. She'd puff her cheeks, groaning lightly.

"I just worked out too..." She groaned, nibbling at her index finger's nail. She'd pull her hand away from her mouth, resting her arm at her side, then shrugging nonchalantly. She'd walk in the direction of the economic district of Kirigakure no Sato. "Hmmm.. oh well.." She'd say, licking her lips in a desiring manner. The female would near the bakery, entering it and being immersed in the familiar warmth of the baked goods, and their sweet, delicious scent.

She'd eagerly approach the counter, paying for a pair of cinnamon rolls and a trio of glazed donuts. She'd pay for the treat, before seating herself at a booth within the corner of the bakery, eating the food slowly. The female's bottom lip trembled in bliss, and she felt a wave of effervescence immerse her frame with each bite she took, the blissful taste accentuating her tastebud's demands.

Setsuko would gobble up the food, then proceed to make her way to the courtyard of the mansion in a light jog, a small effort of burning some of the calories that she consumed. Even with the time spent at the bakery, it was highly likely that the eerily quiet, and seemingly abandoned courtyard would ensue with a bare population. Such a thing felt weird, considering the courtyard was usually abundant with people.* - Wed Sep 30 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) yawned briefly, stifling said yawn with a clasped hand, pressing the back of her frame to one of the two white posts in front of the mansion. Setsuko's golden stare wouldn't drift away from the area in front of her.* - Wed Sep 30 02:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I can't even. - Thu Oct  1 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) tensed up slightly.

"I have something to attend to.." She'd utter, attempting to make a brisk departure from the courtyard.* - Thu Oct  1 04:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Sure. - Fri Oct  2 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded lightly. Three attempts sounded sufficient enough. She'd unsheathe her katana from her hip. The girl would clench it tightly by it's handle with a tight grip of both of her hands. She would slowly begin to build up on chakra. The built up chakra would course throughout the katana's blade in a steady flow.

She was simply applying a raw flow of chakra to the surface of the katana's blade. A shimmering aura of pale, white-ish blue would immerse the weaponry. Setsuko would slowly begin to knead the steady stream of chakra into a Doton-based composure. The katana would be accentuated by a brown glint, rather than one that matched it's blade's color.

The girl could tell she successfully infused the blade with Doton-based, kneaded chakra. However, she had to check if it wasn't just by luck. The blonde applied a sufficient flow of Doton-kneaded chakra to the piece of weaponry. The katana would be reinforced by the chakra, a brown glint to it's blade to indicate she'd done it.

"Did I do it properly?"* - Fri Oct  2 21:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Sigh... - Fri Oct  2 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) showed relatively quick skills at swordsmanship. The blonde attempted to immerse her blade in chakra and proceed to slash at the clones at her sides, as well as the shurikens composed of water closing in on her. Doton-kneaded chakra immersed her katana's blade, causing it to obtain a brown glint to it's shimmer.* - Fri Oct  2 23:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to evade, if not stop Violet from pushing her down. The blonde would take advantage of the mist to do what she intended, and that was devise a plan. She removed a small can of soda from within her backpouch, as well as a kunai, holding one in each hand. She'd cut off the sleeve to her jacket. Setsuko would then proceed to immerse the can of soda in Doton-composed chakra, before whipping it at the attacker, where she last heard his voice.

The kunai would blindly shoot past the male, the arm sleeve serving as a container for the trio of poison bombs attached to the end of the kunai. The bombs would implode into purple mist, afflicting the mask-wearing individual if he was close by.* - Sat Oct  3 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) 

(*De la Cruze, Violet //As she saw a fire ball go for Setsuko she quickly formed her hand seals and formed handseals required to make a earth shadow clone... she would throw the shadow clone at the spawn of the fireball and hope to catch the person shooting it. If the clone caught the opponent then the clone would turn into mud and capture him on the wall. If the clone misses it would try to grab the wall and attempt to spew a mud river at the shadowy figure in the mist. All the while Violet would run along the mountain using suimen and get out of the mist yet again. hiding from the fire and water user.

Hopefully the fire blast would cover her plan sound wise... and she could catch him off guard since he didnt know where she was and he was occupied with the front area.*)* - Sat Oct  3 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly saw an orange shine within the mist. Suddenly, she found a massive fireball being fired at her. The girl clenched her teeth, her eyes noticeably dialating. She'd instinctively throw her arms up in front of her face, upper and mid-torso, trying to deal with the damage she'd take as much as possible. The flames would consume her figure, causing her to shriek in blood-curling pain.

The blonde would bite harshly onto her lip, investing any mental bearings she had left to move her body out of the way, fueling her ability to move by using the pain that she was attempting to endure. She'd attempt to perform a diving roll out of the focal point of the massive dome of heat, her clothing majorly burnt. Her skin was terribly burned, first degrees littering it here and there. Otherwise, second degree burns consumed her frame.

She was on the brink of losing consciousness, but still had the will to crawl further away.* - Sat Oct  3 03:26:30 2015

She noticed the mist had thinned out some. <Did I lose consciousness...?> The blonde thought to herself, taking a quick look around. If she could manage a glimpse at the attacker Setsuko would form five handsigns as a precuation, before rushing toward the male eagerly, clenching her katana within her two-handed grasp. She was exhausted, injured and probably going to lose consciousness soon.

If she had closed in on the masked individual she'd try to horizontally cut him down, trying to take the clones with him if it was necessary.* - Sat Oct  3 04:02:20 2015
