<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Okay. - Thu Nov 19 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) didn't really have a plan up her sleeve. She was trying to improvise with what she had to give Ai a challenge in this spar. Mizora knew that even Tetsumi couldn't bypass the defenses that Ai possessed, and so this fight would prove to be an uphill battle. Mizora produced a total of three handsigns, producing a pair of water-composed clones.

Both clones formed several handsigns, aiming to spew thick, translucent-blue, sticky, syrupy-fluids from their maws. The water-like substance shot toward Ai, though it moved slowly, proving just how inept Mizora was at elemental Ninjutsu.

Mizora herself began to take a quick jog forward.* - Thu Nov 19 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: What's going on over here? - Thu Nov 19 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mmm... - Thu Nov 19 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well.. - Thu Nov 19 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) coursed chakra to her eyes as she continued to rush forth, making note of the fireball that was shooting directly for her form. Judging by the heat alone emanating from it, even from a considerable distance away from her, Mizora couldn't take chances with attempting to take the attack head-on. Assuming that she was in too close of range to simply dodge the attack with her lack of mobility, there was only one way she could handle this situation.

Her water clones reverted into water, and were almost immediately evaporated upon doing so, being enveloped and consumed by the swarming dome of flames. Mizora lifted her heels from grains of pale, yellow sand below, her maroon eyes falling to a narrow as she extended her arms out; that very moment she allowed chakra to course to her lower forearms and most prominently, her hands.

She began to rapidly swivel on her feet, producing a spiralling dome of chakra by spewing chakra from all of her tenketsu. Her sole purpose of doing this was not to completely defend against the fireball; she knew that her sphere of chakra lacked the raw efficiency to provide her with such a gift. Instead, her main goal was none other than to 'defuse' the blast, if not reduce the overall damage it'd do.

Mizora found the fireball completely immersing the sphere of spiralling chakra, even going as far as to go through the sphere. Though, the fireball was weakened, and that was what the Hokuma wanted to do all along. Her sphere of chakra was -extremely- key to her defense against this attack, because with the help of her resillience against raw Ninjutsu, as well as her Revolving Heaven technique serving as a damage-absorber rather than obselete defense, she was able to take the attack without damage that she expected.

(27 Defense against the attack after Ninjutsu Defense is doubled. Rotation itself weakened the fireball's overall damage against me by 27.)

As the fireball combusted, she emerged from whatever smoke it may've produced, her hands still swarming with chakra as she rushed forth eagerly, taking a diagonal path to her left, and Ai's right.* - Thu Nov 19 02:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) had sight of all of the shuriken, unless some of the tools were moving in the blindspot of her doujutsu. The Hokuma attempted to rapidly whip eight shurikens at the paper shurikens shooting toward her, while intending to take an alternate path to the remaining two that she intended to avoid by speed alone.

Mizora still had her gaze set upon Ai, doing her best to take note of anymore attacks that came. She was relieved that the attacks coming at her were in her window of reaction time, for now maybe?* - Thu Nov 19 02:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) was consumed by the paper, being binded by it completely. She'd attempt to squirm, but none the less she couldn't break away. If her head wasn't covered her bundles of hair would conceal her look of pure displeasure.She had a really odd displeasure for binds.

"Nng..." She let out, continuing to attempt breaking free. It was a hopeless attempt, though, since she lacked the necessary strength.* - Thu Nov 19 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded, it seemed that Ai had identified the flaw to the way that Mizora fought. She had no defenses, or counters, to range-based fighters. Even as such a seemingly experienced close-range specialist she still had no counters.

"I'm trying to improve my understanding of elements so I can fight better against long-range combatants." Mizora commented, turning to face Ai. The chakra around Mizora's hands and lower forearms faded, but the chakra flowing to her eyes didn't. Her arms extended outward above Ai's shoulders, her arms bending to coil around her.

"You're still as great as ever though.. in more ways than one." Mizora stated, her head slowly pressing to Ai's chest as she complimented her.* - Thu Nov 19 03:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) snuggled closely to Ai's form, returning the whisper shortly after.

"Hm? Alright.." Her murmur was muffled.* - Thu Nov 19 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: As an taijutsu specialist, those are important to you. - Thu Nov 19 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Okay. - Thu Nov 19 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Alright. - Thu Nov 19 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Listen closely. - Thu Nov 19 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: This technique rotates around chakra control. - Thu Nov 19 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: By channeling more chakra to the feet, you'll be able to launch yourself like an rocket. - Thu Nov 19 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Within an instant. - Thu Nov 19 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Similar to teleportation. - Thu Nov 19 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hmm.. that'll be -really- useful then.. - Thu Nov 19 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Indeed. - Thu Nov 19 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Try it out. - Thu Nov 19 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) stood up. The black-haired female channeled a sufficient level of chakra to her feet. She attempted to balance it with finesse while doing so, concentrating on applying enough chakra, as well as the necessary amount of control, to succeed in performing the technique. She felt as though she was forgetting something about the technique though. The Hokuma recalled the many times that Sanoke used the technique, remembering that the Ram handsign always preceded his movement.

Mizora formed the Ram handsign and then proceeded to course another surge of chakra to each of the soles of her feet. She followed Ai's description of the technique, levelling out the reserves flowing to her feet with her rather-efficient chakra control. The girl then used the chakra to launch forth in an instant without delay to the boosted movement. Upon reappearing a decent distance from her original position, she was wobbly on her feet, staggering forth as she slowly regained her balance.

"This dizziness... was unexpected.." She stated, chuckling nervusly.* - Thu Nov 19 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) lifted a hand, her hands on her knees.

"One second.. I'm still.. really dizzy, haha.." * - Thu Nov 19 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Yeah, it happens.~ - Thu Nov 19 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) moved back over to Ai, kneeling down in front of her and embracing her. Mizora slowly readjusted her own position so that she was sitting in Ai's lap, facing her.

"I guess the unexpected speed boost throws your body off."* - Thu Nov 19 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) widened her eyes, looking up at Ai, her mouth agape. Her arms were still tightly coiled around Ai. "She did? She didn't tell me..." Mizora said, her head sinking as she pressed it against Ai's chest once more. Her demeanor seemed more on edge, and a little more nervous. Just what did Chikyu have to go through..?* - Thu Nov 19 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I don't know what kind of..Crazy sick bastard he was but we found her naked, chained to a wall, full of whip wounds...Her eyes seems broken and he was lapping her breast.. - Thu Nov 19 04:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Did he have any associates? - Thu Nov 19 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Nope. - Thu Nov 19 04:33:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Aye, I thought ya would have been anger at me, I'm glad you understand. - Thu Nov 19 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: It's reasonable.. - Thu Nov 19 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Anyway. - Thu Nov 19 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: What have ya been doing while I was away hun?~ - Thu Nov 19 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Nothing really... me training turned into me just napping my butt off, hehe.. - Thu Nov 19 04:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Mhm... hmhm..~ - Thu Nov 19 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) kissed Ai's chest, still embracing her.* - Thu Nov 19 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) "Mmh.." Was her only response to this news. She didn't hold an inch of familial affection for that boy, anyways. Her body pressed against Ai's involuntarily in reaction to her finger running across her frame.* - Thu Nov 19 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) yawned lightly, murmuring in her muffled voice.

"Sleep.."* - Thu Nov 19 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Oh? Well I'll be cuddling with my lover while she sleeps.~ - Thu Nov 19 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly began to drift off. "I.. love you.." She whispered. Within the next few minutes she fell asleep with her barely audible snores resonating from her, embraced by Ai's warmth.* - Thu Nov 19 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: *Yawns* Good morning,~ - Thu Nov 19 22:49:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Did I miss anything? - Thu Nov 19 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Not to my knowledge. Everything was quiet when I took a walk around. - Thu Nov 19 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Not to my knowledge, everything was quiet when I was out and about. - Thu Nov 19 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? I see. - Thu Nov 19 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Mhm.. - Thu Nov 19 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Anything on ya mind sweetie? - Thu Nov 19 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I've been thinking about what we should do today, if you're off duty. - Thu Nov 19 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: As long as Hassan doesn't call for me, I'm off duty so what do ya have in mind sweetie? - Thu Nov 19 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Mmm.. a nice day of relaxation. Sorry if I'm not that all energetic.. - Thu Nov 19 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Crawl up.~ - Thu Nov 19 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) snuggled closely to Ai, hugging onto her.

"Mm.. I'm glad to be your girlfriend." She stated, burying her head in Ai's chest.* - Thu Nov 19 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) held onto Ai a little tighter as she thought to herself. <I never knew that being in a relationship was so... good.> The close, affectionate contact between them immersed her in satisfactory warmth, both literally and metaphorically.

"Have you ever wanted children?" She asked solemnly. Not a single inch of her physical or sentimental being gave off a sign if Mizora herself wanted them or not.* - Thu Nov 19 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I personally don't know if I want children. I still have time to think about it, though. Maybe. - Thu Nov 19 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: You have a lot of time sweetie. - Thu Nov 19 23:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Could I ask, why ya suddenly bring that up though? - Thu Nov 19 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It was on my mind. - Thu Nov 19 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Oh? I see. - Thu Nov 19 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uhuh! - Thu Nov 19 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Quite cute though, I didn't thought you would have suggested that.~ - Thu Nov 19 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I was just on the thought process, is all.. - Thu Nov 19 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) looked eye-to-eye with Ai. Mizora bit her own lip, attempting to avert her gaze, but none the less it flickered back to Ai. Heat rushed to the black-haired female's cheeks.

"W-Well.." * - Thu Nov 19 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) widened her pair of bright, maroon eyes upon seeing Ai's. Mizora murmured her response. "Lots.. of lewd things.."* - Thu Nov 19 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Dreams...? - Thu Nov 19 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: The Lewd things. - Thu Nov 19 23:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Well? - Thu Nov 19 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Isn't it too early? - Thu Nov 19 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: How long as it been really? - Thu Nov 19 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's felt like we've been together for way longer than we actually have.. - Thu Nov 19 23:57:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm a fan of takoyaki, dumplings and especially white chocolate. - Fri Nov 20 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Go on.~ - Fri Nov 20 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: For general things that I like.. I could go with nature, weather when it's not too hot or cold, also when it's clear out.. cafe hopping, cooking and festivals. - Fri Nov 20 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I've never been to a festival or cafe-hopped though, to be honest. - Fri Nov 20 00:05:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) widened her eyes. She closed them, continuing to intimately clasp onto Ai. She took note of Ai's extremely curvy form, which made it hard to believe that Ai was actually male. The Hokuma was enveloped by intoxicating affection and enjoyment for the activity at hand. Never before did she begin to -think- that kissing was such an immense turn-on for her.

Her breasts continued to press against Ai. That wasn't good for Mizora at all, because she was pretty... sensitive. The pressing of her chest against Ai only amplified the pleasure she was getting from this. Low moans from the pits of her throat resonated from her.* - Fri Nov 20 01:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Mizora(TheOfficialMidknights) continued to kiss Ai, though the feeling of satisfaction began to slip in. She finally attempted to pull away and burrow her face in Ai's shoulder, still huggling her. The Hokuma girl was breathing heavily, her supple pair remaining pressed to Ai's form like the rest of her frame. Her face was red.

"Nnnnhhh..." She just couldn't get enough of the feelings she was experiencing, judging by the way she squirmed while in close proximity to Ai, her nose brushing against her shoulder.* - Fri Nov 20 03:35:02 2015
