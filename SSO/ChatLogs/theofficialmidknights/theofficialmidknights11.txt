<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... - Wed Sep 23 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Violet. Let's go train. - Wed Sep 23 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Sure.. - Wed Sep 23 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) skid her left leg behind her, arching it slightly. She'd press the sole of her right foot to the gravel below her feet, adding a small bounce to her stancing. The girl would rush to Violet's side, picking the female up. She'd bend her knees and release a great leap, landing upon the tip of the wooden roof to the expansious mansion. She wouldn't stop there, as she quickly bound from the third rooftop to the middle, then leaped down and accelerated to the waterfall.* - Wed Sep 23 22:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) placed Violet on the ground, taking a brief, rather far leap back. The bounce to her movement, as though she was always on her heels and ready to move, didn't waver one bit. "Hold on.. this wouldn't be fair, since I'm wearing all my armor, right..?" Setsuna'd state, removing her mask, in addition to her arm guards and chestplate. She'd keep on the chainmail that was handed out to most Kirigakure shinobi a month ago.* - Wed Sep 23 22:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Come at me when you want, by the way. - Wed Sep 23 22:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was very lucky that Violet was within her line of sight, otherwise she'd be unable to counter. Setsuna would throw her own hand to the hilt of her blade, wrapping her fingers around it's perimeter. She'd brace herself, arching her torso forth as Violet approached. She'd pin the soles of her feet to the ground briefly, before dashing off of her left foot toward Violet, aiming to slash diagonally to her own upper left, aiming to block the attack with the blade of her tantou.

Naturally, she was using the blunt, duller edge of the weaponry.* - Wed Sep 23 23:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) got rekt.

"I surrender!" She'd state, chuckling and rubbing the back of her head if she had the opportunity.

"Sorry... but it's clear that I need to patch up on my swordsmanship, and hand to hand combat. Let's hold off this spar, for now."* - Wed Sep 23 23:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled.

"Wow.. "* - Wed Sep 23 23:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Are you ok love? - Wed Sep 23 23:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Of course. - Wed Sep 23 23:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Well... glad I forfeited.. - Wed Sep 23 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Why? - Wed Sep 23 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Because that would've hurt. - Wed Sep 23 23:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Not that bad - Wed Sep 23 23:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) hugged against Violet.

"Let's sleep here tonight. Even if it's in a tree or something. I've been cold for the last few nights without you..~"* - Wed Sep 23 23:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was too tired to move in general. She'd simply drift off.* - Thu Sep 24 00:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) lazed off within her comfy apartment. She'd form the Clone handsign, manifesting a shadow clone that'd do her daily duties. Said clone would position itself within the rather broad, gravel-grounded village square. The blondette's clone leaned against the vending machine, it's hands tucked in it's pockets.* - Thu Sep 24 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sinks underground, traveling in such a manner.* - Thu Sep 24 22:20:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I have not..Except once in central the night before. - Thu Sep 24 22:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So...What brings you all to this very specific spot? - Thu Sep 24 22:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Thought someone could point me to Koeki. - Thu Sep 24 22:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm going to do a quick pass to see if I can find her. - Thu Sep 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Right, But I think you're best off going now Himura and leaving a letter...Though its Been a while since I saw you, Sabo.. - Thu Sep 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Right. - Thu Sep 24 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I can't Fuji, I'd rather not just run off. - Thu Sep 24 22:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Ah, I see. - Thu Sep 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Sunagakure does a horrible job at recovery, just so that you know. - Thu Sep 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: What?... What's up with Suna ? - Thu Sep 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Some guy named Edge apparently is oppressing it? - Thu Sep 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: You guys took forever to recover Amu. - Thu Sep 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Is Edge still ruling it? - Thu Sep 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: And most likely. - Thu Sep 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: If you're all here. - Thu Sep 24 22:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm planning on passing by there soon. - Thu Sep 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I've only met Amu once...When I became a Genin, I've only heard of Amu. - Thu Sep 24 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's a ghost town. - Thu Sep 24 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: You could probably slip in, but who knows if you'll get out alive. - Thu Sep 24 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: And how they needed to recover her. - Thu Sep 24 22:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: How is Amegakure doing? - Thu Sep 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, the reason most of Suna merged with Kiri was simply because of the number of loyalty diminishing. - Thu Sep 24 22:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly emerged from below the sruface of the ground. She'd remove the chakra cloaking her frame, save for the chakra at the soles of her feet. The girl would climb the earthen wall with great expertise, hanging upsidedown off the edge of the wall with the top of her feet pressed firmly to said edge. The soles of the blondette's feet pointed upward.* - Thu Sep 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Kill that percentile then. - Thu Sep 24 22:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It's not as easy as said. - Thu Sep 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Along with that 80% were a number of more than 2000 bandits. - Thu Sep 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Easy. - Thu Sep 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: How is that easy?? - Thu Sep 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Bandits are pretty stupid. They're not as fit as us shinobi. - Thu Sep 24 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: A good plan can go a long way. - Thu Sep 24 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Smaller numbers doesn't make things hard. - Thu Sep 24 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: And considering the skillsets I've seen while I've been here, it's definetly no problem. - Thu Sep 24 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Interesting. - Thu Sep 24 22:41:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I've also identified the fact that, with a preoccupied commander, troops are pretty much like children. - Thu Sep 24 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Maybe i'll check Suna out then. - Thu Sep 24 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) folded her arms over her chest, pressing her left wrist to her upper right's. The young shinobi would begin to lurch her torso forth, performing relatively quick situps. Her overall momentum was impressive, mostly because she was naturally quick on her feet. Setsuna continued to perform the rapid situps. She'd restart the count that she was mentally stating in her head whenever her knees bent, even if it was barely.* - Thu Sep 24 22:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Right. - Thu Sep 24 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: I believe he's set us on two different pathways to learn from him. - Thu Sep 24 22:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If it's her teacher's skill. - Thu Sep 24 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I doubt she'd want to share it. - Thu Sep 24 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: But I did imply that Kenshin is my teacher as well. - Thu Sep 24 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: As I said. - Thu Sep 24 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: He put us on two different paths. - Thu Sep 24 22:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well, I might as well train. - Fri Sep 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) proceeded to open the rolled up scroll. Her pair of pinkish-purple orbs would glide over the text written in the scroll. The blondette, as a relatively fast learner, would absorb the information provided like a sponge. Once getting a relatively accurate interpretation of the technique down, she'd clasp her hands together, building up chakra and kneading it into flames. She'd release said flames in the form of a small stream. Emphasis on small, she was still attempting to learn.

Setsuna would huff in what seemed to be impatience. None the less, the girl would pull out several strings. She'd hook them to the hilt of her kunai knives, throwing a trio of said weapons toward a nearby weapon. The kunai knives ricocheted off one another, curving around the perimeter of the rock and constricting it with the wires attached. She'd clench the wiring between her teeth, emitting an emanating, orange flame from her maw. The flames ran down the wiring, immersing the rock in a great burst of fire.* - Fri Sep 25 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oi sanoke. - Fri Sep 25 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) pulled out what seemed to be an immense amount of shuriken. She'd fling the shuriken down toward a nearby tree, each having a wire attached. She'd manipulate the wires utilizing generic hand movements, one of which would be tucked between her teeth. With finesse to the manner that she manifested the wiring's motion, they'd constrict themselves around the trunk of the tree.

With a rather minor amount of chakra expelled from her maw in the form of flames, an impressive stream of flames coursed from her maw, engulfing the tree in flames. The girl would go through three handsigns, releasing a high-volume stream of water from her mouth and putting out the rather weak flames. She'd shift her head back, looking toward Mitsuru, her eyes narrowing slightly.

The blondette would loosely clasp the hilt of a kunai within her backpouch, whipping it up into the air. She'd catch it with a firm grip, then press her left palm to the top of the kunai knife's blade. She'd slowly process a relatively decent volume of chakra to her palm, attempting to emit the perimeter of the kunai knife's blade in chakra, then proceed to knead it into flames.

With minor error, she'd emit the kunai knife in Doton-based chakra, causing it to inherit what seemed to be a dull brown shine. Still not demoralized by her failures she'd make another attempt at doing what Mitsuru had previewed. The pinkish-purple eye'd female would press her hand firmly to the blade, immersing it in chakra. Said chakra would knead into flames, causing an aura of fire to flow around the blade of the kunai.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled lightly. She'd shift her pinkish purple-gaze toward Mitsuru, gearing her stare away from the male and simply looking forward. She'd remove a small scroll from her backpouch, recalling that it had been given to her earlier. She'd proceed to open said scroll, reading the information that it inhabitted. The blonde haired girl would try to interpret the information as much as possible.

Due to her inept-level of Katon experience, it was slightly hard. None the less, with her refined learning capabilities she easily understood. The girl would form six handsigns in what seemed to be a slight blur, concentrating an immense amount of chakra reserves in her throat. She'd knead said chakra, releasing it in a form of a small sphere of blazing flames.* - Fri Sep 25 03:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded slightly at Mitsuru's words. The female would proceed to form half a dozen handsigns in one go. She'd manifest her chakra into flames, releasing said flames in what seemed to be a relatively bigger fireball than the one that she initially produced. It seemed that her understanding of the Fireball Jutsu was increasing exponentially.* - Fri Sep 25 04:05:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Clone handsign, producing two shadow clones from their own individual plumes of smoke. One shadow clone would form six handsigns, and the other would form three. Her first shadow clone released a seemingly medium-sized fireball from it's mouth. The other shadow clone would fire a massive wave of wind in front of the other clone's fireball, conjuring an enormous inferno of Katon.* - Fri Sep 25 04:10:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Good point. But I already know that it seems. - Fri Sep 25 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) grumbled in what seemed to be mild irritation. She was still incapable of utilizing the technique to it's maximum degree of strength. One more, one of her shadow clones would form a trio of handsigns, then awaited for the other as it formed six handsigns. The second shadow clone would fire a massive, blazing projectile of flames in the shape of an immense sphere. The first shadow clone released an enormous wave of wind, resulting in a combustion of flames within the area in front of her.* - Fri Sep 25 04:13:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) disperses the shadow clone that was within the square, relaying all information that the shadow clone inherited during the day to Setsuna herself. She of course, would be lazing off in her house.* - Fri Sep 25 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed half a dozen seals then proceeded to knead chakra within her. After kneading the chakra into flames, she'd release them in the form of an immense, orange projectile shaped into a giant fireball. The ball of flames would combust against the surface of the water fall, bringing about an enormous detonation of fire. Upon collision with the water source, the fire would easily produce a thick fog in the vicinity.

Setsuna wasn't done yet, because she removed a kunai knife from the confines of her backpouch, engulfing it's blade in an emanating, flaming aura. The girl would slide her left leg back slightly, adding a small bounce to her stancing. The blondette immersed her soles in a levelled, sufficient amount of chakra. She'd sprint forth rather eagerly into the mist, moving very quickly. The girl would emerge from the mist at the top of the waterfall, slashing downward with the kunai knife, a trail of orange following the very quick attack.

The Otome family member would continue slashing about at the air in front of her, bringing an enslaught of harsh cuts. With a spin on the heel of her right foot and a lifting of her left she'd whip the kunai to the left. She reverted to her normal stancing, exhaling slightly.* - Fri Sep 25 12:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed a total of six handsigns. The girl would lurch her head forth, releasing an immense, rather large, blazing projectile at the area in front of her. She'd quickly form three more handsigns, releasing a colossal wave of wind which empowered the fire, basically proving an "inferno" to be an understatement of the total destruction that she caused. The fire ultimately imploded, causing the lake in front of her to rise up as though Flexus thrashed into it from thirty feet up using his Expansion Jutsu.

The girl would exhale a stream of flames from her maw while the water was still descending from it's unexpected, unintended ascension, caused by her usage of Katon and Fuuton in two. The girl would form the Clone handsign after a long period of time of recovering from the chakra that she used up. Three shadow clones emerged from plumes of smoke near her frame. One would remove a total of seven shurikens, immersing them in their own individual auras of fire. The shadow clone would throw the flaming shurikens forward, while another utilized Fuuton-based chakra to manipulate the shurikens to a sufficient degree, as well as empower the fire.

As the flaming shurikens hit the tree and set the closeby area of the trunk that they punctured ablaze, the last shadow clone of Setsuna would whip forth two kunai knives, manipulating the wiring attached to their ends with such a degree that she easily allowed the kunai to ricochet off one another, sending them off course. Naturally, she had intended that, because each stabbed into a nearby tree diagonal to the one burning.

Setsuna and her trio of shadow clones would form six familiar handsigns, surging the chakra within them. They gathered chakra within their throats and puffed their chests out, pushing their torso forth and arching their heads back. Their cheeks puffed up as they kneaded the rather large amount of chakra into flames. All four of the Setsuna's, one being the blondette herself, would release an enormous, blazing fireball, a result of the jutsu having four times as much chakra concentrated.

Upon contact with the tree, the immense blast combusted into an inferno of fire. Setsuna formed three more handsigns, releasing a high-volume wave of gusting wind from her mouth, which would effectively empower the flames to a degree that made it difficult for Suiton to battle. Setsuna dropped to her knees, breathing heavily. It was clear that she was greatly exhausted.

With some of her remaining chakra she would spawn a shadow clone that would take care of her daily duties. Meanwhile, she would be resting back at home.* - Fri Sep 25 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly glided her left foot across the water, positioning her left leg behind her right. She added a slight bounce to her stancing, gripping her bokken within both of her hands. The blondette would rush forth eagerly, intending to train even though she was a shadow clone. The clone would relay the information to Setsuna later on, but for now it was going to get as much training done as possible. The blonde assaulted the vicinity in front of her with rapid slashes, not letting up. Unexpectedly, Setsuna would leap back, performing a quick spin in midair then landing on her soles.* - Fri Sep 25 16:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) huffed lightly, slightly tired out from the manner in which she was striking the air. She'd rush forth once more, her pair of pinkish-purple orbs setting themselves upon the area in front of her. She'd extend both of her arms out in a rushing movement, holding the bokken slightly. In a stabbing motion she struck the air. Due to the manner in which she stood, she easily leaped back, as though she was evading an invisible attack. She seemed to be getting better at wielding a bokken, but soon she'd have to train with a katana.* - Fri Sep 25 16:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) bent her knees slightly, adding a small bounce to her stancing. She'd push her left leg behind her right, bracing herself as she paid close attention to Lera. The blondette would lean forth. Suddenly, Setsuna would shoot forth, leaving dust behind her as she'd vanish from Lera's visage, closing the distance between herself and her opponent in a matter of seconds.

The blonde would only reappear when she was directly in front of Lera in a running position, before vanishing in a flicker of movement once more.* - Sat Sep 26 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was suffering from tunnel vision, even in the midst of her intense momentum. She'd press her soles against the ground below, taking a massive leap into the air above. The blonde formed two handsigns, before spewing a rather thick, translucent, water-like goo from her maw down at Lera, attempting to cloak her in the movement-halting mass that'd solidify with contact to the ground.* - Sat Sep 26 08:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) watched as the gooey, syrup like substance pressed itself against the earthen dome that formed around Lera. Setsuna would land on the ground, practically remaining on the tip of her toes. The small bounce to her stance didn't falter. The girl would form the Clone handsign, producing two shadow clones from a plume of smoke on each side of her frame.* - Sat Sep 26 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) applied a thin layer of chakra to her own frame, sinking into the ground below and traversing within it at a high speed, attempting to emerge behind Lera and firmly clasp the female's right ankle with her right hand.

//Shadow Clone One\\ would form six handsigns in what seemed to be a breeze of hand movement, firing an immense fireball toward the earthen dome around Lera.

//Shadow Clone Two\\ would form three handsigns, reinforcing the flames being fired at Lera with an intense gust of wind capable of knocking down anything in it's path.* - Sat Sep 26 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) dispersed her two shadow clones after they finished firing the C-Rank combination of Katon and Fuuton. Setsuna herself would find that one of Lera's shadow clones intended to block her from getting to Lera. The blondette would arise out of the ground, disregarding the immense destruction of a majority of the dome destroyed by her clones'combination jutsu.* - Sat Sep 26 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to dive underground, only to be inflicted by the wave of electricity used by Lera's shadow clone. The blonde would try to distance herself as much as possible before she could be inflicted too much by the Raiton-based chakra. 
She'd remain underground, only because she was well aware of the massive amount of destruction that the combination of Katon and Fuuton that her shadow clone's caused. Her body had been mildly afflicted by the Raiton chakra, her frame shuddering underground. She was sure an inferno of flames coursed itself through the vicinity around the partially destroyed earthen dome.* - Sat Sep 26 08:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled, moving forth in a saunter. She'd produce the Clone handsign, instructing her shadow clone to simply stand there. The blondette would slowly add a small bounce to her stancing, sliding her left leg behind her right. She set her pair of pinkish-purple orbs upon the shadow clone in front of her.

"This is the speed I'm talking about..." She'd utter, suddenly vanishing in a flicker of movement. She'd gyrate around her shadow clone's frame, only appearing when she threw an extremely quick punch. From the distance that her attacks were from, she was clearly purposely not attacking her shadow clone. Suddenly, she'd appear at her shadow clone's right, her right arm extending forth at a speed that was -very- close to her movement. Her knees were bent near her chest, her soles appearing to not be making contact with the ground.

Her arm blazed forth completely, her balled up fist thrashing against her shadow clone's cheek, sending it corkscrewing a considerable distance before disappearing in a plume of smoke.* - Sat Sep 26 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: So... I'm wondering. Is that fast? - Sat Sep 26 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: The damage from that punch could've been better. If I get stronger physically, maybe near Koeki's level of physical power, this'll be very effective... - Sat Sep 26 09:50:56 2015
