<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I'm afraid of betrayal... because I've already been betrayed before. - Sat Sep 12 01:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I.. I seeked out love because.. I w.. wanted to find someone I.. I could trust.. s.. someone that wouldn't betray me... someone who wouldn't tear my heart apart... - Sat Sep 12 01:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I-is that all? - Sat Sep 12 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Is that the reason you hurt yourself? Is that the reason you  love me? To cover your pain? - Sat Sep 12 01:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: N.. no... I.. I... - Sat Sep 12 01:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was unable to continue her sentence. Tears welled up in her eyes as she whimpered, sniffling as the tears rolled down her pale cheeks. She suddenly gave up on trying to speak, throwing herself into Violet's chest and bawling. Her cries were filled with sorrow, sadness, and years of pain, built up and hidden by the shell around her heart. Somewhere between her muffled, broken-hearted shrieks she'd manage a coherrent response.

"N... No..! I.. I tr.. truly love y.. yo.. you.. I.. I ac.. act like a rude... indecent.... asshole bec.. because I.. try to hide my pain.. b.. behind an emotionless shell... t.. that  emotionless sh.. shell is meant to be my body.. b.. but... it didn't work..

I.. t.. truly... truly.. l.. lo... l... love you.. " Her intense sobs would start again.* - Sat Sep 12 01:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: .. Th.. there's no word.. t.. to describe h.. how much I l.. love you.. - Sat Sep 12 01:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: B.. But I get afraid.. t.. that someone'll.. tr.. try to do what t.. they did to me.. t.. to you.. t.. that's why I don't trust men... I.. I fear their intentions... I.. always feel like they.. the.. they want to harm me or you... - Sat Sep 12 01:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to stay clutched to Violet, as she was desperate for physical affection right now. The female's emotional state was absolutely terrible. Her pinkish-purple orbs had a glint of surprise to them. "..I.. l.. love y.. you too..." She'd say, her voice disoriented from her previous sobs. She'd weakly coil her arms around Violet, her heart filling with delight as Violet kissed her.

"I.. I'll try.... I.. I really will..." The white haired girl would say. Patches of her hair featured it's original color, blonde with a hint of pink to the edges of it's spanning length. She'd tightly hold onto Violet, attempting to drift off within her secure hold. Her emotional breakdown had torn that defensive shell around her heart to pieces, and fatigue'd her.* - Sat Sep 12 01:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Rest now... I will stay by your side... - Sat Sep 12 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) buried her head in Violet's chest, securely wrapping her arms around the female. She muffled a "I'll do my best", before drifting off into slumber.* - Sat Sep 12 02:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Ken... <ignores them still fighting> - Sat Sep 12 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: Oh. Yeah? - Sat Sep 12 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Are you free tomorrow? I would gladly take you up on that training - Sat Sep 12 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Good, im looking forward to it - Sat Sep 12 02:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: Mhm. - Sat Sep 12 02:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: Hey. - Sat Sep 12 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) awoke from her slumber, still curled up against Violet's body. She lifted her head from Violet's chest briefly. She clearly intended to do something, but out of sleepiness she simply planted her head against the brunette haired female's chest again, drifting off.* - Sat Sep 12 12:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hn... - Sat Sep 12 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: (let's do it like they do on the discovery channel-) - Sat Sep 12 13:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Anyone here got raiton? - Sat Sep 12 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Oh, could you teach it to me? - Sat Sep 12 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Cool. - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Cum Bucket(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hn..... - Sat Sep 12 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 14:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: .. - Sat Sep 12 14:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Kinda bored.. - Sat Sep 12 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Time to train. - Sat Sep 12 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) seemed to have changed, attitude wise. She flinched when Lera noticed her. Her pair of pinkish-purple irises peered at the female's frame from head to toe. Her body looked more brittle. All of her false confidence and 'tough' exterior had crumbled due to past events.

"Oh... hey.." She uttered. Her voice was timid, jittery and anxious. Setsuna seemed pretty helpless without Violet around. She always had been, but her false toughness concealed it. She was still trying to figure out how she used to act eight years ago, but relying on such distant events brought recurring failure.

Though, her timidness wasn't as bad as it could be. She trusted Lera, and held no negative emotions toward the girl, mainly because she had noticed that the female was friends with Violet. Not only that, but Lera was a girl, and she wasn't wary of females, like she was with males.* - Sat Sep 12 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) gazed in the direction opposite of Lera. Her hand was coiled around her left forearm.

"I'm fine.." She'd murmur briefly. Her voice was low, and barely audible. Her presence was full of gloom, and dread. Her eyes wouldn't drift away from the grund to her left.* - Sat Sep 12 14:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Welp, I'm not so good at this kind of stuff. But even I can tell your not feeling okay. - Sat Sep 12 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I can't substitute for violet...but uh...do you want a hug? - Sat Sep 12 14:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: H..Huh..? Y..You don't have to... - Sat Sep 12 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Why am I stuttering..? Where's all my confidence gone? - Sat Sep 12 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nonsense~ - Sat Sep 12 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: We're friends right? - Sat Sep 12 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Friends help each other. - Sat Sep 12 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: B..But.. I can handle this... it's... it's okay.. - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I really can't.. - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Oh come here silly. - Sat Sep 12 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I know I'm small...but she so tiny~ - Sat Sep 12 14:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) didn't notice what Lera was doing until she had done it. Setsuna whimpered slightly, burrowing her head in Lera's chest. There were many things that she was contemplating, and just about everything in life was stressing her. She was trying to keep social interaction to a minimum, because she was afraid that she'd say the wrong thing like she has many times. Only this time, she'd actually care about the outcome of such.* - Sat Sep 12 14:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) clenched her teeth, slamming her eyes shut and attempting to restrain herself from crying. She thoughtlessly wrapped her arms around Lera's upper back. Her whimpers of self-restraint continue'd to resonate. Luckily, because of this she was restraining herself from bawling right there. She untensed her muscles slightly, her small sounds of discontent and anxiousness coming to a pause, slowly calming as Lera's voice graced Setsuna's ears.* - Sat Sep 12 14:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) murmured a barely coherrent response, mainly because tears were starting to drip from her cheeks.

"Y..You and Violet are the only people that care... I.. I.. I'm not regarded by anyone else.. I.. I don't know what to do.. I d.. don't know how to handle this.." She said, a low sob cutting her off after she admited her inability to deal with her emotional struggles.* - Sat Sep 12 14:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Bah, Ignore the neysayers. You're strong, you're nice and you an awesome friend~ Just remember, if you ever need a shoulder to lean on. You have plenty~ - Sat Sep 12 14:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: B.. But I still need to improve... I.. I still need to get stronger... e.. even if there are people for me to cry to.. I.. I don't want to burden anyone. - Sat Sep 12 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're never a burden. Never tell yourself that. - Sat Sep 12 15:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Friends help each other, thats what we do. - Sat Sep 12 15:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I.. I.. - Sat Sep 12 15:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Shhh. Its okay, just stay for as long as you need to. - Sat Sep 12 15:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) cried softly, unable to stop herself.* - Sat Sep 12 15:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) held onto Lera, he cries becoming more and more faint. Eventually they'd stop altogether, and she'd remain in the female's arms, breathing softly and trying to gain her bearings.* - Sat Sep 12 15:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 15:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: How are you feeling..? - Sat Sep 12 15:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: M.. much better... t.. th.. thanks. - Sat Sep 12 15:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're welcome~ You know you can come to me whenever right? I don't mind. - Sat Sep 12 15:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: O... okay.. - Sat Sep 12 15:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm... sorry for stuttering... I... can't really help it... I'm really anxious...  - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Its okay really. - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You wanna know a secret?  - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: S.. sure.. - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Only a year ago, I could barely speak to people at all. I stuttered so much all the time...hehehe - Sat Sep 12 15:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But ya know. I realised something. - Sat Sep 12 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't care what other people think of me. And neither should you. - Sat Sep 12 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You should just be who you want to be. Right? - Sat Sep 12 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: But.... I don't know who I want to be... all I know is that I wanted to be a medic.. and that I wanted to be really good at swordsmanship and Fuuton.. I don't know why...... I.. I've blocked out most of my past..m.. mostly the happy stuff I'.. I've only been able to block out. - Sat Sep 12 15:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But thats okay. Don't you see. Noone stays the same forever, nor does anyone really every know who they are. - Sat Sep 12 15:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just live the way you want to live, right now. - Sat Sep 12 15:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And take things as they come. - Sat Sep 12 15:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: If someone has a problem with it, then you have Violet and me to back you up~ - Sat Sep 12 15:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: O.. okay.. - Sat Sep 12 15:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hehe, I've got your back~ - Sat Sep 12 15:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) smiled slightly, looking up at Lera.* - Sat Sep 12 15:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You're feeling better then? - Sat Sep 12 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Y..Yeah.. I just need time to figure things out.. - Sat Sep 12 15:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, take all the time you need. I can stay with you for as long as you want. - Sat Sep 12 15:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Well.. c.. can we spar? - Sat Sep 12 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Training'll take my mind.. off things... - Sat Sep 12 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You want to spar..? Hm...okay, sure why not. - Sat Sep 12 15:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded slightly, breaking away from the embrace and wiping the tears from her own face. She would distance herself, still timid as ever. She looked a little more eager to actually do things, though.* - Sat Sep 12 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: You want the first shot? - Sat Sep 12 15:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No? Then I'll go first. - Sat Sep 12 15:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had somewhat akcnowledged that she was facing a Ninjutsu specialist. The girl jumped back some, skidding against the ground. She kept her hand coiled around the hilt of her sheathed tantou, awaiting to see what Lera would do.* - Sat Sep 12 16:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had gazed amongst the clones, making sure that she knew where each of them were, along with Lera. Her pinkish-purple orbs flickered from right to left, before setting themselves upon Lera's. At this point, she'd find herself become caught in a genjutsu. She'd qucikly unsheath her tantou, bifurcating one of the clones, but finding that it immediately was replaced by yet another. The girl would quickly sheath her tantou, leaping back some.

Without a second thought she'd identify this as a genjutsu, and proceed to halt the flow of her chakra, then suddenly surge it. The genjutsu seemed to 'shatter', breaking away from it's hold on her five senses as she prohibited it from proceeding.

"Didn't know you had that up your sleeve.." She'd remark.* - Sat Sep 12 16:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) watched as Lera's earth composed clones began to run at her. Setsuna softened the ground beneath her as she drifted her vision toward Lera herself. The white haired girl submerged herself beneath ground level, intending to play it safe and begin to brainstorm. She understood thast Lera had four, Fuuton-immersed shurikens prepared to attack, along with a couple shadow clones. In addition, Setsuna was aware that Lera had a good distance on her. It was time for the girl to devise a plan.* - Sat Sep 12 16:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) traversed underground, being well aware that Lera would most likely fall. With that being said, she'd emerge from the earth, distancing herself some. With a great leap, reinforced by her Surface Walking technique, she'd scale the tree, standing at the top and looking down at the area, awaiting.* - Sat Sep 12 16:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed a couple of handsigns in a blur of hand dexterity. Shortly after doing such she would spew a gooey wave of translucent, blue fluid from her mouth. The fluid would land on the ground, pressing itself firmly against the surface and solidifying the second it did such. Setsuna would reveal a trio of senbon, one tucked between each of her fingers. She only saw one Lera, meaning that two others were underground. She assumed that it wasn't the real Lera, considering who would really -not- use their clones as decoys.

<Doton is weak against Suiton... I have a chance at this.>* - Sat Sep 12 16:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) leaped back, submerging herself in the tree to evade the projectiles. She then began forming handseals, spewing a pile of mud from her mouth, releasing a total of nine. The piles of mud formed into perfect replicas of her. Five of her clones took her front, while two took her back, and the remaining two each covered her side.* - Sat Sep 12 16:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) engulfed the soles of her feet in a fine veil of chakra, easily staying on the surface of the tree while it found difficulty in standing. Two of the doton-composed clones in front of her formed a trio of handsigns, before both spewed a funnel-shaped stream of highly pressurized water. One was aimed at Lera, while the other was aimed at one of her clones, if not both, if they were in close enough proximity to one another.* - Sat Sep 12 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) instead, the clones conjured a river of mud, attempting to distance Lera's clones by doing such.* - Sat Sep 12 17:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly allowed all of her clones to revert into their mud-based forms. After that, she'd leap out of the tree, turning around and whipping three shuriken toward the mud-composed clone. Setsuna would then form a trio of handsigns, spewing a wave of high pressure water in the shape of a funnel from her mouth.

"Suiton: Mizurappa no Jutsu!"* - Sat Sep 12 17:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) quickly formed the Ram handsign upon noticing Lera's performance. A thick veil of mist concealed her as she traversed at a boosted momentum. A thick veil of mist would reappear where she'd moved to, having distanced herself from the location of the Raiton and moved off to the right. Her pinkish-purple eyes gazed at Lera as she awaited for the female's next move, seemingly tired out, stamina wise.* - Sat Sep 12 17:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had used at least a fifth of her chakra within that fight.

"You're really good at Doton and Fuuton. I didn't know you had Raiton, either." Setsuna said, a small smile plastered to her features.* - Sat Sep 12 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Mhm, I practice Doton and Fuuton the most; though I know Katon and that Raiton as well. - Sat Sep 12 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Ah? You should teach Violet how to use Raiton. She's been wanting to learn it.. - Sat Sep 12 17:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I would, but I'm not really very skilled with it. We both know another genin who's good with it though. - Sat Sep 12 17:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Yeah.. that guy. I don't trust him though... it's just because he's a male and well..I've had problems with them in the past... - Sat Sep 12 17:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) observed the girl in silence. The technique she displayed was incredible. It would come in handy for plenty of situations. Therefore, the white haired girl had made her decision. Setsuna would proceed to attempt to form the seal that the girl performed, then proceed to evenly distribute her chakra. A plume of smoke would emerge at her side, but a shadow clone didn't appear with it.

She furrowed her brow, noticing that she had formed the Clone handseal wrong. Setsuna would proceed to form the Clone handseal once more, evenly distributing her chakra with relative ease. From a plume of smoke emerged a shadow clone. Herself and her shadow clone rested a hand on one of their hips, exhaling nonchalantly.

Both spoke.

"Did I do it right?"* - Sun Sep 13 02:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) observed what Violet had done. Setsuna slowly unsheathed her tantou, closing her eyes and clenching the hilt of her blade tightly with both of her hands. She'd slowly begin to flow an immense amount of chakra throguhout that of the blade. She opened up her eyes, groaning when she found that her tantou wasn't shrouded in Doton-based chakra.

Once more, the female proceeded to concentrate charka into that of her tanotu. After flowing the chakra, she kneaded it into earth. By doing such, the tantou was reinforced in terms of defense. The blade of her tantou had a brown glint to it by now. "Huh..." Setsuna would say, swinging the tantou and finding there was no change in it's weight. She halted the flow of chakra, sheathing her weaponry.

"Interesting."* - Sun Sep 13 03:13:29 2015
