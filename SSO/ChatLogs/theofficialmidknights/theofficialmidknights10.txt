<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) approached Violet, attempting to clasp the female's hands and smile.

"Sorry I ran off. I felt like I was needed. Medic's instinct."* - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Sure... - Mon Sep 21 19:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to lead the way, holding one of Violet's hands.* - Mon Sep 21 19:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Actually, how about we head to my house instead? You're obviously tired. - Mon Sep 21 19:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: By the way.. this is a shadow clone. I'm still at hmoe. - Mon Sep 21 19:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ...Sure... - Mon Sep 21 19:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) took a short walk since her resident was close in the area. The shadow clone would disperse, as the actual Setsuna opened up the front door, leading Violet into her home. Her apartment was quite simple, with artwork accentuating the traditional japanese home's design here and there. She'd lead Violet to the kotatsu, seating herself across from the female.

"You should've seen how Zetsumo died. Kenshin caved in his chest with a single kick to the back. Koeki almost died though.. that strange chakra that she has released and healed most of her wounds. I left Kumo so I could meet up with my clone while it was carrying Koeki out of the battle. That was around the time that Zetsumo died. I used up so much chakra that I was out cold in the hospital for two days, hehe.." The girl would state.

The blondette was wearing a simple pair of black pants and a black, spacey short sleeve. It appeared that she still possessed stunning beauty even without makeup on. The girl approached the door, speaking to Violet as she locked it to make sure no one would come into her house invited.

"So, are you hungry, or just tired..?" She'd question.* - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) clasped her hands together at the kotatsu, folding her legs beneath the table. She'd frown slightly and grow demoralized when Violet scolded her about not being careful with her chakra. The girl lit up when Violet mentioned the good part, the fact that Zetsumo was dead, Noriko was safe, and that Kiri was rebuilding.

"Yeah." She'd state, a bright smile printed upon her features. The blondette stood to her feet, sliding one of the japanese-stylized doors open to the left, proceeding to roam throughout the room. She turned on the light, making it easy to identify that the room in specific was the kitchen to Setsuna's home. She took out various ingredients to ramen.

Opposed to cooking the ramen cups within the cabinets of her kitchen, along with the rest of other strange ingredients and what not, the girl began to chop up vegetables. From a plume of smoke would emerge a shadow clone. Herself and the shadow clone worked to start making homemade ramen for Violet. "It shouldn't take too long, look around if you want. Make yourself at home." The girl would call out to her romantic companion.

She'd continue working with the ingredients at her disposal, putting her cooking skills to the test.* - Mon Sep 21 19:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exited the kitchen after quite some time, holding a bowl of steaming ramen, as well as fried vegetables and other ingredients. She'd place the bowl down in front of Violet. Setsuna seemed to have put lots of effort into making the meal for the female. She'd hand the female a pair of wooden chopsticks, then proceed to remove the apron she was wearing, dispersing her shadow clone as well.

The girl would leave the kitchen once more, carrying her own bowl of ramen. She'd seat herself across from Violet, making small chit-chat. "How was it, being around Mitsuru all that time?" The blondette would ask, proceeding to slurp up noodles.* - Mon Sep 21 20:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sighed, finding that Violet had fallen asleep. The blonde simply ate her own portion of the meal, refridgerating Violet's. Setsuna would approach the female, picking her up with quite the difficulty. Setsuna would tuck Violet into her own bed, laying down beside the female and coiling her arms around her from behind, her leg folded over Violet's.

She'd press her head to Violet's back, falling asleep in close proximity to the female, both of them covered by two thick blankets.* - Mon Sep 21 20:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: 9 - Mon Sep 21 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) woke up to the absence of Violet's frame warming her body. She moaned in mild disappointment, but that was only if the female distanced herself from Setsuna.* - Mon Sep 21 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) buried her head between Violet's neck and shoulder, her soft breathes running down the side of the female's neck. She'd coil her arms around the female affectionately, hugging firmly against her girlfriend. Heat ran to her cheeks as she passionately tilted her head, pressing her lips to Violet's neck.* - Mon Sep 21 22:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) closed the distance between the two of them. She'd continue kissing Violet's neck, drifting upward to the female's ear and whispering into it, her soft breathes tickling her girlfriend's ear. "I love you so much.." She'd utter, nibbling on the ear lobe of the female in a romantic manner. She'd slowly drift her head from beside Violet's, looking into the female's eyes with her own pair of pinkish purple ones.

The blonde would lurch forth, pressing her soft, plump pair of lips to Violet's.* - Mon Sep 21 23:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) pulled away momentarily. She'd remove her pants, and shirt, slipping back into the bed and hugging up against Violet. It appeared she didn't wear underclothing in the comfort of her own home.* - Mon Sep 21 23:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) embraced Violet tightly, the blonde's bare body comfortably wrapping around her. Setsuna would drift off into slumber in what seemed like moments, snoring lightly.* - Tue Sep 22 00:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: G'night... Violet... - Tue Sep 22 00:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: He is handling all of his learning since a friend of that kids father asked him to limit his studies or something. - Wed Sep 23 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... - Wed Sep 23 16:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: My guess is that he is taking the scrolls and learning them first. - Wed Sep 23 16:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Well.. I am his only blood relative left. I would say he can just continue his studies like he used to do. - Wed Sep 23 16:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded. The blondette would manifest several wires utilizing her chakra, allowing them to constrict the tree nearby.

"Try doing that." She'd state, tugging on the wires and rolling them back up, placing them within her backpouch.* - Wed Sep 23 17:06:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: If I am even allowed to say that. - Wed Sep 23 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Not at the moment. - Wed Sep 23 17:10:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Where are you going? - Wed Sep 23 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Anywhere. - Wed Sep 23 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Most likely Komugakure first. - Wed Sep 23 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Then i'll just work my way around. - Wed Sep 23 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Kenshin said the Kumogakure mountains are very good for taking strolls. - Wed Sep 23 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: They are very nice mountains. - Wed Sep 23 17:14:01 2015

"Yeah." She'd state simply in response to Kirie.* - Wed Sep 23 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..Good. - Wed Sep 23 17:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Well take as long as you feel is needed. - Wed Sep 23 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's mostly for training and research. - Wed Sep 23 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Then take as much time as you need. - Wed Sep 23 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: If you want to train then take your time. - Wed Sep 23 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I can't unfortunately, I have to have a set time period of leave. - Wed Sep 23 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Which is why i'm trying to find Koeki so I can have my form back. - Wed Sep 23 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Ah. - Wed Sep 23 17:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll try, I didn't really want to go through this process honestly. - Wed Sep 23 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) looked down upon the female.* - Wed Sep 23 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I wanted to keep it secret but then this whole form thing came along. - Wed Sep 23 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: You can always just walk out and say that you were sick or something. - Wed Sep 23 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Didn't you say you'd teach me some stuff? - Wed Sep 23 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I could but I respect the Mizukage too much to do that. - Wed Sep 23 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Why's everyone a Jutsu collector in this village..? - Wed Sep 23 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: If you don't remember uhm..We can spar to? - Wed Sep 23 17:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm not really too worried about my leaving being secret or not, I'm just worried about visiting other villages. - Wed Sep 23 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Indeed but, I'll just have to make the most of it. - Wed Sep 23 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Considering that Kiri is allied with most of the villages I'd say have nothing to worry about - Wed Sep 23 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well, We're only allied to Kumo now really. - Wed Sep 23 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I intend to visit some less than friendly villages. - Wed Sep 23 17:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Well good luck. - Wed Sep 23 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Spar with me, in that case. - Wed Sep 23 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'll need it. - Wed Sep 23 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Let's go. - Wed Sep 23 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: But hopefully by the end of this, I won't need luck anymore. - Wed Sep 23 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Wed Sep 23 17:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) performed a quick leap backward, awaiting for Kohaku's move. A thin veil of chakra overlapped the soles of her booted footing to prevent the effect of any movement-binding techniques impairing her fighting efficiency.* - Wed Sep 23 17:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Thanks...Kirie. - Wed Sep 23 17:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) simply bent her knees by some, before racing to Kohaku's right, sprinting behind her and throwing a quick right-legged sidekick.* - Wed Sep 23 17:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: . .. Uh. Are they sparring in a place like this? - Wed Sep 23 17:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Clone handsign the moment she noticed the female weaving handsigns. Twelve shadow clones would emerge, eight of which would form three handsigns. The other four scattered, two of them going to the left and two of them going to the right. The blondette would quickly bound off the earth, landing atop the wall rather quickly.

The eight shadow clones that formed a trio of seals released a rather thin, highly-compressed, immense volume of water from their mouths, attempting to effectively diminish the small fireballs, if not completely overpower them.* - Wed Sep 23 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) 
//One of the waves of water would be aimed at Kohaku.* - Wed Sep 23 17:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9smh - Wed Sep 23 17:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) dispersed nine of her dozen clones. From left and right, two of the remaining shadow clones would perform a couple seals, firing a rather thick, gooey, translucent blue wave down toward Kohaku, attempting to bind her movement. The one remaining shadow clone would quickly attempt to evade the fireball by moving to the right, proceeding to form several handsigns and release an immense wave of Fuuton at Kohaku. Small particles of wind within the jutsu would threaten to slash at her skin, though they'd most likely inflict just flesh wounds.

Setsuna herself would leap downward, seeping into the gravel below.* - Wed Sep 23 18:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) would emerge from underground, uppercutting Kohaku before she could fall.* - Wed Sep 23 18:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) seeped from underground. The trio of shadow clones would form the seal that manifested them, causing them to dematerialize in plumes of smoke. Setsuna would approach Kohaku, forming handsigns then pressing her hand to the female's cheeks and repairing the wounds with a fine aura of light blue chakra that'd speed up her cellular healing rate.* - Wed Sep 23 18:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Used half of my chakra... - Wed Sep 23 18:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Dot, dot, dot. - Wed Sep 23 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So. .. How 'bout that Kirigakure, guys? Anythin' been happenin' lately? - Wed Sep 23 18:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Ram handsign, vanishing in a rather thick veil of crimson mist, reappearing in the courtyard.* - Wed Sep 23 18:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Where is the damn hair stylist. - Wed Sep 23 18:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Are they going to battle? - Wed Sep 23 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: D'aw. i thought something cool was gonna happen. - Wed Sep 23 18:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Maybe even a fresh fade. - Wed Sep 23 18:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) was far more relevant than this wet nigga Mizumi.* - Wed Sep 23 18:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yo . .? - Wed Sep 23 18:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) practically blazes toward Kohaku, coming to a stop then proceeding to whisper to the female.* - Wed Sep 23 18:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: You mentioned you were trained by Kenshin. What type of stance were you using to boost your speed? - Wed Sep 23 18:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: It's called the uh..Hit-n-Run style. - Wed Sep 23 18:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Teach me it. - Wed Sep 23 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Why? - Wed Sep 23 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: It's important to my fighting style. - Wed Sep 23 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: But I don't get anything out of it. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Also, Kenshin is my teacher. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I cannot give out his techniques so wildly. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Out of all the jutsus I used in our spar, choose one. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Choose one? - Wed Sep 23 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: To learn? - Wed Sep 23 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Obviously. - Wed Sep 23 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: How did you split yourself up? - Wed Sep 23 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: A jutsu. - Wed Sep 23 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: That one. - Wed Sep 23 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) displayed the Clone handsign. "Use this and concentrate a fraciton of chakra. Then attempt to form a clone, like this." She'd state rather simply, investing a fraction of chakra into a solid clone she made from a plume of smoke.* - Wed Sep 23 18:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Likewise. - Wed Sep 23 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's a B-Rank jutsu. - Wed Sep 23 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 23 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I see. - Wed Sep 23 18:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uhuh. - Wed Sep 23 18:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Now then, show me that stance you were in again.. - Wed Sep 23 18:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I guess I should. - Wed Sep 23 18:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded silently. She'd glide her left leg backward briefly, her right leg remaining in front. She allowed a small bounce to settle upon that of her features, as though she was on her heels without literally doing so. The girl would perform a quick lunge, though it was no different from how fast she could normally navigate. She'd back up beside Kohaku once more.

The blondette would proceed to lurch her torso forth slightly at a very small angle, sliding the sole of her left foot along the ground and kicking up dirt as she arched and pulled her left leg back. Her legs were slightly arched, and her heels lifted from the ground every now and then to help her remain quick on her feet. She'd notice a difference in her movement from the very moment she thrusted forth in a brief sprint.* - Wed Sep 23 18:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Right.. - Wed Sep 23 19:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So. - Wed Sep 23 19:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Uhm. - Wed Sep 23 19:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hm..? - Wed Sep 23 19:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What do you specialize in? - Wed Sep 23 19:31:24 2015
