<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) sat there, wheelchair-less because this was Sunagakure, and laying across the bench in a mix of sadness and the feeling of abandonment. She couldn't navigate on her own, unless she intended to crawl, and that was the last thing she'd do.* - Fri Oct  9 01:57:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) rolled over to the bench, kicking the wheelchair away with her one functioning leg. She'd simply lay sprawled across the bench silently.* - Sat Oct 10 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) rolled away in a wheelchair.* - Sat Oct 10 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) approached Zenaki within a wheelchair. Naturally it was attuned to the terrible environment that this village was asunder. She'd run her golden gaze across Zenaki's features, identifying what a fellow shinobi identified her as; she looked for a crazy look and long white hair. The latter was easier to perceive.

"Are you Zenaki?"* - Sat Oct 10 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: glasgow smile* - Sat Oct 10 18:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) extended her left leg out. Her ankle was dislocated, and her knee was -very- injured. It was practically shattered. She winced when she moved her leg just a little bit. "Fix this... please." She'd state, having swallowed her pride by the end of her statement.* - Sat Oct 10 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I pray that she can fix this, or my shinobi career is over. - Sat Oct 10 18:43:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: My aunt. - Sat Oct 10 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) felt a shiver of pain immerse her body. She'd yelp, her golden, dagger-like stare shifting to Paine. "Can... you not..?" She'd say rather hesitantly, trying not to convert all the pain into rage, because she'd probably scream in Paine's face if she did, regardless of the consequences. Her gaze would soften as she looked toward Zenaki.

"I... figured as much. I'm a medic myself... but I have -no- experience... I was going to learn from Koeki until.... she died.."* - Sat Oct 10 18:48:32 2015

She'd slowly raise her head some, drifting her golden gaze toward the cast coiled around her leg, then at Zenaki. She'd lay back down, looking up at the ceiling while still in a daze from the medicine. Setsuko felt tears near the corner of her eyes. She was ecstatic.

"T..Thank you... so much.." She'd murmur, her voice faltering.* - Sat Oct 10 21:45:10 2015
