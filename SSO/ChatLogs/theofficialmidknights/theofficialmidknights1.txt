<br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) lacked the interest that someone of her level should've had. Instead of attempting what few of their movements that she -could- decipher, the white haired individual remained barely aware of the battle taking place, her eyes gaze never lifting from the small, partially opened scroll in her lap. She leaned against one of the tall posts in front of the mansion, reading whatever seemed to be written within the scroll. Her concentration seemed to be mostly, if not entirely, geared toward said writing.* - Thu Sep 03 18:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) finally lifted her gaze from the scroll within her grasp up to Violet. "Are you okay?" Setsuna questioned, her voice appearing calm and collected, as well as laidback. Her left arm was arched, the corresponding hand pressed to her hip, while her right arm rested at it's own side on her pale figure. Her right hand was clasped firmly around the scroll she was initially reading.

Judging by the casual-looking manner of which she stood, it appeared that she only asked because it went along with her profession.* - Thu Sep 03 19:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) retreated to her original seating. She perched herself against the closest post in front of the mansion. Her gaze drifted over to Baen, eyes remaining half lidded and dull. "She's fine if she said she is." The white haired female remarked in a manner that hinted to mild rudeness.* - Thu Sep 03 19:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled nonchalantly, removing a kunai knife from her back pouch. "I'm so bored that I could cut myself.." She murmured, slowly slitting her wrist like some sort of emo. She casted her blood-covered kunai to the side, pressing her right palm firmly to the wound and proceeding to engulf her hand in a pale green, translucent aura. Her inexperience in Medical Ninjutsu was obvious, because the wound didn't effortlessly heal. Infact, it looked as though such a simple cut would leave a scar.

None the less, she was slowly repairing the self-inflicted damage, using half of the technique's full efficiency.* - Thu Sep 03 19:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) noticeably kept a calm composure with every word she stated, never emphasizing any of them. One could easily see that she was extremely impassive. Even though she wanted to frown when Violet offered up herself, she didn't. Instead she maintained the monotone, emotionless voice she retained throughout the entirety of this time period. Her pair of pinkish purple orbs set themselves upon the writing located within the scroll in her lap, as she read whatever was written intensely. She continued to listen to Violet.

"I guess being loyal to even your fellow shinobi isn't so bad.." Setsuna murmured, slowly closing the scroll after feeling as though she wouldn't faint if she used the Novice Healing technique again. She began to clean off the kunai knife she cut herself with, using a handkerchief.* - Thu Sep 03 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly glided the tip of the kunai across Violet's wrist, ensuring the cut wasn't deep. She had cut the female in a more gentle manner compared to when she was doing it to herself. After doing such, she placed the kunai on the handkerchief resting beside her, proceeding to form several handsigns and engulf both of her hands in a nearly transparent aura of green chakra. She hovered one palm over the wound, then slowly descent her hand, engulfing the girl's slash wound in a green aura of chakra which sped up her body's natural healing process in that corresponding part of her. The white haired female only utilized half of the technique's full output, as she would overexert her chakra otherwise.* - Thu Sep 03 20:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was slightly unsettled by the results of her attempting to heal the female. Despite that, she continued to heal the girl, Within moments of wait she managed to completely heal the wound, leaving no trace of it behind. Setsuna however, was completely exhausted. Her chakra reserves were practically dominated by the drain that the technique had on her. The fact that she went into this field without the necessary chakra reserves, or control, made her contemplate.* - Thu Sep 03 20:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded subtly, coiling her thin, pale fingers around the hilt of the kunai knife once more. "Yeah, I'm far off." The white haired, impassive female remarked, proceeding to slide the sharp edge of the kunai across Violet's wrist. She placed the kunai on the handkerchief beside her once more, beginning to form handseals. She engulfed her right hand in an aura of barely visible green chakra, pressing her palm to the wound, engulfing it in the chakra. The blood that began to slowly seep from the wound clotted, and the ruined skin began to repair itself at an incredibly quick rate of healing.* - Thu Sep 03 20:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was slightly tired with the continous process of cutting her and then proceeding to heal said cut. None the less, the experience was worth it. She was becoming more refined with each moment she utilized the Novice Healing technique. The green chakra engulfing her hand grew slightly, as she was capable of drawing out more chakra now that it didn't mean death if she did such. After some time, she withdrew her hands from the wound while it was partially healed. "Give me a moment.." She said between heavy breathes. The female reapplied the chakra to her hands, pressing both of them to the wound and beginning to heal it. The green aura of chakra ultimately patched up the wound with relative ease.* - Thu Sep 03 20:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 

"I have to confirm somethingf irst." Setsuna remarked. The short female lifted the kunai knife, thrusting it into Violet's wrist and producing a slightly deep wound, making sure she didn't impale anything vital. After doing so, Setsuna placed the blood-drenched kunai on the handkerchief beside her, conjuring a green aura around her right hand after manifesting several handseals. Her thin lips parted after she noticed that the rate that she was healing the girl had increased slightly.* - Thu Sep 03 21:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stopped healing her momentarily, tying the handkerchief around the girl's wrist where the partially healed wound was located at. "Follow me. I have an idea on how to make this easier for you." The white haired individual aid, extending a hand out to the female.* - Thu Sep 03 21:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) seated Violet down at one of the benches, sitting beside her. She applied some pressure to the wound utilizing her thumb, then proceeding to unravel the handkerchief, which was now partially soaked in blood. "I apologize. I wanted to make sure this technique was efficient with stab wounds. It is." She remarked in an emotionless tone, placing her arm beneath Violet's, pressing her right hand against the wound and engulfing it in pale, green chakra, beginning to patch it up.* - Thu Sep 03 21:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) conjured a series of handsigns, manifesting a green aura of chakra around her hand. She pressed her hand to the wound, beginning to repair the torn flesh at an immense rate of healing.* - Thu Sep 03 21:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) cocked a brow when the female smiled at her. She was foreign to having others smile at her, unless they had bad intentions prior to said action. The smile unsettled her because of that, but she didn't show her slight discontent. She continued to flow chakra into the wound, speeding up the natural healing rate of the cells located at the torn flesh using her chakra.* - Thu Sep 03 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) looked off into the distance, remaining impassive as ever.

"How do you tell if you love someone, though?"* - Thu Sep 03 22:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 's voice was as monotone and emotionless as ever, but the faintest blush was on her features.

"Yes."* - Thu Sep 03 22:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) extended her right arm out, pressing one hand to the female's shoulder. "Otome, Setsuna." She'd murmur, before slowly leaning forth, attempting to kiss Violet on the cheek. The faint blush on her face grew darker, but she maintained her laidback tone, save for a stutter here and there.

"I-I guess I'm happy."* - Thu Sep 03 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slid her fingers between Violet's, looking into her eyes with her own. Her voice was a little more lively, and less impassive. It seemed she loosened up when around Violet once figuring out she could trust the female. "It should be fun. I know I'll enjoy it." She said, her face slightly red. "There's still some more torn flesh for me to heal, but for now it shouldn't bleed or drag you down. Let's just enjoy this moment.." Setsuna said, smiling slightly.* - Thu Sep 03 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) lifted a brow when Violet mentioned the path of a samurai. "So you want to get better at kenjutsu? I want to better myself in Medical Ninjutsu." She mentioned, her hands still clasping Violet's. A relaxed grin settled onto Setsuna's features, as she was growing comfortable with showing emotion around Violet.* - Thu Sep 03 23:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) looked down at what seemed to be nothing momentarily. She looked back up at Violet with her relaxed, half-lidded stare. She smiled lightly. "I guess it'd be pretty cool to become a grandmaster at kenjutsu. I'd like to become a master of medical ninjutsu. Or just become better at it. That's my goal, for now." The white haired female elaborated, her gaze never drifitng away from Violet's.* - Thu Sep 03 23:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) //"Don't."

Setsuna would state with mild irony, and harsh toxicity. Though, this was a facade. She leaned in, pressing her lips to Violet's and gliding her hands from clasping Violet's to her back, coiling her arms around the female in the process and guiding her closer. After some time she'd pull from the kiss, gazing at Violet with half-lidded eyes filled with content from the action.

"You didn't think I meant that comment, did you? Of course you can kiss me." She grinned lightly.* - Fri Sep 04 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) urged herself closer to Violet, pressing her form to the female, her hands clasping Violet's. Setsuna pecked her on the lips, then smiled. "I love you." She remarked with evolving meaning behind her words.* - Fri Sep 04 01:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) smiled even birghter than before, her cheeks flushing. She extended her arms out, coiling them around Violet. She pressed her head to the female's chest, flooding her romantic companion with her warmth and affection. It was clear that she desired the close, physical affection that they were exchanging at the very moment. A small exhale of relief escaped her maw as she relaxed while remaining pressed to Violet.* - Fri Sep 04 01:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) climbed atop Violet, laying down atop the female. She coiled her arms around Violet's upper back, allowing herself to be immersed by Violet's warmth. She was extremely relaxed at the moment, the few traces of discomfort emotionally having seemed to fade from her mind. She was put to ease by this close proximity with her lover.* - Fri Sep 04 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shook her head. She lifted her head, her eyes lifting toward the female. As usual she had a cool, half-lidded stare on her facial features. "Yeah.. you're the first person I've been in a relationship with.."* - Fri Sep 04 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded slightly. Her calm manner of voice seemed to be soothing at times that made people around her nervous. "I feel like I can trust you too.." Setsuna said, being fully truthful. She didn't talk so much around people she couldn't trust. Though, when the topic of 'history' came up, that was an offset. Her pinkish-purple orbed gaze drifted to her left.

"I..would not like to talk about my past.." She murmured. She rarely looked at herself in mirrors. The piercings on her skin, which was bleached long ago, both associate with her past. Her flowing, snow white hair did too. The fact that she was impassive, and weirdly silent even had to do with her rough past. It was a topic she got -very- uncomfortable talking about.* - Fri Sep 04 02:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded, smiling lightly. Setsuna was afraid that she would pry information out of her, but luckily she didn't. The white haired female truly felt the love and affection that Violet mentioned resonating off of her. The Otome girl scooted up some, so that she was face to face with Violet. She'd proceed to nuzzle her nose against Violet's in a lazy manner, then snuggle close to the girl, resting her head on her shoulder.

"If people can love us... then we can love eachother.." Setsuna whispered into her ear, tickling her lobe with small breathes.* - Fri Sep 04 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shook her head sluggishly, before submerging it in her shoulder again. She snuggled as close as possible to Violet, before mumbling. "Good..night.." She murmured, attempting to drift off.* - Fri Sep 04 03:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was initially leaning against the wall. She looked toward Violet, extending her own hand out and clasping it. The white haired female stepped forth some, standing beside Violet while having her hand coiled around her romantic companion's.* - Fri Sep 04 13:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to slide her fingers between Violet's, alining her arms with Violet's while they were extended out at their sides, slightly arched. She leaned forth, attempting to press her lips to the female's, a small moan of ecstasy resonating from her throat. She was glad it was just the two of them there.* - Fri Sep 04 14:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) gently pressed onward, so that Violet was pinned to one of the posts in front of the mansion. "I'm feeling fine..~" Setsuna remarked, staring into Violet's eyes. A joyful smile found it's way to her facial features, as she slowly glid her hands up the female's arms, before wrapping her own around said female. Her great deal of affection was displayed through her physical actions.* - Fri Sep 04 15:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) caught a glimpse of the male that had practically appeared out of nowhere. Her half-lidded eyes narrowed toward him. Her gaze relaxed as she looked up at Violet once more. She lurched her head forth once more, nibbling on Violet's bottom lip in a gentle manner. She continued to hug against Violet, though she lightened up on the affectionate actions and display of emotion.* - Fri Sep 04 15:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly slid away from Violet after seeing Tethys exit the mansion wearing the MIzukage robes. She allowed Violet to coil her hand around hers, simply gazing at the male with her normal, relaxed look.* - Fri Sep 04 15:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) pursed her lips slightly. The village personnel had that much of a chaotic response from the common cold? She could understand slightly, because she was the Mizukage afterall, but none the less she wasn't very worried. It wasn't like she was in the first place, either. The girl shifted her half-lidded stare over to Violet.* - Fri Sep 04 16:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) aattempted to coil her arms around Violet and urge her close, while shifting her gaze toward Tethys, lifting a brow when she noticed the tears streaming down from his cheek. "Are you okay, Tethys-sama?"* - Fri Sep 04 16:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was obviously uncomfortable anywhere near Tethys, but she beared with it for Violet's sake.

<This is not the most desirable situation I could find myself in.>* - Fri Sep 04 16:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikami(Bagholic) whispers: This is unfortunate... - Fri Sep 04 16:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) spent this moment in time trying to comfort Violet in low murmurs to her, that were uncharacteristically tender and soothing, or intended to be in that manner. "Everything'll be fine. She'll get better." Setsuna said in a hushed tone, rubbing Violet's back. She attempted to guide Violet off to the side and seat her at one of the benches, proceeding to pull the girl onto her lap and continue to cradle her within her arms.* - Fri Sep 04 16:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Things like this happen. You just have to let them pass. I guarentee the Mizukage'll be fine. Trust me. - Fri Sep 04 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: D-do you really think so? - Fri Sep 04 16:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I know so. - Fri Sep 04 16:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued rubbing the female's back, her chin resting on the female's head. Her arms were securely wrapped around the girl.* - Fri Sep 04 16:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued to cradle the female as she drifted off into slumber, glancing toward Tethys.* - Fri Sep 04 17:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) looked throughout the square.

"Okay... who's Koeki..?" She murmured.* - Fri Sep 04 23:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) blinked with her half-lidded gaze. She shifted said gaze to the blue haired female.

<How'd she hear me? Alright..superhuman strength and superhuman hearing. But what about her ability as a medical ninja? She is the head medic, so what's she doing being more acquainted with traits that'd aid her physically?>

Setsuna stood from the bench, approaching Koeki's front, then proceeding to bow.

"I'm Otome, Setsuna. I hope to become a decent medical ninja. I was referred to you, seeing as you are the head medic of Kirigakure, Koeki, no?" The white haired female retained her characteristically casual, calm and collected personality, though she was speaking to someone she admired greatly, specifically because of her rumored strength, and proficiency in Medical Ninjutsu.* - Fri Sep 04 23:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded slightly. "Indeed, I do wish to undergo your teachings." The white haired female remarked.

<I wouldn't be surprised if she denied my request.> She thought.* - Fri Sep 04 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) drifted her purple-eye'd gaze to Violet, smiling lightly. Setsuna folded her hands within her lap, resting casually.* - Sat Sep 05 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had been seated on the bench for quite some time, her head cocked to the side and her eyes shut. Her mouth was parted slightly, saliva draining from the side of said mouth. Her arms hung at her sides. Her snores were light and barely audible.* - Sat Sep 05 14:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shifted around somewhat within her sleep, inadvertently resting her head upon Violet's shoulder.* - Sat Sep 05 14:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly came to, her half-lidded gaze shifting from left to right when she felt that side of her head had made contact with something. When she got a glimpse of Violet, the female sluggishly slid closer to the female, tucking her left arm beneath Violet's right, pressing the side of her head against the female's shoulder. Setsuna slowly attempted to drift off into slumber once more.* - Sat Sep 05 15:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly came to. The female sluggishly wrapped her arms around Violet, urging herself closer. She embraced Violet closely, resting in close proximity to the female as she awoke.* - Sat Sep 05 16:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) approached Violet's side, shifting her gaze toward Tethys. The female ran her hand through her own head of lengthy silver hair, slowly becoming more acquainted with things now that she wasn't half-asleep.* - Sat Sep 05 23:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) cut her eyes to the side discreetly. Her hands tucked themselves within her pockets. Her actions alone were enough to make it clear what her decision on getting involved in this was. A flat -no-.

<If learning how to sense chakra is a hassle then I'm definitely out of this. Sure it'd be a wonderful ability to have but the effort required for it... ugh..> She immersed herself in deep thoughts, debating how she'd go about this. And if she did decide on not wanting to learn how to sense chakra, she was debating how she could evade the entire situation.* - Sat Sep 05 23:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was immune 2 this because of impassiveness.* - Sat Sep 05 23:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned. Though her tone remained as emotionless as ever.

"A rookie medic would do better dragging shinobi down than saving them."* - Sat Sep 05 23:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shifted her gaze from Violet to Tethys. She frowned slightly at the sight. "Are you sure she simply has a common cold?"* - Sun Sep 06 00:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) approached the vending machine near the mansion doorway. She slipped a couple coins within the vending machine, clicking on various buttons. The girl returned to Violet's side, munching on a honey bun and oddly looking at the female out of her peripheral. This action was nothing more than a small, innocent act of teasing. It seemed that Setsuna had also purchased a bottle of red drank.* - Sun Sep 06 01:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned slightly. I seemed that her ploy had failed, none the less she intended to offer in the first place. She kept her hand hovering in front of Violet's mouth, allowing the female to eat the food. "Yeah.." Setsuna would mumble under her breath as Violet thanked her in a teasing manner.* - Sun Sep 06 01:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) removed a kunai knife from the confines of her backpouch, spinning it by the small opening at the end of the hilt, her pointer finger shoved through it. She slid her pointer finger out, proceeding tog rasp the kunai tightly by it's handle and jab it into the epidermis of her wrist, breaking the skin and puncturing deeply. She tore the kunai from her wrist, ensuring that she hadn't thrusted into any veins. The female flicked the kunai off to the side, then began to produce handsigns at what seemed to be a blur.

The white haired girl engulfed her hand in a translucent, green aura of chakra.  She pressed her palm to the deep wound, using her chakra as a supplement to speed up her body's natural healing process. She accelerated her overall recovery from the wound, repairing her blood-drenched, tattered, and unevenly split flesh. Her figure was shivering some, but that was only because of how deep the laceration was, and how much it hurt.* - Sun Sep 06 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was treating her self-inflicted wound, a deep stab in her wrist. The white haired female pressed her hand against the wound, immersing it in partially visible viridescent chakra swarming her right hand.The torn flesh healed at a rate only discernable due to it being reinforced by her technique. Though, the deepness of the wound kept it from being fully healed, and the aura around her hand was growing fainter every second. She perspired quickly, her breathes ragged and heavy.* - Sun Sep 06 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned when Violet caught her harming herself. Even if it was to master her healing technique, doing so in her manner wasn't efficient.. She removed her palm from over the stab wound, showing it to Violet with a look of guilt crawling onto her features. It was pretty deep, and dry blood drenched the fleshy walls of it. She listened as Violet informed her about her upcoming traniing regime.

In an eager manner her hands would rest upon her romantic companion's shoulders. She'd lean forth as Violet did, her soft lips to coming in contact with her own. Intent on not breaking away yet, her arms slipped around Violet, urging herself closer to the female, and nibbling on her bottom lip in an alluring manner. She finally pulled away, looking up at Violet with her half-lidded, relaxed, but also fatigue'd stare.

"Alright.. you be careful as well." Setsuna whispered, a small smile forming.* - Sun Sep 06 13:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was pressed against the bench, her hands clasped within her lap. She slowly unclasped her hands, forming several handsigns before emitting a green chakra around her right hand. She pressed her palm to the wound, repairing a majority of said wound before becoming exhausted again. The green aura around her hand had progressively became fainter as time progressed, but now it was completely gone. She wrapped bandages around the wound, deciding she'd take it easy, considering how dizzy and discombobulated she was.* - Sun Sep 06 14:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) approached Koeki, her hands tucked away within her pockets. She looked at the female with her relaxed gaze.* - Sun Sep 06 17:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) lifted a brow. The female nodded silently, manifesting the necessary handseals in a blur of momentum, before conjuring an aura of green chakra around her hands. She pressed her palms against the cut located on Koeki's arm, immersing her wound in chakra. By doing such, her natural healing rate was immensely multiplied to the point that the torn flesh was visually repairing. It was noticeable that Setsuna was highly experienced in the Novice Healing technique, though she hadn't mastered it yet.* - Sun Sep 06 17:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) looked at the scroll in mild wonder. Setsuna accepted the small item, glancing at it briefly before pocketing it and looking up at Koeki.

"Thanks. How bad did I do?" Setsuna questioned.* - Sun Sep 06 17:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) bowed toward Koeki out of habit. She'd venture over to bench, seating herself before removing the scroll from her pocket. With a small exhale she'd open it, beginning to read what was written and gather the knowledge provided. She knew that if she tried a little harder than usual it'd be easy to do what she was tasked with; learn the technique provided by her teacher and master the Novice Healing technique.* - Sun Sep 06 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) narrowed her eyes, not interpreting the information properly. She continued reading the scroll, wanting to make sure she didn't miss anything. Sure enough, there were many parts of the technique's description that she didn't understand. After rereading sections of the description she felt that she was actually getting somewhere on terms of acquainted with how the technique worked. Her brows furrowed as she noticed more points that she couldn't interpret. She repeated the process of going back and reading parts that were relevant to understanding the ones she had yet to interpret. Her progress was certainly slow, as her aefficiency in regard to learning betrayed her. It seemed that her smarts alone wouldn't aid her, and rather her ability to act as a scholar would. 

"Huh.."* - Sun Sep 06 17:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had developed a sufficient understanding of the Temperature Control technique, which she had been reading about for a few hours. None the less, some of the information that the scroll which the desccription was stored in was still confusing. Aspects of the technique's explanation were unable to be interpreted by her. None the less she kept on going back and reading over any part that made her say "what".* - Sun Sep 06 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shrugged nonchalantly, recalling where the male left to. She was slightly curious about his location as well, but none the less she didn't want to think about it. She also noticed that Violet was soaking wet. "What kind of training were you doing to increase your speed..?" Setsuna asked. She looked to see if Violet was shivering, finding that if she was it'd be a good time to try out her recently learned technique. Setsuna formed a fluent array of handseals, pressing her chakra-engulfed palm against her own wrist, where the partially healed, deep stab wound she inflicted on herself earlier was located.

She patched up the remainder of the wound, finding that she had healed it at an incredible speed compared to before. Perhaps it was because she wasn't exhausted, or it was because she was -very- close to mastering the technique. None the less, most of her attention was focused on Violet, even as she healed her own wound, leaving nothing behind, not even a scar.* - Sun Sep 06 19:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) coiled her left arm around Violet's waist, urging the female closer. Using her chakra, she stabilized Violet's body temperature, if it wasn't normal already. She was still new at using the technique, but it was clear that it was easy for her to utilize. The drain was obvious, because she took a more fatigue'd posture. She leaned toward Violet, pecking the female on the lips firmly. Setsuna began to whisper to her.* - Sun Sep 06 20:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: How was the training? - Sun Sep 06 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: it was difficult...but progression was made - Sun Sep 06 20:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: That's good. - Sun Sep 06 20:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Im worried... whats happening outside the mansion - Sun Sep 06 20:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: outside the village - Sun Sep 06 20:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Tethys-sama said the battle would be one-sided. - Sun Sep 06 20:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: I hope... everything is ok... I hope everyoe is save - Sun Sep 06 20:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Hopefully we are the one with easy win... - Sun Sep 06 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: We probably are. - Sun Sep 06 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: I pray you are right - Sun Sep 06 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) embraced Violet, taking in whatever warmth she had to offer and returning it with her own. Setsuna's arms remained tightly wrapped around Violet, pressing the female to her, leaving them in very close proximity.* - Sun Sep 06 21:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Dont let go... I need this right now... - Sun Sep 06 21:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I won't let go until you want me to, trust me.~ - Sun Sep 06 21:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Thank you... - Sun Sep 06 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned. She assumed that Koeki had been called to the battle, and therefore the white haired girl was uncharacteristically antsy. Setsuna kept her arms coiled firmly around Violet, her chin resting upon the top of the female's head.* - Sun Sep 06 21:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) wasn't exactly sure -what- his injuries were. She didn't really make a specified assessment. The female approached him quickly, conjuring handseals at a rate which seemed to be a blur. The first thing she did was check his pulse to ensure that he was still breathing when he collapsed. The white haired girl would proceed to engulf both of her hands in a pale green glow, pressing her palms to the most injured aspect of his body, proceeding to clot the blood, and completely heal the wound if it wasn't -too- intense.

She'd expend the rest of the chakra she was utilizing to heal him on the more major wounds, and lastly, the minor ones. Setsuna would glide her purple irises across his body from head to toe, ensuring she didn't miss anything. She'd cleansed any possible poisons or future infection-causers via. the sanitization-aspect of her Novice Healing technique.

With heavy breathes she'd look down at the male, pushing him over onto his back. Of course, she'd only do this if it was safe, and wouldn't cause him pain or cause him to bleed out. She was still being cautious, even though she'd clotted any blood dripping from his wounds utilizing her medical ninjutsu.

<So... what the hell went down..?> She thought to herself, remaining levelheaded and calm while she looked down at the most likely, still tattered and beat-up substitute Mizukage before her. <What's with the consistency of his body?> She continued thinking, remaining hunched beside him. She removed a bottle of lukewarm water from the confines of her backpouch.

The white haired female would yank off the top, attempting to pour the liquid into the male's mouth, making sure he swallowed it properly. She wasn't aware of his special clan technique, as she simply figured he was exhausted after most likely leading the frontlines, considering his fighting style and strength.* - Mon Sep 07 00:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) squinted when he mouthed the word 'more'. Her brain computed what it meant.

She looked toward the four genin within the vicinity one by one. "All four of you, get more water. It doesn't matter from where, just get more. If he receives more water he'll revert from this jellified form." She said, poking his arm to identify the consistency that his body was in while it was under the influence of it's jellified form. There was no way that she would leave his side, a reasoning for which she demanded the others got the water for her.

She felt as though taking her attention from him would prove to be an action fatal for her patient.* - Mon Sep 07 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) retreated to the sidelines, uttering a "No problem" when Tethys thanked the group. She sat in her usual seat, comfortably perched upon the bench.* - Mon Sep 07 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned, obviously not liking the hugging that was going on.* - Mon Sep 07 01:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) doesn't die.* - Mon Sep 07 01:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned slightly, refusing to make eye contact with Violet as she cut her purple irises to the left. She still held hands with the female, though.* - Mon Sep 07 01:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: I will do what ever you want me to do... to make you feel better - Mon Sep 07 02:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) widened her eyes slightly. Her face flushed as she responded to the faint whisper.* - Mon Sep 07 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: W-Well..could we... sl..sleep like we did when we first met... on the bench in front of that mansion southwest of here..? - Mon Sep 07 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: <said in a sexy soft voice>what ever you want my love~ - Mon Sep 07 02:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) would proceed to guide Violet to the place she mentioned.* - Mon Sep 07 02:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) wrapped her arms around Violet, leaning forth and proceeding to press the female against the bench. She scooched upward, pressing her lips to Violet's in an affectionate manner, before burying her head into the female's shoulder. An exhale of relief escaped her mouth, as she stretched her legs momentarily, her comfort growing.* - Mon Sep 07 02:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) moaned in pleasure, attempting to stifle her own moan by burrowing her head between Violet's neck and her shoulder. Her clutch tightened slightly as she was immersed in Violet's affection, warmth engulfing her body. Redness flooded to her cheeks as she gave into the infatuating love.* - Mon Sep 07 02:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued looking toward Violet with her drowsy, half-lidded gaze. She was extremely relaxed. She felt her body slowly grow cold, but once more she was engulfed in Violet's warmth. The female slowly pressed the side of her head against Violet's shoulder as she drifted off into slumber. Her soft, uneven breathes danced across the female's neck.* - Mon Sep 07 03:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Good....... night... - Mon Sep 07 03:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: night my love... - Mon Sep 07 03:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Remember what we talked about Lera? About relationships.? - Mon Sep 07 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Yup! I remember. - Mon Sep 07 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) held Violet's hand in a rather tight manner. She remained as impassive and silent as ever.* - Mon Sep 07 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: She is my girlfriend - Mon Sep 07 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Uh huh, I know. - Mon Sep 07 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) didn't even acknowledge the male beside her.* - Mon Sep 07 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shook her head in response to Lera's question.* - Mon Sep 07 13:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded subtly as positive response and answer to the question.* - Mon Sep 07 13:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) examined the stranger's frame from head to toe, trying to get a glimpse of a headband, to identify what village he affiliated with, if any.* - Mon Sep 07 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) flinched, her eyes noticeably widening as she threw her arms up thoughtlessly. She was all relaxed, lazy even, up until that point. The probability of her even managing to block before getting struck were... most likely zero.* - Mon Sep 07 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly stood up, unable to ignore the stinging pain of the strike. It was clear that she was highly inexperienced, and was most likely the reason for her lack of self-confidence, even if she never showed such a thing.

"Alright." She clasped Violet's hand, her other one pressed to the area in which Koeki struck, which was red.* - Mon Sep 07 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) climbed aboard or w/e.* - Mon Sep 07 22:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) madara face.

She'd remove her jacket, exposing several stacks upon stacks of exploding tags.

"ALLAHU AKBAR!" She formed the handseal, boom. (omit)* - Mon Sep 07 22:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Koeki... so those are them? - Mon Sep 07 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) whispers: Yup... - Mon Sep 07 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) whispers: We're going to get those back....a lowlife named Akask ran off with them after killing my best friend.  - Mon Sep 07 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) whispers: Those need to be back in the hands of Kirigakure....not some random.. - Mon Sep 07 22:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: They look amazing... I wonder is he versed in them? - Mon Sep 07 22:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: This is a bad situation if he is. For Tethys-sama at least. He turns into water-like sludge when he's near death. We can restore him from that state with water. But water conducts electricity. Logically speaking, Tethys-sama is a human conductor of lightning. He'll easily get screwed over by it, if I'm right. - Mon Sep 07 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: He is right here... - Mon Sep 07 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed several handsigns at an expeditious rate of speed, quickly exiting visage of a majority of individuals within the area, hopefully before they took her handsign formation for hostility and attacked her. She'd snag Violet by grasp of her hand, attempting to yank her up into safety, hidden amongst the thick branches within one of the unoccupied trees in the courtyard.* - Mon Sep 07 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) formed several handsigns at an expeditious rate of speed, preparing to replace herself with a log if she was put in harms way. She quickly attempted to exit visage of a majority of individuals within the area, hopefully before they took her handsign formation for hostility and attacked her. She'd snag Violet by grasp of her hand. The female was attempting to yank her up into safety, hidden amongst the thick branches within one of the unoccupied trees in the courtyard.* - Mon Sep 07 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) runs away from the area all together, intending to leave with Violet.* - Mon Sep 07 23:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) (omit)* - Mon Sep 07 23:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to move twoard Violet, nudging the female briefly with a poke to the shoulder, before trying to whisper into her ear. Once her murmurs were complete she'd retreat, concealing herself in the thickets of leaves and wood.* - Tue Sep 08 00:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Don't go in. It's too dangerous. - Tue Sep 08 00:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: You can't let your loyalty get the best of you. Someday it could get you killed. And I don't want that. Just support him from afar. This isn't a battle we can participate in. - Tue Sep 08 00:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: But... But... Lord tethys...  - Tue Sep 08 00:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Just believe in him. It'd be rash and stupid to just run in! They're on a different level. - Tue Sep 08 00:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Ok... - Tue Sep 08 00:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to grasp Violet, attempting to hide in the tree alogn with her.* - Tue Sep 08 00:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) removed the wrapper from a bubblegum flavored lollipop, sliding it into her mouth. Only the white stick was exposed, as she pushed the lollipop to the corner of her mouth using her tongue.* - Tue Sep 08 16:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) approached Koeki, standing in front of her at a reasonable distance. She shifted her sights to Kerasen, curious if the male would move. Unless he wanted to possibly get toppled by a soaring Setsuna after taking a blow or two.* - Tue Sep 08 17:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had her sights more or less focused on Koeki. She didn't want to get beat down for losing focus.* - Tue Sep 08 17:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) literally couldn't see Koeki's movements, so she could only assume that she was about to get hit at some point in time. The terrible part was that she didn't know when, or where Koeki was coming. Setsuna didn't even have time to throw her hands up, because the only thing she saw was Koeki's four knuckles. Instinctively, she attempted to throw her body to any direction other than the one that Koeki's knuckles were closing in from. Even if she managed to avoid the brunt of the attack, it'd only be slight, and she'd probably get knocked off her feet by the strike regardless.* - Tue Sep 08 17:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had hopefully been capable of seeing Koeki as she rushed forth this time, even if it was a brief moment, at least she could -perhaps- figure out what direction the female was approaching. She barrel rolled to the right as quick as possible, attempting to plant her feet against the earth even if partially and try to regain her footing, though her pinkish-purple eyes maintained their intense focus, even if it strained them.* - Tue Sep 08 17:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) unfortunately had her eyes focused on the ground as she pressed her arms against them while she was trying to stand up. Because of the opening she was easily struck by Koeki, the blue-headed medic's strike forcefully occluding her jaw. She barely pulled her tongue back from being shanked by her teeth. Setsuna threw her head back upon getting struck, stumbling back if she had the opportunity to at least stand by now.* - Tue Sep 08 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) // A simple nod would acknowledge Koeki's comment. Setsuna noticeably widened her eyes when she noticed Koeki's boxer-like stancing. Even when she wasn't using her superhuman strength, gained by her chakra, it was identifiable as a seemingly new style of fighting.

Setsuna stood in a seemingly less reserved stance, that granted her better fluency with her movements overall. "I'm ready." Setsuna said, intending to focus her sights on her blue-haired teacher.* - Tue Sep 08 17:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had a hard time examining Koeki's movements. She was taken by surprise when Koeki didn't aim at her face though, but instead removed the repetitivity of her attacks and attempted to strike her in the stomach. She'd try to immerse herself in a brief rush of momentum, attempting to bypass the range of Koeki's attack with her movements, even if it was slight. At the same time, she'd attempt to block where-ever Koeki was aiming.

<This is extremely difficult. I can only see sections of her movement.>* - Tue Sep 08 17:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) -definitely- didn't expect Koeki to completely change the arc in which her attack was directed to. In what seemed to be an instant for Setsuna, Koeki's fist thrashed into her chest, causing the white haired girl to stumble back, a stinging pain flooding her upper torso. She'd eagerly brace herself for the next attack, practically standing on the tips of her toes.* - Tue Sep 08 17:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was gasping mildly.* - Tue Sep 08 18:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was -barely- impassive. Her eyes were wide and her mouth remained agape. She closed her mouth, narrowing her eyes slightly. Her purple orbs remained focused on Koeki's.

"Alright." She'd utter.* - Tue Sep 08 18:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) inspected the first scroll, proceeding to read and absorb whatever information it had to offer. She pocketed the scroll shortly after closing it. Setsuna then proceeded to contort several handseals, repeating them vocally in a brief murmur. "Dragon, Tiger, Hare."

She opened her mouth, spewing a massly, compressed wave of ever-expanding from her mouth. She observed it's consistency as she did such, draining her chakra to a level that would be sufficient enough for the technique to still do damage to her imaginary foe. She breathed heavily, slowly seating herself beside Koeki and attempting to recuperate her lost chakra. Such a performance of an actual Ninjutsu was short-lived, it seemed.

None the less, while she was resting she removed the scroll, beginning to read it once more. She found no signs of the technique informing her of it's chakra drain. Thus, she was only left to assume that the drain varied with how trained the user's chakra reserves were, or how trained in Suiton they were. In Setsuna's case, she was inexperienced with both.

She stood up, forming a trio of handseals once more in a blur of hand dexterity, spewing a wave of water from her mouth once more.

"Suiton: Mizurappa no Jutsu!"

She'd holler, firing the wave after she did such, soaking the area in front of her. She dropped down onto her butt again, assuming that was enough for now. Her training was probably enough to provide her with a decent level of experience in the technique by then.* - Tue Sep 08 19:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued reading the scroll. A wave of realization reinforced her learning capabilities as she read the scroll at a speed that only a refined intellectual such as herself could sufficiently perform. Setsuna's pinkish-purple orbs flickered from right to left, the focal point of them descending as she read the next line to the description of the technique. With each time she read the scroll she gained a better understanding of the technique she was trying to utilize at full capacity.

The white haired girl could already tell that she lacked the reserves at the moment to utilize it. She still hadn't recuperated from the intense drain of her previous two uses. She continued reading what the scroll had to offer. Her intentions were clear, to learn how to use the technique to it's fullest use as soon as possible.* - Tue Sep 08 20:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shifted her sights back over toward Mitsuru, her orbs shifting over to Baen. "On it." The white haired girl remarked, then she'd approach the injured male. She started forming several handseals in a blur of speed, emitting a green aura of chakra around both of her hands. She crouched down beside the male's form, removing the bullet-like bones from him by applying pressure around the wound, utilizing her hands. At the same time, the aura of chakra had came in contact with the torn flesh, and was already beginning to heal them.

She'd partially heal the wounds, as her level of healing wasn't sufficient enough otherwise. The female clenched her teeth, cursing under her breath. She ultimately was capable of cleansing the wound and stopping the intense bleeding. The aura around both of her hands faded from view, as she stuffed her right hand into the beige backpouch attached to her lower back. The white haired girl removed a lengthy amount of gauze from within, coiling it around the area in which Mitsuru was pierced by the bones, covering his right shoulder and upper arm in the white gauze.

"There.."* - Tue Sep 08 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sighed. She forcefully lifted his head, placing a purple, opaque pill between his teeth. "Swallow it." She'd say, before motioning away from him.* - Tue Sep 08 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stuffed another bubblegum lollipop into her mouth, remaining silent from that point. The lollipop rested on the edge of her mouth.* - Tue Sep 08 20:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) claps shortly after her monotone response.* - Tue Sep 08 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was as monotone as ever. She turned out to be ignorant of stereotypes, no matter how much of a genius she was. She followed Tethys nonchalantly.* - Tue Sep 08 20:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) would see this attack, since he'd  have to be in front of her to kick her in the face. She'd contort handseals in a blaze of movement, spewing a waterfall-like wave from her maw, attempting to knock the male back with fire-truck esque pressure to her attack.* - Tue Sep 08 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) paraphrased something she recalled Mitsuru saying to her. She switched around some shit tho'.

"With that attitude you easily will.."* - Tue Sep 08 21:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) remained silent from this point.* - Tue Sep 08 21:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) pressed her figure against the wall of the mansion. She shoved her hand within the confines of the beige backpouch. She pulled out a black scroll with a white sash binding it tightly. Setsuna'd peel the scroll open, narrowing her eyes as she focused intensely on the small lettering written within the scroll. She slowly began to read the scroll, attempting to identify whatever information it had to offer. After summarizing what the technique she did, the white haired girl stopped leaning against the wall. She moved forth, moving beside Koeki and resting there momentarily.

Feeling that her chakra was replenished, the white haired girl formed two handseals in a blur of hand dexterity. Shortly after performing such an action, the purple eye'd girl focused a plume of chakra from within her. Gathering the chakra, she spewed it from her mouth shortly after kneading it into a translucent, blue liquid. The liquid, shortly thicker than normal water, planted itself against the floor below, solidifying into a sticky substance that spanned a decent distance. She nodded in satisfaction, opening up the scroll once more after retrieving it from her pocket. Her purple orbs began to focus on the writing once more, checking to see if she did anything wrong when performing the technique.

She removed a small piece of paper from her pocket. She balled the paper up, throwing it down at the sticky substance. She watched it stick firmly to the substance, acknowledging that she'd successfully utilized it. As the sticky substance began to evaporate, she frowned slightly. After it evaporated completely she formed the Ram handsign. Shortly after she formed the Tiger handsign. The translucent, blue, thick liquid spewed from her mouth once more.The liquid pressed itself to the ground, spreading slightly across the ground. It solidifed, becoming noticeably bluer, and more opaque. The field of sticky liquid was proof enough she used the technique right. For now, her chakra was exhausted though. She removed the scroll from her pocket, reading the description. She was slightly proud of herself when she found that she most likely learned how to use the technique properly.* - Tue Sep 08 21:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had steadily increased her already extensive knowledge in Suiton by reading a book on it. The book in particular was one that she'd rented previously. Setsuna continued identifying what she'd did wrong while performing thet ehcniques. This was in order to perhaps reinforce her efficiency. Hopefully she'd do things more properly the next time.

The white haired girl closed the book. She slid the book into her backpouch, slowly standing up from sitting at Koeki's side. She clasped her hands together. First the female formed the Dragon handsign. Shortly after, she conjured the Tiger handsign with great dexterity, and accuracy.

Lastly, she manifested the Hare handsign. Setsuna focused her chakra throughout the short-lived period of time she invested into forming seals. The plume of chakra within her throat slowly exited through her maw. She already kneaded her chakra into water before it left her mouth. An ever-expanding, high-pressure stream of water shot forth in front of her.

The white haired girl watched as the highly-pressurized cannon of funnel-like water shot from her mouth. Her cheeks were puffed, emphasizing how much chakra she had focused. The kneaded chakra moved at the momentum of a waterfall, proving it's efficiency. While her chakra was being exhausted, the drain was minor. This was due to the fact that the male that informed her of this technique was very experienced with it, if he didn't master it already.

The stream of water narrowed out into what seemed to just be a quick ray of water shooting from her mouth, and even then it was still contracting on itself. Eventually, there was no water to spew. Her cheeks were no longer puffed up, because there was no water to consume her mouth. She huffed slightly, dropping down on her butt. She removed the scroll stored in her backpouch. After reading over it, she was capable of confidently confirming that she had successfully used the technique to it's greatest efficiency.* - Tue Sep 08 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled loudly. She formed the Dragon handsign. The dragon handseal was followed by the Tiger handsign. And lastly came her Hare handsign. By then she'd concentrated a sufficient amount of chakra, allowing it to swell and knead into water within her throat.

The white haired girl opened her mouth, her cheeks puffing up. She kept the Hare handsign formed while firing it, pumping more chakra in. A wave of flowing water spewed from her maw in an ever-expanding stream, drenching the area in front of her as it flowed forth at an impressive rate of speed. While she was exhausting her chakra, at the same time she was gaining more experience with the technique.

Her fierce pair of pinkish-purple eyes discerned the wave. The highly-pressurized stream of water thinned out, but that wasn't what she wanted. She grumbled in frustration, pulsing her chakra suddenly. The stream expanded to it's original size, continuing to flow forth rapidly. None the less, it was getting harder to knead the water as it flowed from her maw. Her cheeks were slowly contracting, indicating that the water supply, provided by her constantly kneaded chakra slowly thinned.

The chakra progressively shooting forth in front of her slowly thinned out. As the stream thinned out, she couldn't really do anything to stop it. Instead, she watched as it slowly became just a ray of water flowing from her maw. Finally, the ray had contracted into nothing. She clasped her hands together in front of her, pressing her butt against the ground, breathing heavily. She had certainly had her fair share of training for today.

Setsuna removed a black scroll from within her beige backpouch. She proceeded to read the contents and start interpreting them efficiently. Her genius level intellect only made it easier to expand upon her knowledge of Suiton. She groaned, slowly closing the scroll and stuffing it in the backpouch strapped to her lower back.

"Alright. That's enough."* - Tue Sep 08 22:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I want to make sure two of our shinobi aren't fighting. Or trying to kill eachother. - Tue Sep 08 22:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Do all genin gut their own legs? - Tue Sep 08 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) approached the male. She formed several handsigns, before pressing her right hand to the male's wound. "This'll probably hurt." She'd remark, casting the kunai aside if he hadn't already removed it from his wound. She'd proceed to press her left hand against the other side of the wound. After doing such, the white haired girl inspected the wound briefly. She suddenly released the built up chakra within her hands, forming a pale green aura around them. The wound was far beyond her healing ability, much like Himura's.

Utilizing her healing technique, she sanitized the wound and repaired a minor amount of broken flesh, while proceeding to clot the immense amount of blood coursing. She'd speak in regard to Koeki without actually looking at the blue haired medical shinobi. "You'll have to take over, the wound's too severe for my healing to do the trick." She said. When the green aura around her hands began to fade she gave her chakra the extra boost it needed, putting in some of her extra reserves into the technique at the cost of exhausting herself quicker.

Any flesh that wasn't -extremely- ruined would be healed, but a major amount of the wound would still need to be healed.* - Tue Sep 08 23:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) managed to half the drain that the Novice Healing technique had on her, by retracting her left hand from the wound and allowing the green aura to fade. She continued clotting the immense amount of blood, stabilizing the wound with sanitization while doing such. The innards of the terrible injury glowed green from the aura it was being afflicted by. Her other hand coiled around the male's other leg gently, urging it to halt movement.

"Relax. It'll be over with soon."* - Tue Sep 08 23:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) removed her hand from his leg. She'd sigh, feeling lightheaded and somewhat dizzy from chakra drain. She'd arise to her feet none the less, her wobbly footing being highly noticeable.* - Tue Sep 08 23:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sighed. She approached a bundle of grass, picking up a gathering of leaves since she was aware she'd need them. In one hand she held the gathering of leaves. As for her other hand, one, single leaf rested between two of her fingers. The white haired female would pulse chakra through the leaf, frowning as it suddenly dampened. She attempted to flood the leaf in her chakra again, concentrating on the breee that passed by.

Instead, a thin spike of earth would thrust through the center of the leaf, bifurcating it. The girl would frown once more.

"I keep drawing out the elements I already have."* - Wed Sep 09 00:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) removed a leaf from within her grasp. She held it between her fingers, closing her eyes. She directed the entirety of her sense of hearing to that of the sounds around her. She delved even further into concentration, to the point that she wouldn't hear anything other than the wind. The breeze seemed to carry her obstacle to learning how to utilize Fuuton-based chakra. Slowly, the smallest bit of wind rushed the leaf within her grasp, though it did not split it. Instead, the top of the stem cut slightly, barely below half an inch.

"Not good enough.." She'd murmur.* - Wed Sep 09 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) hissed in annoyance. "I swear, you're all lucky."

Her chakra would continue to pulsate throughout the leaf. She'd completely ignore the chakra within her that she could describe as 'nature like'. Not only that, but she'd ignore the chakra that she considered 'freeforming and flowing'. Both of which described that of the elments she already possessed. She focused on the sounds of wind within the distance. She'd use the endless breezes as her determination. Blades of wind cut off small pieces of the leaf.* - Wed Sep 09 00:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stood near the coast of the island she was located on. A leaf rested between her fingers. Her eyes slammed shut as she closed her mouth and concentrated intensely. She focused on the sounds of the light breeze passing by, feeling a breeze pass by. With such an at ease, light gust she pulsed her chakra, basing it off of such a free flowing, yet sharp and deadly attribute be applied. Nothing happened, though.* - Wed Sep 09 07:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) grumbled in annoyance. She didn't even know why she was trying at this. None the less she'd keep going. Setsuna clutched the leaf between her fingers. She continued pulsing her chakra into it,avoiding her actual elemental natures. She was differentiating the nature that was flowing into the leaf by the feel of it. The white haired girl conjured a flow of Fuuton-based chakra through the leaf, but it still didn't split, or move, for that matter.* - Wed Sep 09 07:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) huffed impatiently. The task wasn't exhausting on her chakra or her stamina, and it didn't harm her health in any manner. But the fact that she couldn't gain contrl over the Fuuton element instantly was what infuriated her. The white haired girl continued to flow Fuuton-based chakra throughout the leaf, watching as it held no results and had no effect either.

"Why..."* - Wed Sep 09 07:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled in exasperation when she thought about Muhhamed. She felt as though doing what the old man told her to wasn't getting her anywhere near the success that she wanted. She slowly opened her eyes, staring fiercely at the leaf with her purple orbs, her cheeks puffed in annoyance. She coursed Fuuton-based chakra through the leaf again, though it showed -no- success, as nothing happened.* - Wed Sep 09 07:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) saw that Violet had seemed to be in a daze. That didn't stop the white haired girl from coiling her arms around the brunette haired female's upper figure and kissing her. A small, brief giggle of affection exited her mouth. Shortly after kissing Violet Setsuna would remove her arms from around the brunette haired female's frame.

She settled down beside Violet, resting on broad, expansive carpet she'd brought with her from her home. The white haired female had a bundle of leaves in her lap.* - Wed Sep 09 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) picked a leaf from the bundle within her lap. She clutched it between her fingers. The female closed her eyes briefly, listening closely to the faint sound of a breeze blowing on by. When she felt chakra that was as flowing, cool and calm as the wind that passed by, she pulsed it throughout the leaf. Though, like many times before, such a tactic did -not- work.* - Wed Sep 09 16:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) recalled Muhhamed's words as he instructed her. Such a thing didn't help as much as she thought it would, because all he said was to try cutting a leaf in half with Fuuton chakra. She continued pulsating the brief, very small portion of Fuuton chakra in her throughout the leaf, coursing the breeze-like chakra through it's frame. A short-lived gust of wind hit her face, simply surprising her and almost tearing the leaf from between her fingers. The chilly gust appeared to have arose from her Fuuton chakra.* - Wed Sep 09 16:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) "Couldn't he be more specific? I can call upon the chakra just fine, but I can't control or concentrate it. At all." Setsuna would utter, continuing to pulse the breezing flow of chakra throughout the leaf. The leaf blew around slightly between her fingers, indicating that it was slightly working. Though, the blow came to an unexpected end.* - Wed Sep 09 16:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) conjured more of the Fuuton chakra as she went, based on the property of Fuuton. The female would intend to manifest a large quantity of Fuuton chakra around the entirety of the leaf between her fingers. The chakra flowing throughout the leaf had no effect. It simply waved around slightly, but otherwise there was no sign of the leaf even being cut. * - Wed Sep 09 17:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned slightly, her pinkish-purple gaze drifting to Mitsuru briefly, before back over to Mizumi. She'd scan his frame from head to toe, attempting to identify his wounds. Judging by their casual sense of talking, he must've been moderately harmed and simply discombulated. Never knew with this village, though.* - Wed Sep 09 20:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) lifted a brow.

"All he's dealing with are bruises. It'd be inefficient if I used my chakra to heal simple things like those."* - Wed Sep 09 20:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) groaned. She was trying to fall asleep and all.

"What?"* - Wed Sep 09 20:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) withdrew a small leaf from a pile of them at her side. The white haired girl clutched the object between her fingers, concentrating a decent amount of chakra into it. The chakra was attuned to that of the Fuuton element, which she had barely any control over. As the chakra flowed into the leaf, it did none of what she intended it to do. While she wanted it to split the leaf in half, the leaf didn't budge or get cut not once. The girl clenched her teeth. "This is so tedious.." She'd hiss lowly.* - Wed Sep 09 23:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued to concentrate a relatively decent amount of Fuuton-based chakra into the leaf. None the less, her attempts were futile, as it had no effect on the leaf. It became clear to her that she would be highly incapable of achieving the task that she needed to accomplish without applying the precise chakra control required. Learning how to utilize an element she didn't have a natural affinity for was on par with learning high-ranking Medical Ninjutsu. Her eyes closed as she concentrated on the sounds of the wind within the area, taking into consideration of every single effect it had on her.* - Wed Sep 09 23:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) clutched the leaf between her index and middle finger. She closed her eyes, focusing on the sound of the breeze passing by, and the feeling of it doing so. She attuned her senses to focus on such a factor, applying the most common attributes of Fuuton-based chakra, such as sharpness, deadliness and raw power to her chakra reserves, as she infused a small portion of them into the leaf.

It was clear as day that nothing had happened, but that was because she was originally stopping short before. This time around, when she was practically praying something would happen around Muhhamed's visage it did due to her patience. The chakra circulated throughout the leaf, as she manifested the level of control she utilized while applying successful usage to her Medical Ninjutsu. In one instant, with the combination of refined chakra control, and necessary chakra utilized, the leaf split into two, descending from her finger-clutch.

<So.. I need to add impatience to my 'self-flaw' list.>* - Wed Sep 09 23:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sighed lightly. She wasn't one to look for confidence in the words of others, nor courage. "So... basically I'm applying Fuuton's factor of sharpness and cutting ability to my chakra.. or trying to?" Setsuna would ask, clutching another leaf from the bundle of them beside her. She closed her eyes briefly, focusing on applying Fuuton's fine-compressed chakra, reinforced with additional cutting ability. A very low sound corresponding to a breeze passing by resonated in front of her as she pulsed her chakra into the leaf. A sharp, short-lived thrust of Fuuton-based chakra would slice the leaf, cutting the center halfway. "Not good enough.." The white haired girl mumbled.* - Thu Sep 10 00:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) wasn't familiar with how she'd manage doing what he instructed. None hte less, the female would halt leaning against the wall. She headed off into the distance, intending to guide Violet there along with her. Morale support was important, afterall.* - Thu Sep 10 00:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) crouched down in front of the large pool of water. The female proceeded to form the handseals for the Novice Healing technique. Instead of infusing an aura with healing based properties she formed one composed completely of what little Fuuton chakra she had kneaded and within her possession. The female'd try to simply glide the tip of her hand across the water, seeing if what she did with the leaf would be effective at this point. Unfortunately it wasn't, and she found that she had drained an immense amount of her chakra in the process while attempting this odd performance.* - Thu Sep 10 00:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was clearly tired out. Her motive to train had diminished to zero. The white haired girl rested beside Violet, pressing her figure against the brunette haired individual slightly. "I'll train some more tomorrow. For now, sleep is important too." Setsuna'd utter, proceeding to drift off into slumber, her head resting on Violet's shoulder.* - Thu Sep 10 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I can't decide on my own so decide for me. Should I laze off or train today? - Thu Sep 10 16:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sighed slightly, noticeably pouting.

"Lazing off seemed more appealing."* - Thu Sep 10 16:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) pressed her back to Violet's upper thighs, looking up at the female with her pinkish-purple orbs. Her hands were folded below her waistline.* - Thu Sep 10 16:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: I still love that about you though - Thu Sep 10 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: H-Huh..? - Thu Sep 10 17:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Oh... I.. love you too. - Thu Sep 10 17:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Have you learned alot medical jutsu wise? - Thu Sep 10 17:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: The most I can do is regulate body temperature and heal decently injured wounds. - Thu Sep 10 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: I see... - Thu Sep 10 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Hm? - Thu Sep 10 17:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) rested the back of her head, as well as upper back, on Violet's upper thighs. She lay strewn across her half of the bench otherwise, her legs folded comfortably. She was noticeably alert, basically because of the brunette haired boy who decided it'd be wise to stand in such proximity to her. The white haired girl's pinkish purple orbs narrowed at the sight of him. She was clearly insecure.* - Thu Sep 10 18:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) didn't lighten up. At all. Guys annoyed her enough. 'Nice' guys only irritated her more, and made her more alert of her surroundings. "No. Your presence is utterly annoying." She'd say in a bland tone, laying her head against Violet's lap.* - Thu Sep 10 19:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) arose to her feet, her hands shoved into her pockets. She withdrew her hands from her pockets, rapidly forming a trio of handseals. After doing such, she'd emit a high-pressure wave of ever-expanding chakra, kneaded into water, from her mouth. Said wave drenched the area in front of her. Setsuna simply smirked at her high-level experience with the technique. It wasn't anywhere near a genuine grin, and if anything it was full of cockiness.

<Barely drains my chakra. Good.>* - Thu Sep 10 19:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) still appeare dto not have mastered the technique,r egardless of how experienced she already was with it. She formed three handseals one by one once more. Shortly after doing such she'd clasp her hands together, firing a wave of water from her mouth. Said wave expanded as it shot forth, shaped-like a long funnel. Said stream of high-pressure, rapidly moving water progressed onward.

Her cheeks were puffed, slowly contracting as her water supply decreased. Another plume of chakra removed itself from her throat, expanding the stream as it was beginning to thin out. The stream of water would resultingly drench the area in front of her. She'd slowly reduce the chakra output within the technique, allowing it to thin out until there the water was no longer exiting her maw. She'd seat herself beside Violet once more, easily capable of telling that her chakra was -barely- drained by the training.* - Thu Sep 10 19:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) scooted closer to Violet, though the proximity between them was already limited as it was. Her pinkish-purple orbs rested upon Violet's irises, a hint of curiousity creeping upon her facial features.* - Thu Sep 10 20:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Sweetie... can you try to act friendlier to the guys please? - Thu Sep 10 20:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: But... I don't trust them... - Thu Sep 10 20:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Why not my love? - Thu Sep 10 20:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: What if one of them tries to steal you from me? - Thu Sep 10 20:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: What if one of them already has and you just don't want to mention it..? That's been on my mind. For awhile. - Thu Sep 10 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: No none is stealing me from you... Im yours and yours alone - Thu Sep 10 20:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Y-You mean that..? - Thu Sep 10 20:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: I promise... - Thu Sep 10 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: U-Uh... well.... f-fine! Don't expect me to be all happy go lucky with them, though. - Thu Sep 10 20:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Ofcourse... just be a little kinder? For me? - Thu Sep 10 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I already agree'd. Don't expect me to shake anyone's hands.... - Thu Sep 10 20:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Or touch them, for that matter. - Thu Sep 10 20:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: Just dont be be mean - Thu Sep 10 20:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Okay... - Thu Sep 10 20:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) crouched down at the bank of the water. She extended her right arm out, hovering it over the surface. The girl applied a sufficient amount of chakra to her hand, swiping at the water below with her hand, though she was nowhere near in contact with it. Essentially, she was trying to use the Fuuton-based chakra enveloping her hand and lower wrist to cave in area of the water temporarily.

With her chakra control as a medical shinobi, such a task would be very easy.* - Thu Sep 10 22:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) still was unable to perform thet ask necessary for continuing her training. None the less, she emit her hand in Fuuton-based chakra once more. She swiped her arm back slightly, watching the water for signs of seeing if the area she slashed over would cave in, so to speak. None the less, it seemed she was insuccessful, because the water kept flowing normally.

"Ugh.."* - Thu Sep 10 22:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) narrowed her eyes toward her hand, as if she could see the chakra flowing around it. Unfortunately, she hadn't sued enough chakra to make it visible. She engulfed her hand in chakra once more, doubling the amount of chakra she was putting into these attempts. She lifted her hand out in front of her, hovering it over the water. Setsuna swung back, seeing that the water caved in slightly.* - Thu Sep 10 22:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had acknowledged the fact that in order to succeed in doing this, she'd have to increase the output of chakra she was using. However, the more of the Fuuton chakra she had to control the harder it was to control it. She smirked slightly in arrogance, extending her arm out in front of her then swiping back, watching the water cave in a little more than it did before.* - Thu Sep 10 22:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) overlapped her hand in a cloak of invisible chakra once more. She doubeld the amount of chakra that she initially applied to her hand. Slowly, her pinkish purple eyes eagerly observed as she extneded her right arm out. She slashed off to the side, slashing horizontally across the water while hovering her hand a few inches over it. The fuuton chakra, with it's great range and cutting ability, parted the water momentarily, caving in at the area it was cut.* - Thu Sep 10 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) drifted her gaze over to Violet briefly, before setting her pinkish purple orbs down at the surface of the water again. The white haired girl proceeded to flow chakra through her hand once more, as she had ceased the flow each time she swiped, to preserve chakra, even though doing this repeatedly didn't consume much chakra overall. After doubling her chakra output she proceded to thrust her right arm out in front of her, her hand gliding above the water in the process. The fuuton chakra slashed the water once more, though the cut wasn't as deep as the last.* - Thu Sep 10 22:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had advanced rapidly throughout her training. none the less, she still hadn't seemed to do what Muhhamed had instructed. She immersed her hand in chakra once more, doubling the amount after applying it successfully. Using the precious chakra control that she used while attempting Medical Ninjutsu, she successfully applied the invisible cloak of deadly, sharp blades of Fuuton-based chakra to her hand. She slashed horizontally, caving in the water slightly and parting it. It seemed that she needed to use more chakra while doing this.* - Thu Sep 10 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) clasped her hands together. In a rather intense manner she plumed her chakra, kneading it into a highly compressed gathering of wind particles formed to make a polygon of intensely pressurized wind blades. After doing such, she overlapped her hands with the immens elevels of Fuuton-based charka. She thrusted forth with her left arm, parting the water.* - Thu Sep 10 23:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) was eager to keep on going with the task at hand. The white haired girl kept her pinkish purple orbs focused on the surface of the water in front of her. She constantly slashed at it with her chakra engulfed hands. Of course, the result was minor because she wasn't using an actual technique, but the immensity of the water's response to her mid-air palm strikes proved that she was doing it properly.* - Thu Sep 10 23:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly uncloaked her hands. She seated herself comfortably on the edge of the pool of water. Folding her legs and claspign her hands together, the female would begin to meditate. From that point she'd conjure chakra from her reserves, kneading said chakra into Fuuton-based particles of wind. She applied every property of wind that she could think of to the chakra.* - Thu Sep 10 23:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sighed nonchalantly. She removed a scroll from the confines of the backpouch attached to her lower back. From that point she withdrew a pen, beginning to write down the properties of Fuuton based chakra, from what she'd obserrved in the past. She knew that it was sharp, as well as free-forming, highly-compressable, strong against Raiton, weak against Katon, empowering the flames in the process. She wrote all of this down for future reference.* - Thu Sep 10 23:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) underlined most of the parts that were most relevant to the description of Fuuton-based chakra. That meant she underlined "weak against Katon". She also underlined "empowering" and "flames". In addition, she underlined "free-forming". The girl was slowly regathering the information and recalling it as she went onward, reinforcing her learning efficiency for utilizing Fuuton chakra.* - Thu Sep 10 23:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) placed the pen back within her backpouch. She rolled up the scroll, placing it within the back pouch as well. After doing such a thing she stood up again, clasping her hands together. She proceeded to manifest a plume of chakra within her hands. Within said chakra she freely formed it's shape to easily coil around her hands, taking advantage of the compression factor of Fuuton. In addition, she ensured the chakra was fine, and was capable of easily cutting. After doing such, she allowed the plume of chakra to span across her hands.* - Thu Sep 10 23:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) //After allowing the charka to span itself in a fine layer of Fuuton across her hands, she proceeded to double the intensity of the charka, controlling and manipulating it freely to the manner in which it sufficed for her. After doing such, Setsuna extended her arms out in front of her, her chakra-enveloped hands hovering over the sruface of the water. She recalled the factual information of the Fuuton element. <Compressable, freeforming, weak against Katon, empowers flames, fine, and very sharp.> She thought to herself, ensuring that she'd applied these attributes to the chakra engulfing her hands.* - Thu Sep 10 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) tensed the muscles within her right arm. She arched it, her hand resting in close proximity to the left side of her neck. She swiped frmo the left to the right horizontally in a relatively quick motion. The aura of chakra, which practically had it's own gust of wind to it's form, caused the water to cave in as it came within the necessary contact for such a thing to happen. The water parted extremely deeply, confirming she'd did it properly.* - Thu Sep 10 23:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued to swipe at the water in front of her, her arms always remaining a few inches or more above the surface. The water caved in and parted each time her wide-ranged cloak of Fuuton-based chakra came in close proximity to it. It was clear as day that she had successfully done what Muhhamed had told her to do a multitude of times. Only now she didn't know what to do.* - Thu Sep 10 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly allowed the cloak of chakra engulfing her hands to fae away. She removed the scroll from within her backpouch. It seemed that she had some revisions to make, and perhaps add some things. She read what she wrote out loud. "Fuuton is composed of very-fine, sharp, kneaded chakra. It's very freeform, and highly compress-able. In addition, it's weak against Katon but strong against Raiton. Lastly, flames struck by Katon'll be empowered." SHe nodded simply.* - Thu Sep 10 23:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) closed the scroll after rolling it up. She slowly clasped her hands together, closing her eyes. She did what she'd been doing at the beginning of her training. The female slowly began to focus on the sound of the wind blowing within the near area. Using that sound as motivation, she'd conjure immense amounts of Fuuton chakra from within her reserves, proceeding to meld said chakra into her reserves so that it was practically an additional, natural affinity for her.* - Thu Sep 10 23:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly removed one leaf, plucking it from a tree nearby. She seated herself at the edge of the lake once more, clutching the leaf between her pointer and middle finger. After doing such, she plumed her chakra throughout the leaf. Utilizing her natural affinity of Fuuton, granted by her hardwork for the past week, as well as her -extremely- high chakra control, granted by her medical ninjutsu training, and lastly the -perfect- amount of chakra she invested into this action, she easily split the leaf in half. The tear was clean, and perfectly straight, running down the middle. "Looks good." Setsuna'd murmur.* - Fri Sep 11 00:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) slowly fished her hand throughout her multi-pocketed backpouch. She removed a small, indigo, opaque globe from within her backpouch. She parted her lips, sticking her tongue out briefly and placing the small sphere of nutrients on the tip of her tongue, before allowing her tongue to recede into her mouth. She gulped down the medicine pill, already feeling refreshed. That didn't stop her drowsy pair of half-lidded, pinkish-purple orbs from drifting over to Violet.

In a lazy manner, Setsuna would approach her brunette-haired romantic companion, attempting to snuggle against the female if she had stopped training. The white haired girl would proceed to attempting falling into deep slumber in close proximity to the brunette, pulling her into an affectionate embrace and pressing her head to Violet's bosom.* - Fri Sep 11 00:04:54 2015
