<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) added a brief bounce to her step, lunging toward the two with unseen momentum. She'd yank Lera into her grasp rather quickly as the female passed out.* - Sat Sep 26 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Next time end early so neither of you exhaust your chakra too majorly. - Sat Sep 26 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) leaned Lera against the tree, forming several handsigns and emitting her hands in a thick, translucent blue aura. She'd press her hands to Lera's wounds, healing them with highly experienced finesse. She'd take a closer look at Lera's exhaustion, stamina-wise.

<She'll be out for about a day from using so much chakra..> The blondette would think to herself. She'd turn away from Lera, clasping the female by her wrists. With some strength applied, Setsuna'd pull Lera's arms over her shoulders, then clutch beneath the female's hips, hoisting her on her back supportively. Setsuna would lean forth slightly, jogging to the hospital.* - Sat Sep 26 11:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) entered the hospital, checking Lera into an empty room. She'd place her on the hospital bed within the center, and begin hooking her up to rather simple machinery. She'd seat herself within a chair nearby, intent on keeping a good watch on Lera. The blonde would exit the room briefly, coming back with some more supplies to treat Lera's wounds.

The female would apply burn ointment to any region of Lera's body that was afflicted by burns. After doing so, she'd change the girl into hospital robes, placing her clothing within the drawer attached to the night table beside the girl's bed. She'd withdraw herself from Lera's side, exhaling as she ran her fingers through her locks of blonde hair, pushing it behind her ear. Her pinkish-purple orbs scanned Lera's figure for anything she may've forgot to treat.* - Sat Sep 26 12:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded slightly, settling down within the doctor's chair to the Lera's left. She folded her arms beneath her chest, exhaling.

"Yeah. It'll take nearly a day before you've fully recovered. Your body's in a mild state of chakra deprivation. It'll be weak until then."* - Sat Sep 26 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right... - Sat Sep 26 12:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: A bit isn't good enough... I'll discharge you soon, but you have to stay close by, I don't want you to harm yourself without me knowing, okay? - Sat Sep 26 13:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Alright~ - Sat Sep 26 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) entered Lera's hospital room wearing a white, button-up overcoat with no sleeves, hugging a clipboard against her side. The female's steps were as soft as ever; she was trying not to stir Lera's rest. She'd approach the side of the bed, gazing down at Lera with her pinkish-purple orbs. The blonde intended to check if she was asleep or not.* - Sat Sep 26 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: .... - Sat Sep 26 15:59:34 2015

"As desirable as it sounds, I have no strings attached to my actions. I'm simply doing what I promised. And that's make sure that Lera doesn't harm herself for the next twenty four hours. Physically, at least."* - Sat Sep 26 16:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) glanced toward Seisuke out of her peripheral, taking note of his unsealed sword. She'd press her back against the white post. The blonde noticeably added a small bounce to her stancing, and slid her left leg behind her right.* - Sat Sep 26 16:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Enough. Stop arguing you two. - Sat Sep 26 16:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) huffed, seeming rather worked up even though she was initially acting levelheaded and rational. She'd exhale, pushing her hair behind her right ear.

"Anyways... I'm done. It doesn't matter. Lera, how're you feeling?" It seemed she'd disregarded the situation that occured moments ago.* - Sat Sep 26 16:53:20 2015

"Or is it that you're not used to seeing bras..?" She was referring to his lack of a romantic relationship.* - Sat Sep 26 16:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) relaxed slightly, no longer practically on her heels. She'd take a quick leap back, settling down atop the white post near the vending machine. She was expecting Seisuke to attack, and she still did. The blonde would look forward.* - Sat Sep 26 16:59:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Kohaku. Use the technique I taught you and make your clones scout every bridge that comes to mind and the land that leads to it. Do not go yourself. - Sat Sep 26 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh uh. - Sat Sep 26 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right-o. - Sat Sep 26 18:22:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So why are they scouting the bridges? - Sat Sep 26 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) narrowed her eyes slightly, nodding.

"It'll take a very long time for this to heal.. probably three months." The blonde would state, turning away from Kirie and leaning down.

"Get on my back. I'm not letting you walk with a leg like that."* - Sat Sep 26 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded silently. She'd wrap her arms beneath Kirie's hips, hoisting the female onto her back.

"Hold on tight.." Setsuna'd state, leaning forth and shooting forth in a burst of high speed movement.* - Sat Sep 26 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) entered the hospital rather quickly. She'd place Kirie on a bed, elevating her broken leg. The blonde would inspect the female's leg closely, running a measuring instrument across it. She'd exit the room, re-entering with a cast that served as a perfect fit for the kunoichi's leg. Setsuna would apply the cast to the female's leg, giving her a small dose of medicine that served as pain killer. She'd then grant her a pair of crutches.* - Sat Sep 26 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) had initially been in the hospital. After becoming aware of the fact that a patient had been rushed into the intensive care unit the female entered said vicinity, The blonde would come through the doorway of the hospital room that Kohaku resided in. Naturally, only medical personnel was around. She'd eagerly approach any area of the room that was close to the female, her eyes widened.

Refusing to allow awe to prohibit her from doing her job, the female would form several handsigns at high speeds, coursing vibrant, blue chakra throughout Kohaku's wound, and the torn, bloody stump where a large portion of her arm separated. She'd clot the bleeding, but naturally she wasn't as skilled as Koeki. Despite the pang of guilt that washed a cold feeling throughout her frame she remained levelheaded, working with other medics in order to stabilize Kohaku's condition as much as possible.

When she wasn't needed any longer in the room, Setsuna would cloak her frame in chakra and sink into the floor, having no intentions of seeing anyone or being seen by anyone for now. She'd be unable to fathom the events that took place in such short notice.* - Sat Sep 26 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'll leave her in your hands.. For now I'll be leaving. -@NPC Medics ofc- - Sat Sep 26 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sunk below the floor as originally stated after cloaking her frame in chakra, leaving.* - Sat Sep 26 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stood at the side of Kohaku's hospital bed, assisting other hospital workers in treating her. They'd apply bandaging to the afflicted area, proceeding to clot the blood once more and sanitize the wound utilizing chakra. Regardless of the rate that they sped up her cellular healing rate it wasn't doing anything. It was clear as day that her arm was rendered useless. The blonde stared intensely at the unconscious female, feeling as though there was a distant blood relation between them, even if it was miles off.

She'd frequently check Kohaku's vitals using the machinery with wires hooked up to her arm. Setsuna would check her pulse, noticing that it was no longer faltering as bad as it was before. The severity of her blood loss was frightening.

<I'm sure that people will find out that she's in this state because of what I told her to do. There's no doubt in my mind that they'll want me dead..> She'd think.* - Sat Sep 26 19:55:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sat a considerable distance away from Kohaku's bed, her partially narrowed pair of pinkish-purple orbs gazing at the female, regret coursing through the young medical kunoichi. Not only was the complete abolishment of Kohaku's arm obvious, but so was the casuality count. Her rash actions costed the lives of three thousand.

<I'd do a better job at leaving, then staying and getting executed.>* - Sat Sep 26 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) rushed to Kohaku's side, pressing her hands to the one arm that Kohaku had left.

"Don't move it..." She'd utter slightly, her gaze toward the female faltering as she looked in the opposing direction. "I'm... sorry.." She'd murmur, resting her arms at her sides.* - Sat Sep 26 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned, tears threatening to run down her cheeks. She halted them, however. Her voice was strained, and uncharacteristically saddened.

"I... I didn't know this'd happen.. I really didn't..." She'd murmur, her pinkish-purple orbs widening slightly as she witnessed the difference in Kohaku's irises.* - Sat Sep 26 21:40:03 2015

"I know.. that's why I'm sorry. Even if it doesn't change the situation.. I just want you to know that I didn't mean for this to happen.." She'd whisper to Kohaku.* - Sat Sep 26 21:48:35 2015

//A random non-player character nurse arrived at the doorway to Kohaku's room.

"We'll ensure that she remains stable. You may go off duty."\\

Setsuna would slowly exit, forming the Clone handsign and producing a shadow clone from a plume of smoke. The blonde would apply a thin cloak of chakra to her form, sinking into the floor below to traverse without having to get egged, or have shit thrown at her.

The clone on the other hand would be busy attempting to make an exit from the hospital unharmed.* - Sat Sep 26 21:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 

The Shadow Clone continued peering at Kilm's arms, before nodding lightly. The real Setsuna was home by then. The clone would take a step forth, unraveling the gauze around his arms and taking a brief look at the wounds that he'd suffered. <Damn..> The clone'd think, forming several handsigns and cloaking it's hands in vibrant, blue chakra.

The shadow clone would press each hand to one of the male's arms, immersing both of the deep wounds in an aura of chakra which, using fine chakra control, would rapidly multiply the cellular healing rate in the specified vicinity where the chakra was applied. The torn, butchered flesh would rapidly repair itself, and any blood oozing from the wounds would clot. In addition, the wound would be sanitized, causing a slight tingle be felt by Kilm.* - Sat Sep 26 22:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) frowned. She was relatively cautious of the Konoha shinobi, specifically because they were from another village and she couldn't anticipate if they'd attack after she finished healing them.

She'd exhale briefly.

"One second." The clone would form the seal that manifested it, poofing in a plume of smoke. A thick, maroon mist would gather in front of Kilm, cloaking anyone whom may've been in it. When it distanced itself Setsuna stood there, her hands in her pockets.

She'd spare a gaze to the individuals that were injured.* - Sat Sep 26 22:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) no longer had to worry about him dying of blood loss. She'd form several handsigns, immersing both of her hands in a vibrant blue chakra. The blonde would press her palms against each of the male's arms, the difference in the rate at which she sped his natural healing rate being clear as day. The ruined flesh was recovering much quicker compared to when a clone was taking care of the task. Though doing this was taxing, she'd efficiently repaired his wounds.

With a nimble step forth she'd press her palms to Arnitanu's chest, repairing the torn flesh. As the aura faded away she'd urge him to sit within a nearby chair. The female would crouch down in front of him, an emanating, blue aura engulfing her hands once more as she pressed her palms to his legs, healing the deep gashes located on his legs.* - Sat Sep 26 22:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) gazed at Kohaku with lavender, rippling eyes. She'd extend her right arm out, hovering it just above the female's throat.

"Know pain."

A black, sharp rod would exit her palm, thrusting into the female's throat.

"Why'd you listen to me in the first place?" Her set of pinkish-purple orbs set upon the female.* - Sat Sep 26 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 

"I was completely unaware of what'd happen. If I wasn't busy helping Kirie with her leg I would've tried to scout with clones of my own." She'd frown.

"I'm a medical kunoichi. I prefer to heal people instead of harm them. I apologize." She'd state.* - Sat Sep 26 23:09:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) rushed forth at a sufficient pace, the female would shove her right hand into her backpouch, pulling forth six shurikens. She'd hook two wires to each, whipping them forth with impressive accuracy. Every two shurikens shared the same two wires, but were thrown at opposing sides of Kohaku. In the manner she was aiming, it seemed she was intentionally trying to make them miss, with three on each side of Kohaku shooting by if she didn't halt them.* - Sat Sep 26 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) didn't seem very phased as the shuriken, as well as the wires, were incinerated by the flames. The female would add a small bounce to her step, sliding her left leg behind her right. She'd lean forth, then suddenly burst forth in rapid movement, aiming to close the distance between herself and Kohaku. In a brisk demonstration of her hand dexterity she'd remove a kunai knife from her backpouch, attaching a tag to the end and emitting it in an aura of dense, orange flames.

She'd whip the kunai toward Kohaku, ensuring she wasn't too precise to harm her.* - Sat Sep 26 23:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the seal necessary, detonating the tag early and using the smoke produced by it as cover. She'd dive into the large smoke, performing a diving roll to avoid the fireballs and re-emerging on the other side of the cloud of smoke in a crouched position, kunai tucked between all of her fingers. She'd whip all of the kunai knives, aiming to close Kohaku's range of space, though she was well aware the female was capable of keeping up a good pace.

The girl would form several handsigns, firing a high-volume wave of water at Lera's frame. She'd halt the wave early, pressing her feet firmly against the ground and immediately shooting forth at high momentum out of her crouching position, moving at a pace that would keep her behind the weaponry she threw, but also make Kohaku incapable of tracking her speeds.* - Sat Sep 26 23:48:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) paid close attention to the attacks that soared towards her. The female would simply smirk beneath her mask. The blonde's frame would literally vanish in a flicker of movement unexpectedly. She'd suddenly reappear in front of Kohaku, intending to throw a quick punch forth with intentions of thrashing her knuckles against the female's jaw.* - Sun Sep 27 00:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) vanished once more the very moment her strike connected with Kohaku. She'd reappear behind the female, throwing a rapid sidekick, using her right leg, to the center of Kohaku's back. The female wouldn't stop at that, however. She'd attempt to shoot back in front of Kohaku and thrash her fist against her jaw, then move to her left and strike her with a left hook. When she could see signs of daze on Kohaku's feature she'd initiate a barrage of omnidirectional strikes upon the Sharingan user.* - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed six handsigns of her own, shooting a massive fireball at the girl with intentions of firing an immense fireball, intending to consume Kohaku's eight smaller ones. She'd shoot to the side at high speeds, the only sign that she was even moving being the descension of pebbles from the middle of the mountain. Suddenly, the female would appear behind Kohaku, attempting to smash her fist against the girl's back.

The second that her attack connected she'd shoot to Kohaku's left, aiming to thrash her left leg into Kohaku's midsection, then attempt to strike her in her back with her right leg.* - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Ram handsign the moment she saw the last seal, distancing herself far from Kohaku, using a thick veil of crimson mist to conceal her movements. She'd reappear at the top of the waterfall, discombobulated by her usage of Shunshin without necessary experience, other than generic mastery.* - Sun Sep 27 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) watched as Kohaku punched an iron chestplate, stacked upon full chainmail. That'd have to hurt. Even though she was still disoriented by the usage of Shunshin, she was capable of throwing attacks. The female would shove both of her hands into her backpouch, removing a pair of kunai that already had wiring attached. With the arc in which she threw them, they'd pass eachother as they made a loop around herself and Kohaku.

If such a tactic was successful, they'd be pressed together by constricting, steel wiring. Setsuna smirked beneath her mask, as she lurched her head forth, intending to thrash her mask-reinforced cranium against Kohaku's skull.* - Sun Sep 27 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) took the damage head-on. The masked blonde would suddenly shoot from the inferno of flames when she couldn't take it's intensity any longer, intending to catch Kohaku by the element of surprise and elbow her in the chest, intending to leave no distance between them, and send both of them shooting off the waterfall. Her armor helped her endure the heat effectively.* - Sun Sep 27 00:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) felt a punch strike the back of her head. In response to the stinging pain she'd clench the fish that she just caught and blindly flail behind her, attempting to slap the shit out of Kohaku with said aquatic being.* - Sun Sep 27 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly shot out of the water, applying a thin veil of chakra to her feet and shooting toward Kohaku. She'd throw a punch directly toward the arrogant female's face.* - Sun Sep 27 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) leaped high into the air, forming several handsigns and firing a massive blast of wind capable of knocking down anything in it's path. She had obvious intentions of reinforcing Kohaku's flames and perhaps making her catch on fire with them.
