<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) removed a kunai from the confines of her backpouch, allowing it to gyrate throughout the air as she whipped it from said pouch. She'd catch it by it's handle, explaining how to utilize the technique. "So... basically... try coursing a high volume of Doton chakra throughout the weapon's blade." She'd state, pluming her chakra.

The kunai shimmered some, the glint to it's blade becoming brown to indicate she'd successfully done it. The female halted the flow of chakra, stepping forth and handing Lera the kunai.

"Now you try."* - Sun Oct  4 16:52:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded lightly. "Alright then.." The female would face her right, proceeding to plume her chakra. The blonde would clasp her hands together, kneading chakra into the form of Doton. She'd attempt to spew a decent amount of mud from her mouth, but instead nothing came out, and thus she ended up wasting chakra.

Setsuko attempted to keep her hands together. She'd utilize a decent flow of chakra and attempt to knead it into Doton. Instead of before, she attempted to take it a step further. This time the blonde would try to infuse the Doton-composed chakra into mud. At that point, she would try launching the mud from her mouth in the form of a wave.

The blonde grew sour when she noticed that the amount of mud exiting her mouth was insufficient compared to Lera. The blonde would keep her hands clasped, proceeding to focus a plume of chakra in her throat. She puffed up her cheeks and kneaded the chakra into mud, releasing it in the form of a stream of mud down at the ground.* - Sun Oct  4 16:58:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) attempted to engulf her feet in chakra, attempting to soften the ground below her. Unfortunately, she wasn't using the technique properly at all. Her feet remained above ground, causing the blonde individual to peer down with her golden gaze with a look of confusion. She'd sigh lightly, taking note of this failure.

"Hmmm.... how about this.." She'd murmur to herself. The girl would attempt to immerse her lower body in chakra. Upon doing such she would utilize the chakra to soften the ground below. The girl had sunk halfway below the ground, leaving her torso, arms and head exposed. Setsuko would exhale slightly, as though she didn't take her failures seriously.

Having understood what she did wrong, the blonde would cloak the entirety of her body in a thin veil of chakra. The amount of chakra that she invested into the technique was perfect, in addition to the balance and proportion to the chakra that she used to cloak her figure. She sunk beneath the ground completely, re-emerging a second later then peering at the orange haired girl.

"Alright.. now that that's done with.. c'mon." She'd state, clasping Violet's hand and running off eagerly toward the mansion.* - Sun Oct  4 17:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) shifted her golden gaze toward Violet, having heard the whisper. She'd keep her frustration to a minimum, though the scowl made it evident that she wasn't pleased with what she just heard. The blonde let out a tense answer. "No.. not now." She'd state, forcing herself to walk away.* - Sun Oct  4 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) walked up to a tree, throwing a quick barrage of kicks at it's perimeter, knocking it out of it's roots and sending it into the wall nearby. She'd shoot forth, smashing her four knuckles into the wall. She left a thick, circular indent in the wall, pulling her bleeding fist away from it.

"Damn it..." The emotionally hurt girl murmured, clenching her teeth and remaining silent as tears dripped from her face. For the first time since she'd gotten defeated by Mizumi, her face looked rabid and wild.* - Sun Oct  4 18:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) wiped her face clean of tears when they'd stop falling, returning to the courtyard in a saunter.* - Sun Oct  4 18:38:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) stormed away, her balled up fists tucked into her pockets.* - Sun Oct  4 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Guarantee she has the audacity to not even follow me and ask why she's frustrating me. - Sun Oct  4 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Was my desire, perhaps my love, directed to the wrong individual? - Sun Oct  4 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) scraped her fingernails of her right hand across the mountainous platform. Her left hand was balled into a fist at her side. She shifted her gaze toward the orange haired female, a rather rabid, if not savage, furious expression printed upon the blonde's features. At the same time it did a good job of concealing her regret and sadness.

"Grrr.." The blonde would grumble, her piercing golden stare setting itself upon her.* - Sun Oct  4 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Come.... here... - Sun Oct  4 22:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) lifted her right hand upright, coiling her fingers around the female's wrist and glaring down at her.

"You have the audacity to tell me you're not ready for relationships then you're sitting here telling people that you couldn't be together with them forever, then saying 'I love you' to Koeki." Her fury grew less reinforced as she spoke. She was toning down a notch because saying what she was saying was bringing sadness to her.

Her voice was slowly weakening.

"I actually was starting to love you... and you practically ignored that feeling..... now I'm left feeling like I chose the wrong person to start loving..." She'd state, her lip curling in displeasure. Her eyes would come to a narrow as though it'd help stop her from crying like she did earlier.

"I...thought that I could bear...not being able to grace everyone in the world.... so... why does it hurt when I can't grace you..?" Her voice was a whisper by the time she said this, regret and pain immersing her tone.* - Sun Oct  4 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: You show so much affection to everyone... but it's practically inept with me. What is it..? Do you hate me that much.....? - Sun Oct  4 22:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) struggled within the forced grasp, some of her anger directed to Violet being calmed. None the less, it made her even sadder.

"I.. don't want to bear seeing you get with someone other than me... why should I even try anymore when you haven't showed -any- interest in me..." She'd murmur, her golden stare focused on the earth at her feet. Setsuko really couldn't bear one-sided love. She wasn't used to not having her affection returned.* - Sun Oct  4 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) wasn't really sure if there was any affection behind the kiss. She was too frustrated emotionally.* - Sun Oct  4 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: I..I want you so badly... it's killing me.. - Sun Oct  4 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) whispers: You need to stop this obession with me... - Sun Oct  4 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) guided her arms toward Violet, attempting to stay close to the female. She'd attempt to hide her face in any manner possible when her tears started flowing, even if it meant placing it against Violet's shoulder.

"I... I don't like being in control of my emotions..!" She'd outcry, trying to stifle her own sobs but failing greatly.* - Sun Oct  4 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Just tone it down ok? If it was meant to happen it will happen ok? - Sun Oct  4 23:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) flushed, her wide, golden gaze setting itself upon Violet. Her hands would tense on their grasp of her shoulders.

"I..really..do... love you. I love you.. Violet..." She had a feeling that she was in love, but it hadn't fully dawned upon her until this point.* - Sun Oct  4 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Do you want tobe with me? - Sun Oct  4 23:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Well you need to calm down with everything you have been doing. No jealousy or anything; then maybe MAYBE I might consider another relationship...  - Sun Oct  4 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: B..But.. - Sun Oct  4 23:45:29 2015

She'd ask, assuming that he could perhaps get his own meal. It looked like he'd survived on his own for awhile. His headband reinforced her faith in his lifestyle.* - Tue Oct  6 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) approached the child, removing her wallet from the confines of her backpouch. She'd hand him a portion of yen that was sufficient for approximately ten bowls of ramen. "Here." She would extend her arm out to the little boy, originally asking him how he was doing lifestyle-wise. The blonde assumed that mentioning such a thng would remind him of his parents, whom, wherever they are, were perhaps difficult to think about for him.
