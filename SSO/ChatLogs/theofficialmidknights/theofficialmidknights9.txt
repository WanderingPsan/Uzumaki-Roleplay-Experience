<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) formed the Clone handsign. A dozen shadow clones emerged from plumes of smoke around her. Shortly after the shadow clones formed, they began to produce handsigns. Each of her shadow clones manifested a rather sufficient amount of chakra from the fractions of the pool that they had in their possession.

One shadow clone removed a trio of shurikens from it's backpouch, emanating them in a decent amount of Fuuton-based wind particles. The clone would eagerly whip the shurikens forth, easily manipulating the pathway in which they moved by using the chakra applied to them. The  shadow clone would utilize the Fuuton chakra around the shurikens to pin them to the tree to Setsuna's left.

Another shadow clone would remove several steel wires from the confines of it's backpouch. The clone would eagerly throw forth the wires, manipulating them by utilizing it's chakra. The wiring would flow around the entirety of the tree, binding the tree trunk's perimeter via. constriction.

Another shadow clone would proceed to form one handsign, building up Fuuton-based chakra. Said shadow clone would produce a small vortex composed of wind partiles, easily uplifting the blades of grass in front of her attack. The blondette would look at her clones, seeing their success as highly impressive.

Her fourth shadow clone would do severla handsigns ebfore building up an immense amount of chakra. The shadow clone kneaded the chakra into wind particles. After doing such, the shadow clone would release an immense wave of Fuuton in front of her. The range was impressive, and unlike the Godly Wind from the Mountains technique, it was much more effective.

Setsuna herself in the meantime would slit her hand slightly, making a cut that wasn't too deep. She'd press her hand to the wound, immersing it in pale, light blue chakra. The chakra would speed up the cellular natural healing rate of the specified area that she immersed in it's glow.* - Sun Sep 20 19:24:09 2015

She'd proceed to hastily go into the mansion, herself and the shadow clones cutting her hair using gathering scissors. Setsuna would simply shorten it to shoulder-length, then proceed to regulate her body temperature utilizing raw chakra. After doing such, she'd place the white and red mask over Noriko's face, checking on her breathing, as well as her pulse. Draping the redhead in a blanket, her four shadow clones would carry the female out, while Setsuna herself would order in a caravan with sufficient yen.* - Sun Sep 20 21:27:02 2015

Setsuna would pay close mind to the female's health, checking her pulse and providing her with a small dose of medicine. The four shadow clones initially carrying her dispersed only after the blondette would set her down. Setsuna would remove the white and red mask from over her face, gazing down at the woman, unease engulfing her.

She stabilized Noriko's body temperature via. chakra once more.* - Sun Sep 20 21:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly dashed from what seemed to be nowhere. She'd attempt to scale the duck's height with a quick suimen-reinforced jump. Forming the Ram handsign, she'd eagerly attempt to close in on Zetsumo and jab her unsheathed tantou through his back, four explosive tags attached to the blade.* - Sun Sep 20 22:17:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) suddenly appeared within the area. She'd rush forth eagerly, forming the Clone handsign and producing a dozen clones, all of which sunk underground, far beyond sensory range. Setsuna herself would speed up her pace, attempting to grab his attention by appearing at his side. She'd apply more momentum, shooting behind the male then accelerating even more, attempting to reappear at his left and thrust through his arm, aiming to stab through his upper body as well.

Four explosive tags were attached to the sword. She was sure enough, with just looking at him, that he wouldn't be damaged by them, but none the less they were important. Regardless if she thrusted through him, she'd form the required handsign for the tags, attempting to activate them and cause a massive detonation, which'd form an immense cloud of smoke.* - Sun Sep 20 22:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) //All clones would disperse, she'd be impaled. Suddenly, 'she' herself would disperse as well, confirming that she'd been a clone all along. Setsuna retained knowledge on anything her clones saw.

Suddenly, a trio of shadow clones shot into the area. One of them briskly shot toward Koeki, aiming to grasp hold of the female and sprint to a place of safety. The other two shadow clones would aim to sink below ground before Zetsumo could notice them, attempting to go beyond his range of sensory as they descended further.* - Sun Sep 20 22:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 

Having received the knowledge she wanted, Setsuna herself was headed to Kirigakure.* - Sun Sep 20 22:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 

One shadow clone ran toward Koeki. It'd form the Ram handsign, attempting to reach a talking distance for the male. "I can heal her, but we need to get away from here." The shadow clone would state the obvious.

Two others shoot from the ground, merciless smirks plastered upon their features. One shadow clone would form the Clone handsign, producing a dozen shadow clones which all shot toward Zetsumo eagerly from his left, aiming to stab through him mercilessly. The other shadow clone would proceed to form a single handsign, attempting to use a small vortex of Fuuton chakra that'd urge Zetsumo toward the shadow clones attempting to barrage him with impales.* - Sun Sep 20 23:03:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) watched as Kenshin kicked the shit out of Zetsumo before her two shadow clones could do anything. They'd disperse, relaying the information to Setsuna. Setsuna herself was by the gates of Kirigakure at this point. Her last remaining shadow clone would briskly move along, carrying Koeki.* - Sun Sep 20 23:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 

The Shadow Clone would place Koeki on her back carefully, before dispersing. Setsuna herself would rush to the female's side, breathing heavily. Even though she was exhausted from her hasty dash to Kirigakure, she wasn't ready to give into her exhaustion though. The blondette would form several handsigns, proceeding to emanate her hands in a light blue glow. She'd press her hands to the areas that Koeki was most inflicted by burns.

Despite this degree of healing, it was likely she'd be unable to heal the burns, but at the very least sanitize her wounds, which'd been exposed to the area. After she saw some signs of improvement, but also a massive drain to her reserves, she'd change to her accustomed rate of healing, attempting to heal the blue haired medic as much as possible. If she'd successfully done a decent job, the girl would breath heavily, struggling to stay conscious. Her vision was extremely blurry, and her body felt empty, lacking of mass.

"D..Damn it.." She'd murmur, trying to stay awake for Koeki's sake. She'd spend only a fourth of a minute trying to recover her bearings, before checking her pulse and temperature, providing her with a small dose of medicine. Shortly after, she'd begin investing some more chakra into stabilizing the female's body temperature, since she'd been burned to near death some time ago.

The girl would lurch forward, slamming her eyes shut partially, struggling to keep consciousness as she'd used so much chakra in such little time.* - Sun Sep 20 23:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) stood to her feet. She'd attempt to leave Koeki to medical personnel, but only if the female showed signs of severe burns. Setsuna herself would head off toward the mansion, but not before preparing a Body Replacement technique nearby Koeki, intending to see the finale of the battle royale that went down.* - Sun Sep 20 23:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) walked up, looking -very- exhausted. She'd drained a load of her chakra in a small bit of time, trying to regulate Koeki's health. She had a Body Replacement set, just in case the tyrant was still alive and killing people. It seemed that the mindless chatter was a sign that he wasn't, though. She'd drop to her knees, breathing heavily, her legs hurting beneath her.

"W..Wow..." She'd murmur, tired out.* - Sun Sep 20 23:34:11 2015
