<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What is that? - Sat Sep 19 14:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) emerged from the ground, simply gazing at them with her red and white kitsune mask. The red scarf coiled around her neck flowed in the breeze.* - Sat Sep 19 14:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: ... - Sat Sep 19 14:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Who's the masked girl? - Sat Sep 19 14:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) lifted a brow slightly beneath the mask. She'd turn away from them, recalling the handsigns that Lera had utilized. The masked individual would proceed to form the handsigns after recalling them. Her hand thrusted into her backpouch, pulling forth several wires. Instead of doing the intended technique, she simply throw the wire, blinking slightly as it did nothing but land on the ground.

She furrowed her brows. The girl would form several handsigns once more. She'd lift the wiring, turning to face the two females, proceeding to throw the wire forth in a brisk movement. The wiring would eagerly coil around Kirie if she didn't get the opportunity to evade. The masked girl would nod slightly, before allowing the grip of the wires to loosen up. It was clear that she was smart. Perhaps her intelligence would make it obliviously clear who she was, to Lera.* - Sat Sep 19 14:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) spoke, her tone slightly distorted by the porcelain mask covering her face. She'd remove it.

"I like it."* - Sat Sep 19 14:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) 
"Well... I can't say everything'll be fine... but, I'm here for you."

Setsuna would extend her arms out to Lera.

"Come here."* - Sat Sep 19 15:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) felt as though the situation was akin to one that underwent before. Only this time, she was consoling Lera. She'd embrace Lera tightly, rubbing the female's back and murmuring soothing words. "I'm.. sorry about you two splitting up.." She'd utter. She'd allow Lera to bawl within her arms. If this had happened months ago, Setsuna would've felt awkward, specifially because she didn't have a good understanding of emotions, or her own emotions, at the time.* - Sat Sep 19 15:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) continued rubbing Lera's back, though eventually she stopped. She'd simply cradle the female in her arms until there were signs of relief in her emotions, rooted from heartbreak.* - Sat Sep 19 15:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) shook her head, smiling lightly.

"It's a much deeper distrust than just breakup. What men have done to me has traumatized me... so I'm always on edge when there's not someone I trust around me.." She'd state, her words becoming more careful. She was unnerved by talking about her past, even subtly.

"Men seem pretty impassive when it comes to our emotions, though.." The girl would remark, drawing a nervous laugh. She was trying to gear the subject away from her history.* - Sat Sep 19 15:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) nodded slightly.

"I've only told Violet so far... so I'm not sure... maybe.." Her wowrds seemed to drift away from her mouth.* - Sat Sep 19 15:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not that you should, I'm glad you have what you do with Violet. - Sat Sep 19 16:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I like knowing that there's someone else that loves me other than myself... it helps me get through hard times.. - Sat Sep 19 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I see... - Sat Sep 19 16:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Alright.. I only have one thing I can teach you, in that case. - Sat Sep 19 23:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) moved forth at a relatively decent rate of momentum. She'd come to a halt when she was at the center of the courtyard, standing upon the gravel at her feet. Her heavy-clad, militaristic pair of black, open-toe sandals tapping across the ground loudly with each step she took to the location. The female would remove the white and red, fox-esque mask concealing her facial features.

Setsuna would rapidly form the Ram handsign, followed by the Tiger handsign at a speed which could be perceived by the normal eye as a slight blur. She'd elaborate upon the technique as she performed it. "You form the Ram and Tiger handsign.. then build up your chakra and.." The blondette would spew a gooey, translucent, water-like liquid with a turquoise outline toward the area in front of her. The stream of kneaded chakra would land on the ground, but instead of seeping into it, it'd solidify into what seemed to be a syrupy field of movement halting structure.

"Then you knead your chakra into this sticky substance and release it. It works well on people who don't have the reflexes, or the ability to perform the Surface Walking technique, in time at least. It's efficient for followup attacks, and slowing people down, at most."* - Sat Sep 19 23:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Mhm, perfect. - Sat Sep 19 23:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uh.. you're welcome.. - Sat Sep 19 23:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Violet, should we go train? - Sat Sep 19 23:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) exhaled slightly.

"Guess not." The female would state, before manifesting the Ram handsign using brisk hand movements, vanishing in thick, red mist.* - Sat Sep 19 23:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) noticed how fond she was of the waterfall. The blondette would proceed to allow the white feline on her right shoulder the entire time to slide off into the water, swimming to the shoreline and walking off into the distance. Setsuna would remove several kunai from her beige backpouch, attaching steel wiring to the end and whipping them forth. Performing basic weaponry manipulation via. the usage of her chakra, she'd allowing the kunai to change the trajectory of their aim, rotating around the tree and thus coiling the wire attached to the end of them around it.

The kunai dangled from the wiring coiled around the external of the tree trunk.* - Sat Sep 19 23:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) stepped toward the tree slowly. She'd unravel the kunai from it's trunk, removing the wiring from the ends of the weaponry. She'd distance herself from the tree trunk, then proceed to utilize the wiring in order to shoot forth at a rapid pace and coil around the tree tightly. Upon succession she'd tighten the constriction of the wiring around the tree. She could easily notice the wiring beginning to indent into it's bark. She released the wiring from around the tree, allowing said steel wires to recede. The blonde would proceed to shoot the wiring forth like tendrils once more, utilizing her raw chakra to manipulate them.

She succeeded once more, watching as the wires made a series of rotating trips around the tree. The wires constricted the tree once more, indenting the bark with their tight constriction. When she attempted to tighten their constriction, the wires simply broke. She'd shift her gaze toward Violet, her pinkish purple gaze slightly recognizable even with her mask on.* - Sun Sep 20 00:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Hey Violet! - Sun Sep 20 00:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) removed her ANBU mask, smiling brightly. "Mhm.. it's me." She'd state. She placed her mask within her backpouch, approaching Violet. "How was your rest?" The blondette would ask, shortly after recalling that they last spoke before Violet headed home to sleep. Setsuna seemed very comfortable within her new outfit, considering it didn't expose any of her assets. That didn't mean her profile didn't, though. Hint hint wink wink.* - Sun Sep 20 00:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Lera told me she'd be fine with me telling her about my past too... but I'm not sure yet. You're the only one I've told... so it's kinda special for me.. - Sun Sep 20 00:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) hopped toward Violet. She seemed much more swift than she was before, and more keen with her surroundings. The female pressed her lips to Violet's, embracing the brunette. She'd break away from the kiss after a few moments, whispering into Violet's ear.* - Sun Sep 20 00:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: He could easily alter the winds around Kirigakure or even the battlefield, making it dangerous if not hazerdous to fly. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: But he also has a limit. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: One person flying would only make them aim for Hassan . - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: We will need another.. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I can fly to a limit. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Hassan doesn't have to be flying to do this... - Sun Sep 20 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: If Hassan teaches me some fuuton-based techniques I can assist. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: But Zetsumo's elements may nulify his . - Sun Sep 20 02:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I possess Doton, Fuuton and Suiton as of late. - Sun Sep 20 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Wind and Water for stronger water attacks. - Sun Sep 20 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Raiton and Suiton are more effective.. - Sun Sep 20 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Not really...Wind powered Suitin could easily negate the Raiton in that combination. - Sun Sep 20 02:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: suiton* - Sun Sep 20 02:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Raiton conducts Suiton regardless. - Sun Sep 20 02:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Unless Hassan is the one providing us with the Fuuton and Suiton combination it'll still conduct Raiton.. - Sun Sep 20 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: We can use our genjutsu... - Sun Sep 20 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: He's probably sufficient against Genjutsu... you know that right? - Sun Sep 20 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Never hurts to try. - Sun Sep 20 02:07:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Guess I'm trying alone then. - Sun Sep 20 02:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) sits there struggling. She couldn't break away from Koeki's grip at all.* - Sun Sep 20 02:08:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Huh..? Thanks.. - Sun Sep 20 02:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: It's not good enough. - Sun Sep 20 02:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Im only good with close range fighting... If I can get close to him I tould try to fight him hand to hand... - Sun Sep 20 02:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well I need my rest. - Sun Sep 20 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) didn't have Toe Fighter, Rebound, or any perk that assisted her with getting flung away by someone with strength. She was also pretty small, weight and height wise, so she simply went flying away in mid-air, discombobulated. It seemed that her motor function had betrayed her. She'd slam into the ground back-first, gasping for air loudly as the throw knocked the wind out of her.

She waited a few moments to regain her bearings, as well as her breath, before sitting up. She'd attempt to stand to her feet, and swivel on the gravel below her. The blondette huffed slightly. "I give in.." She'd say with a small groan. The girl could've closed the distance between herself and Koeki, but she already knew this was an uphill battle. She couldn't find any flaws or openings in Koeki's fighting style, something that, as an intellectual individual, surprised her.* - Sun Sep 20 02:15:02 2015
