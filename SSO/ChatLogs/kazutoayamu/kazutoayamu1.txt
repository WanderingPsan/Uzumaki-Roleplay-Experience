It was clear that the shots were being fired both ways which caused him to chuckle a bit "Well, anyway, I wanted to talk to you about something but I can return once you guys consumate the declaration of love or are you going to reject a fair maidens feelings?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) lets go of her hand.* - Thu Dec 10 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: But you don't -want- me to touch it. - Thu Dec 10 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: It does not matter. - Thu Dec 10 05:13:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Will you answer me? - Thu Dec 10 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Particularly no - Thu Dec 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: But you won - Thu Dec 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You get to have something you want from me - Thu Dec 10 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: ... - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I see. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Would you care for something to drink? - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Sake? - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I only drink sake. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Sure. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I think I have some in my house. - Thu Dec 10 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) continued on chewing the thing that she had given him and zipped up his coat once again then moved toward his home expecting her to follow him.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Woah, this is like the biggest house in this village! - Thu Dec 10 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) notes that his home is more or less a mess as it signifies a sad existance since it was more or less dirty and there were not many things in the home just the bare bone essentials. Leading her to the kitchen he offered her a seat as he walked over to a cabinet and pulled out two cups as he did not have saucers >Do I have any?< he asked himself as he closed that cabinet and began to search through the rest not really having any luck >Hmm.< he thought to himself as he walked over to the table and placed one cup infront of her then set on where he was seated and walked over to the fridge and in the very back a lonely white bottle stood there "You dont mind if it is cold do you?" he asked her as he pulled out the bottle.* - Thu Dec 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) would like to point out there even though the house was more or less a mess there were a -few- things that were clean like the dishes he used, the bathroom and his bed. Everything else he did not really care for and it showed. 

"There is a first time for everything." he replied to her as he served her a decent amount of sake but did not give himself any as he just placed the bottle on the table and sat down "If you want more help yourself."* - Thu Dec 10 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) shook his head as he brought his hand up to unzip his coat opening it fully as he was in the "comfort" of his home "It is rather hard for me to hold liquids in." he commented as he hoped that she would know what he was refering to."* - Thu Dec 10 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) shook his head once again "I avoid it as it is rather embarrassing to have to clean myself everytime I drink something or injest anything with fluid. I cannot eat Ramen for obvious reasons." The sake was not poisoned so she had nothing to worry about.* - Thu Dec 10 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) leaned forward and brought his hands up infront of his chest using his elbows to rest on the table and locked his hands together "Wierd? I would not say weird. You have the same amount of humanity I have so I would say that we are alike in some way shape or form."* - Thu Dec 10 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Are we speaking about humanity as a whole or the humanity that you keep inside you? - Thu Dec 10 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And I did not say that we are something alike not fully. - Thu Dec 10 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I have some sort of humanity left as I do not transform when I need to. - Thu Dec 10 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh... well both I guess? Humanity is different than what I thought is all. - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: So you are human most of the time? - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Yes. - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I chose when I can transform. - Thu Dec 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: And I can chose when I can change back. - Thu Dec 10 06:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: If you are done with the Sake in your cup you can get more. - Thu Dec 10 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: If you are done with the Sake in your cup you can get more. - Thu Dec 10 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Tingly? - Thu Dec 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: What do you mean by tingly? - Thu Dec 10 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Like numb and falling over and stuff. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know you very well so I shouldn't drink that much. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Drunk? - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You mean you get drunk? - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...yes, that. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Drunk. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: New word. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: There is nothing word with that. - Thu Dec 10 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: wrong* - Thu Dec 10 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: It is something normal that happens. - Thu Dec 10 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Yes but it makes a person weak, makes it so you can't control chakra properly. - Thu Dec 10 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Does it? - Thu Dec 10 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Some people benefit from being drunk. - Thu Dec 10 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...they do? - Thu Dec 10 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Yes. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: How? - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Maybe you have not gotten drunk enough. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: They tend to be unpredictable. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...but how? - Thu Dec 10 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) thinks: This just sounds like a trick to get me drunk. - Thu Dec 10 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Their movements become faster and unpredictable. - Thu Dec 10 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: They attack allies and foe alive. - Thu Dec 10 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: Because they cant distinguish them. - Thu Dec 10 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: ...Oh. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't think that would work for me. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: I become slow and fall over a lot and things. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: You do not seem to be very well versed in taijutsu are you? - Thu Dec 10 06:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yuriko(TenaciousRiven) says: Not really no. - Thu Dec 10 06:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) says: I can sense that you have a high amount of chakra. - Thu Dec 10 06:59:50 2015
