<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) raised his brow once again as he seemed to have struck some repressed memory "Are you ok?" he asked her not really wanted an answer since he could see that he was clearly not ok "Would you like some water?" he continued as he stood up and focused his sensing abilities on her just in case she wanted to use ninjutsu in his fucked up home "Is there anything I can do for you?"* - Thu Dec 10 07:12:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) walked over to her and slowly began to move his hand toward her back to attempt to pat it. At first he was weary of it since he did not know how she would react but then went ahead and placed a hand frimly on her back since he figured that he would have the upper hand when it came to a physical showdown "Listen to me." he told her as he leaned in to almost whisper in her ear "I do not know what happened but do not let a single word trigger. I do not know your past but I can tell you that if you let words grow out of proporsion they will haunt you for a long time to come." Of course he was ready to react to any form of agression coming from her part since he had his sensing abilities focused on her just in case.* - Thu Dec 10 07:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) moved his hand up to begin caressing her hair "We are in the middle of my kitchen where there are no mirrors. If you let words rule over your life it will become a living nightmare. Take it from me. Most of my life I grew up hearing 'Monster" "Freak" Abomination" and many more words, if I would have let those words rule over my life I would not be were I am now. I know it is not easy to get over it but you must make an attempt to do it or suffer this hell."  He would continue caresing her head as he told her this since this was his only way to provide some sort of comfort as he went through more or less the same things she did "Would like to continue living in this nightmare? Or will you wake up and see what the a more pleasant picture Yuriko."* - Thu Dec 10 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) stopped caressing her hair as she seemed to have calmed down from how she was just a few moments ago "Do you want to know how I got these scars?" he asked her as he began to undergo his transformation. Along his spine would grow a black fin that would be more or less compressed against his clothing since well he was still wearing his suit, the pores under his eyes and all along his body would begin to change as well as he began to resemble an eel as the transformation when on. When everything was said and done he would bring his hand up to the same height as he head and brought his index finger and tumb closer together forming a tiny spark "I told you that I received my first shock when I was eight years old. I used to hate the sound it would create, i used to hate how it felt as it ran through my body but look at me now. Here I stand in full control of it. If I would have sat around skulking over the people that did this to me I would not have gotten far in life."* - Thu Dec 10 08:14:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) raised a brow as he saw her transform into more of a woman >Interesting.< he thought to himself as he stood there watching her. It is worth noting that he was not really surprised since he grew a fin out of his back.* - Thu Dec 10 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) brought his hand up to lift up her head so that he could look into her eyes and it is worth mentioning that he didnt have to worry about the electricity he was emitting since well she seemed not to be affected by it. "Listen to me. You can be whoever you want. You said that he broke you and made you into a doll. You may hate being a doll but it is what you are. You can be anyone you want. You said that Yuriko stuck the longest but perhaps you might want to be Kaori, or Tachibana. You can look at it as a bad thing or you can look at it as something good. What do you say?"* - Thu Dec 10 08:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) brought his hand down to his side and continued staring at her "So who will you be? If you continue being Yuriko you shall continue living in the past but if you move on and chose to be someone new you might not feel the way you do." Taking in a deep breath after he had finished telling her that he exhaled slowly and moved back to his seat "I may not know what I am talking about but if you hate being a doll but want to continue being one then I offer a simple solution to you. Become my doll and live in this house, come and go as you please and become your own person as time goes by. Or continue down the path you are going down. The choice is yours." he told her as he once again brought his hands up infront of him and locked them together "You and I are somewhat alike so I can partially understand what you have gone through."* - Thu Dec 10 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) would give the equivalent of a smirk since well he lacked cheeks as they were mostly scared and one was gone "I am glad that you made a decision Yuriko. You see moments ago you were stuck in the past trembling at mentioning of a single word and now you are proud of what you are and seem to be looking forward to ti so congratulations. As for the other thing, sometimes people just need a push to help them realize what they want. In this particular situation I was the one that gave that little push." he told her as he then began to think to himself >Not that I really wanted another person in this house...I mean..look at it....not even rats would dare come in here...the place is so void of hope...< which then lead to a shake of his head and a sigh.* - Thu Dec 10 09:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) would have been pacing back and forth waiting for Yuriko to come out of the place where she was and when he saw her he would have blinked twice as he was rather shocked by how she looked but only for a few moments as he then reached into his backpouch and pulled out a rag that he was going to use as a bandage if need be but instead walked over toward Yuriko and began to wipe off her mouth of the excess blood "Look at you Yu-chan." he commented as he was carefull enough not to get his white coat dirtied with blood "You really seemed to have had a good time in there didnt you?" he asked teasingly as he continued to wipe her down.* - Fri Dec 11 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) saw and felt as she shuddered "Are you ok?" he asked her as he moved his hand back from her face meaning that he stopped cleaning it "Would you like to go somewhere else? Would you want to take a shower? You are covered in blood Yu-chan, I think that a bath would be nice and relaxing, dont you think?" he asked as he went back to cleaning her face >Her skin is soft for what it is worth.< he thought to himself as he stared at her > I would be more surprised but then again I did cook someone to death by running electricity through their body so eh.< This last thought would have caused him to chuckle a bit as the memory of that event seemed kind of funny to him.* - Fri Dec 11 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) nodded once and took a step back "Well, are you sure you do not want to take something extra for the road?" he asked teasingly as he folded the rag and placed it into his backpouch and extended out his hand toward her so that she could take it."

Once he entered the room he opened his coat and took it off then threw it on a bed that was big enough to accomadate him comfortably, there was also a single closet that had just two other coats hanging from two hangers other than that the room was cleaner than the rest of the house since he slept there and who wants to sleep in a dirty room.

Walking toward the bathroom he opened the door and motioned for her to follow him "The warm water is the one on the right, the cold one is on the left." he informed her so that she could take a relaxing shower.* - Fri Dec 11 04:17:16 2015

It may not be as relaxing as a tub but it still serves the same purpose."  Walking away from the bathroom he would head to the drawer that was under the closet and opened it which allowed him to reach for a lonely folded towel that was there as it was his back up towel for when his main towel was being washed and dried. Walking over to the bathroom he would place the towel on the edge of the sink and once that was done he would look at her "You don't feel temperature?" he asked her rather curious as this was something new to him.* - Fri Dec 11 04:37:45 2015

They can feed on the fish when they need to and I can come an visit them any time I want.< Standing up he would shake his hand to get the excess water off and stepped back a bit as he began to mold and kneed his chakra within his body as he was preparing to execute a jutsu.

Bringing his hands up to his chest he would send the chakra he was molding and kneeding toward his palms he would begin to clear his mind >I need to start focusing my chakra to hold the shape of the jutsus I use. Like the lightning ball jutsu. I need to get better at using that and all my jutsus since I will be constantly using them. This will help increase the mastery of the jutsus so I will be able to use them with much ease and I will not have any trouble controlling them.< Separating his hands a bit so that there would be a small space between them he would begin increase the amount of chakra he was molding and kneeding in his palms

>Will this training be hard? Will it be worth it? How long will it take me to master this training? I wonder if I will get better by doing this.< he thought to himself  separated his hands a bit and began to send out chakra in small amounts so that he could control the shape of the jutsu slowly so that it would not get out of hand >Keep the round shape of the jutsu. Do it nice and slowly at first.< he told himself as he separated his hands slowly so that the ball could grow a bit more >Keep it under control, if it gets too out of hand just cease the jutsu so that I do not get myself hurt or anyone that might get in the way. I also do not want the jutsu to land on the water to not damage the fish that are swimming in the water.<

Separating his hands more and more he would send out more chakra causing the ball to grow in size once again causing the ball to crackle and spark as the amount of raiton that was in the jutsu had increased. >I can see that I have a bit more control over this jutsu as it seems that well it does not seem like it, it acutally feels better and I have more control over it which is nice.< As he was having the lively conversation in his head the jutsu began to get out of controlas he had stopped focusing on the jutsu and started focusing more on his thoughts. As soon as he noticed this he would quickly push those thoughts to the back of his head and focused on the jutsu once again.

Separating his hands fully now he would allow the ball of lightning to grow to its full size and stared as it took a round shape >Good job.< he told himself as he focused on keeping the shape of the ball >Remember that you must not get cocky, this will get challenging so you have to give it your best.< Turning his body to look at the wooden post that was nearby he would launch the jutsu at it and had it impact against the wood causing sparks to fly out because of the impact >Good enough for today, tomorrow I will continue with this training of my so for today I need to get some rest.< Looking at the water one last time he began to walk toward the center of town where everyone congregated in.* - Fri Dec 11 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Brought his hands up to his chest and took in a deep breath of air as he cleared his mind >I am sick of just standing around, all i do is nothing but stare at the water of talk to Eiyu. What the fuck, all he talks about is doing things for what could be concidered the greater 'good'. Foolish ideals but to each their own.< Beginning to send chakra up to his palms he would continue to take deep breaths of air >Better get started.< he told himself as he closed his eyes and focused on the task at hand.

>Infuse Raiton into your chakra, focus the shape of the jutsu into a ball, make sure to make it a decent enough size while keeping in mind your current chakra pool.< Spreading his hands apart slightly he would begin to send out his chakra to the space that was created between his hands >Mold it into a ball, slowly begin to build it up. Create it through your hands and control your chakra.< Taking a deep breath of air as he was doing and thinking this, he would remain controlling and molding his chakra so that it would take the proper shape and size he desired.

>Begin to expand it, send the proper amount of chakra toward the small nall that you are forming. Once you have done that make sure that you keep the shape of the ball for a while before sending it off toward whatever target you choose to go after.< Slowly separating his hands a bit the small ball of Raiton infused chakra would grow grow a bit bigger and would begin to crackle and spar as more raiton and chakra were being poured into the jutsu that he was in the process of creating.

Separating his hands a bit more now he would pour more chakra with Raiton infused into it >Keep an eye on your chakra pool, do not over exhert your chakra so that you do not end up like last time during your spar against Hachirou where you could barely stand up afterward.< Hearing the crakling of the raiton infused chakra ball he would separate his hand more and more until the ball was of a decent size to where he considered it worthy enough to be thrown >Pick your target wisely and remember that in the future targets will be on the move.<

Keeping the ball between the space that was created between his hands he would scan around the area for a proper target Hmm, I do not want to throw it into the wate because of the risk of killing anything that mght be swimming thre, which would result in my eels having less to eat which would not benefit anyone< Deciding to target the same wooden post that he had targeted last time he would launch the ball toward it and watched as traveled through the air untill it impacted the post sending sparks everywhere and burning the post a bit.* - Fri Dec 11 13:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Arrived at the lake/pond thing that was located in the bottom part of Kumogakure, he would look around to see if he would spot iyu or Hachirou since they all usually hung out near the lake/pond thing. >Hmm, they are not here, oh well.< he thought to himself as he began to kneed and mold his chakra inside of his lungs >Lets practice with katon now since I have practiced enough with raiton and I do not want to fall behind with my katon release. It would be a good thing to be proficient in all aspects, Katon, Raiton and taijutsu...among other things as well but for now I am going to focus on just those three.<

Continueing to mold and kneed his chakra in his lungs he would look at the water and brought his hands up to perform a handseal so that he could execute the technique when it was ready to be released. >Katon is tricky. I cannot mold it inside of my body since it requires me to expell the chakra out of my body so my chakra control needs to be spot on so that I will not have any trouble controlling and keeping the shape of the jutsu. That being said I need to make sure that I do not lose control of the justu. Even if I do I am near a water source so that will really help out if things go sour.< he thought to himself as he continued to kneed and mold his chakra.

Inhaling deeply he would infuse the chakra that was being kneeded and molded within his lungs into the air that was coming into his system and would continue to hold the handseal so that the jutsu could be activated. Once the air left his body the katon natured chakra would begin to ignite the air and would create a small stream of fire that he would control with hi chakra >Keep it focused, do not let it lose its shape, I know that this is harder that it looks but you can do it. Do not lose control of the shape of the stream, you can do this.<

Continueing to spew out more fire he would find it hard to keep up since the technique was limited to the capacity of air that his lungs had >Damn.< he said to himself as the technnique came to an end because of the air in his lungs was ran out. >Now there is an even bigger limitation since well I need to keep a constant amount of air to keep the jutsu going.< Breaking the seal he would begin to inhale deeply again as he formed the handseal once again as he began to kneed and mold the chakra withing his lungs. >You can do this Akito, just focus on the task at hand.< he thought to himself as he continued to mold his chakra.

>One more time.< he thought to himself as he exhaled the air that had acummulated within his lungs and created the stream of flames as the katon infused air left his body > Same thing as before, keep the stream in control. >Keep your chakra in a set path or course so that you do not lose control of it.< Nearing the limit of air he had left in his lungs he would stop the tehnique as he broke the handseal >Good enough for now, I shall continue this at a later date since I have much to learn still.< Turning around he would begin to walk toward the center of town where everyone would congregate in >Hopefully there is no one there.< he told himself as he truely hoped that no one would speak to him* - Fri Dec 11 14:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Once again finding himself infront of the lake/pond thing, he would let out a small sigh since he had spent his day doing absolutely nothing other than doing nothing at all >What a waste of time, I have become less productive ever since I started speaking to people. Ugh, infuriating.< Kneeling down to look at his reflection in the water and would sigh once again and stand up >Infuriating.< he thought to himself as he cleared his mind. Bringing his hands up, he would perfom a set of handseals and inhaled as deeply as he could so that he could get enough air into his system.

>This next jutsu requires me to create individual balls of fire that I can control with my chakra so it will require me to hold the shape of the orbs, now how many orbs I create is completely up to me and my chakra pool so I have to keep that in mind.< Kneeding and molding the chakra in his lungs as well as kneeding chakra into it >Start off by forming one or two balls of fire so that you can get the hand of the jutsu and so that you know what to expect and what not to expect from it. Also make sure to have the target in mind since striking the wooden post wont do you any good since it can catch on fire and the would end up very badly.<

Beginning to exhale he would create a small fireball that would be sent forward to travel above the water >Keep it in control, keep the shape of it.< he thought to himself as he controlled the fire ord to make a right turn as it traveled above the water. Having the fireball keep on its intended path he would think to himself >This is harder than it looks, I do not think that I can keep it up for much longer.< At that time the fireball would begin to lose control and fall down to the water bellow, causing steam to appear as that is what happens when water gets to its boiling point due to the fire crashing down into the water.

>Damn it.< he thought to himself as he broke the handseal. Inhaling and exhaling normally he began to think to himself >This is not as easy as I thouht it would be, my chakra control leaves much to be desired but that is what training is for. One day I will be able to get this done wthout even struggling...when that happens I will be able to do much, much more.< Bringing his hands up and inhaling deeply to prepare to execute the jutsu one more time since he was no quitter and he wanted to get his training done so that he could progress even further >Keep at it and you will progress beyond what you imagine.<

Doing the required handseals and kneeding as well as molding his chakra inside of his lungs he would exhale the air out having it ignite. Controlling the chakra that ignited, he would hold and control the shape and trajectory of the fireball in an attempt to hold it for a much longer time than his previous attempt but failed because of his inexperience with the jutsu that he was using which caused the fire balls to crash into the water that was infront of him >Fuck.< he thought to himself as he cursed his inexperience with the jutsu >One day I will be able to master it and I wont have to struggle.< he thought to himself as he decided to call it a day.* - Fri Dec 11 14:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Arrived at the lake/pond thing that was located within the village of kumogakure and stared at the water as he brought his right hand up to grab onto the zipper that held his coat closed >This missions are beyond stupid, god damn it why the hell do these missions exist? Fuck it, it does not even matter I will just focus on my training for now.< Molding and kneeding his chakra within his body as he infused raiton to it >Enough with katon training since Raiton is easier for me to cotrol and shape and I am more familiar with the element.<

Taking a couple of steps away from the lake/pond thing so that the technique he was going to use would not affect the ecosystem down bellow. Kneeling down as he continued to mold and kneed his chakra within his body >This was one of the first jutsus I learned so it should be more than easy to get it done.< Brining his palms down to rouch the ground bellow him he prepared to use the just once he was ready to release it >Mold your chakra a bit more.< he told himself as he began to send it to his palms.

>This technique naturally comes in very handy once I think about it but it still has its flaws since it only covers the ground so anyone that manages to get off the ground would be free and unaffected by the technique. I need to come up with a way to counter that flaw in the jutsu one of these days.< Sending out his chakra into the ground he would work deligently to weave the chakra infused raiton to form the spider web that the technique made. >Cover as much ground as possible, focus on having all the area around you covered to provide as much protetion as possible. No blindspots with this technique.<

Sending out the chakra in a straight line to all known cardenal points and began to weave out his electric web. First off he started from the location nearest to him making a pentagin or whatever shape the spider web shape was called and began to conect it to the lines that ran down the length of the cardenal points then began to weave the jutsu. > There are flaws with this technique and I could see them but when I grow stronger I will be able to cover that one flaw with something better.< Looking around as the weaving was in process, he made sure that no one would have been affected by the jutsu since it would deliver an electric discharge to them.

Once he saw that the technique was not going to affect anyone he would continue on weaving the web until the jutsu had been completed. >Hmm.< he thought to himself as he kept the shape of the jutsu going for a while longer before he decided to end it. >I can do better.< he thought to himself as he slowly stood up and walked toward the lake/pond thing >I still  need to do those fucking missions, infuriating isn't it? Very infuriating.< Reaching into his coat he would take out a mission scroll and began to read it.* - Fri Dec 11 20:26:11 2015

I have never done anything for anyone so why start now?< he asked himself as he continued to walk up the wall keeping his chakra in control >Where do I even begin looking? These mountains are baren.

>Did I really just say...oh god...what is wrong...something is very very wrong with me. Maybe I should get away from her more.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) >I still have yet to do those fucking missions.< he thought to himself as he stood on the shoreline looking at the water >My training is preofresing just fine, I can feel myself grow stronger with every day that goes by but I am still by no means strong.< Turning around he walked toward the nearest mountain and leaned against its rocky wall surface >Should I continue to traing with Katon jutsus?< he asked himself as he wanted to see if he could find the answer he was looking for >Raiton is something I have some sort of mastery over so it is easier for me to use but if I just focus on that my katon would be lacking.<

Sighing and shaking his head he knew that he had found his answer >Katon it is.< he thought to himself as he pushed off the rock wall and walked back toward the lake/pond thing and stood at the shore line once again. Brining one hand up to the zipper that held his coat closed he would fiddle with it a bit >Which jutsu should I use?< he asked himself as he was unsure as to waht jutsu to use >Most of these require many handseals so it will take a relative long time to execute. Of course there are some exceptions to this as there is jutsu in my arsenal that only requires one handseal.< he thought to himself as he opened his coat.

Taking in deep breaths of air he would bring his hands up to perfomr the Tiger handseal >Same thing as with the previous Katon jutsu, create a stream of fire and keep it in a cone shape. This jutsu is supposed to be a lot more potent than the other one so I have some work to do.< Taking in an even bigger amount of air so that he could start kneeding, molding and infusing his chakra into the air that was being stored in his lungs with katon natured chakra.> Control the rate in which you are releasing the air so that the jutsu can last longer.< he thought to himself as he was still kneeding and molding his chakra. Looking at the water that was infront of him he prepared to execute the jutsu.

Exhaling slowly he would activate and release the jutsu. Holding the Tiger handseal he would release the air and had it ignite thanks to the ckara that had been infused in the air >Start controlling the jutsu into a cone shape.< The stream of fire would travel above the water and caused some to evaporate because of the heat that the flame was lettig off >This is harder than it seems.< he told himself as the stream of fire seemed to be getting out of hand due to the lack of control from his part >Shit.< he thought to himself once again as he struggled to keep the stream of fire in a cone shape.

Ceasinf the jutsu he would break the Tiger handseal, by doing this he would begin to breath normally >Fuck.< he said to himself as he stared forward at the water >I need to increase my understanding with the Katon element, this happening is very infuriating.< he thought to himself as he walked back toward the rock wall and leaned against it when he got near it >This cannot continue happening, it will not happen again.< he told himself to feel better about the fact that he could not keep the jutsu in a set shape for a long time.* - Sat Dec 12 22:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Leaning against the wall he would look around trying to see if he could spot Hachirou or Eiyu since he had not een them in a couple of days >Wonder where they went. i have not seen them around in a while, I wonder if they are still alive. I know that Eiyu is fine since he holds the title of Raikage but as for Hachirou I really do not kow. He might be alive or he might be dead.< Shaking his head he cleared his thoughts away and began to think of what jutsu to train next >Raiton is my strong suit.< he began >But working on my Katon really helps me progress further with my abilities so fuck. Decision, decision.<

>I will alternate a jutsu per practice, that way I can get the best of both worlds.< Crouching down he would reach for the zipper that held his coat closed and pulled on it opening up his coat >I also need to work on my marksmanship skills. That however will have to wait and will be for another time as I need to master this. Once I am done then I will continue to better my marksman skills.< Beggining to send chakra to the palms of his hands he began to mold and kneed it. >This jutsu is rather easy to use and it does not require any handseals to make, also it is a medium to long range jutsu so it is nice to have in my arsenal as I can surprise people with it.< Pushing off the wall and standing up he would turn to face the wooden post that he had been using as a target.

Bringing his hands up to his chest he would begin to focus more chakra onto them as he created a small gap between his two hands >Keeping the shape of the ball should be easier now that I have progressed with my abilities.< he thought to himself. Molding the chakra that was accumulating in his palms he would send out a bit of chakra so that the jutsu and theball could begin to take form >Keep a constant eye on the jutsu, do not let it get out of control like the Katon jutsus.< he told himself as he sent more chakra to his palms as he prepared to execute the jutsu.

Separating his hands from each other a bit more he would slowly begin to release chakra so that the ball would start to grow >Controlling this particular jutsu is easy but I do not want to get cocky as there is still room for error.< he told himself as he began to hear the ball crakle and saw it as it began to spark due to the amount of Raiton in the jutsu that was increasing >I used to hate that sound.< he thought to himself as he separated his hands a bit more releasing an even greater amount of chakra into the forming ball. >Things change.< he thought to himself as it implied that he no longer hated the crackling sound.

Separating his palms fully now he would allow the ball of lightning that was growing in the space between his palms to grow to its full size >Keep the spherical shape, do not let it get out of control.< he thought to himself as he held the ball between his hands. Focusing on keeping the spherical shape of the jutsu he would begin to think to himself >I wonder when I will be done with this training.< then turned his body to face the wooden post and sent the ball toward it. After the ball struck its target he went off to do other things as he had decided to call it a day* - Sat Dec 12 23:05:20 2015
