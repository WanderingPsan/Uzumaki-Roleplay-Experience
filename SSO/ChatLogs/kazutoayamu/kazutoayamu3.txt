<br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Arrived at the lake/pond thing that most of the shinobi in the village seemed to tkae up as the new "chilling" spot. Looking around he was hapy that no one was around >Damn that Eiyu.< he thought to himself as he began to mold and kneed his chakra within his lungs >This used to be a 'sanctuaty' of mine where I coul dcome and do nothing without having to interact with people but then came along Eiyu and with that he ended my 'sanctuary' where I could be alone and in peace.< It was very clear that he was not happy at all about this since he did not really enjoy any for of social interaction.

Kneeding and molding his chakra within his lungs he began to regulate his breathing so that he could slowly begin expainding his lungs in hopes of being able to accumulate more air than usual.>I need to find a new plae where my eels and I can be in peace, but that cannot happen any more since well thanks to Eiyu this place has become everyones favorite spot. I really need to find a new one.< Continueing on with his breathing exercise he also continue to kneed and mold his chakra within his lungs >This technique requires an unsually high amount of chakra and whoever said that was right because it does.

Executing six handselas Tiger ---> Ram ---> Monkey ---> Boar ---> Horse ---> Tiger as he continued to mold and kneed his chakra within his lungs >Just a little more.< he thought to himself as he was doing all of this >Just a couple more days of this training and I feel as if something might happen or I will be able to do a lot more things than I can do at this moment.< Taking in a deep breath of air he would hold it within his lungs as he molded and kneeded his chakra for a final time as he was about ready to release the jutsu that he had been preparing.

Bringin up his right hand to unzip his coat he would use that same hand to form a circle infront of his mouth with his index finger and thumb then began to blow the air out of his mouth through the circle he had created which caused the chakra to ignite infront of him. Using his chakra to control the shape of the jutsu he would slowly but surely begin to mold the jutsu into a spherical shape that started off small but would begin to grow bigger and bigger as the seconds went by >Keep it in control. he told himself.

Molding the fire into the shape that he wanted which was a spherical one he began to think to himself >This is taxing.< as he felt a chunck of his chakra go missiong because of the jutsu that he was in the process of creating. As the fireball grew to its full size it would begin to evaporate the water bellow it due to the heat that was emanating from the jutsu. Launching the jutsu forward he had it impact the water that was infront of him causing a whole lot of stam to rise to the air. Once satisfied with his work he would turn around and walk toward the center of town.* - Sat Dec 12 23:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Arrived at the lake/pond thing, he looked at the water ahead of him as he brought up his hands to unzip his coat open revealing the belt of kunais that hung at his waist as well as the many kunais that he had stored in the compartments in his suit. >I need to have someone make me special receptors so that I can use or send my elecricity to them once my Kunai have impacted them.< he thought to himself as he brought his hands up to his chest and separated them a bit. Beginning to send chakra toward his palms he would begin to kneed and mold his chakra as he stared at the water that was ahead of himself.

>Using electricity to my advantage I will certainly have the advantage and it will be my trump cards of sorts, but I must be careful not to reveal it to other people. I have been lucky enough to only have revealed my special ability infront of Hachirou but he did not notice anything thanks to my outfit. Smirking a bit he conitnue to mold and kneed chakra in his palms as he stood there staring at the water >There are so many things I want to do and achieve but I need to train hard and get stronger for that to happen. One day I will do it.< he thought to himself as he continued to kneed and mold his chakra.

Separating his hands a bit he would send out his chakra and formed it into a ball >These new people seem troublesome, I do not know if Eiyu should have allowed them to stay here.< he thought to himself. Keeping the small bit of chakra into a ball he would have slowly separated his hands and sent out a bit more chakra causing the ball to grow a tiny bit more >Eiyu seems to be fucking up but that is just my personal opinion that no one really cares for but oh well. I will leave this place as soon as I get enough training done.< Controling the ball to keep its shape he would look at it >This surely is easier that the first time I did it.<

Looking up at the water that was infront of him he separated his hands a bit more so that the ball can grow to a medium size causing it to crackle and spark due to the increased amount of raiton that was accumulating within the growing ball >What will I do when I leave?< he asked himself as he looked down at the crackling and sparking ball >Where will I go? At least here I have somewhere to stay but out there I would have nothing, not that I mind but it will e a hastle to say the least.< Turning his body to target the wooden post he would level his hands a bit.

Separating his hands a lot more now allowing it to grow to its full size causing it to crackle and spark with a greater frequency >I will find out what the future holds for me as time pases by.< he told himself as he focused on the wooden post that was directly infront of him but was quite a distance away. >Having this stationary targets really does not help me much at all but it is still very good practice non the less.< Shooting the lightning ball toward the wooden post he would watch as the ball crackled and sparked through the air until it impacted its target >Good enough.< he thought to himself as he zipped his coat back up and walked away.* - Sat Dec 12 23:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Arriving at the training field now he decided to mix things up a bit since well staring at the water was getting kind of boting and he did not like the fact that the lake/pond thing was a common chilling spot so the training field seemed like the right coice considering that no one really went there for anything. >Such a vast space that no one uses.< he told himself finding some sort of satisfaction with the change of scenery > Better get started then.< he thought to himself as he stretched his arms up and continued looking around the training field.

Beginning to kneed and mold his chakra he would look around him to make sure that no one was around the area because he was anti-social and did not want anyone else knowing what abilities he could do. >Yesterday was risky, too many poeple saw me spar Eiyu. If it werent for my discrete transformation they would have noticed that something was different about me. I have to be more careful about it next time.< Continueing to kneed and mold his chakra within his body >The world is becoming increasingly dangerous so accomplishing my training is more important than it was before so I need to finish this so that I can move onto the next training.<

Bringing his hands up to his chest he would get ready to execute a series of handseals as he continued to kneed and mold his chakra within his body >This jutsu has become easier to use with the training that I have done in the past couple of months so that is good. It will really come in handy when I need it.< Executing four handseals Dog ---> Dragon ---> Rat ---> Ram he would kneel down to the ground and palced his palms flat against the ground. This was dne in preparations for the jutsu he was going to execute >Make sure that there is no one around so that they dont get injured and that they do not see this technique.

Releasing the chakra he had been molding and kneeding within his body he would have sent it to the ground via his palms and began to control it through his chakra control. >Weave the jutsu as fast as you can, the faster you get this down the better it will be when I use it in a combat situation.< Weaving the intricate patter that was the spider web, he focused on first laying down the basic shape of the spider wbe as it was a complex shape that would have given anyone trouble if they were not as familiar with the Raiton element.

With the basic shape laid out in a certain radious around him, he would reinforce the spider web that much more noticeable > Keep it up, focus on keeping the shape of the jutsu and keep the jutsu in control.< Pouring more and more chakra he would remove his hands up from the ground and stood up >Good enough.< he thought to himself as he patted his clothes and began to walk away toward the center of the village so that he could see if he could spot Eiyu to spar him or something.* - Sun Dec 13 00:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) Arrived at the training field and looked around to make sure that no one was around, once he made sure that the coast was all clear and that no one was around he would begin to kneed and mold his chakra withint his body >Damn that Eiyu, who the fuck does he think he is? Why is he going around telling people that I can teach them raiton related jutsus. Next time he pulls something like that again I am going to seriously injute him. Next time I will not be so lenient, I will seriously injure him.< It was clear that he was not happy about Eiyu recommending him to be someones teacher.

>Anyway, back to training.< he thought to himself as he brought his hands up to his chest as he continued training my jutsu and I need to be able to pull off jutsus at a more rapid rate. I can already see myself using two raiton jutsus back to back and at the same time. I already have some jutsu combination in mind.< Moving his hands closer to each other he executed four handseals Dog ---> Dragon ---> Rat ---> Ram and brought his hands down to the ground causing the jutsu to manifest itself. A web of lightning would quickly appear on the ground around him >Good.< he thought to himself.

With the execution of the Lightning Release: Spider web jutsu he would keep it up for just a bit longer since the jutsu took a couple of seconds before it was completed the jutsu he would remove his hands up to his chest and would separate them a bit then began to mold and kneed his chakra on his palms but was taking longer than usual to do so >What is happening?< he asked himself as he did not know or understand why his chakra was taking as long as it was taking to mold and kneed than when he was training before.

>Why can't I kneed and mold my chakra fast enough? What is happening? Just a couple of days ago I was able to do this very fast, well what I considered to be fast.< Continueing to kneed and mold his chakra slowly he attempted to quicken the process but to no avail as it seemed to be going at about the same, if not t a slower pace than it was before > Why is this happening?< he asked himself as he tried to find an explination as to why he couldnot form the jutsu as fast as he was used to doing it.

Beginning to form the lightning ball between his hands he was still distressed and bothered by the fact that it took him long to begin forming the jutsu > Why does this happen? Can't I not use multiple jutsus one after the other? Do I have to train myself to be able to do such things?< Expanding his hands he tried to get the ball of lightning to the size he was used to but only got it to the size of a baseball. Frustrated by this he launched the ball of lightning up to the sky and walked out of the training field.* - Sun Dec 13 00:46:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) shook his head as he heard them speak "The more things change, the more they stay the same. Boundaries shift, new players step in, but power always finds a place to rest its head. We fight and bleed alongside out fellow Shinobi. We shoulda known they'd hate us for it. History is written by the victor. And here I am, thinking we'd won. But you bring down one enemy and they find someone even worse to replace them. Locations change, the rationale, the objective. Yesterday's enemies are today's recruits. Train them to fight alongside you, and pray they don't eventually decide to hate you for it too." Taking a big exhale he would go back to remaining quiet.* - Sun Dec 13 01:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akito(KazutoAyamu) looked up at the sky above him as he processed Sogeki's words so he stood there thinking to himself quietly. Crossing his arms infront of his chest he would continue looking at the sky "Paths determine the actions you take, paths determine what decision you will make. Paths also determines who lives and who dies." he began to speak as he made stuff up as he went along "The path you take if important as it will determine your actions in the present and in the future but revenge, revenge is like a ghost. It takes over every man it touches. It's thirst cannot be quenched, until the last man standing has fallen. The world's men of action will look and wonder...how it came to this. You may be able to kill Rias, but the beast will eventually come for you." he told him as he turned his body.

Looking at both men present he would bring a hand up to rub his chin since he did not have his coat that hid the scars on his face "Words cannot truely sway the heart once it has decided to do something. Look deep inside you for the answer that you seek for, whatever the result of that search may be just remember my words. Yes this village has been stomped on and we have suffered greatly because of it but if revenge truly the right path? Remember this: It doesn't take the most powerful nations on this Shinobi world to create the next global conflict - just the will of a single man." With that he would stand quiet hoping that they could make sense of his thought process.* - Sun Dec 13 01:42:20 2015
