It's a sadistic smile.* - Fri Oct 16 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, without much of a reaction.

Afterwords she rolls the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit in response to this. Eyes wander off as she hovers up into the air.

Soon the girl is in front of him with arms behind her back. Both legs rest side by side.

He's lucky her feet are bare now.

Kat makes eye contact. Her smile remains.

She's overing over his lap right now, with her foot near his stomach.* - Fri Oct 16 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) Draws her right leg backwards.

Abruptly she then launches it forwards. It moves as a blur, augmented by her jutsu.

It's also a tiny bit weaker.

Even so, she uses her full strength.* - Fri Oct 16 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) drops the dice into his lap afterwords.* - Fri Oct 16 03:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What's your biggest regret, out of every single one of the things you've done or not done.  It has to be an actual regret too. If it was suicide or something, it doesn't count. - Fri Oct 16 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: My biggest...Regret.. - Fri Oct 16 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She passes the other dice.* - Fri Oct 16 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go get some ointment. She applies it to her two open cuts, to make them stop bleeding.

Afterwords she returns and rolls the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) absent-mindedly rubs his arm as she passes the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 04:07:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wears an awkward smile for the moment. She seems amused by the gesture. Her cheeks are only a bit pink.* - Fri Oct 16 04:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Penalty." she says.

The slightly tipsy girl tosses her dice up into the air.* - Fri Oct 16 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct 16 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes her money to him. Her cheeks turn more pink.

"Turn around...at least." she says.* - Fri Oct 16 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes him for a moment, ensuring that he's turning all the way around. Afterwords, with a shrug and a silent sigh, she reaches up to pull down the zipper of her body suit.

The couch is felt shaking, and maybe a full minute or so passes. At some point she's standing up.

Eventually the girl can be felt sitting back down. Both legs are sprawled out underneath her form.

After a brief moment of consideration she picks up one of the couch cushions and pulls it over to cover herself up.

She's completely naked aside from underwear.

"'Kay...." she says, resting her face against the cushion and thus hiding it at least partially.

Kat then passes the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Uh.. - Fri Oct 16 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) extends her arm with eyes averted.* - Fri Oct 16 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches over to carefully obtain a kunai from where her clothes were.

Afterwords she stares.* - Fri Oct 16 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) cuts.

She's actually careful to make it very shallow though.

As much as she'd genuinely love to scar him, she doesn't want blood on her couch.

It's pretty much not even bleeding, except for in a few small portions of the cut.

Afterwords Kat sets her kunai aside and offers him the ointment she'd used on herself.

She'd kept it in the room.* - Fri Oct 16 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes dice too.* - Fri Oct 16 04:26:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head in response to his request.

"Don't want your blood on me. . ." she says.* - Fri Oct 16 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Fri Oct 16 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the dice.

"Don't forget the money." she says with a cheeky smile on her face.

She rolls the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 04:32:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches over. Her eyes are averted and she pulls her arm back, as if to get ready to slap him as per the dice god's instructions.

She sips at her sake.* - Fri Oct 16 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) uses her lightweight technique to lessen the power of the blow.

Even so, her arm gains speed.

Abruptly she slaps him hard in the face. Specifically, the lips.

Afterwords she tosses the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 04:35:12 2015

She passes the dice, and some cash.* - Fri Oct 16 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

She extends an arm and waits for the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 04:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks her pillow up, since Index's eyes are closed.

Afterwords she stares down at him and attempts to stuff the corner of her pillow into his mouth, to choke him on it.* - Fri Oct 16 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || It's a really big and thick pillow.* - Fri Oct 16 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Afterwords she picks it up, sets it aside, and walks away.

She says nothing, since she can't get caught.

The teen's headed to bed.* - Fri Oct 16 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sleeps before eventually going back to the village.* - Fri Oct 16 04:48:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- But yes. If I teach you how to use Zetsumo's special variant of Kai, you'll spread the knowledge around. - Fri Oct 16 05:09:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being able to defend myself from people who use techniques like yours. I've never seen anything like it. - Fri Oct 16 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can easily put down a kage. Pretty much any kage. - Fri Oct 16 05:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not explaining that. It's common sense. - Fri Oct 16 05:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: You're both the same. - Fri Oct 16 05:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) directs his eyes at him. Her eyes are so cold, it might as well be a glare.

Her eyebrows are relaxed though, as if to suggest no loss of composure.

Her eyes are the eyes of a predator. A killer.

"Direct a single one of your attacks at me and I'll kill you within the span of two seconds." she says out loud, for all to hear.

"That kinjutsu is nothing to play around with. It should be forbidden officially and I'll act accordingly. A single jutsu...a single one. I'll kill you, to keep it from hitting me."

Kat's head tilts a bit.

"By not knowing any other way to counter it, it can't be avoided."* - Fri Oct 16 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your techniques are slow. I wouldn't even dare you to test me. - Fri Oct 16 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: You don't seem to want me to be a shinobi. - Fri Oct 16 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I might as well resign if I'm treated like this. - Fri Oct 16 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do it if you want to. You'll get no sympathy from me with that attitude. - Fri Oct 16 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't want anything from you anymore katsune. - Fri Oct 16 05:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. She simply watches his back for every single step he takes.

She's still fairly relaxed. This is a woman that fears very few people.* - Fri Oct 16 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Katsune... you ok? - Fri Oct 16 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course. I don't have a single doubt about anything I just said or did. - Fri Oct 16 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: His techniques aren't humane. - Fri Oct 16 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They're not like anything most people have ever seen or heard of. - Fri Oct 16 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: As I said I can stop him...I could be harder yet possible for you all but  harder - Fri Oct 16 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow. She turns her head in consideration of Bryson.

Turning her head all of the way would be uncomfortable after all.* - Fri Oct 16 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was under the impression you weren't a very fast person. Physically speaking. - Fri Oct 16 05:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Which ever you were interested in - Fri Oct 16 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd like to learn how to counter it, yes. Mostly for if I ever meet anyone like him. Not too worried about him. - Fri Oct 16 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhmm. - Fri Oct 16 05:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: it doesnt matter... as long as u shut him up - Fri Oct 16 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Knowing his own weaknesses...I suspect he will be. I don't focus on only speed. If someone -were- to do that...they'd be very dangerous. - Fri Oct 16 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: What if he runs away while chanting? I know a lot of amateurs like to stand still while weaving handseals, casting jutsus, or whatever...but what if Susumu knows better? - Fri Oct 16 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: He is a necromancer... they are cunning and cocky. He is a stupid one - Fri Oct 16 05:52:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Normally running backwards while casting a jutsu can be a bad idea. Your jutsu moves backwards with you. - Fri Oct 16 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: Also Im not sure if you actually hate him but I do and that makes me like you more Katsune - Fri Oct 16 05:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I don't know anything about Susumu. I have no reason to dislike him. - Fri Oct 16 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Oh, thats just an insult... I never underestimate people - Fri Oct 16 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: You are though. If you think it's as simple as punching him before he uses his technique. - Fri Oct 16 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I want better ways. Any other ways to stop his abomination from hitting me. - Fri Oct 16 05:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: One thing to know... he has no jutsu... - Fri Oct 16 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: He uses what are called curses - Fri Oct 16 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: Once the chanting of a curse is complete it is almost impossible to get out of... - Fri Oct 16 05:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Don't think I'd be able to learn how? - Fri Oct 16 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: I can dispell it but I will need time to research it; I am unaware of your people being able to learn anything about it  - Fri Oct 16 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Who is that? - Fri Oct 16 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: "Blackness"....? - Fri Oct 16 06:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances back and forth between the two of them, pretty blankly.

For the most part, though, she doesn't really think much of it.* - Fri Oct 16 06:12:28 2015
