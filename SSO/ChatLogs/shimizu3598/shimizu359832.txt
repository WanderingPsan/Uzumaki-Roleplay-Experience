<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise. Hands meet to form the tiger seal -- the most popular for earth jutsus and also one sometimes used for shadow clone jutsu. As such, it's the most fitting. Out of the dirt then comes a muddy human-like figure. It forms very quickly and changes colors until it's identical to Katsune.

In response to her will, said mud clone then walks forwards. It places itself in front of Izanami if allowed; between her and Baen.

Kat's not good at throwing punches after all. Ninjutsu kills.

"Calm down." the real girl says from behind.

"If it were anyone else I'd let you have your fun but if someone sees a little girl fighting Baen of all people, they might be inclined to kill him instantly without asking questions."* - Sun Oct 11 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head from where she is. Her clone says nothing.

The real girl is the one that speaks when she says "Flexus and his friends came into Konoha and told me, the Hokage, they were there to kill Erebus. They told me outright. I told them to do no such thing, but they tried to get him killed anyway using cowardly tactics. The boy died for that. For sticking his neck out and breaking my laws. It's unfortunate, but Baen has done nothing wrong. He was following orders. If he hadn't done it, Erebus would've done it with his own hand anyway."* - Sun Oct 11 21:06:20 2015

"Not the first time I ran away." she says.
"Won't be the last I'm sure, and I'm not ashamed at all."

Eyes remain averted even now.

"Truth is I would've gone back eventually but the village was destroyed. And besides. I wasn't ready for the position. Erebus vowed to be my sword, shield, and armor. He swore it. And then he came with two thousand people -- showed up to take my head, because I dared to be angry at him for killing my very best friend in my own front lawn. He was immortal and I couldn't even compare. Wasn't faster; wasn't capable of damaging him much less killing. He was in another league."

"Again -- no shame."* - Mon Oct 12 00:41:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) collects a large amount of stones once more. They're all relatively small. All of them are easily managable for this point in her training of the Lightweight Rock Technique. All of them are stacked up at this time at her side. The girl takes a moment to rub at her left temple with two fingers. 

Even thinking about training this technique gives her a headache. With a shrug, though, she eventually reaches over to pick up the nearest stone. Feet are planted against the dirt, and Kat's eyes wander upwards slowly. They meet the sky. Her arm draws backwards with her stone in hand.

It's of course had its weight reduced by way of her jutsu. With all preperations made, Kat them shoves her arm forwards. The stone is released as her hand comes to the end of its path. It flies upwards into the air, almost hovering. It travels even for fourty feet or so.

Kat's right hand clenches tightly into a fist. Eyes lock onto the stone. She can only hope it remains light from her previous jutsu use. At least for now, she's positive that it will. She can tell, because it falls very slowly as planned.

With this in mind, she waits. Eventually it's close enough. She times herself perfectly for safety's sake. Her arm flies forwards as explosion release chakra is poured into her fist, and then her chakra flow gauntlet. The very second the stone meets her weapon, an explosion is released.

The explosion had been detonated from the stone's insides in specific. She'd used her explosion release to use the stone's matter as the fuel for an explosion. She'd turned it into raw energy, thus forcing the damaging beam that races forewards. The ground shakes, and Kat's hair and skirt are blown back. Dirt follows suit, blowing all over the place.

Kat's of course...at this time, training her ability to transition from jutsu to jutsu.* - Mon Oct 12 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to one of the trees she'd been using for training in the past. Specifically one of the ones she'd left standing on stones to bench press. After taking some time to stretch, Kat reaches out for its roots. Both palms are on it, and with both she pours enormous amounts of earth release chakra into it. Using it, she lowers the weight of her tree.

Eventually, she's sure she can pick it up. With that, she pours more chakra onto the surface of her palms for the suimen technique. The girl then simply lifts her tree up. She's forced to take a breath because it's still a bit heavy. She hasn't yet mastered her jutsu. 

She's very, very close but not yet there. Kat picks the tree up until she can rest it against her right shoulder. With that done, she turns on her heel and walks many paces away and to the southwest. Once there, her feet are planted. Both hands move to pull the tree off of her shoulder.

Many flakes of bark rain down onto her head. It's not just a tree. It's a dead tree. It's not exactly made for being swung around so wantonly. As such, it struggles to even stay together. Its lighter weight certainly helps, though.

Kat draws the practice dummy backwards as if it's a massive blade. Once she's prepared, she swings forth with it as if it's a baseball bat. The girl nearly loses her grip on it. As a result, she's carried. The tree swings all the way around until it's done a 360 degree turn. 

Kat's pulled, with her feet sliding to and fro in the dirt. Nearly silently she scoffs through the nose. Lips twitch and form a smile. The girl's slightly amused. She picks the weapon up once more.

It's tempting to ram it into the ground just for her own satisfaction's sake, but she needs to keep her weapon whole if she's to keep using it for training. As such, she opts to simply swing it forwards once more. The entire time, she's loading it up with chakra. Once more, Kat's pulled around by its sheer weight. The tree even groans.

Its wood cries out, as if it's beeing split. This causes the girl to lift an eyebrow, but with a shrug she eventually continues training. So her tree will break soon. Even so, she'll get as much training out of it as she can first. Hours pass, and she keeps throwing it to and fro as if it's a bat.

When she's done playing, she lifts it up over her head. Roughly, she then swings her arms forwards. They travel downwards, towards the ground. The tree hits very roughly, and Kat pulls her chakra out of it as it comes closer to said dirt. The weapon regains all of its weight.

As a result, the ground shakes. Her tree breaks into fourty pieces. Kat's gauntlets are now dirty, so she takes a moment to brush them off. With that, she turns on  her heel and begins walking away. Eyes wander. She needs to find another tree.* - Mon Oct 12 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) collects two rather large boulders. Each are half as tall as she is, and roughly as wide, making them relatively round. Both have chakra poured into them, and their weight is reduced. Using suimen, Kat walks around with both in hand. She sighs through the nose.

This is the only high-ranking jutsu she's eager to master as quickly as possible. It's very frustrating, too. It's by far the hardest she's ever had to deal with. Even the landmine fist was not only faster and easier to master, but it was more fun too. She shakes her head though and brushes the thought off.

Chakra is poured throughout her very own body. Kat uses it to lower her own weight. With that done, she begins sprinting. She springs until she's built up a lot of momentum, moving as a blur. Kat then at some point crouches down. During the same motion she roughly shoves her legs back against the ground.

She leaps. Kat's sent flying, almost literally. She nearly hovers. Not quite, but she's definitely getting there. Sixty feet are covered nearly instantly.

The stones she carries keeps her weighed down by some amount. As such, she forces her to push her jutsu to its utmost limits. They're weights, to force her chakra circuits to work harder. It works, too. Already, Kat can feel them burning.* - Mon Oct 12 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) whispers: Why hello Kat. - Mon Oct 12 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms uncross. Eyes wander for a moment as senses focus on Beth. As they do so, Kat's hands are meeting to form the tiger handseal.

Abruptly, the girl would then flicker out of sight. When she reappears she's south of Beth by eight feet. She stares blankly, maintaining eye contact.* - Mon Oct 12 04:10:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances towards the hand as she's pulled close. The girl's cheeks turn pink. She stares blankly to the south for a very long while.

Only two people have ever hugged her. Beth is the second.

Carefully she attempts to pull herself away, then, and takes a few steps off to the side. She'd stay facing the west as she comes to a stop.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The former hokage takes a moment to rub her face with her left palm. It wasn't an empty threat in all honesty. The girl's simply used to the lawless beat-the-fuck-out-of-whoever-you-want lifestyle she enjoyed when she was in Zetsumo's company in Amegakure.

She's still learning to control herself now that she's forced to be civil. A silent, deep breath is taken through the nose.

"The sexual harrassment bit was a joke that you were too stupid to notice." she says to Reguel.

"I was implying I'd abuse my authority to lock you up."* - Mon Oct 12 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her arms. Hands meet to form the tiger seal. Kat's head tilts to the side. She cracks her neck. She follows suit to crack it from the other side as well.

With that, a large plume of smoke appears at her side in a loud poof. From within it comes a muddy clone of Kat. It very quickly rises up out of the dirt. By the time the smoke's cleared, an identical clone of Kat is made.

The teen turns around to stare coldly at Reguel. Arms find her sides as her clone then sprints forwards, moving as a blur.

The clone's hands meet as well. It forms the tiger seal and disappears, flickering out of sight. When it reappears it's in Regeul's face. Even Tetsumi Jiki's sand can't move so fast. It in fact moves -half- as fast literally as Katsune when she's using the shunshin jutsu.

When the clone meets Regeul, it immediately lifts a leg and aims to deliver a roundhouse kick to his face. It aims for the nose, and holds nothing back.

Kat may have to spend some time in jail but wow will it be worth it.* - Mon Oct 12 04:57:23 2015

A rematch with Tetsumi would be extremely welcome, but unfortunately she can't do that without making her situation much worse.

That, and she can't fight him without potentially killing in the event she'd win, because she uses very dangerous techniques.

She's lying limp when his sand catches her, and she allies herself to be picked up. Eyes wander off.

The clone, too, simply sits there. Its life is crushed out instantly and it turns to a puddle of mud, which splashes against the ground.* - Mon Oct 12 05:25:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gently plants her butt on the ground with a soft sigh. Legs are left sprawled out underneath her form. Hands meet to form the tiger seal, and Kat sends chakra into the ground. A large plume of smoke then poofs into existance. From within it comes a shadow clone, made of mud.

It's identical to Katsune. When the smoke clears, that's all one would see. No mud; only clone. It'd risen up out of the ground, though she's training herself to form the clone quickly to hide its nature. After all; everyone knows that earth is unbelievably weak against lightning.

With this, done, Katsune waits fifteen or so very long seconds. She's looking her clone up and down in the mean time, slowly. The girl looks for any flaws in its appearance mostly. With her senses, she looks for flaws in the mud itself. Once Katsune's done, she parts her hands and brings them back together to form the same seel.

Another clone appears. Lazily, Kat glances back and forth between the two of them. Supposedly elemental clones don't have their own consciousness entirely. They're controlled by the creator's will or something like that. If this is true, then an easy means of training the jutsu becomes apparent.

Kat can simply practice controlling the clones' movements. With this in mind, she wills both clones to turn and face each other. Both slowly draw their right leg back through the dirt and lift their arms. Hands meet to form the tiger seal. They stare blankly at each other.

Within a brief moment, both have made use of a certain jutsu. Their limbs move faster, and their bodies in general do too. Abruptly, they then dart towards each other. Both move as a blur. Wildly they throw kicks and punches at each other.

Often their gauntlets clash with loud clanging noises. These are chakra flow gauntlets though in the clones' case, they're simply rock that's been made as hard as steel. Occasionally mud is chipped away. Whenever this happens, they slowly regenerate. Kat's careful to refrain from bidding them to use jutsus.

For one, they're in a town square. Secondly, she'd rather them not waste chakra. That chakra is chakra they can use to regenerate. In general, they aim for where it hurts. Nose, eyes, chest, etc.

Whenever one is struck, they never release grunts of pain or anything of the sort. They're mud after all. The clones stumble backwards occasionally but only due to the struggle needed to maintain their solid shape. The eyes of each of them are lifeless. Occasionally one or the other leaps up into the air.

It covers roughly six feet of height and then comes crashing down on its opponent. Its speed isn't reduced in any way even as a two-legged kick is launched forwards. One clone strikes the other in the cheek. Finally, one of Kat's clones disipates entirely for several reasons. The girl's hands part and then meet once more.

She makes another clone.* - Mon Oct 12 06:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gives up, with a silent sigh. Both clones fall apart, into mud. The girl then lazily declines onto her back. Both arms and legs are left sprawled out in the dirt.

She can't do this.

Too lazy.

Kat stares up at the sky blankly.* - Mon Oct 12 06:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Should I focus on learning fuuinjutsu now or maybe try my hand at lightning more? - Mon Oct 12 19:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Fuuinjutsu. Learn how to counter it when some annoying ass guy shoots fuuinjutsu at you that can't be dodged, blocked, or tanked. - Mon Oct 12 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You're still convinced those things were fuuinjutsu? I mean . . . I'm not sure if fuuinjutsu needs an incantation. - Mon Oct 12 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Whatever it was, I'll kill him if he ever aims it at me in private. I figured out how to counter it. And that's it. He has to die if he shoots it at you. - Mon Oct 12 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: That it should be officially classed as forbidden jutsu and that he should be careful who he uses it on. - Mon Oct 12 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I sent him a letter but I'm guessing he saw it as  adeath threat. - Mon Oct 12 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: People have a way of doing that with my letters. - Mon Oct 12 19:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: And your letter almost made an army attack me since you made it look like we're going to get back when you meant you're going to get back. - Mon Oct 12 19:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: But . . . Past is past. - Mon Oct 12 19:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: It's okay. - Mon Oct 12 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: I'm not going to bother you while you're busy. - Mon Oct 12 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not that busy. - Mon Oct 12 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What's up? - Mon Oct 12 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Just relaxing for now. - Mon Oct 12 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Have you improved at the water jutsu a bit? - Mon Oct 12 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 12 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Good. - Mon Oct 12 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes Kilm a scroll.* - Mon Oct 12 19:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Big difference. - Mon Oct 12 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Don't let anyone else see that. - Mon Oct 12 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Oh.... - Mon Oct 12 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Just wanted you to know since you're his baby sitter. - Mon Oct 12 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Dont read it out loud either. - Mon Oct 12 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Guess me and Baen share the same interests in protecting nozumi. - Mon Oct 12 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: He's my student . . . And Baen likes him in some way. - Mon Oct 12 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) holds her hand out to take the scroll back.* - Mon Oct 12 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: That's all the more reason not to let him get killed. - Mon Oct 12 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: To be honest. - Mon Oct 12 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I have no interest in your emotional speeches. - Mon Oct 12 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: The point was -- - Mon Oct 12 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Keep him safe. - Mon Oct 12 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Yeah, I am. - Mon Oct 12 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: As I was saying . . . To be honest, If Nozumi dies. Baen's not going to be the only one searching for the killer. - Mon Oct 12 19:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Mon Oct 12 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I want to talk to Baen. Should I send him a scroll? - Mon Oct 12 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. Rematch, Kilm? - Mon Oct 12 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) talks just to stop Kilm from whispering.* - Mon Oct 12 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 12 19:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: She's definitely going to outsmart me now. - Mon Oct 12 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And no. Don't talk to Baen. Wouldn't have shown you that letter if I'd known you'd lose your damned mind. - Mon Oct 12 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel to walk away as she says this, to lead the way to some appropriate place for their rematch.* - Mon Oct 12 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: Huh? - Mon Oct 12 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the tiger seal as she comes to a stop, and eyes wander off. A large plume of smoke appears at her side. When it clears, a mud clone has formed. Of course, anyone seeing it won't usually know for sure that it's made of mud -- though Kilm should easily guess as much.

Kat's lips twitch, and she smirks. Her clone turns then and crawls up onto her back. It wraps its arms around Kat's neck, and lifts its legs up. Said legs wrap around her waist.

The girl does her best not to laugh.

Senses are locked onto Kilm.

Her clone's palms are pressed to the real girl's shoulders.* - Mon Oct 12 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Kilm had guessed correctly. Kat keeps her hands in formation of the tiger seal. And then? The girl's -clone- pours earth release chakra into her body. It reduces her weight to nothing. And with that, Kat herself uses the shunshin jutsu, shoving chakra throughout her body.

A puff of smoke envolopes her form. With that, she darts up into the air...flying, at shunshin speed.

She's figured out how to use jutsus while flying, without the ability to dual cast jutsus.

As a result, she very easily dodges Kilm's jutsus.

The girl now stares down at him from so high up in the air, she'd be only a tiny purple speck.

She waits.* - Mon Oct 12 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're a genius. - Mon Oct 12 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know right?!?! - Mon Oct 12 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aren't you glad you taught me this jutsu? - Mon Oct 12 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Was that what you wanted to show me? - Mon Oct 12 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And yes I am. - Mon Oct 12 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since you already found a smart way to use it. - Mon Oct 12 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Na I figured this out five seconds ago. - Mon Oct 12 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Literally five seconds ago. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . On the spot genius? - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wonder like . . . - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I could have two clones. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: A water and earth clone. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Earth clone uses the flying jutsu on me and my water clone fires water jutsu . . . - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm. . . - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: While I do my main stuff - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I just might. . . - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Be kage-tier now. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is why you can't teach anyone else this jutsu. It's too powerful. Too dangerous. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't worry. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Only me, you and Lera will know it. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm not teaching Nozumi. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even if he does learn the Earth element. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yeah. Now I can even fight Tetsumi Jiki. He can't fly away anymore. - Mon Oct 12 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's continue then? - Mon Oct 12 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah! Come at me! - Mon Oct 12 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just hold back a bit on your jutsus! Don't turn me to ash! - Mon Oct 12 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Although I don't know how you'll manage that. - Mon Oct 12 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply waits for Kilm to approach. She moves backwards as he does so. And as he comes close, Kat extends her left arm. Her fist is aimed at him, as are her senses. Kat's right palm wraps around the center of the extended arm.

She keeps eyes averted to avoid the boy's genjutsu. As he draws near point blank range, Kat pours explosion release chakra into her gauntlet. She channels the landmine fist jutsu into her fist. The girl flies forwards and towards Kilm even as the jutsu leaves her fist, making it literally impossible for him to evade it.

Due to it delivering concussive force as well as burning, electric power, Kilm may even take more damage than usual due to him using the lightweight rock technique.

He's simply too slow to evade it when it's combined with Kat's speed. He'll be hit.* - Mon Oct 12 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) quickly descends to the ground. The girl leaves herself hovering only twelve feet high above the dirt. Just high enough that Kilm can't catch her in earthen corridor or earth and stone bamboo shoot. Her clone continues pouring just the right amount of earth release chakra into her to maintain her light weight.

The clone's hair flows to and fro in the air, due to it weighing next to nothing and due to Kat bobbing up and down.

"Hmm. Should we keep going?" she inquires.* - Mon Oct 12 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You did me in. - Mon Oct 12 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm. - Mon Oct 12 20:12:09 2015
