Afterwords she turns on her heel and begins walking away.* - Sun Nov  1 20:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow.

"You do...?" she inquires.* - Sun Nov  1 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes, I want to put any hostilities between us behind. - Sun Nov  1 20:49:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit with a nod. It's a snake like smile. It's almost a goofy one. "I-I...." she says, in a way that suggests...excitement. Adrenaline.

"I was right then. There -is-....hostility. You proved it to me, didn't you? Just now?" Kat inquires.* - Sun Nov  1 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It sure seemed like it. I never wanted any in the first place. - Sun Nov  1 20:51:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Here to kill you, Kilm. - Sun Nov  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't want to explain. - Sun Nov  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't want to give you a chance to defend yourself. - Sun Nov  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You came into my house to passive-aggressively challenge me. - Sun Nov  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You came into my house to make me feel like shit. - Sun Nov  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well it worked, so now you die. - Sun Nov  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the clone seal. Abruptly, a plume of smoke appears on Kat's back. When the smoke clears, a clone of Kat is there. Its legs are wrapped around her waist. Its arms are wrapped around her neck.

"Yes...." Kat says with a breath, calming down a bit.

"Now it makes sense. You were trying to blame me for choosing Index over you. That's why I'm angry."

The clone then forms another few seals. It uses the henge jutsu, and then transforms. When it's done, it resembles Kat's purple Sunagakure chuunin vest. It's zipped up.

"You were implying I -owed- you my attention. Very specifically you were implying that you deserved me for all of the groveling you did. When I used you like my bitch. You were implying I could be bought. See those things aren't insulting but the fact that anyone could be so stupid....that is."

Kat nods.

"Now you're gonna die. I'm glad I understood that finally......when I was looking you in the eyes."* - Sun Nov  1 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is maintaining eye contact, very specifically.* - Sun Nov  1 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Didn't understand why I wanted your death so bad. - Sun Nov  1 20:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not forced to pretend to like you anymore! - Sun Nov  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're....the last obstacle.... - Sun Nov  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Between me....and freedom. - Sun Nov  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I....tried....to be nice to you. - Sun Nov  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To genuinely like you. - Sun Nov  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And to repay me.... - Sun Nov  1 20:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I am gonna kill......the -fuck-, out of you. - Sun Nov  1 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) spints off to the southwest as Kilm moves. Abruptly she throws her fist forwards. Eyes are locked onto Kilm the entire time.

Kat's moving half as fast as Kilm is. As such, she can make it. The math adds up.

As he moves, Kat directs a fist at him. Abruptly she'd channel chakra into it as she moves. Explosion release chakra. The Landmine Fist jutsu.

The ground shakes, and dirt is blown all over the place. Kat's hair and skirt are blown all over the place. The entire world shakes.

Kat runs even as the explosive beam moves forwards. As such, it's moving twice as fast as it normally would due to the speed of her, and her chakra, at the same time.

Kilm would be struck pretty much instantly, mid-shunshin.

Immediately afterwords Kat would sprint after him with murder in her eyes, while he's vulenerable from using shunshin.

Kat would come to a stop some ten feet from him only, so that she can make sure he's defenseless before she strikes. Her feet come skidding to a stop. Kat's chest rises and falls very rapidly as her adrenaline races through her.

She wants this. Very, very badly.* - Sun Nov  1 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) keeps sprinting. Since Kilm's in the air, he's probably vulnerable at the moment. To take advantage of this, Kat hovers up into the air mid-sprint.

It's her clone -- which looks like a chuunin vest right now -- that's using this Lightning Rock Technique on itself and Kat at the same time. As such, Kat's free to use a jutsu of her own.

Once more she attempts to launch a fist at Kilm, in the gut. If it seems like he's successfully countering in any way, Kat simply channels her landmine fist through her gauntlet just before he hits her, to at least get 'some' damage in.

Kat's speed is also improved for the brief moment, thanks to her flight.

As such, Kilm 'will' be in the air most likely. Kat's faster than gravity.

He'd also be rammed very hard into the dirt by the landmine fist's beam, while taking damage. He may even take damage a second time from the impact with the ground.
* - Sun Nov  1 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's forced to release her landmine fist early. As such, all of the senbons are either disintigrated outright or knocked aside.

Kat races forwards by way of flight for the entire duration of this. Her Landmine Fist's beam is moving even as she does, and thus it's twice as fast as it'd usually be, quite literally.

Kilm's hit.

Period.* - Sun Nov  1 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shoots another landmine fist through her chakra flow gauntlet.

Kilm's flames don't do anything.

Obviously.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) walks up to Kilm's cage. Kat's eyes are closed as she does so, and she sways a bit. Her breaths are shakey. It's apparent that she's filled with enormous amounts of adrenaline.

With a shakey sigh, Kat eventually very slowly opens her eyes. Said eyes are cold and murderous. The eyes of a wild animal backed into a corner.

The eyes of someone terrified to their very -core-, for their life.

Kat's left hand rises. It trembles as it does so. Eventually it finds one of the bars to Kilm's cage. Gently and slowly, it wraps around it.

Kat wastes no time. She explains herself very quickly, getting straight to the point.

"I-I'm....not mad at you Kilm. I'm afraid of you. Of your maniacal obsession with me. I just now....realized that. You terrify me, because you....are mentally and emotionally unstable. All this time, I felt guilt. I thought maybe I was crazy."

Kat pauses, slowly drawing in another breath to calm herself.

"But I was wrong." she says, maintaining eye contact.

"It's you who's terrifying. It's you who's crazy. You're obsessed."* - Tue Nov  3 13:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . - Tue Nov  3 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly takes a silent breath. Kat shakes her head. Her hand falls back from the cage, slowly.

Strangely, she's very relieved. Finally she's figuring out why Kilm scared the fuck out of her.

"Kilm....you were at my door on that day...when I went to check it. I'd just woke up and you were already there....waiting. And you were nervous. You -scared- me. A -lot-. That's how I -knew- you were going to snap. It's how I -knew- I was in danger. That's why I -knew-, I had to kill you."

She pauses for a moment to study his body language.

"You're a rabid animal. You're not even human. Your obsession is literally insanity. Admit that."* - Tue Nov  3 14:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly shakes her head. Her eyes become very dark.

"I see it." she says.

"My intuition...so sharp these days. It's so clear. You're not even aware of how dangerous your obsession is. You don't even care that it terrifies me to my core. That it makes me feel unsafe. Raped. That it made me feel pain."* - Tue Nov  3 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm I need.... - Tue Nov  3 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I need you to admit it. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Admit that you were there....for some....insane reason. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: An insane reason? No, I warned you of the group, That was my main goal. Everything else was just chatting. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So... - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's...it then. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You really. . .are. . . - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Too far gone. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Insane. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There's only one cure for madness, Kilm. - Tue Nov  3 14:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Everyone. . .knows that. - Tue Nov  3 14:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that death is inevitable for me. - Tue Nov  3 14:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And it might be seconds away right now. - Tue Nov  3 14:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, slowly.

Her left hand reaches up to the cage door. Slowly she opens it up. She makes it so that there's no barrier between her and Kilm.

Before, she was weak. So weak mentally and physically she could barely move. Dizzy, because she was scared and didn't know why. She didn't understand her fear of this man.

But now, she knows. She understands. This time, she has no fear. This time, she's mentally strong so....

This time, she knows she can win.

"Are you going to die with honor by putting that raccoon away and accepting your death?" she inquires.

"Or am I going to lose respect for my closest friend...in his last hours?"* - Tue Nov  3 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let me love you....as you die Kilm. - Tue Nov  3 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I need that. - Tue Nov  3 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am ready for death, Though, There's one thing I want to do. Whether it takes me a long time or not, I want to do it. I'll even have Fujitora seal away my mental personalities to try and stabilize me. I want to atleast kill edge . . . Atleast answer to any and all threats the shinobi kind have. Are you willing to honor that request and then kill me when it's done or would you rather accomplish the deed right now? You said it once to me. O - Tue Nov  3 14:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: me? - Tue Nov  3 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You said it yourself to me. - Tue Nov  3 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm strong. - Tue Nov  3 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If I can shift the tide for Sunagakure's side in any way possible . . . I want to do it. - Tue Nov  3 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly shakes her head.

"I can't." she says.

"Your existance makes me feel as if I'm in danger at all times. That's how terrifying you are for me. I desperately need to feel secure, Kilm. I need to feel safe. I can't feel happy unless I'm safe. If I don't feel safe I will literally lose my mind. I'll become half as crazy as you are right now."

Kat pauses, taking a silent breath.

"Again...." she repeats.

"Please let me love you....to death, as I kill you. Like a brother, so that I can have a memory of you that I love. Not a memory of you...that terrifies me. I need you Kilm. I need to be able to remember....the Kilm that I love."* - Tue Nov  3 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because....right now. - Tue Nov  3 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're not him. - Tue Nov  3 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're not the boy that made me feel safe. - Tue Nov  3 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The boy that helped me be almost happy. - Tue Nov  3 14:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right arm rises, oh-so-casually. It feels so natural. It's as if her arm moves on it's own. So very smoothly. So very effortlessly.

Kat's right fist is aimed at the raccoon and Kilm just as the animal moves Kilm's person.

Abruptly, Kat's fist releases a beam. The landmine fist, channeled through her armor's gauntlet. The world shakes for the moment. It rattles, just as Kat's sanity did for two days thanks to -this- man.

The roar produced is reverberating and loud. Kat's hair and skirt are blown back. All dirt in the area is blown way back.

And when Kilm's raccoon is hit, it's knocked back. When Kilm is hit, he's knocked back. No matter how much, or little, damage it does -- they're knocked back, due to the concussive force that explosions produce.

Kat's staring blankly the entire time. She's finally secure again. She's finally got the closure she needed. This is why she couldn't let Index kill Kilm. It's why she needed to do it with her own hands.

In doing this herself, she feels safe again.

She's not even remotely hesitant or mentally weak right now.* - Tue Nov  3 14:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs, silently, with a slow nod. "You are accepting it." she says.

"The fact that you're insane."

"I respect that. Maybe my memory of you will be one I love. Right now, you're showing that you do have some feelings for me that aren't just rabid obsession. You're showing me that there was some human in you."

Slowly Kat walks forwards. A glance is directed towards the bag of scrolls her friend tossed forwards.

As Kat moves, she lifts her left arm. Her fist is aimed at him, for her protection, and kept there.

Once Kat's within range, she extends the arm entirely. Kat stands from the distance that her arm covers, and turns to where her right hip faces the south. Kat's eyes remain locked onto Kilm.

Silently she sighs, with her fist planted to his flesh.

"You were in love with me, weren't you?" she says.

"Literally madly...in love. Is that what did this to you?"* - Tue Nov  3 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Tue Nov  3 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I loved you more than anything . . . More than myself. - Tue Nov  3 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's why I wanted Index to make you happy. - Tue Nov  3 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I was never angry at you for choosing index. - Tue Nov  3 14:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I was in fact happy that you found someone who makes you happy . . . That's all that mattered for me. - Tue Nov  3 14:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, very slowly.

"I want you to know, right now." Kat says. Her eyes become a bit watery.

"I want you to know, Kilm. I love you too. Not like that, but I do. I'm only...doing this, because I have to." she says.

Tears manage to begin slowly rolling down her cheeks as she finishes her statement.* - Tue Nov  3 14:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If this is what you need to do then do it. I'm ready. - Tue Nov  3 14:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, slowly.

"I'll miss you." Kat says. Her tears roll down even harder.

"I really will."* - Tue Nov  3 14:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her head trembles a bit as she does so.

"Tell Orokuru that I've missed him." she says.

"And that I was in love with him when he died."

Slowly Kat draws in a deep breath. She gives Kilm time to consider what she just said.

She needs his brain to process that, before his brain is turned to ashes.* - Tue Nov  3 14:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Bury me near Taifu. - Tue Nov  3 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She's in Kumogakure. - Tue Nov  3 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Taifu...Kumogakure. - Tue Nov  3 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. I'll remember. - Tue Nov  3 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Any other wishes? - Tue Nov  3 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Tell my brother that I wish I had a chance to know him brother . . . And that despite only knowing him for a bit, That I love him. - Tue Nov  3 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's it. - Tue Nov  3 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you on the other side. - Tue Nov  3 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be watching. - Tue Nov  3 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . . - Tue Nov  3 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Brother. - Tue Nov  3 14:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I love you. - Tue Nov  3 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) silently takes a deep breath.

It takes many long seconds for Kat to reach a final decision. A full minute, almost.

Hearing Kilm remind her that he has a brother -- someone who needs him. Hearing that she's taking a loved one from someone, that made her hesitant.

Even so, Kat's made up her mind. She needs to be happy. For her to be happy, Kilm can't live.

"I'll tell him." Kat says.
"I'll do it myself, in person. He'll know, you love him."

And then, the world shakes. It trembles, and rolls. Dirt is picked up and blown all over the place. Kat's hair and skirt are blown all over the place.

Kilm's body from the waist up is literally disintigrated.

It'd be a quick and painless death. Instant.* - Tue Nov  3 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The resulting beam also probably puts a hole in the wall behind Kilm.* - Tue Nov  3 14:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly turns on her heel to face the east.

Her eyes find the bag of scrolls that Kilm left for her. Slowly she takes in yet another deep and shakey breath. Eventually though, with a nod, she slowly kneels down.

Kat's palm finds the bag where it's tied up. She wraps her hand around it, and picks it up as she rises.

For a long moment she stares down at it. It doesn't take her long to see why she should accept this gift.

It's Kilm's memory. A reminder that he wasn't a bad person at all. He wasn't evil, or without value to the world. He was just sick. Broken inside.

With this in mind and with a clear conscience -- but a heavy heart -- Kat walks away. She does so at a lazy pace. She's in no hurry, and she doesn't have much strength in her legs for walking.* - Tue Nov  3 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) returns at some later point to disintigrate the rest of Kilm's body.

She can't risk someone seeing evidence.

That'd give her more stress and stability in her life than she already has. She can't deal with that. It's why she had to kill Kilm.

She needs things to be easy for a while.

So. No evidence.

She uses the landmine fist to blast all traces of Kilm off of the map.

After that, she turns and walks away once more.* - Tue Nov  3 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey...Kat. - Tue Nov  3 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms meet behind her back. One hand rests on the opposite arm, and she looks up at Index almost through her eye lashes.

Her expression's pretty stoic, but at the same time intense. They're eyes that suggest she just did something horrible, and she's okay with that.

Silently she takes a breath.

"Yeah?" she asks afterwords.* - Tue Nov  3 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) draws in a slow and shakey breath as she's pulled close. Eyes close for a moment, as Kat needs time to calm herself. Some time afterwords, Kat slowly nods, with her face pressed to the boy's shoulder or chest; whichever she'd been pulled to.

"Maybe." she says.

Her arms meet at her sides.* - Tue Nov  3 23:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She was so nervous. So -excited-. She had so much adrenaline. - Tue Nov  3 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could feel that. - Tue Nov  3 23:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could feel her. - Tue Nov  3 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was intuition. - Tue Nov  3 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The 'strongest'....intuition. - Tue Nov  3 23:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you understand me? - Tue Nov  3 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly shakes her head.

"Not at all." Kat says.

"But I -know- that I don't."

Slowly Kat then pulls herself away. Silently she takes a deep breath as she does so.

She pulls away, because she wants to look Index in the eyes. When Kat does, her eyes are full of life. She's guarded, but one can tell she's also not slow at the moment.

"You're not as easy to read as everyone else. No one else is a challenge."* - Tue Nov  3 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Everyone else? - Tue Nov  3 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They're weak. - Tue Nov  3 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes slowly wander off.

"Okay...." she eventually says.* - Wed Nov  4 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares down at the hands for a very long while. Silently she takes in a slow, deep breath. Afterwords she nods.

"I dunno if I'm ready to talk about that." she says.

Kat's eyes then find Index's.

"No...actually, I do know. It's a bad idea. Let's wait." she says.* - Wed Nov  4 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's....have fun, instead. - Wed Nov  4 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not...sure. - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think....I want..... - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To explore. Especially murder. I like exploring that. - Wed Nov  4 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes find Index's.

Kat's cooing, smoothly and quietly, when she says "Marissa. . . ."

"She's unstable. I understand my intuition now, so I understand her. She's terrified of me. The last time we talked, I could tell. She was obsessed. So obsessed. Let's play with that. Let's show her....that we are inside her head. Let's show her how terrifying we can be. Let's prove to her that we know her every thought, and emotion, and the reason for them. Let's be...that. Her nightmare."* - Wed Nov  4 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression hasn't changed a bit in response to Index's question, or body language. That's because nothing he did or said surprised her much.

"By showing that I know what she's doing right now." Kat says.

"I know why I haven't seen her. She's obsessed with me. Madly. Just like Kilm was madly in love with me....an obsession. Marissa is obsessed, in rage. She's not even in control of that. She doesn't know what those feelings are. So....I know what she's doing. People fear what they don't understand. She doesn't understand -me-, so she fears me. She'll try to kill me. She'll do that, hoping she can figure me out in the process. Let's...find out what she's doing. Get proof. I suspect she's training. Gaining power. Let's find out where and how."* - Wed Nov  4 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No...she wants to figure herself out by killing me. - Wed Nov  4 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh...this is gonna be fun. - Wed Nov  4 00:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Right now.... - Wed Nov  4 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's obsessed because she can't find out why she's excited. - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She wants this. - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a challenge, to her. - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a way to better herself. - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's...what she sees this is. - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And do you know why....Index? - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Why? - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's because she knows she's weaker than me. Emotionally. - Wed Nov  4 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She wants to prove that wrong. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She can only do that by killing me. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She won't be able to. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Exactly. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She can't kill me. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She can never get the proof she wants. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That and. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'll drive her mad. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So when she fights me? - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She won't be in control of her emotions. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not sure, she'll be a shinobi for much longer. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She'll be crippled by how over-whelming it is. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She took the private exam. - Wed Nov  4 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That so? - Wed Nov  4 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov  4 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She passed. - Wed Nov  4 00:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But, at the cost of one of her arms. - Wed Nov  4 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's not why she can't kill me. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She can't kill me because she won't be able to focus. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know, because I wasn't able to focus when fighting Kilm. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even so.... - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She won't need to be mentally strong if she gains physical power. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can tell....she's petty. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So she'll look for physical power. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suspect. - Wed Nov  4 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or, she'll give up. One of the two. But she was so insecure.... - Wed Nov  4 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She knows, so well, that I'm better than her. Stronger. - Wed Nov  4 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I doubt she will give up. - Wed Nov  4 00:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Does that mean, we can celebrate this 'victory'..? - Wed Nov  4 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. This'd be the best thing for me. Something...that can calm me down. - Wed Nov  4 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Or not. - Wed Nov  4 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I honestly. - Wed Nov  4 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Felt like this would happen. - Wed Nov  4 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. Actually. There are other ways to calm down. - Wed Nov  4 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've...got an idea Index. - Wed Nov  4 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm? - Wed Nov  4 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a slow and silent breath. Afterwords, Kat shakes her head. "Killing won't calm me down." she says with a glance up at Index.

"It'll just make me more excited. Way more. And I don't need that."* - Wed Nov  4 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's..... - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Go lie down somewhere. I wanna talk about Kilm. - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or sit down. Either way, don't wanna be standing up. - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --...Alright. - Wed Nov  4 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: We can lie down. - Wed Nov  4 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns on her heel and wanders off. Arms remain behind her back for the moment, she she begins opening doors, looking for a bedroom.* - Wed Nov  4 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ToYoToMi - Wed Nov  4 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to the foot of the bed. Once there she turns to face the west and sits down. Slowly she wiggles up into it. Her eyes wander off.

Quietly Kat sighs.

"Kilm's death still excites me." she says.

"But it shouldn't. I know what I've done. I know it was wrong. I know what caused it."* - Wed Nov  4 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Index.

"It's....a -bad- excitement. Not the good kind."* - Wed Nov  4 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I....can't calm down. -Ever-. - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not until...I talk this out.... - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And figure out what I've done. - Wed Nov  4 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm here, and we have all the time in the world. - Wed Nov  4 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll listen to you, and try to help. - Wed Nov  4 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think.... - Wed Nov  4 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I need someone to agree with me. Either that what I did was bad, or good. Because I'm not sure. - Wed Nov  4 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm.... - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Will -always-.... - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Be a part of my past this... - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: His death... - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It -will- come up in my decisions in the future. - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In my conversations. - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So if... - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We don't figure this out right now? - Wed Nov  4 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then when someone brings his name up.....I'll panic. I'll be weak. - Wed Nov  4 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Wed Nov  4 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: U-um.... - Wed Nov  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lie down. - Wed Nov  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: On your back. - Wed Nov  4 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords Kat pulls her boots off. They're left on the floor.

Once this is done, Kat pulls herself further up onto the bed. She then turns over and gets into all fours. Slowly she crawls up onto Index. Once there, she sets her butt down in his lap.

Kat's legs are left sprawled out underneath her form. Eye contact is maintained, and Kat's palms rest on Index's gut.

"I know why I killed Kilm...and why he was so willing to die for it." Kat says.* - Wed Nov  4 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly draws in a deep breath, with eyes averted. Afterwords she slowly releases it, sighing.

"Kilm....he was obsessed. Not for selfish reasons. He was obsessed because I was stressed and it showed."

Kat makes eye contact.

"He wanted to make it better. He thought that was his place. He tried to -make- it his place. By -force-."* - Wed Nov  4 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's palms rise up, off of Index. Slowly she leans forwards, moving her palms with her. When she stops, Kat's palms are over Index's arms. She stares down at him from there.

"But....it was my fault. I didn't talk to him about his obsession sooner. That's what I should've done, rather than killing."

Kat's eyes slowly wander off.

"But...I think...it was too late...by the time I finally killed him."* - Wed Nov  4 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "Let me finish...." she says.

Kat makes eye contact.

"I -knew- his obsession was there. I knew it for five....whole....years."

Kat silently sighs.

"I used it to my advantage. I -used- Kilm. I made him mine. I liked that he was mine. That he was so loyal. He was my weapon. My most powerful weapon, because I saw the obsession so clearly. I could tell...intuitively. He'd have done -anything- for me."

Kat's eyes slowly wander off.

"And yet, instead of making it stop....I made his impulse stronger."

Kat looks at him once more.

"I...-I-....turned Kilm into a monster. It was my doing. That means...it really is completely my fault that he's dead!"* - Wed Nov  4 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes eye contact. She doesn't give Index so much time. She can't.

"I know why I felt guilty...now." Kat says.

"I've been using other people to stay alive. All of this time. I was forced to. But still, I did it. I played on Kilm's emotions. I was a predator. A snake. I always knew that and took pride in it. I just didn't know it could hurt my friends."* - Wed Nov  4 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I... - Wed Nov  4 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tried to make him.... - Wed Nov  4 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My prey, and my friend...at the same time. - Wed Nov  4 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I...-liked-...playing him. - Wed Nov  4 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I liked it a lot. - Wed Nov  4 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay.... - Wed Nov  4 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I get it now. - Wed Nov  4 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly, Kat descends. She wraps her arms around Index's chest as she does this. Eventually she has him in a snug, tight hug. Eyes close, and she sighs. With a nod she says "Now I get it."

"I....love, playing people."* - Wed Nov  4 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's... - Wed Nov  4 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why I like...murder. - Wed Nov  4 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "I truly am....the best. I was able to use every single person in my life, including Kilm. I played them so hard. Like an instrument. Like an artist. That was my thrill. I felt so powerful. Now I know...I was a monster. I...can't do this anymore. I have to stop this."* - Wed Nov  4 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I murder people.... - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: By becoming...an animal. An apex predator. - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I kill them by... - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Making them move as I want them to. - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Making them act as I want them to. - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I manipulate peoples' emotions.... - Wed Nov  4 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So that... - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know what they'll do next. - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's so easy. - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For me. - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one else can do this Index... - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People have tried, to me. - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one can do it. - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one's....good enough. - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It gave me such a rush. - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was the -best-! - Wed Nov  4 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I.... - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I understand now. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Kat.. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see what people are doing before they do it because.... - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I make it happen. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I make them do it. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm like....a god. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That...it felt good. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being that. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being unstoppable. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Literally. - Wed Nov  4 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've become...the strongest person...I've ever met. - Wed Nov  4 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not a single person was stronger. - Wed Nov  4 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can tell. - Wed Nov  4 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But.... - Wed Nov  4 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't have to use people anymore. - Wed Nov  4 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I get it... - Wed Nov  4 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly rises up. Her palms find Index's gut.

Kat's expression is perfectly relaxed. She's very, very calm, because everything makes sense now.

"When I got to Sunagakure I thought I could stop playing people. But Kilm was part of my past. The past where I was a monster. He was the very last person I used. He was the last thing tying me to the life of a monster. I kept lying to him. I never stopped. I thought I did but it was a lie. That's why I felt....that killing him....would set me free. I was killing my -past-. I was killing everything about myself that disgusted me."* - Wed Nov  4 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's.... - Wed Nov  4 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why I thought.... - Wed Nov  4 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd feel good. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This, Index. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is what I was looking for. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wasn't looking for that high. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That excitement. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not when it came to Kilm. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was looking for this. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: This..? - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov  4 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I.... - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was trying to become a good person. - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That Orokuru would like. - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's what I was doing in Sunagakure, remember? - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I wanted Konoha. - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see... - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So... - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So what are you trying to become now..? - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Konoha wasn't about Orokuru. - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was about me, Index. - Wed Nov  4 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was about being something -I- liked. - Wed Nov  4 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly descends once more. Once more she hugs, and nuzzles.

"I....am going to become...someone who doesn't use people." Kat says.

"Someone who's not a predator. Maybe. Or maybe not. All I know is....from now on? I'll know what I am. I might choose to stay a predator but if I do...I'll make sure I know what I'm doing."* - Wed Nov  4 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I hope I didn't completely misread the situation. - Wed Nov  4 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I do this a lot. - Wed Nov  4 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "I have an idea." Kat says.

"I don't want to talk about it...but I think...I know what I'll do. What I'll become."* - Wed Nov  4 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I..... - Wed Nov  4 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains on Kilm's chest, not moving a muscle.

"Am gonna be....me." Kat says.

"I'll keep being the best. I'll just....make sure I know who I'm hurting in the future. And how. That way...when I get attached to someone like Kilm....I know how to deal with it. I know -when- to deal with it. I deal with it the second I stop using them."* - Wed Nov  4 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No....using people. - Wed Nov  4 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't be me if...I use people. - Wed Nov  4 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't even know who I am. - Wed Nov  4 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ever since.... - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Orokuru.... - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Made his plan to leave Konoha.... - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ever since then, I've been in danger. - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ever since then, I've been using people....so that I could stay alive. - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Kat. - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's how I stayed alive. - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I.... - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then I think....The way to rediscover -who- you are...Is by returning to Konoha. - Wed Nov  4 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You...think so? - Wed Nov  4 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Claim what is yours. - Wed Nov  4 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But how you do it...Is up to you. - Wed Nov  4 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It sounds like it was the place where 'you' left off. - Wed Nov  4 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's up to you to continue. - Wed Nov  4 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Nov  4 02:22:30 2015

"Yeah. . ." she coos.

"That's right. I told myself he was okay but I was wrong. I'd forgot he tried to steal me from Orokuru. Kilm really -was- bad. I really -didn't- murder a friend. I murdered....a monster."* - Wed Nov  4 02:33:36 2015
