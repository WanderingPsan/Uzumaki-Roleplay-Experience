<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To be a kage...you have to be stronger than -everyone- in the village. Know -why-? - Tue Sep 29 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because people will expect you to act in times of crisis. They want to see that. If they don't, they'll see you as not being fit to lead them. To protect them. - Tue Sep 29 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And if you act while not being strong enough for the role...well. - Tue Sep 29 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You die. - Tue Sep 29 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What good does that do anyone? - Tue Sep 29 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nothing. - Tue Sep 29 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I only accepted that role because.... - Tue Sep 29 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus ensured me he'd protect me. I'm nowhere near stupid enough to accept it otherwise. - Tue Sep 29 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The plan was always....become strong, and then make Orakuru's dream happen. - Tue Sep 29 15:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm . . . Together. - Tue Sep 29 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Tue Sep 29 15:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder...why Erebus wanted you here. - Tue Sep 29 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted to take you away from me. Why? - Tue Sep 29 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Like you said earlier. - Tue Sep 29 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Kage of Amegakure? - Tue Sep 29 15:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Right. - Tue Sep 29 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) brings her scroll to her lap and slowly unrolls it. With a silent sigh, she sets it down on the ground in front of her and begins reading it. As she does so, she forms the tiger seal with her hands. Not for this jutsu though. For genjutsu kai. 
The girl intends to practice it while reading. Her chakra flow is stopped even as she reads. It takes time due to her being distracted. Eventually however, she manages to stop it. She keeps in mind as she does this that the chakra manipulation for the interrogation jutsu is similar. The difference being, you want to manipulate the enemy's chakra instead.

Eventually, the girl roughly shoves chakra throughout her network. There's some delay since the majority of her attention legitimately is on the contents of this scroll. She's successful though. And of course, once she's finished, she simply resumes practicing the technique. If she can learn to do it absent-mindedly....naturally....by reflex? 

Surely that'll only make her even more skilled with it. In reading this scroll while practicing, she only gets better at it. * - Tue Sep 29 15:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) admits to herself eventually that she'll have to switch her focus completely to the interrogation jutsu. Having read the contents of the scroll entirely, she now needs to practice and see if she can actually do it. Kat carefully begins manipulating the flow of her own chakra. She needs to try and cast the genjutsu technique on herself. If she can do that, then she can begin practicing doing it to other people.

Hours pass as she sends her chakra to and fro. Mostly she focuses on the chakra in her brain of course. As the scroll instructs, she directs her efforts to the parts of the brain that control fear, worry, and anxiety. Parts that control fight or flight. To create a balance between those two instincts to make someone indecisive and uncomfortable.  To make them panic.* - Tue Sep 29 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually passes the scroll back to Kilm.

"Done." she says.* - Tue Sep 29 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nice. - Tue Sep 29 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What do you want to do? We have lots of time. - Tue Sep 29 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Costs a lot of chakra though. - Tue Sep 29 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Whatever we do today it has to be focused on getting stronger. - Tue Sep 29 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or at least...whatever 'I' do. - Tue Sep 29 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's my life at stake. - Tue Sep 29 15:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And i've chosen to help you out no matter what . . . That in turn puts me in the same danger you are as well. - Tue Sep 29 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then...hm. - Tue Sep 29 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What to do. - Tue Sep 29 16:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want to check on Zenaki and kill Fujitora. Unfortunately they're in Kirigakure. - Tue Sep 29 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Getting in would be hard. - Tue Sep 29 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fujitora has decided I'm an enemy too I'm sure. - Tue Sep 29 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fujitora is definitely strong. - Tue Sep 29 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So if he has connections in Kirigakure, they'll know to kill us or bring us to him. - Tue Sep 29 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wonder...if those clones he makes can actually fight. - Tue Sep 29 16:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Might. - Tue Sep 29 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny that Ushinawa is trusting so many clumbsy people. - Tue Sep 29 16:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit I was a bit loose-lipped while working for Erebus but I knew exactly what I was doing. I also knew I didn't care since he didn't bother to communicate with me. - Tue Sep 29 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So my safety came before his plans. - Tue Sep 29 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Your safety is pretty high up in my list too. - Tue Sep 29 16:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hideki...he's very bad at this. So...Erebus will see through him. That means anything he says against me is worth nothing. - Tue Sep 29 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 16:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Let's go somewhere less public if we're discussing this. - Tue Sep 29 16:39:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || He'd be able to see that it's to Erebus. Kat makes no effort to hide this fact. It involves feeding the man information so that he's not played by Ushinawa's group.

A ton of very valuable information is included that makes it beautifully easy to see through Kat's enemy's lies.* - Tue Sep 29 16:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's probably worried I want to use him to kill my enemies. The truth is I don't. - Tue Sep 29 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: All I want...is to make sure Ushinawa's lies aren't getting me killed. - Tue Sep 29 16:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's because of how unintelligent she was. - Tue Sep 29 17:04:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I want it. Bad. - Tue Sep 29 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder what Sunagakure is like. - Tue Sep 29 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Right now. - Tue Sep 29 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Still recovering perhaps . . . - Tue Sep 29 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fujitora's turf I presume. - Tue Sep 29 17:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hate genjutsu. - Tue Sep 29 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Until I master Kai I can't take risks. God damn it. - Tue Sep 29 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If need be . . . I'll hit you so you can escape the genjutsu. - Tue Sep 29 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head with a sigh. The girl slowly sits up, planting her butt to the bed. Hands meet to form the tiger seal, and Kat's eyes close. A subtle scowl is on her face. She can't take risks until she masters this technique. 

It's been this way for so long. Ever since Rymei, she's been afraid to take any risks at all. Traumatized. Because of this, she's been using lies and using other people to get things done, and she's done an awful lot. Even so, this isn't working.

She has to master this jutsu to go and do things. To search villages. To kill the people are are -daring- to annoy her right now. The girl focuses on stopping the flow of her chakra. Once she's succeeded, she roughly sends it out throughout her body once more.

Afterwords, her hands part. Kat's arms rest on her legs. Without any handseals, she attempts to focus. All of her efforts are spent for now on trying to use the jutsu without seals. That means stopping her chakra, without seals.

It takes enormous amounts of time. Maybe even an hour passes. Eventually though, she succeeds. All of that time, just to barely manage to stop her chakra from moving. And then it moves again.

Kat had tried to send her chakra racing about again. Unfortunately, it hadn't worked. Very little force was put into it at this time. A lot of effort, but little to no result. Slowly and silently she draws in deep breath.

She'll need to be patient with this. Even so, she tries every hard. This time she focuses on stopping her chakra more quickly than before, still without seals. Tenketso burn in agony. Even so, she persists.* - Tue Sep 29 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Need any tips on the technique? - Tue Sep 29 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right eyebrow twitches. She's getting very, very impatient. This jutsu only reminds her of just how much she hates genjutsu and especially paralysis. The girl vows that any enemy that dares to try paralyzing her while using a sword will be blown apart from the inside within a few seconds. No mercy.

She sighs. "Sure." she says to Kilm. Her expression relaxes a bit. "What tips?" Kat's chakra flow slows down. It ebs to and fro rather than going in one single direction. It shifts and turns, and wobbles.* - Tue Sep 29 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You know . . . Try focusing on stopping the flow near the brain . . . It'll work a bit better than stopping it at the same time around the body. - Tue Sep 29 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You sure about that? - Tue Sep 29 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Hmph." she says in response. Her scowl remains, subtle or not. The girl focuses on calming herself for now. If she's gonna be focusing on the chakra in her brain like Kilm suggests, she'll want to be very....very careful. Even so, without handseals, it can't be too dangerous.

Her jutsu will be weaker anyway. Eventually she nods. Carefully she focuses specifically on the chakra within her brain. She makes her best effort to stop the chakra there. It takes time, and it's not a good feeling.

Manipulating chakra in the brain specifically generally means using genjutsu on yourself or someone else. As such. it makes her uncomfortable. She feels random chills at times, and warmth at others. Immediately it becomes clear how people train genjutsu, and how it was discovered. People must've experimented with this.

She can only wonder whether or not it's possible to accidentally kill herself with genjutsu. Eventually, after thirty minutes or so, she manages to stop it. Thirty minutes or so because she's becoming much better at this technique. It was taking an hour each time. Once she's done, the girl slowly releases her control over her chakra.

She allows only the smallest amounts to run free. To wander. Immediately afterwords, she reproduces her vicer-grip on it. The girl forces it to come to a complete stop. Slowly she draws in a subtle and shakey breath, trying to be sure it stays that way.

Once more she tests her chakra, doing the exact same thing. This is repeated many times. Over an hour passes. She gets faster and faster with this. Her thoughts are that this is the fastest way to improve.* - Tue Sep 29 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to stretch her neck while she focuses on stopping her chakra flow in her brain. First to the right. The joints pop. The girl then subtly rolls her neck a bit, popping the oppposite side as well. It'd been getting stiff due to how long she's been sitting her training.

The sooner she masters this though, the sooner she can go and gladly ruin peoples' day. The sooner she can easily risk fighting Ushinawa or the masked cloaked girl from before. People underestimate her because of how hard she tries to avoid fighting. It makes her look weak. This fact though is actually a very powerful weapon she intends to take full advantage of.

Little do people know, she was as capable as any one of Zetsumo's other students. She's very confident. The girl can get away with pretty much anything as long as she's careful about whose attention she draws. Kat's chakra flow stops. She holds it. 

A new strategy comes to mind. Kat will simply hold her chakra like this for hours. Eventually, it'll be easy to make it stop completely. She's gaining control over it. Eventually she releases it completely, only to attempt to suddenly stop it once more.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: More organized, because we'll be on the same page. - Tue Sep 29 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Understand? - Tue Sep 29 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sprints along, with Kilm trailing behind her. The girl's leaning forwards and her arms are at her sides. Eyes wander for every single step she takes. She runs slow enough for Kilm to keep up. The girl doesn't have to hold back much though. 

Kilm's become very fast. "If we do sneak in...and we get caught." she says, now hours closer to Kumogakure. "We'll be in trouble." They pass a random traveler. Naturally Kat strafts off to the side as they do so. Cautious as always, just in case that's a shinobi sword specialist. Her paranoia is as bad as Zetsumo's...only she's actually 'good' at keeping things exactly where she wants them to be.

* - Tue Sep 29 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Is it just me or are you having trouble keeping up? - Tue Sep 29 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm pacing myself. - Tue Sep 29 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't waste energy. - Tue Sep 29 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Kilm in response to him noting that he has an errand to run. With a shrug, she continues moving. Hours pass. Eventually she needs to stop and rest. With a shrug, she makes camp.

Hidden underneath her tent, which is nothing more than a front, is a cave of her own making. She makes it with Hiding Like a Mole Jutsu. By way of this, she ensures no one sneaks up on her while she sleeps. When Kat's done, she packs up and resumes traveling. If she dies for leaving Amegakure to get a god damned bird, that's gonna be pretty sad.* - Tue Sep 29 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ends up camping somewhere else for a while. She makes camp several times in fact. When she gets back to Amegakure she'll be sure to find out why in the fuck they don't have a bird store. Someone's going to lose their house. With a sigh, she eventually wakes up and stretches.

She then resumes traveling, sprinting away. Part of her hopes someone's dumb enough to chase her when she's in Kumogakure. Things would be less dull for a while, and there would be corpses. The bloodthirst Zetsumo drilled into her with his "mental fortitude training" does remain, deep down. She tries to burry it but it's there.

When she has to kill, she enjoys it, even if she hides the fact and is very good at controlling herself.* - Tue Sep 29 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sneaks past Kumogakure's perimiter using hidden mole. Once she's within the walls she surfaces in a dirty area that has no grass. She leaves the mole covered up behind her and resumes walking.

She needs to find a store.* - Tue Sep 29 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) exits the store she'd come out of, forming the tiger handseal as she walks through the flaps. In a flash, she's then gone. She's particularly skilled with the shunshin jutsu so there are no side effects. The girl puts herself in a dark alley. From there, she uses hidden mole to exit the village.

Easy. Exactly as you should expect it to be. Why Kirigakure thinks it's an impenetrable fortress the world may never know. Someone should very slowly and carefully explain to them to dangers of paranoia. Very, very slowly. Maybe that'll be Kat's next stop.

Hours pass, and she's that much closer to home. Amegakure.* - Tue Sep 29 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops to rest, making for herself yet another cave. She sleeps extra long today. All this running is exhausting. It's a good thing Kilm's not here anymore though. It allows Kat to practice her favorite jutsu even more.

When Kat's traveling again, she often makes use of the shunshin jutsu. Even as it stops working she continues sprinting without pause. Of course, each time...she has to wait many long seconds to use it again. Half a full minute even, probably. In a fight, that'd be a life time. If she were to use it any more often, she'd experience the side effects.

And that's exactly why she's practicing. To train.* - Tue Sep 29 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) just non-chalantly walks by. Palms are on the back of her head, and the girl's expression is blank. A careless glance is sent Koji's way, but she pays little attention to him. She makes no effort whatsoever to hide her presence.* - Tue Sep 29 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop. Eyes wander, slowly, and in a shady manner. After some moment of consideration, Kat resumes walking.

It'd crossed her mind to steal the dude's headband and face but no....that wouldn't work. Supposedly villages have some sort of magic BS means of detecting henge that isn't even canon.* - Tue Sep 29 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to familiar training grounds. The girl never expected to see this place again in all honesty. She'd hoped she'd never be anywhere near any place so distinctively "Kenryoku" ever again. Even so, she knows the area. She chose a place where the townspeople won't be bothered by her training....but close enough to where she can easily sprint to the town square within a single breath due to how fast she is.

Kat's arms rise and hands meet to form the tiger seal. The truth is, she almost definitely doesn't need any handseals for this technique. Even so, it probably helps in some way or another. Chakra is at a lightning-fast pace sent forwards like a river from her palms. It's invisible, but it's there.

For the most part, for this exceedingly simple and useless technique, Kat forms the mud from her chakra alone. Dirt from the ground, too, is picked up though. It's quickly moulded into mud, and the entire river is sent racing forwards with tremendous force. Eventually it even crashes into the ocean north of her. That's at least fourty feet away, but that's just how much range this jutsu has.

It's probably the longest-ranged jutsu she has oddly enough. Eventually, Kat's river settles down. Briefly the teen lets her hands part, before putting them back together. It takes time for her chakra circuits to cool off. When they do, though, she repeats her former motions. Mud is piled up on top of the last river, and it too races forwards.

As a result, much of the mud from before is weighed down. Thus, it's forced to quickly spread east and west and cover more ground.  When she's complete, Kat turns and begins walking to the east. She produces more mud as she goes. Before long, the former hokage is looking at a blanket sixty feet wide of mud. * - Tue Sep 29 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to the mud she'd prepared a day before. This is Amegakure so it's always raining. Because of this, the mud is still nice and wet. It's still "mud." Three handseals are formed.

Naturally, chakra invisibly pours out of her body in response -- probably through the feet. It fills the mud. Once it's reached its destination, a dragon's head made of mud slowly rises up. It faces the north. Eyes leer, and its massive maw opens.

Fangs spill drops of mud every second. A very bright light marks the entrance to the dragon's throat. From this light comes a very long and loud barrage of mud bullets. Due to the force of each bullet, each releases a very loud reverberating bang. Seeing as there are one-hundred or so of them, the sound is easily enough to stress ears.

Mud balls skid accross the water to the north of Kat like skipping stones. Occasionally some hit trees on the island north of her's. The technique lacks accuracy, because she hasn't mastered it. Eventually. Kat's barrage dies down. Lazily, she turns on her heel to face the south.

If nothing else, this technique at least has an extremely low chakra cost -- at least for her, thanks to Zetsumo's teachings. Not only does that make it easy to pull out and spam in battle, but it also makes it relatively easy to master. The low chakra cost means she can train for that much longer. Kat weaves the three handseals once more. Once more, a dragon's head made of mud is formed.

This time, the girl directs the blasts at a nearby tree. She needs to test its power, thoroughly. The dragon's head comes out nearly instantly, as it always does. It's meant to be used in combination with Earth Flow River after all, while the enemy is still being knocked back. Once it's visible, it launches its barrage.

The tree is hit by enormous amounts of mud balls. At first it releases cracking noises and it shakes. Trees fall. That's with only the first several blasts of this unmastered technique. So many more follow, though.

Eventually the tree falls entirely. Kat's barrage is forced to target the tree behind it as a result. This one, too, loudly cries out, screeching. More leaves fall. The tree remains standing up, but it's scarred now. With a shrug and a faint frown on her face that suggests disappointment, Kat continues training for several hours.* - Wed Sep 30 15:11:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls onto her belly in her bed. Both palms are planted against her cheeks and a subtle but sour expression is on her face. Eyes are downcast.

"Erebus hasn't replied to my letters." she says.

"Either he's dead, he's rude, or...he's preparing assassins for us."* - Wed Sep 30 15:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not yours, and Erebus's, and Ushinawa's at the same time. - Wed Sep 30 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't...fuck....with -me-. - Wed Sep 30 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I'm only saying that cause she still thinks I lied when I didn't . . . Me saying I was lying was the lie. - Wed Sep 30 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) knows this and is talking about the lie he just told.

The fact is, either he lied just now or he lied before. That's very obvious.

Now stop using think chat you ass.* - Wed Sep 30 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Wed Sep 30 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Now i'm intimidated. - Wed Sep 30 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're not following sweety. - Wed Sep 30 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) uncrosses her arms, slowly. Slowly, her arms rise. The girl's hands would find his lips if she's not stopped. The corners of them.

Slowly she lifts them up, forcing Kilm to smile again if allowed.

"This -smile-." she says.

"The smile is fake. Not your lie."

Her head tilts a bit. "Are you following now? I don't have time for pretentious behavior."* - Wed Sep 30 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm following. - Wed Sep 30 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good. - Wed Sep 30 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes her arms back. She stands with both of them at her sides, still staring and studying.* - Wed Sep 30 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm glard we're on the same page. - Wed Sep 30 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: glad* - Wed Sep 30 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I guess I'll just...have to start hiding things from you. - Wed Sep 30 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sleeping in a different room. - Wed Sep 30 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not trusting you. - Wed Sep 30 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How's that? - Wed Sep 30 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't do that please. - Wed Sep 30 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That is...if you can't have the -patience-...and -respect-...to prove to me that you're loyal. - Wed Sep 30 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you're too good to do that. - Wed Sep 30 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Which...is what your pretentious, stuck-up behavior implies. - Wed Sep 30 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -Everything-....I said about Konoha. Every single thing....was true. - Wed Sep 30 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was always true. - Wed Sep 30 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't lie if I'm not desperate. - Wed Sep 30 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't lie if it's not an emergency. - Wed Sep 30 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No blatant lies. - Wed Sep 30 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Unless it's an emergency and I don't have time to think things through. - Wed Sep 30 16:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You were asking about Konoha anyway. - Wed Sep 30 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Explain yourself. - Wed Sep 30 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You were either making small talk...to impress me. To ease into something else.... - Wed Sep 30 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or you didn't believe me the first time I told you my plans. - Wed Sep 30 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Which is it? - Wed Sep 30 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because you already knew....that I wanted to turn Konoha into what Orakuru wanted. - Wed Sep 30 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: None of the mentioned. I wanted to know what happens after all this is over. You might've told me what happens afterwards but you should know that I have bad memory. - Wed Sep 30 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I was asking about what happens after you turn Konoha into what Orakuru wanted. - Wed Sep 30 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even if that's very far away. - Wed Sep 30 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Or well . . . Depends on how we handle the situation. - Wed Sep 30 16:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Wed Sep 30 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes. Her expression relaxes, even if her body remains a bit tense...guarded, for only this very brief moment. She turns and sets herself on the bed, gently. From there she wiggles into place. Palms rest at either side of her on the mattress, and Kat's right leg crosses over the left.

Eyes wander off.

"There is no 'what do we do after?' " she explains.

"When Konoha is what Orakuru wanted, we have to keep working to make it stay that way. I can't live forever so I'll have to create some form of....system. A system that ensures Konoha will always be the same. A council....some sort of voting system. That sort of thing. And until the day I die, I'll have to do my best as hokage or make sure someone competent is doing the job for me."

There's a brief pause, and eyes wander.

"That's how I'll make things right with Orokuru." she says, a bit quietly.* - Wed Sep 30 16:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 16:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And not a single person in this world will get in my way no matter what their excuse is. - Wed Sep 30 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have my own plans though they're going to be completed over time and don't contradict with anything. - Wed Sep 30 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. Eyes wander a bit more.* - Wed Sep 30 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: He means romance. - Wed Sep 30 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm so bored. - Wed Sep 30 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Same. - Wed Sep 30 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 30 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) opens up the scroll Erebus just sent her and holds it open for Kilm to see.

Her expression is blank, and she stares up at him.

"What do you make of this?" she asks.* - Wed Sep 30 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm not sure what he's going to do. - Wed Sep 30 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have no way to read him. - Wed Sep 30 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suspect...it might be a trap. - Wed Sep 30 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need to make sure he's alone. - Wed Sep 30 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When he gets here. - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he is, he'll be easy to deal wtih. - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This has gotta be a trap. - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I doubt he'd try throwing another party. - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As well as that went last time. . . - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can't not be there either. - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need...something. - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gotta think fast. - Wed Sep 30 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He could be here already. - Wed Sep 30 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Help me think, Kilm. - Wed Sep 30 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We hide again? - Wed Sep 30 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Just to lose more trust? - Wed Sep 30 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Although ensure safety temporarily? - Wed Sep 30 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why does he have to be so -cryptic-! - Wed Sep 30 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He should know better.... - Wed Sep 30 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He should know how I think by now. - Wed Sep 30 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He may have...mistaken my last letter as a passive aggressive threat. - Wed Sep 30 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It wasn't. - Wed Sep 30 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's too unpredictable to trust. - Wed Sep 30 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 30 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll...send him a letter. The man seems to have emotions so.... - Wed Sep 30 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll see if I can poke at those. - Wed Sep 30 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins writing.* - Wed Sep 30 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Sep 30 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) visibly and obviously hesitates to send the letter, despite having signed her name on it already, proving that she's finished writing.

Eyes wander. A faint frown is on her face.* - Wed Sep 30 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's here. . . - Wed Sep 30 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What do we do? - Wed Sep 30 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fine. - Wed Sep 30 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're going. - Wed Sep 30 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Stay here if you want, anyway. I'm going, at least. - Wed Sep 30 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll come. - Wed Sep 30 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and quickly scurries out the door.* - Wed Sep 30 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stands at the end of the road, with both arms behind her back. She holds her left arm with her right hand.

Eyes had wandered to and fro since the moment she left the inn, eyeing for potential ambushes or anything. She does so as subtly as she can manage, and scans even the town square. Of course, to Erebus, it could be mistaken for her simply looking for him.

Eventually, she's eyeing Erebus, fairly blankly.

"Good morning...." she says, staying right where she is.* - Wed Sep 30 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "No, it hasn't." she says.* - Wed Sep 30 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I also told you the truth. - Wed Sep 30 17:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit to you.... - Wed Sep 30 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even as suicidal as you may think it sounds... - Wed Sep 30 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I still want Konoha. - Wed Sep 30 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll always want Konoha. - Wed Sep 30 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Never said I didn't. - Wed Sep 30 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Specifically...Konoha. - Wed Sep 30 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) waits for Erebus to speak.* - Wed Sep 30 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's true. I'm good at talking to people. Doesn't mean I'm playing you. - Wed Sep 30 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Remember my advice. "Only work with facts." - Wed Sep 30 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I do so myself, because paranoia is very dangerous. - Wed Sep 30 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder. . . - Wed Sep 30 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who's been inside your head? - Wed Sep 30 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Too long, Don't read. - Wed Sep 30 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....I'm sorry for saying that. The fact is...you scare the hell out of me. - Wed Sep 30 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How you haven't realized that yet I can't -imagine-. - Wed Sep 30 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You make me nervous, so when you don't respond...I keep talking. - Wed Sep 30 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're unpredictable. - Wed Sep 30 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Wed Sep 30 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For all I know you'd kill me if I said a single word off. - Wed Sep 30 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So...I'm asking you to forgive me when I occasionally slip. - Wed Sep 30 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Betrayal cannot be forgiven --- under normal circumstances. - Wed Sep 30 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What betrayal? - Wed Sep 30 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't recall ever betraying you, so I'll need clarification if we're going to be on the same page. - Wed Sep 30 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It seems we're in completely different books, Katsune. - Wed Sep 30 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We always have been. It's why I ask you so many questions and make so many assumptions. Why I 'over-think things". - Wed Sep 30 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know nothing about you. - Wed Sep 30 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And with you being so dangerous....that's why I'm always making back-up plans for my back-up plans with you. - Wed Sep 30 18:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You suggest....I'm horrible for not trusting you. - Wed Sep 30 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But...what efforts have you made to make me trust you? - Wed Sep 30 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Apart from the incident with K- - Wed Sep 30 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What efforts? - Wed Sep 30 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. You've made efforts. - Wed Sep 30 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But you're going about it the wrong way. - Wed Sep 30 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No, no.. - Wed Sep 30 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: . . . She's making a mistake. - Wed Sep 30 18:10:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's a effort, no? - Wed Sep 30 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You were given the Hokage spot. - Wed Sep 30 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's an effort, no? - Wed Sep 30 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You were given a military. - Wed Sep 30 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's an effort, no? - Wed Sep 30 18:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Those things are nice. Thank you for giving them to me. - Wed Sep 30 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: However, I interpreted those as you...sharpening your tools. - Wed Sep 30 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Us...being...the tools. - Wed Sep 30 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see, I see. - Wed Sep 30 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see that I was wrong. I'm just telling you what was on my mind. - Wed Sep 30 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You have the mindset of Zetsumo. It's just conflicted with your goals to do what Orakuru wished for. - Wed Sep 30 18:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's been...hard to work for you. Your immortality makes you very unique. Very hard to understand because you're of an entirely different species. - Wed Sep 30 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you were any mortal man.... - Wed Sep 30 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We would have got along perfectly fine. - Wed Sep 30 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're the reason I try so hard when I talk. - Wed Sep 30 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The only reason why my immortality would be a problem for you is if you planned on killing me. - Wed Sep 30 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: See? You don't understand my position either. - Wed Sep 30 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's the case, yes? - Wed Sep 30 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I explained it before. Your immortality makes you unfamiliar with the precautions I take. - Wed Sep 30 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Precautions are precautions. - Wed Sep 30 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't understand how you can blame me for wanting to make sure I stay alive. - Wed Sep 30 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If I was as durable as I am now, but without the immortality, I still wouldn't be able to be killed. - Wed Sep 30 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: He's durable. Noted. - Wed Sep 30 18:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You are.. a splitting image of Zetsumo - Wed Sep 30 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Splitting.. image - Wed Sep 30 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I 'was' his favorite. - Wed Sep 30 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Get a new wardrobe before you suffer the same fate as him. - Wed Sep 30 18:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're the one slipping Erebus. - Wed Sep 30 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a shame you can't see it. - Wed Sep 30 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's not a threat. - Wed Sep 30 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Provide me with the water to wash my eyes out then. - Wed Sep 30 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's advice. You won't find anyone as weak as me that trusts you if you keep acting like this. - Wed Sep 30 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're intimidating and you -revel- in the fact. - Wed Sep 30 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You amuse yourself with it. - Wed Sep 30 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: While I run the second you show up with an army. - Wed Sep 30 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And you wonder -why-. - Wed Sep 30 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ahh. - Wed Sep 30 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see... - Wed Sep 30 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The truth finally came out. - Wed Sep 30 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Up until that point I believed you were truly on a mission.. - Wed Sep 30 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm impatient with you Erebus. - Wed Sep 30 18:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you - Wed Sep 30 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glares. "I'm tired of WATCHING MY MOUTH!" she shouts, basically snarling. Hands clench into fists.

"I'm tired of BEING YOUR GOD DAMNED SLAVE."* - Wed Sep 30 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Someone has you enslaved? - Wed Sep 30 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm tired explaining this to you. I've been so LOYAL! - Wed Sep 30 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been so COMPETENT! - Wed Sep 30 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do not try to give ME advice! I'm not taking it! - Wed Sep 30 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm free from Zetsumo and I'm going to stay free! I'll do what I FUCKING want! - Wed Sep 30 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you want to know how it is I feel enslaved?!?!? - Wed Sep 30 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Figure it out on your own! - Wed Sep 30 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're.. so close to understanding that I can smell it on you. You say that you've explained yourself numerous of time, you're right. Why is it a bad that I have to assure myself that I have a loyal partner, but you've been free to do as you please all this time. - Wed Sep 30 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: How is it right for you to make precautions, but not me..? - Wed Sep 30 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: How is it right that I get yelled at for giving myself security, but it's okay for you to do it without any rebuttal? - Wed Sep 30 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I may be immortal, but I do enjoy a loyal group of partners. - Wed Sep 30 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If you were truly my slave, Katsune.. You think you'd be alive for raising your voice to your owner..? - Wed Sep 30 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I did nothing wrong. You slipped in Konoha at the gates with those two-thousand. Embarrassed -yourself-. Take credit for it. - Wed Sep 30 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Embarrassed..? - Wed Sep 30 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't ever feel that way.. - Wed Sep 30 18:27:12 2015
