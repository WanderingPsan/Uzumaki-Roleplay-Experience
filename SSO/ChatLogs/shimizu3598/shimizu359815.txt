<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As such, I can't let you assault him right now. - Thu Sep 24 00:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) keeps her eyes low and on Yan's feet. Her head turns a bit in acknowledgement of his walking, though. The teen averts her eyes in response and rises to her feet to follow him.* - Thu Sep 24 01:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When you decide, let me know. - Thu Sep 24 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I will be standing by. - Thu Sep 24 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Just don't cause trouble while you're here, please. - Thu Sep 24 01:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Also, if you have any work you don't want to set your own ninja to task doing..Myself and Flexus will be interested in aiding you. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wouldn't dare, ma'm. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Interesting. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing I'm sure about is up for grabs right now, but I'll keep you in mind. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Understood. - Thu Sep 24 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go sleep.* - Thu Sep 24 01:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Morning. - Thu Sep 24 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Thu Sep 24 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hopefully today there will come even more people. - Thu Sep 24 13:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure is annoyed with us....supposedly. - Thu Sep 24 13:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: How so? - Thu Sep 24 13:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They "see us as a potential threat" apparently. . . - Thu Sep 24 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suspect it's Erebus. - Thu Sep 24 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . If Erebus leaves, We should be better . . . Then again . . . I'd probably need to improve our relation with Kirigakure. - Thu Sep 24 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus says it was because of the mission I assigned. That could be true. Doesn't seem to make sense though according to what Paine said...if what she said is accurate. - Thu Sep 24 14:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She says they never entered the village. - Thu Sep 24 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Must be Erebus then. - Thu Sep 24 14:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not willing to give Erebus up unless I'm giving up on the village -- which I'd consider. - Thu Sep 24 14:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This position is suicide without someone strong at my disposal. - Thu Sep 24 14:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't think Kenshin is horribly loyal to Kirigakure. I think he lets them do their own thing until someone tries to take over the world like Zetsumo did. - Thu Sep 24 14:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I'm not sure I'm ready to let them do whatever yet. - Thu Sep 24 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Thu Sep 24 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I am not afraid of Koeki. - Thu Sep 24 14:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll try and calm Kirigakure down but I'm not giving them anything unreasonable. - Thu Sep 24 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Sep 24 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way. - Thu Sep 24 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have no army. They have nine-thousand. - Thu Sep 24 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Thu Sep 24 14:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Silly when they think of us as a potential threat when we have no shinobi. - Thu Sep 24 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think it's more. . . - Thu Sep 24 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They see us becoming a threat if we're allowed to grow. - Thu Sep 24 14:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "Potential" threat. Not threat. - Thu Sep 24 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I'll admit I'm not sure how I feel about you handling relations. I'm under the impression that's the hokage's role. - Thu Sep 24 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm fine with just being a chuunin if you wish to not keep me as the internations officer. - Thu Sep 24 14:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm just not sure whether or not you're good at it. It's a very important job. - Thu Sep 24 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I haven't even started my duties yet. - Thu Sep 24 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It would be nice to have someone handle that.... - Thu Sep 24 14:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Your choice though. - Thu Sep 24 14:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Huh.... - Thu Sep 24 14:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) just finished reading the contents of a scroll.* - Thu Sep 24 14:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who is that? - Thu Sep 24 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Remember that guy who hosted that dice game? - Thu Sep 24 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes Kilm the scroll to let him read it.* - Thu Sep 24 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The one who wanted dice back. - Thu Sep 24 14:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ah . . . Hanabi is in prison? - Thu Sep 24 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. - Thu Sep 24 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where do you think they are right now? - Thu Sep 24 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Kiri? - Thu Sep 24 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Considering how soon I sent the letter, my guess is Kirigakure. - Thu Sep 24 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Annd they don't like us very much right now. - Thu Sep 24 14:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts the scroll away.* - Thu Sep 24 14:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She got sent to prison awfully fast. . . - Thu Sep 24 14:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I sent that letter as soon as she left Konoha. - Thu Sep 24 14:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh . . . - Thu Sep 24 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Squads.... - Thu Sep 24 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You wanted squads, Kilm? - Thu Sep 24 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah. - Thu Sep 24 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why? - Thu Sep 24 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How do squads help? - Thu Sep 24 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Official squads that is. - Thu Sep 24 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Rather than just any three people. - Thu Sep 24 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or four. - Thu Sep 24 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They're organized and they can be assigned missions together instead of just individually. - Thu Sep 24 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can be given a purpose and can build trust with each other overtime. - Thu Sep 24 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't think I like it. - Thu Sep 24 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe when we have some jounin, which will probably be at least a year from now. - Thu Sep 24 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Although. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There is something I noticed under Zetsumo. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Whenever we were sent on a mission, I was always the one and only person that said we should stop and plan before we leave the village. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's honestly terrifying. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me and Orakuru almost died on our first mission together because we just ran up to the enemy camp. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He didn't think we needed a plan. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We 'did'. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's why I said I will keep reminding myself to plan even if the mission sounds simple and easy. - Thu Sep 24 15:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Having squads with appointed leaders that know what they're doing...I can see some sense in that. - Thu Sep 24 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As for the jounin . . . Going to be a while before we get some . . . Need them to be Gezo Privates if they are to be real jounin. - Thu Sep 24 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The Gezo. . . - Thu Sep 24 15:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Na. If I say anything the Gezo will kill me. - Thu Sep 24 15:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Anything else to discuss? - Thu Sep 24 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd like to know more about a dead woman named Kastya. Other than that no. - Thu Sep 24 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She was a jinchuuriki from what I know. - Thu Sep 24 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She was one of the Kazekages. - Thu Sep 24 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Had a little sister named Katya . . . - Thu Sep 24 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think she was related to Kronos too. - Thu Sep 24 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Was still alive when I just began working for Kumogakure. - Thu Sep 24 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People say she had a demon living inside of her. Know anything about that? - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mmh . . . Hard to remember . . . - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I only mostly knew common knowledge. - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The demon does ring a bell though. - Thu Sep 24 15:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anything else? - Thu Sep 24 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing I'm ready to ask about. - Thu Sep 24 15:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Thu Sep 24 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm ready to go on any mission . . . If you've got something for me that is - Thu Sep 24 15:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're anxious to go on missions, Kilm; that's admirable. At the same time, however, you're going about things the wrong way. - Thu Sep 24 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Becoming a Jounin is your goal, fine; missions don't get you there. - Thu Sep 24 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not putting down your efforts, but think of things at a bigger picture. - Thu Sep 24 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There's no true requirement for Jounin other than passing the exams. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm getting missions so I can be more battle ready. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It doesn't hurt to get better. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The missions you're asking for will end in your demise. - Thu Sep 24 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What doesn't kill me makes me stronger . . . You've probably heard that phrase before. - Thu Sep 24 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's right. - Thu Sep 24 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No matter how strong you get, I won't make you a jounin unless you've proven other things to me. - Thu Sep 24 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That phrase is a contradiction, but I see your point. - Thu Sep 24 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- On the other hand. - Thu Sep 24 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Grant him what he seeks, Katsune. - Thu Sep 24 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It's his beliefs.. - Thu Sep 24 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Missions will teach him the skills he needs to get there. - Thu Sep 24 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let me think, though. - Thu Sep 24 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Thu Sep 24 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Thu Sep 24 16:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches into her drawer to pull out a scroll. Briefly she opens it up to look it up and down.

"One of the outlying villages has been having problems with bandits..." she says.

The teen rolls it up as she then passes it to Kilm.

"Clean them up. People think Konoha and its territories are easy targets right now since we can't afford to pay for shinobi to guard the walls. Prove them wrong. Leave no one alive." Kat says with eyes on the floor.

"I want to make an example out of them."* - Thu Sep 24 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: . . . Well damn, I sure have weird timing to always walk in at important moments. - Thu Sep 24 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: B rank. - Thu Sep 24 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can handle it. You're stronger than a C class ninja in most ways. Zetsumo taught you a lot of techniques. - Thu Sep 24 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or...bring people with you if you prefer. - Thu Sep 24 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mm . . . Not a lot of people to choose from right now . . . I'll do it myself for now. - Thu Sep 24 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- If you're sure. I don't want you to die though. - Thu Sep 24 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You really do care about me. - Thu Sep 24 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're valuable. - Thu Sep 24 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes are averted when she says this. Her expression is blank.* - Thu Sep 24 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: -- Only for value? Alright. - Thu Sep 24 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's right. - Thu Sep 24 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Damn, cold. - Thu Sep 24 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Did you really have to say that? - Thu Sep 24 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course I did. I don't want to lead him on. - Thu Sep 24 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I wonder if I could make a shadow clone do all of my paper work for me. . . - Thu Sep 24 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You could've atleast called him a friend. - Thu Sep 24 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Sheesh. - Thu Sep 24 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He knows we're friends. - Thu Sep 24 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then ignore what I said. - Thu Sep 24 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm gonna go train for a bit. . . - Thu Sep 24 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be east of the mansion if anyone needs me. - Thu Sep 24 16:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That mission wasn't that bad. - Thu Sep 24 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did any make it away alive? - Thu Sep 24 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nope. - Thu Sep 24 17:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and turns to walk away.* - Thu Sep 24 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: See you later. - Thu Sep 24 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Thu Sep 24 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out from the kage mansion to the same woods she's been using for training shunshin. The teen does so at a lazy pace. Lately, she has no drive whatsoever. All work and no play is what it means to be the hokage right now. That'll be the case until she and her village are very capable.

Being weak means no leverage. No room to ask other factions to compromise. It means having to give people whatever they want. It's for this reason that she trains harder than she ever has before. Hands meet to form the tiger seal.

As they do so, Kat turns her head to look up at and study the mountain base she's chosen. Rocks protrude out of it all over the place, as well as the occasional shrub or branch. There's room for her to hold onto any number of things should she need to. She 'will' need to do so, too. By now, Kat's become pretty good with this jutsu. 

She doesn't risk throwing up anymore. There is, however, still the dizzyness and such to deal with. Abruptly, the teen shoves chakra throughout her body to the various nerves and muscles there. As soon as she feels it spur her on as it always does, she sprints. Chakra meets the base of her feet as she goes, for the Suimen technique.

This of course allows her to scale the structure. She moves as a barely-visible blur, and so fast that almost no one could possibly hit her while she's in mid-stride. Eventually, she comes to a stop. The area Kat's chosen provides a long, thick, sturdy branch. Sturdy enough to support her weight, but thin enough to test her balance.

The limb holds strong, barely wobbling at the end of it -- though she's at the much more secure base. Both feet rest side-by-side, and Kat's hands remain in formation of the tiger seal. Eyes are closed, and Kat takes many quick and sharp, deep breaths. It takes all of her willpower to not teeter over and fall to her death. That's what she's counting on, too.

In doing this training, Kat puts fear into herself. Fear that should help spur herself into developing the resistance to this shunshin-induced naseua. * - Thu Sep 24 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to Flexus. Arms meet behind her back since she has no pockets. The teen holds one arm with the opposite hand.

"Hi." she says.* - Thu Sep 24 21:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's face is resting on her fists at the moment. She looks bored. It's clear she has only so much patience for the professional attitude she typically tries to keep up.

A blank expression is on the lolikage's face when she peers up at Asteroth.

For many reasons, it stays blank despite the insults. Boredom and strategy are among them.

"Scrolls...?" she inquires.
"Why would I give you scrolls?"* - Fri Sep 25 02:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes slowly wander off. One leg crosses over the other, and she leans back to where her back's touching her chair. Kat's arms cross and eye contact is taken back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes, and says nothing.

Even if she had been about to give in, Asteroth's lack of charisma doesn't help her at all.* - Fri Sep 25 03:29:55 2015

"Good night Flexus." she says, before turning to walk away.* - Fri Sep 25 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually sends a single scroll to Asteroth by bird. It contains the knowledge of both jutsus she'd requested, alongside a note.* - Fri Sep 25 04:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to look Beth up and down. Eventually she just makes eye contact and stares expectedly, expecting Beth to tell her who she is.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs. She averts her eyes. "Alright." she says.

"Good morning. . ."* - Fri Sep 25 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . We doing anything today? - Fri Sep 25 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Sep 25 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I'm at the point in my career where I should keep my arsenal of techniques a secret. - Fri Sep 25 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To be honest. . . - Fri Sep 25 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A spar would be pointless at the moment. - Fri Sep 25 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even just a taijutsu spar? - Fri Sep 25 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've learned nothing new lately. - Fri Sep 25 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So the results would be the same as always. - Fri Sep 25 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . What else . . . - Fri Sep 25 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Still haven't heard from Zenaki. This is either unbelievably rude and self-centered behavior for her, or she really is held against her will. Probably the former. - Fri Sep 25 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Guess I'm gonna go train. - Fri Sep 25 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like, my jutsus. - Fri Sep 25 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You two are welcome to join me if you want. - Fri Sep 25 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I still haven't mastered my recent one. - Fri Sep 25 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Going to join probably . . . Need to finish it anyway. - Fri Sep 25 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She then rises to her feet and turns to make her exit.

"We'll be somewhere within the walls." she says to "Hanae."* - Fri Sep 25 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to the nearest tree. Once there, Kat's weight shifts a bit. She stares blankly at it. Briefly, she looks it up and down. After some amount of consideration, the teen lifts her arms and puts her hands together.

The tiger seal is formed. Abruptly, she shoves chakra out of her hands, doing her best to rapidly grind it together and form raiton-natured chakra in the process. This chakra nigh-instantaneously covers her entire body and spreads out, shocking her environment. The raiton flash jutsu. Naturally, little to nothing happens to this tree.

Kat shrugs, having expected as much. All the more reason to train this otherwise useless jutsu. The girl waits a while, allowing her tenketsu to cool off. They can only take so much abuse before demanding that she pauses for the briefest of moments. The moment Kat feels like she can perform the jutsu again, she does so.

With another loud, crackling bang, Kat lights up like a christmas tree once more.* - Fri Sep 25 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't know how useful this technique will be in battle. - Fri Sep 25 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, having decided that this technique is a waste of time. Instead, Kat turns on her heel to face the west. Eyes find the trees off in the distance. For a very long while, Kat looks for some sort of marker. She never finds one.

With a shrug, Kat reaches into her robes and pulls out a kunai. With precision, she launches it forwards. With a clunk, the weapon finds itself in the trunk of one of the trees. Whether or not Kat hit what she was aiming for doesn't matter. The kunai's nothing more than a target for target practice.

Lazily the teen kneels down. Once on the ground, her palms meet the surface. Roughly, she launches her chakra into the ground. It races across at an extremely fast pace. Maybe a full second later, it finds the tree Kat wants it to find. When it arrives, the subterrain there is very quickly molded.

Four large, very dense, and thick spikes are formed from earth and stone. As opposed to how Kat may normally do this technique, she does her best to make sure the spikey tips in particular are extra rocky and hard. This all happens very suddenly due to how quickly she's capable of manipulating chakra. Once done, Kat uses her chakra to shove the spikes forwards. They're guided from all sides, for precision only.

Eyes are locked onto her kunai. When the spikes come forwards, they all hit the tree very roughly. So much so that it shakes. Naturally, the tree is impaled in many places. Wood cries out in response. 

None of the spikes touch the intended target. They're close, but the best they do is getting a few inches below Kat's kunai. Naturally, due to the shaking, this weapon wobbles and then falls loose. With a blank expression on her face, the kage watches it fall down to the ground. A sigh follows and she retrieves another kunai, tossing it to where the last had been.* - Fri Sep 25 15:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know. . . - Fri Sep 25 15:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's depressing to think that someone so short-sighted was actually capable of keeping us for so long. - Fri Sep 25 15:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . We're going to think ahead . . . Right? - Fri Sep 25 15:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's never going to change, no matter how strong I get. - Fri Sep 25 15:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In the shinobi world, you never know what to expect, so being overly brave is just plain stupid. - Fri Sep 25 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo didn't seem to realize that. - Fri Sep 25 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) still to this day isn't aware that Zetsumo was immortal.* - Fri Sep 25 15:34:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can I use it on you? - Fri Sep 25 15:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passess Kilm a mission scroll at some point off-screen.* - Fri Sep 25 16:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Fri Sep 25 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the woman, briefly glancing up at her.

"Peace and stability? Nothing complicated." she says.
"Or at least...peace for 'our' village. I don't much care for the others."* - Fri Sep 25 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hopefully no one bothers us. - Fri Sep 25 16:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: But once you have your naswer let me know.  - Fri Sep 25 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I will. - Fri Sep 25 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Kilm. - Fri Sep 25 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hm? - Fri Sep 25 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'll be buttering up Seisuke soon for cheat notes on the Gezo Private written test. - Fri Sep 25 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Don't mess things up again by getting jealous. - Fri Sep 25 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You'll be taking it someday? - Fri Sep 25 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Soon. - Fri Sep 25 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: We need all the resources we can get, - Fri Sep 25 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Won't it have a combat test too? - Fri Sep 25 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: A written test is possible. Tell no one I said that. - Fri Sep 25 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright . . . I kinda want to take the private exam too. - Fri Sep 25 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I learned some things about the Gezo a long time ago. I don't remember how much of it is supposed to be a secret. - Fri Sep 25 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Either way...that's too bad. If I get cheat notes I'm not sharing. It's the Gezo we're talking about. - Fri Sep 25 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Orakuru had cheat notes and he still failed. - Fri Sep 25 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I never said I wanted cheat notes . . . I don't like cheating . . . I like to do things honestly. - Fri Sep 25 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Either way, I'll try to stay calm. - Fri Sep 25 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Fri Sep 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What do we know about Koeki? - Fri Sep 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Personality, abilities. . . - Fri Sep 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have no idea about Koeki. - Fri Sep 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hear she's nice. - Fri Sep 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Actually. - Fri Sep 25 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I was just told she's a medic. - Fri Sep 25 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nothing else. - Fri Sep 25 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Apparently. . . - Fri Sep 25 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When Sunagakure was taken over, most of their people went to Kirigakure. - Fri Sep 25 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Probably explains why their army's so big. - Fri Sep 25 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Their elite people went elsewhere. - Fri Sep 25 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm only asking because of Kirigakure supposedly looking at us. - Fri Sep 25 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When they have people like Kenshin, they're not people you should play with. - Fri Sep 25 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Just gotta prove to them that we mean no harm then. - Fri Sep 25 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: They won't ever trust us. - Fri Sep 25 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm mostly only interested in her personality, though. - Fri Sep 25 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So far I gather that she's as inexperienced as I am. - Fri Sep 25 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not sure. - Fri Sep 25 17:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Actually . . . This is going to be worth a try. - Fri Sep 25 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: --  You know . . . - Fri Sep 25 17:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: If you give me a hug now . . . I will keep my calm better. - Fri Sep 25 17:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) frowns a bit. Her head tilts, and she makes eye contact.* - Fri Sep 25 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Did it work? - Fri Sep 25 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right arm reaches up. A palm is gently placed on Kilm's smooth face.* - Fri Sep 25 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: No, It did not - Fri Sep 25 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Oh god no. - Fri Sep 25 17:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Abruptly, Kat's palm releases a very loud, gun-shot-like bang.

Out of it comes a very powerful explosion. It won't melt Kilm's face off due to how durable he is, but it'd undoubtedly send him crashing very hard into the ground. Being explosion release, it packs conscussive force. Therefor, it pushes.

Kat's expression returns to a blank one at this time, rather than the fake ass frown she'd been wearing.* - Fri Sep 25 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross. Eyes wander again.* - Fri Sep 25 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nevermind. So what now? We go back to the mansion? - Fri Sep 25 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm.... - Fri Sep 25 17:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I should probably train. - Fri Sep 25 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just working up the drive. . . - Fri Sep 25 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've already trained a lot today. - Fri Sep 25 17:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Training jutsus is the most boring thing in the world. . . - Fri Sep 25 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might start taking missions myself, soon. - Fri Sep 25 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For the practice. - Fri Sep 25 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I should learn how to make clones like Zetsumo always did. - Fri Sep 25 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So they can do my paperwork while I do other things. - Fri Sep 25 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm the kage but I'm not strong enough to be a kage. - Fri Sep 25 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I need the experience. - Fri Sep 25 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I probably will never think like a kage. - Fri Sep 25 18:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If.... - Fri Sep 25 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not for Zetsumo.... - Fri Sep 25 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Never mind. - Fri Sep 25 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What? - Fri Sep 25 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I should go back to training. - Fri Sep 25 18:02:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and walks away.* - Fri Sep 25 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: And now....boredom. - Fri Sep 25 18:13:58 2015
