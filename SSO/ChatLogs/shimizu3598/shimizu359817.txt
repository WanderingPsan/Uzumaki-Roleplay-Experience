<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls a mission scroll out of her robes with a shrug. The girl had been hesitant to give this one to a friend, but she turns around and hands it over. A blank expression is on her face and she stares down at it in the mean time.

"Not gonna say what rank this is." she says, since they're in public around un-affiliated shinobi. "You can read it and find out for yourself. I strongly suggest you bring other people with you and be careful, but it's your choice."* - Sat Sep 26 19:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It sounds like a dangerous mission, so a third person would be a wise decision. - Sat Sep 26 19:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) resumes walking.* - Sat Sep 26 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) carries herself out to the residential area of Konoha. Once there she lazily leaps up to the top of the nearest fence and turns to face the west. One leg is placed in front of the other, and the teen stares ahead blankly. She's decided that today, she'll train here. It's in public, but why not? 

It's not like shunshin is a "hiden" jutsu. Both arms rise and hands meet to form the tiger seal. So far, no effort at all is required to balance on top of the fence. She 'is' a ninja after all. That, and she has Suimen.

Abruptly, the girl shoves chakra into her body's nerves all over. Once compelled to sprint forwards, Kat does so. Feet ram hard into the wood as she goes. Naturally, this would be very easy without the shunshin technique. That, however...is because she'd be running slower than usual.

What Kat finds is that she's unable to sprint for more than twenty feet. Abruptly she comes to a halt, tripping over her own foot at a lightning-fast pace. Just barely, the girl manages to catch herself on two fingers of her right hand. A bead of sweat falls down the side of her face due to her surprise. "Hmph." she quietly scoffs.

Eyes close for a moment. The teen's hair hangs down towards the ground below, and she takes some time to compose herself. She's easily getting used to this jutsu at this point. Katsune was born with a ridiculously strong constitution. It takes nearly thirty full seconds for the technique's dizzyness to go away completely, so Kat waits exactly that long.

Eventually, with a shrug, she roughly pushes herself back up into a standing position. She draws in a silent deep breath and forms her handseals once more. With that, she resumes training. The girl carries on for several very long hours. By the time she's done, she's stopped tripping.* - Sat Sep 26 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her butt in the dirt of Konoha's training grounds. Once there, she begins picking up sand in her hands. A silent sigh leaves her nose. Zenaki tried teaching her this jutsu ages ago, but she eventually got bored and gave up trying. Thinking about how Kilm and the others are in danger though reminds her that she could 'use' a medical jutsu.

It could come in handy. The girl toys with the sand, letting it slowly fall from one hand to another. All the while, she's pouring and kneading chakra into it. It takes enormous amounts of time, but eventually, this sand begins taking on a slimey consistency. It's at this time, that Kat begins carefully placing it on her right leg.

With that done, she places both palms on it. They cover the entire surface. Steadily, she pours even more chakra into it. The goal is to make it rock hard, like a cast. Slowly, it begins working.* - Sat Sep 26 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Ya know. I knew that was irresponsible. - Sat Sep 26 21:22:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- There was a bounty for people with red or white eyes a while ago. - Sat Sep 26 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Red and white eyes? - Sat Sep 26 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. However...Noriko is.... - Sat Sep 26 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dead, I think? I hope. - Sat Sep 26 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She was a monster you know. - Sat Sep 26 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Should I tell them that I can see something that seems like Chakra flow through everyone? - Sat Sep 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was mostly because of the families who had those eyes. Takes a disgusting person to blame peoples' family members for an enemy's sins. - Sat Sep 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Or would that be a bad idea? - Sat Sep 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not saying it's immoral. Saying it's petty. - Sat Sep 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, my eyes aren't red or white. - Sat Sep 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So I have nothing to worry about. - Sat Sep 26 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Though I do think I'm seeing weird things. - Sat Sep 26 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Kang, a pleasure to meet you. . is something wrong? - Sat Sep 26 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh that's just how she talks. - Sat Sep 26 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Sat Sep 26 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: That's cool, in a way that's different than anyone else I've ever heard speak. - Sat Sep 26 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: o-oh... - Sat Sep 26 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well anyway. - Sat Sep 26 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-um....i-il...umm b-be on my way t-then... - Sat Sep 26 23:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, is there anything I can do Katsune? - Sat Sep 26 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: As you can see I'm in fine condition. - Sat Sep 26 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ozu, Nagarushi(Trendingg_NYC) says: . .. - Sat Sep 26 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing at the moment. Besides, you should rest. - Sat Sep 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You've got a point, traveling between two villages after a mission is tiring. - Sat Sep 26 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the masked individual, fairly blankly. Her head tilts a bit.* - Sat Sep 26 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Uhm Katsune, who's this? - Sat Sep 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She can give you her name if she wants to. I'm sure she's wearing a mask for a reason. - Sat Sep 26 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way, she's welcome here. - Sat Sep 26 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Alright then, so it's a she. - Sat Sep 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Unknown**(Iron Zorro) says: Indeed I am a she. - Sat Sep 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Unknown**(Iron Zorro) says: Anyway. - Sat Sep 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Unknown**(Iron Zorro) says: Katsune are you free? - Sat Sep 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sat Sep 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Unknown**(Iron Zorro) says: Excellent~ - Sat Sep 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So, are you two going to another room orrr? - Sat Sep 26 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Unknown**(Iron Zorro) says: Would you like to speak here or somewhere else Katsune? - Sat Sep 26 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Unknown**(Iron Zorro) says: Up to her really. - Sat Sep 26 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply stares at Hanabi for a long while. The girl studies her, and notes some things.

Eventually though she rises to her feet and gently slides her chair under her desk. "We can talk outside somewhere." she says.

"Somewhere nice."

She turns and begins walking towards the door.* - Sat Sep 26 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Unknown**(Iron Zorro) says: You know I missed that sight~ - Sat Sep 26 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually comes to a stop. Her arms cross, and she eyes Hanabi's mask. The girl's weight shifts just a bit.

"Why the mask?" she inquires.* - Sat Sep 26 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply stares, maintaining eye contact. Her expression's pretty blank.

"Must have to do with Ushinawa's group then." she says.* - Sat Sep 26 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Almost looked like you might be here to assassinate me. - Sat Sep 26 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It has nothing to do with Ushinawa really. - Sat Sep 26 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And nope. - Sat Sep 26 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I came here because you said you would tell me about Kirigakure. - Sat Sep 26 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the south.

"Actually that's exactly why I've had to be careful. Supposedly Kirigakure's "deemed us a potential threat," as if even that combination of words is supposed to mean anything. I was going to ask 'you' about Kirigakure. That's what my letter said, right?"* - Sat Sep 26 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some people probably don't realize that killing me would be pointless, since I'm not exactly the muscle behind Konoha. - Sun Sep 27 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I've been wondering when some idiot will come try to kill me for no reason. - Sun Sep 27 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I might have missread it or something but thre isnt much I know about it. - Sun Sep 27 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: The only thing I know is that they attacked a Kumogakure shinobi and Hideki. - Sun Sep 27 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Sep 27 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For what reasons? - Sun Sep 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was actually only gonna ask if you knew why Kirigakure was looking at us. Because.... - Sun Sep 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You were trying to convince me to leave the village, or give up if anyone attacked. - Sun Sep 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just looked like you might know about it. - Sun Sep 27 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I trust you, though. - Sun Sep 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not know really. - Sun Sep 27 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: A male wearing a mask showed up and attacked Mamoru. - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Then Hideki went to Kirigakure and got jumped. - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And I was just saying it as a precautionary measure. - Sun Sep 27 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That 'is' interesting, because.... - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Konoha is allied with Kumogakure if you hadn't realized. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not really pay attention to those things. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But that is good to know. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way. It was only hearsay. The nonsense about Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not putting much stock into it. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not anymore. - Sun Sep 27 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Is there anything you can tell me? - Sun Sep 27 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has said everything since the very start of this conversation at the mansion, with little enthusiasm.* - Sun Sep 27 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You did say that you knew things about Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did I? Show me the letter. I don't remember that. - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I sent them back to you. - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I wrote my reply on them. - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You should have them. - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You sent one of them back....or.... - Sun Sep 27 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I sent two. - Sun Sep 27 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you sent the one that matters, it must've got lost somewhere. - Sun Sep 27 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Shame. - Sun Sep 27 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes hanabi the two letters she recieved.* - Sun Sep 27 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But can you tell me? - Sun Sep 27 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: . . .Did I pass her the wrong one...? - Sun Sep 27 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes a third.* - Sun Sep 27 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: These are the messages I sent - Sun Sep 27 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. - Sun Sep 27 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gimme the one about Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I sent all of these. - Sun Sep 27 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I didn't see that one when I was looking through them. - Sun Sep 27 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Pretty sure it doesn't say I know things about Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It appears Hideki has written over the message - Sun Sep 27 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd never say that because I really don't know anything about it. - Sun Sep 27 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm I was really looking foward to know more about Kirigakure - Sun Sep 27 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have no interest in conspiring against Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Revealing information to a firend does not mean conspiring against them. - Sun Sep 27 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Just thought that might be your real intention. - Sun Sep 27 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Not at all. - Sun Sep 27 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To find out whether or not Konoha's attacking them. - Sun Sep 27 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: No. - Sun Sep 27 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not think we would ask for help. - Sun Sep 27 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But...I guess, if you want to know about them. I only know some things. - Sun Sep 27 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Most of Sunagakure apparently went there when their village was taken by Edge. - Sun Sep 27 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What ever you can tell me would  be nice. - Sun Sep 27 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know things about Edge too but. . . - Sun Sep 27 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Who is edge? - Sun Sep 27 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I've heard about him. - Sun Sep 27 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Sun Sep 27 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But don't know who he is. - Sun Sep 27 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's funny, you're the first person I'll be saying this to. - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Oh~ - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'm special then~ - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Edge used to work for Zetsumo. - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Did he? - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Apparently. I don't know the details. - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) whispers: DO you know what he can do? - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 27 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No idea. - Sun Sep 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As for Kirigakure....? - Sun Sep 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not really know much about them like I have said. - Sun Sep 27 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, that's all I know that's worth noting. Most of Sunagakure went there when Edge stole their village. - Sun Sep 27 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: See? I really do know nothing about them. - Sun Sep 27 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They keep their village locked up twenty-four seven like it's some kind of treasure. - Sun Sep 27 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's ridiculous. - Sun Sep 27 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Only explanation that makes sense is. . . - Sun Sep 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They're hiding something that'd be a scandal. - Sun Sep 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Kirigakure? - Sun Sep 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Slave trade or something. - Sun Sep 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm. - Sun Sep 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm - Sun Sep 27 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well without Zetsumo around Kirigakure can go unchecked. - Sun Sep 27 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I got my seals removed. - Sun Sep 27 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I haven't forgot who put them there. . . - Sun Sep 27 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Who did? - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Noriko. - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Noriko? - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) emphasizes the name a bit.* - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well. - Sun Sep 27 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What are your plans for now? - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Haven't decided. Truth is. . . - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know, how I got here's a pretty funny story. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't tell you the whole thing unfortunately. - Sun Sep 27 00:20:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I figured he'd lose, at first. He was so confident though I started to believe him. - Sun Sep 27 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He had so many Kenryoku available.... - Sun Sep 27 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And he chose to charge in like that. - Sun Sep 27 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: At some point he must have lost his mind. - Sun Sep 27 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It was truly a spectacle. - Sun Sep 27 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I think you'd like Kenshin if you met him. - Sun Sep 27 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Sep 27 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. . . - Sun Sep 27 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As strong as he is I wonder why he didn't help sooner. - Sun Sep 27 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ---I wonder the same thing some times. - Sun Sep 27 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe he doubted himself? - Sun Sep 27 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo's an idiot for not targetting Kenshin first. - Sun Sep 27 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I don't think he could've. - Sun Sep 27 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I couldn't even follow Kenshin Walking with my eyes. - Sun Sep 27 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit and rubs at her lips, assuming that -must- be a joke.* - Sun Sep 27 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I shouldn't have said that in the first place, though. - Sun Sep 27 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lazily glances over at him.

"Why do you ask?"* - Sun Sep 27 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Just out of boredom. - Sun Sep 27 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Feel free not to answer. - Sun Sep 27 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Sun Sep 27 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I asked you that because. . . - Sun Sep 27 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're not the only person that's asked me that recently. - Sun Sep 27 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh really? - Sun Sep 27 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm. - Sun Sep 27 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you don't mind me asking. - Sun Sep 27 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Could you tell me something about yourself? - Sun Sep 27 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That I don't know. - Sun Sep 27 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Sun Sep 27 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing comes to mind. - Sun Sep 27 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I won't be telling you how I fight of course. - Sun Sep 27 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been pretty open with you, so you know pretty much everything that matters. - Sun Sep 27 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you've been paying attention anyway. - Sun Sep 27 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Fair enough. - Sun Sep 27 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Plus Hanabi told me your sizes~ - Sun Sep 27 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Sep 27 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Twas a joke. - Sun Sep 27 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. Eyes wander and she scratches at her cheek.

She really can't be sure whether that was a joke or not.* - Sun Sep 27 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up her own cup. It'd be rude if she didn't to say the least. She holds onto it for a long while...just to make sure it's not obvious she likes sake an awful lot.

Eyes are locked onto the liquid while she considers his question. Said eyes wander off as she says "Not always. But I've wanted it since I was old enough to start training." She tilts her head back and pours the liquid into her mouth and throat in one go as well, as you're pretty much supposed to do with sake.

She gently puts the cup down afterwords.* - Sun Sep 27 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) directs her eyes at Seisuke's own. They stay there, and she shakes her head in response to his offer.

"I don't know much about my original parents." she says.* - Sun Sep 27 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A prince. - Sun Sep 27 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been wondering about that. - Sun Sep 27 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who exactly 'are' your parents? - Sun Sep 27 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Bwasha! They're the King and Queen of courshe! - Sun Sep 27 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Sun Sep 27 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's unfortunate my memory was terrible when I was younger. - Sun Sep 27 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Attention span, too. - Sun Sep 27 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Otherwise I'd know an awful lot of things right now. - Sun Sep 27 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I shupose you're right. - Sun Sep 27 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: .... - Sun Sep 27 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sheeems like I haf' to go. - Sun Sep 27 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances down at the scroll. What color is it?* - Sun Sep 27 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. See ya. - Sun Sep 27 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel three seconds or so after Seisuke leaves. At a lazy pace, she exits through the back door -- opposite of where Seisuke had left. Eyes wander as she opens it. Once there, she dives through the ground by way of a jutsu and darts away at a superhuman pace.* - Sun Sep 27 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: This is fucking ridiculous. - Sun Sep 27 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: He's invincible. - Sun Sep 27 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I'll just teleport him away. - Sun Sep 27 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) thinks: This is fucking ridiculous.  - Sun Sep 27 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) thinks: He's too resourceful.  - Sun Sep 27 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: KUCHIYOSE NO JUTSU. - Sun Sep 27 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: IRON MAIDEN. - Sun Sep 27 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: Get the FUCK outta here. - Sun Sep 27 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) thinks: I don't fight with Tetsujins or Zetsumos. - Sun Sep 27 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits. Her expression is blank, and eyes are averted. Arms cross and one leg crosses over the other.* - Sun Sep 27 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: 'Why' didn't he just give his report through the letter? - Sun Sep 27 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hey Katsune. - Sun Sep 27 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good morning. - Sun Sep 27 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright . . . The report. - Sun Sep 27 13:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head with a glance at Asteroth. "Don't need anything." she says.

"Thank you."* - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Shall I tell it here? - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should've told me in the letter. - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It would've taken too much time to write everything with these hurt arms. - Sun Sep 27 13:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If it happened at the gates it's probably public knowledge. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah . . . It is. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not on your way to getting that vest back Kilm. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Flexus had invited a group of sunagakure shinobi to stay over for a night in Konohagakure. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fujitora's family was in the group . . . Zenaki . . . Some of those mercenaries . . . Sabo as well. - Sun Sep 27 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Sep 27 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But ehh . . . Erebus came and didn't like that he invited them without getting permission. - Sun Sep 27 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So he didn't let them inside and ordered Baen to kill Flexus. - Sun Sep 27 13:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Is Flexus alive? - Sun Sep 27 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No. - Sun Sep 27 13:55:24 2015
