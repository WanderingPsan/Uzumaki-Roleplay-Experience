<br><br><font color=teal>*Pandora(Them Yams Salty Fam) says: No. I refer to myself "of the Sand" as it pays homage to my primary specialty. I can manipulate the sand that I'm standing on right now, as well as the sand in my gourd. - Mon Sep 21 16:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants herself against the wall to the west, with arms behind her back. She holds one arm with the opposite hand. Eyes are kept to herself. A faint, cheeky smile is on her face.* - Mon Sep 21 16:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Just me or did you get your smile back? - Mon Sep 21 16:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It won't be around for long if you keep saying cheesey stuff like that. - Mon Sep 21 16:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I was just wonderin' , Okay then. - Mon Sep 21 16:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway.  - Mon Sep 21 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and wanders up to the hokage. Briefly she looks the man up and down, in a friendly manner, as she comes to a stop.

"Didn't expect to see you here." she says.* - Mon Sep 21 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I'm lying. I literally called it. - Mon Sep 21 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: We should've made a bet on this. - Mon Sep 21 16:55:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: This is merely a set up before the true leader is elected. - Mon Sep 21 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: True leader? - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Who will elect the new leader? - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 21 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I actually came to get citizen ship and a headband, though. Would you let me join, despite who I used to work for? - Mon Sep 21 16:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I pass judgment on no one, for it is judgment that I want to stop. - Mon Sep 21 16:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You are free to return to your native home. - Mon Sep 21 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "And I get to be a genin?" she inquires.

She doesn't say it, but she actually...secretly, has a headband already.* - Mon Sep 21 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: As opposed to citizen, of course. - Mon Sep 21 16:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You already know my beliefs on that. - Mon Sep 21 17:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you're actually going to do it? - Mon Sep 21 17:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, nothing really changes for me in the end. - Mon Sep 21 17:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: There goes all the ranks . . . Guess we all will be equals. - Mon Sep 21 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Suppose so. - Mon Sep 21 17:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: So life will go back to how it's always been, not bad. - Mon Sep 21 17:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Sounds good." she says. Definitely better than foolish people possibly becoming chuunin and jounin, no doubt. "Gonna go check on my old house then."

The girl then turns and walks away.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) motions towards the east with her head.* - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh, so he's your lover? - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He was. - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Was? - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I killed him. - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In war. - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Had to. He came at me with a sword. - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . .Well, I'm sorry that war pushed you to do so. - Mon Sep 21 17:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But you moved to Amegakure for a few years. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So your house, might possibly not be your house anymore. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You're most likely homeless at this point. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's why I'm just gonna buy it, of course. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How much do you think Zetsumo paid me? - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can tell you, it was a lot. - Mon Sep 21 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Well, that works. - Mon Sep 21 17:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, it's kind of funny. First I was staying in your village, now you're staying in mine. - Mon Sep 21 17:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, I was here for five years before war forced us to leave. - Mon Sep 21 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been in Konoha since before I could dress myself. - Mon Sep 21 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, Konoha territory. - Mon Sep 21 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I didn't know that, but now I do. - Mon Sep 21 17:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So what do you intend to do now that you're back in Konohagakure? - Mon Sep 21 17:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Are you going to live your life as a shinobi here? - Mon Sep 21 17:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rummages through the pack tied to the back of her right hip and retrives a headband. The girl kneels down while speaking to Taiga and ties it to her leg where he can see it.

A nod follows. "Yep." she says.* - Mon Sep 21 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, it's a bit strange. - Mon Sep 21 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I'm not used to talking so much with other people. - Mon Sep 21 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That explains a lot. - Mon Sep 21 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . That hurts Katsune. - Mon Sep 21 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That really hurts. - Mon Sep 21 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Anyway, is it a big house? - Mon Sep 21 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Really big. - Mon Sep 21 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno if I'll stay there for long, but for the rest of the month I might. - Mon Sep 21 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Plus I need to collect the things I left there. - Mon Sep 21 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: That's going to feel lonely. - Mon Sep 21 17:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Things you left? You didn't take everything with you to Amegakure? - Mon Sep 21 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. We were taken by surprise, surrounded by three thousand. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We had to flee. Zetsumo flew away. I swam underground. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Sheesh, what did you leave behind? Basic household things? - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some of it was important. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sentimental value. - Mon Sep 21 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Things that remind you of Orakura? - Mon Sep 21 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, I don't get that. Why would you want to have things that remind you of the lover whom you had to kill? - Mon Sep 21 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because he taught me things. I'd be a very different person if not for him. - Mon Sep 21 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I 'was' a different person. - Mon Sep 21 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Really? What were you like before? - Mon Sep 21 17:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Mon Sep 21 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Less world-weary. - Mon Sep 21 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I would've paid to see a Katsune like that. - Mon Sep 21 17:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Can't ever be like that again. - Mon Sep 21 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Damn. - Mon Sep 21 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being like that leads to people dying. - Mon Sep 21 17:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If I may, can I come with you to your house? I have nothing better to do anyway, and I'm curious as to what you left behind. - Mon Sep 21 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Katsune is a real depressing person. . . - Mon Sep 21 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. You can come. - Mon Sep 21 17:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her expression's actually a good-humored one. Naturally she's in a good mood, all things considered. She's back in Konoha. She doesn't need to be a rogue anymore.

With that, she turns on her heel and leads the way to her house.* - Mon Sep 21 17:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: It really is big. - Mon Sep 21 17:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down at the kitchen table. Arms cross, and one leg crosses over the other. Eyes are on Taiga when she says "Want anything?"* - Mon Sep 21 17:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We had sake here. That doesn't go bad. It'd be warm, though. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, well. I don't think a house that's been empty for five years has any food Katsune. But even so, I'm good. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not five years. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A few months at most. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We lost the battle against Amegakure a few months ago. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's when we had to leave. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure* - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You can drink your sake, I'm only sixteen. So I shouldn't. - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How old do you think I am? - Mon Sep 21 17:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You seem to be around my age, seventeen maybe? Or eighteen? - Mon Sep 21 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks fourteen. Sixteen at best.

She hasn't matured well.* - Mon Sep 21 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || I mean, aside from her chest obviously.* - Mon Sep 21 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've done lots of stuff that weren't good things. - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I've earned the right to be an alchoholic. - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: True. - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But I wouldn't go to alcohol. - Mon Sep 21 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Find a hobby, like reading a book. - Mon Sep 21 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Wait I've said that at the restaurant already. - Mon Sep 21 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "Alchoholic" was a joke. - Mon Sep 21 17:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way, I can hold my sake. - Mon Sep 21 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see, but this certainly is a nice home. - Mon Sep 21 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Bigger than mine. - Mon Sep 21 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Mon Sep 21 17:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'll be nice to sleep in my old bed. - Mon Sep 21 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . Why're there four beds anyway? - Mon Sep 21 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: There were only two of them after all. - Mon Sep 21 17:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || There are actually walls and doors in the way of those beds. Four bedrooms.

Of course, Taiga could have inferred that there are four bedrooms.* - Mon Sep 21 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because. . . - Mon Sep 21 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Orokuru was rich. - Mon Sep 21 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He bought me my gauntlets. Chakra flow. Very expensive. I've been saving up for years and still...I'd not have been able to afford them to this day. - Mon Sep 21 17:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So you had a rich lover and Zetsumo paid big bucks, sheesh you've sure got it made. - Mon Sep 21 17:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Mon Sep 21 17:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So, what is it that you left behind here aside from sake? - Mon Sep 21 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head to eye the bedrooms. She stares for a long moment. Eventually though, with a shrug, she glances over at Taiga and rises to her feet. The girl leads the way to her bedroom.

Once there she stands in the doorway and slowly opens the door. All over her bed, floor, and shelves are enormous amounts of stuffed animals. Absurd amounts.* - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He bought me those, a long time ago. - Mon Sep 21 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, eyeing the dolls. A weak smile is on her face.

"I'd kick you," she says, "but I'm in a good mood today."* - Mon Sep 21 17:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches forwards to pull the door shut. Inviting Taiga to her bedroom would look bad.

She then wanders back over to the kitchen table, sitting down once more.* - Mon Sep 21 17:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, watching Taiga's weapons.

"I guess so." she says.* - Mon Sep 21 17:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Do those memories make you happy? - Mon Sep 21 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: If his hands move too fast, I'll look away. - Mon Sep 21 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: No one's catching me in genjutsu again. - Mon Sep 21 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Careful, you do not want to be Taiga, the guy with nine fingers. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: 'Course, I'm only thinking about the good ones. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then coming back to Konohagakure was a good thing. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Right? - Mon Sep 21 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course it was. - Mon Sep 21 18:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was planning out my rogue life already when I heard the rumors. - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: About a new kage. - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: There's one thing I've been meaning to ask. - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm...? - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You said all of you are comrades from war who've spend years together. .  - Mon Sep 21 18:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But why're there only two of you here? - Mon Sep 21 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Where did the others go? - Mon Sep 21 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Sep 21 18:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: About that. - Mon Sep 21 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: That sounds bad. - Mon Sep 21 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Before I heard about Konoha being back in business. . . - Mon Sep 21 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...I dunno if I should talk about this. - Mon Sep 21 18:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off.* - Mon Sep 21 18:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: If you don't want to then you don't have to. - Mon Sep 21 18:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If the wrong people hear about it, people will die. - Mon Sep 21 18:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You really don't trust me huh~? - Mon Sep 21 18:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.* - Mon Sep 21 18:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise and her hands meet. The teen forms the tiger seal. Chakra is channeled into the ground as quickly as she can possibly manage, for the sake of training. Abruptly, and oh-so-quickly, dirt for twenty feet shifts to mud. The path is quite, quite wide. 

As it does this it races forwards with tremendous amounts of force. Soon, it's crashing into the tree in front of her. Leaves from above begin floating down to the ground as a result, its limbs having shaken just a bit. No titan's amount of power, that's for sure. Kat draws in a sharp, quick, deep breath.

Her tenketsu basically burn within her body, letting her know not to dare and try to produce another jutsu just yet. Just as they're nearly cooled off, the girl then forms three more handseals as rapidly as she can. Ram, horse, and dragon. With those seals complete, Kat shoves her chakra into the mud she just created. At a rapid pace, a mass of mud in the shape of a dragon's massive head springs out of it.

Its eyes leer ahead in a smug manner, and its maw is wide open with muddy fangs dripping down. The beast's throat glows a bright white as soon as it appears. As soon as it appears, enormous amounts of mudballs race forwards like bullets from a machine gun. There are over twenty of them within just a second or so. All of them hit the tree with force, shaking it to and fro.

It creaks, though not in any manner that suggest it's about to break or fall over. This is a very thick, old, and powerful tree. More leaves fall down. More mudballs are produced. They seem to never want to stop flowing.

Eventually one-hundred-fifty or so have been fired in all. Kat hasn't broken a sweat. It's a good thing Zetsumo was such a good teacher. For anyone else this might cost an enormous amount of chakra. Immediately, almost as soon as the jutsu fades, Kat begins rapidly forming handseals again.

She'd waited about two or three whole seconds before doing this, once more giving her tenketsu time to rest. Even so, they're still quite warm and stressed when she starts up again. As a result, her mud dragon's head seems to tremble a bit as it rises up, as if weaker than it's supposed to be. The real point of this training and the main reason she's out here, is so that she can learn to fire jutsus back-to-back as quickly as Zetsumo was always fond of doing.

Mudballs once more race forth. A barrage. With each ball that leaves, loud bangs are produced. Much, much louder bangs still are produced with every single impact made. However, these balls seem weaker than the last barrage. It's because they are. Kat still has a lot of training to do if she wants to spam jutsus like this effectively.* - Mon Sep 21 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow at the sight of this man. Briefly she's lost in thought, and her eyes suggest as much. After this small amount of time, the girl realizes she's seen the man before. Briefly, she looks him up and down.

The teen's arms at this time are crossed, and her back is pressed to the fence.

She says nothing.* - Mon Sep 21 22:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Enemy...? - Mon Sep 21 22:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm Prince Seisuke, I was wondering if any formal government has been re-established? - Mon Sep 21 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why are you asking? - Mon Sep 21 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Prince...? - Mon Sep 21 22:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'd like to discuss...A business proposition is all. - Mon Sep 21 22:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With the hokage? - Mon Sep 21 22:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If that is the title of the leader, I suppose so. - Mon Sep 21 22:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll show you to the kage. - Mon Sep 21 22:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself off of the fence and motions towards the north with her head.

"This way." she says.

With that, the girl turns and begins walking off in that direction.* - Mon Sep 21 22:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: It almost feels like I'm luring him into a trap. Is he nuts? - Mon Sep 21 22:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Mon Sep 21 22:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not here, I gues...? - Mon Sep 21 22:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That''s a shame. - Mon Sep 21 22:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I suppose I could wait. - Mon Sep 21 22:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can. - Mon Sep 21 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: .Thank you. - Mon Sep 21 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I don't believe I've gotten your name? - Mon Sep 21 22:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Katsune. - Mon Sep 21 22:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's a pleasure. - Mon Sep 21 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Guess so. - Mon Sep 21 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her back to the wall.* - Mon Sep 21 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Not much of a talker? - Mon Sep 21 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . .It 'is' a bit awkward seeing you again. - Mon Sep 21 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We've met? - Mon Sep 21 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sort of. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Well...I'm sorry for not introducing myself sooner then. - Mon Sep 21 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I hope you can excuse my lack of manners. - Mon Sep 21 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: It's a good thing he doesn't recognize me though. Some people have annoyingly, unrealistically good memories about irrelevent people. - Mon Sep 21 22:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So. - Mon Sep 21 22:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are you...with Kirigakure? - Mon Sep 21 22:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I mean. That's the closest village, and all. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Nope. - Mon Sep 21 22:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Sep 21 22:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Here on Gezo business, then. - Mon Sep 21 22:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm.... - Mon Sep 21 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I suppose you 'could' say that. - Mon Sep 21 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: More for pleasure than business. - Mon Sep 21 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Sep 21 22:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: May I ask you a bit of an odd qestion? - Mon Sep 21 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 21 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you wished to secure an Alliance with an unknown Party...Let's say that's me. - Mon Sep 21 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're the leader of this Village for the sake of this scenario. - Mon Sep 21 22:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Mon Sep 21 22:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I will give you whatever Aid you need, in exchange for a lock of your hair, If I take your hair, it'll allow me to kill you from wherever I stand on this planet. - Mon Sep 21 22:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you deny this the treaty is out the door. - Mon Sep 21 22:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I ask you for an answer, So tell me what is your answer? - Mon Sep 21 22:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Yes or No, will you give me your hair? - Mon Sep 21 22:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Do you value your own life over your Villagers? - Mon Sep 21 22:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Or do you Value your Villagers over your own? - Mon Sep 21 22:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not a very good metaphor. Say no to the hair and not only do the villagers die, but you do too. - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Eventually. - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I mean -- you're with the Gezo after all. - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Unless you're not talking about the Gezo. - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I mean staying within the perameters of the information given to you in this scenario. - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In that case, I'd blow you up where you stand for daring to ask that. - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Parameters* - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So you'd deny it? - Mon Sep 21 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Absolutely. - Mon Sep 21 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Does that mean I value my own life over the villagers'? I dunno. Don't care. - Mon Sep 21 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd still blow you up. - Mon Sep 21 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But -- I'm not the leader either. - Mon Sep 21 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Tell me... - Mon Sep 21 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Do you fear me? - Mon Sep 21 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nope. - Mon Sep 21 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: At least your honest. - Mon Sep 21 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm not sccary at all. - Mon Sep 21 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not saying I'd actually attack him...but he doesn't need to hear that either. - Mon Sep 21 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I never could understand, fearing what you don't know, It just seems...Irrational doesn't it? - Mon Sep 21 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth is. - Mon Sep 21 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If we were in a backwoods village in the middle of nowhere. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd probably not let you come closer than twelve feet. - Mon Sep 21 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're not, though. - Mon Sep 21 22:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sounds fun, I do enjoy your honesty. - Mon Sep 21 22:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Do you drink Tea by any chance? - Mon Sep 21 22:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Standing around is a bit boring, and I'm getting thirsty. - Mon Sep 21 22:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could go for some tea, I guess. - Mon Sep 21 22:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself off of the wall and turns to follow, eyeing the man blankly.* - Mon Sep 21 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to lead the way.* - Mon Sep 21 22:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I do drink a lot of sake. People are starting to get the wrong impression about that though. - Mon Sep 21 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Why would they? - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits with her arms crossed, and one leg crossed over the other. Both eyes remain on Seisuke, due to the fact that he's a bit of a mystery.* - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. It's dumb. - Mon Sep 21 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, averting her eyes at this time due to the intensity of his gaze. When the waitress does show up -- which is likely at around this time -- she orders sake.* - Mon Sep 21 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I miss when they feared us. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || She'd averted her eyes casually, mind you.* - Mon Sep 21 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 22:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: 'Right' ankle. . . - Mon Sep 21 22:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see, How long have you beena  Shinobi? - Mon Sep 21 22:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Five years. - Mon Sep 21 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Five 'long' years. - Mon Sep 21 22:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Do you regret it? - Mon Sep 21 22:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Regret what exactly? - Mon Sep 21 22:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Killing? - Mon Sep 21 22:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because I definitely don't regret that. - Mon Sep 21 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had made eye contact as she says this, as if to judge his reaction.* - Mon Sep 21 22:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I regret any choice I've ever made, it was walking through those gates five years ago to find food. - Mon Sep 21 22:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't regret anything I chose to do afterwords. - Mon Sep 21 22:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression is blank. Stoic. She seems completely unphased.* - Mon Sep 21 22:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People died and it wasn't my fault. Simple as that. - Mon Sep 21 22:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I wonder. - Mon Sep 21 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Will you say that with the same resolve, in the comming days? - Mon Sep 21 22:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ha..! - Tue Sep 22 08:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Hmph. - Tue Sep 22 08:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Friend of yours? - Tue Sep 22 08:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is grinning, in a slightly snide manner. Arms cross, and her weight shifts a bit.

"Na." she says, with eyes locked onto the corpse.
"Not really."* - Tue Sep 22 08:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: We have much to discuss. - Tue Sep 22 08:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's smile fades for the most part, and she looks up at the chair. A glance is then directed at Erebus. Hesitation is apparent for a very long while.

Eventually though, with a shrug, she makes her way over at a lazy pace -- or rather, she doesn't seem to be in a hurry at any rate.

Upon reaching the chair from the east, she reaches out to grasp it from the backrest. Slowly, with eyes locked onto the hokage, she slides the chair over in her directly.

The girl sets herself down seven feet away from Erebus. Arms cross, and her right leg crosses over the left. Her head tilts a bit.* - Tue Sep 22 08:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 08:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) carefully glances over at the papers as well, but only because of instinct bidding her to know where his eyes are. "Hard to say." she says.

"Not sure I'm actually answering your question, but the only thing this village is to me right now is a canvas. I want to turn it into a place where people aren't trembling every time they open their doors, fearing they might see a crazed tentacle-monster-tyrant, or an Amegakure shinobi waiting to drag them away for someone's experiments."* - Tue Sep 22 09:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's facial expression remains the same, and such.

"Yeah." she says.
"That's fine. As long as Konoha's becoming a better place, I don't much care who's leading it."* - Tue Sep 22 09:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Morning. - Tue Sep 22 09:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Be the hokage, you mean? - Tue Sep 22 09:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Indeed. - Tue Sep 22 09:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. She reaches up to scratch her cheek for a moment.

". . .Not gonna lie." she says.
"It's intimidating. If the village is attacked, the hokage is expected to be the meat shield for the rest of the village."* - Tue Sep 22 09:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do it, Kat. - Tue Sep 22 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Tue Sep 22 09:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Yeah, I'll do it. - Tue Sep 22 09:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Orakuru. . . - Tue Sep 22 09:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Until you realize there are probably better people, at least. - Tue Sep 22 09:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: In which case, until I'm much stronger. . . - Tue Sep 22 09:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm curious as to exactly what resources I'd have access to, though. - Tue Sep 22 09:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..We'll see about that. - Tue Sep 22 09:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Also, everything. - Tue Sep 22 09:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Tue Sep 22 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alliance with Kumogakure is the biggest aspect right now. - Tue Sep 22 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That.. i forged myself. - Tue Sep 22 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- You did? - Tue Sep 22 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct. - Tue Sep 22 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the corpse. Her mouth is slightly agape, only briefly.* - Tue Sep 22 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're sure? - Tue Sep 22 09:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The Raikage was in the presence of her death. - Tue Sep 22 09:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Tue Sep 22 09:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: She placed a bounty on my head, requesting that I be turned in dead. - Tue Sep 22 09:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Eh . . . - Tue Sep 22 09:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I heard about that. Why would she do that anyway? - Tue Sep 22 09:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Tue Sep 22 09:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Tue Sep 22 09:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's left hand reaches up to lightly pinch at her nose. Eyes are averted, and a weak smile is produced. A nervous one. Slowly and carefully, Kat pushes herself a bit further away from him.

"I see. . ." she says, in a slightly nasaly tone.* - Tue Sep 22 09:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're sure? I've had letters from Zenaki. Her explanation of the situation was pretty weird. - Tue Sep 22 10:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We were still trying to figure out whether she was forced or not. - Tue Sep 22 10:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Oh..? - Tue Sep 22 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Someone named Ushinawa was holding Suitengo, Zetsumo's son. That's very uncharacteristic of that man -- especially carrying 'that' boy of all children. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zenaki is his aunt. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She had to follow for that reason. We're not sure what the context to that is. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zenaki's not sure whether she's allowed to leave or not. - Tue Sep 22 10:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A sticky situation to say the least. - Tue Sep 22 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you wish to happen? - Tue Sep 22 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's in our best interest to bring them home for a lot of reasons. We owe that to Zenaki, and as for Suitengo....well, the two of them 'would' be very valuable too. - Tue Sep 22 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But...I want them to want to be here. - Tue Sep 22 10:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see. - Tue Sep 22 10:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Suppose she haven't noticed his unique eyes. - Tue Sep 22 10:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: So be it, I'll do what I can. - Tue Sep 22 10:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wanted to go a personal view of Amegakure. - Tue Sep 22 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Rather than barging in and causing trouble, wanted someone with access to be my escort. - Tue Sep 22 10:41:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: None of you were willingly allied with him? - Tue Sep 22 10:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He claims some people were....but I'm not sure. Most of us were forced or tricked, or baited in through some way or another. - Tue Sep 22 10:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: False promises or intimidating threats? - Tue Sep 22 10:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Both. Depends on the person. He liked to get people as peacefully as he could, because he wanted us loyal. - Tue Sep 22 10:44:28 2015

Knowing Shin, she has literally no idea whether or not that was polite, so she thinks little of it.* - Tue Sep 22 12:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Maybe this will prove useful in my studies - Tue Sep 22 12:14:04 2015
