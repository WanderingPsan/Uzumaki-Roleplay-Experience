<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I will soon. - Sat Oct 31 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll train in other areas until then...if that sounds okay? - Sat Oct 31 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Of course it does. - Sat Oct 31 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sat Oct 31 16:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches over to take the box that Index gave her hours ago.

She picks it up. Gently she then plants it against his belly. Her hand slide down off of it and onto his flesh.

In the mean time, Kat stares at it.* - Sat Oct 31 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually picks her hands back up. Both find the ribbons that bind the box. Slowly she begins untying them.

Eventually she'd pull them away.

The teen stares for several full seconds.

Afterwords she slowly reaches over to the live. Slowly, she'd then pick it up and move it off to the side. It'd be placed against the bed while she studies whatever contents are within the box.* - Sat Oct 31 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances up at Index, studying him for the brief moment. Eyes are on the armor afterwords. Slowly the wander, taking in the details very carefully. Silently she draws in a deep breath, before letting it out.

She can't help but show no emotion. She has grim things on her mind, so instinct bids her to look strong and be strong.

Eventually though she picks the box up and moves it off to the side. Gently she places it against the bed.

Katsune then slowly leans forwards. Palms meet the mattress at either side of Index's head and then slowly slide accross it as she moves forwards.

She draws near and once very close she stares for a full second or two. Afterwords her eyes and mouth both find his lips.

Kat gives him a long and passionate kiss if not stopped.* - Sat Oct 31 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The kiss lasts for maybe thirty full seconds. Often Kat stops for breaths, or turns her head to try a different angle -- mostly for the sake of experimenting and tasting.

A glance or two is sent up to him during the kissing.

Eventually, the girl is done. She finishes it with a simple peck. Arms then reach down, slowly, and she wraps said arms around his torso. Her face finds his chest and she nuzzles it into him there.

The rest of her body wiggles to and fro as she gets comfortable, and her eyes are closed for a moment. Kat takes another breath, as if to relax.

"Thanks. . ." she says.* - Sat Oct 31 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: U-um.... - Sat Oct 31 17:27:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nuzzles her face more, eventually turning her head to face the opposite direction.

Eventually she turns it further. Her hands move to take Index's shirt in-hand, and she uses it to hide her face from him. She burries her face into it.* - Sat Oct 31 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is stupid. - Sat Oct 31 17:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't react to that joke, despite it being hilarious.

She sighs, silently, and nuzzles her face into him a bit more. Slowly she repositions herself, wiggling off to the side.

Carefully Kat slides a leg under him. Eventually both legs would be wrapped tightly around his waist. Her arms are wrapped around her torso, and she burries her face into him from there.* - Sat Oct 31 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I. . . - Sat Oct 31 17:43:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops speaking.

For like, forever. She nuzzles more.

For the most part though, she gets quiet.* - Sat Oct 31 17:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "I wanna kill you." she says, finishing her statement.

Kat's mouth opens. When it closes, she's gently clamping down on Index's flesh through his shirt.

She takes it in her mouth in full.

Eyes close. Gently she pulls it back and forth. Gently she even chews a bit, and suckles.

She finishes almost as soon as she begin though, and she turns and crawls up onto him, slowly.

Kat's eyes are cold and murderous. She silently and sharply...quickly, takes a breath.

The teen's butt is planted on his gut just below his rib cage and she's straddling him. Both palms rest on the center of his chest and she simply stares down at him. Her right fist finds his chest where his heart might be, and her left palm reaches up. Gently it combs through his hair, and it's planted there.

Both her fist and palm are lethal weapons. She could instantly and easily kill him right now.

Kat repeats her statement. "I know why I wanna kill you. I figured it out."* - Sat Oct 31 17:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes don't relax. Even now. She's far from calm.

"I...I've been waiting." Kat says.

"I've been hoping you'd hurt me. Because I want to kill you....badly. For the release."

Silently Kat sighs. Her left palm slowly pulls away from Index's head. It finds the mattress shortly afterwords. Her right fist unclenches and she moves it over to the mattress too. Both hands are at either side of her.

"But I need an excuse first. That's what you are. Prey. I've been playing with my food. It's why I like it a lot when you lie to me. It's why I like it a -lot- when I suspect you're cheating. Because every time. . ."

Kat pauses briefly for a silent breath.

"I'm hoping you'll slip....and give me the excuse."* - Sat Oct 31 18:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes slowly relax. Slowly Kat looks Index up and down. Silently she takes another deep breath.

"Or, well...." she says.

"That explains the killing part."

Slowly Kat slides downwards.

Eventually her butt is firmly planted on Index's crotch.

With a very blank and relaxed, calm expression she looks back up at his face. The teen stares at him, maintaining eye contact.

"Doesn't explain the other things I want."* - Sat Oct 31 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: As an admin - Sat Oct 31 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eye contact is maintained when she says,

"....Secrets."* - Sat Oct 31 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- No. The other things I want 'are' a secret. - Sat Oct 31 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sat Oct 31 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....Not sure I still wanna kill you. - Sat Oct 31 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kinda do. - Sat Oct 31 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you still want to. - Sat Oct 31 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I welcome you to hold onto that desire. - Sat Oct 31 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I won't be slipping up. - Sat Oct 31 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) coos when she says "Yeah. . ."

"You're doin' good so far."* - Sat Oct 31 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: aim* - Sat Oct 31 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes trail down to Index's hands as he begins moving her. Quickly Kat takes in a silent breath through the nose.

Once she notes his position on top of her, with a glance down at their lower regions, Kat's cheeks turn a bit pink.

With a faint frown on her face she stares up at him. Eyes are still guarded.* - Sat Oct 31 18:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off, at least for a moment. More than once she attempts to catch her breath, to compose herself. Even so her blush remains.

Kat's eyes are on Index's again when she shakes her head and says "I like it too. Your bad ideas get me into trouble and that just means I get to kill other people when -they- slip. When they show me their faults. When they finally let me and the rest of the world see what makes them bad. Then, I...."

Kat takes another brief and silent breath. A glance is sent off to the side.

"Get to kill 'em."* - Sat Oct 31 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gulps as her shoulder is kissed, and looks away. Once more she takes a breath, trying to make sure she doesn't let him make her look weak.

A subtle scowl is on her face as a result, though her blush remains.

"Yeah. . ." she says, staring up at him.

"Maybe."* - Sat Oct 31 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. . . . - Sat Oct 31 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I mean...yeah. Okay. - Sat Oct 31 18:50:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches up with her left hand. Silently she's sighing as her palm would cover his eyes.

A glance is sent in his direction to make sure he really can't see her.

"Well, yeah. Sure." she repeats.* - Sat Oct 31 18:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right palm finds his shoulder. Her legs' grip on him tightens to. Carefully she'd then roll with him in her grip.

Once he's underneath her she removes the hand covering his face, and moves it to his shoulder.

She stares down from there, saying nothing since she already answered his question.* - Sat Oct 31 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hmmmmm. - Sat Oct 31 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) silently draws in a deep breath one final time. Her blush is fading away when she nods.

"Yeah. Think I feel fine now. I understand everything now. That makes everything easy."* - Sat Oct 31 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scratches her cheek with her left hand. A glance is directed down at him.

"Do I?" she iqnuires.

"What makes you think that?"* - Sat Oct 31 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

"I might suggest training instead....because I have enemies and I doubt they're going anywhere. But I have no ideas for training either. Unless it involves killing. Wonder if 'that's' why I wanna kill."* - Sat Oct 31 19:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's why I was saying hang out with Bryson. - Sun Nov  1 00:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. - Sun Nov  1 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see... - Sun Nov  1 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's good. - Sun Nov  1 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, staring at her prey with that murderously calm expression on her face.

"I'd tell you if I was bothered, you know." she says.* - Sun Nov  1 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wouldn't be a fair game otherwise. - Sun Nov  1 00:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It only feels good when I win, if I play fair. - Sun Nov  1 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lightning chakra flow sounds good. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure what I can teach you but.... - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm sure we'll think of something. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: We have time. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well come closer. - Sun Nov  1 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not sure if learning from that distance is efficient. - Sun Nov  1 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. Right. - Sun Nov  1 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she walks over.

Once she's close, Kat turns to face the south. Arms rest behind her back at the moment, with one hand holding the opposite arm.

Why?

Because this body language says "I'm not armed."

In other words, it says "I'm not gonna brutally murder you."

Kat's expression remains blank, and she watches the sand below.* - Sun Nov  1 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: lmao - Sun Nov  1 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods as she watches the display.

Eventually she reaches out with her right hand to wait for the coin. Her palm faces the sky.

Of course, as Index would see, she's currently wearing her lightning chakra flow armor.* - Sun Nov  1 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the coin in her palm and closes the hand. Carefully she maneuvers the hand until the coin slips through her fingers. From there, with skill, she moves the coin to where it's inbetween her thumb and index finger. Silently Kat takes a deep breath. Afterwords, very abruptly, the coin lights up.

It turns a neon blue color and crackling noises are produced. The noise presists for as long as the glow does of course. Many tiny strands of lightning trickle down to the ground below. Katsune is after all a person who learns incredibly quickly these days. Much faster than most "prodigies," due to how much work she's put in.

She's developed strategies. Critical thinking skills and such that put her above and beyond most. That, and she's had extensive amounts of elemental lightning training. Her control over her chakra is very good too. Add all of this together with the fact that she's wearing armor specifically made for lightning chakra flow, and it makes sense that the coin lit up instantly on Kat's very first try.

Already Kat can tell; her chakra flows much more smoothly now through this armor than it ever did through her gauntlets. Of course, that's only for the lightning element but she doesn't know that. She hasn't been told so yet. "This armor. . ." Kat coos. "I like it."

"I can tell....with it, I might be able to fight even Hassan." Slowly one of Kat's fingers wanders upwards. It finds the top of her coin. Gently with the gauntlet-covered appendage Kat rubs back and forth against its edge. She's testing how sharp it is.

Between her senses and her own familiarity with the feeling of lightning release chakra slipping out of her flesh, Kat can tell. This isn't her full power. She can thus tell, her armor won't be harmed in any way. "Not that I ever would." she says. "But the power definitely feels good."

"Calming." the savage teen elaborates. "For once...maybe I'll be able to relax when people threaten my life." Kat glances over at Index with those calculating and guarded eyes. Eyes that aim specifically not to threaten. Of course, that's part of what makes her expression intimidating.

She has enormous amounts of self-control. So much so that people are 'right' to be intimidated -- 'if', they're trying to make an enemy out of her. "If I'm strong, I don't -need- to kill anyone. I won't need to because I won't be desperate." Kat takes her thumb and uses it to flick the coin up into the air.

It spins. Almost as soon as it leaves Kat's hand, the lightning fades away. Of course, if she's learned the technique, it's not supposed to do that. The lightning is supposed to stick for long after it's left her body. Eventually the coin is in her hand again.

Kat places it inbetween her fingers. Roughly, she shoves lightning release chakra into it once more. This time, Kat knows instantly. She's learned the jutsu. She hasn't mastered it, but she can use it. She can also tell; this coin could now cut some things in half.

She can tell. Touching its edge may now be a bad idea.

With a nod, Kat stops pouring chakra into the pseudo-weapon. The lightning fades away, leaving her coin bare.* - Sun Nov  1 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns to face him. Absent-mindedly she hands him the now-bare coin.* - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd say that I can't wait to use this armor in a fight but.... - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know what? - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I can. - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For some reason.... - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This armor makes me feel really calm. - Sun Nov  1 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Enemies.... - Sun Nov  1 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Marrissa....Ortho.... - Sun Nov  1 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even possibly Hassan.... - Sun Nov  1 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes are averted as she says this. Her expression is a fairly neutral one, but she doesn't seem tense.

Kat's palms find her hips and her weight shifts a bit.

"I...don't think I'm worried about them. At all."

Kat's eyes find Index's again.

"I think....I don't need to worry anymore. I feel very safe."* - Sun Nov  1 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: done - Sun Nov  1 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Afterwords she turns to face the south. Slowly she lowers herself down to the ground. Her butt touches the sand, and her legs stretch out in front of her. Kat's palms find the ground at either side of her.

"Yep." she says.

"I can relax."* - Sun Nov  1 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Slowly.

Very quietly, Kat draws in a noticably -- but subtly -- shakey breath through the nose. Her eyes tremble.

Slowly, Kat reclines down onto her back. Her eyes become watery. Shortly afterwords, tears begin streaming down her face.

"I. . ." she says, with another nod.

"Don't have to fight anymore."

Despite her tears, Kat's voice flows smoothly.* - Sun Nov  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She can tell, she should turn around and hide her tears -- or, at least, wipe them away.

Even so, the teen feels for once like she doesn't have to.

So, Kat simply stares up at the sky very blankly. She hides absolutely nothing.

Very silently and carefully she takes in deep breaths.* - Sun Nov  1 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms and legs are sprawled out at her sides, for the record.

It'd be an awkward position otherwise.* - Sun Nov  1 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this. For the moment, she's a rag doll.

In more eloquent words; Kat's relaxed.* - Sun Nov  1 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains like this for the entire time. She feels no need to move a single muscle, and she doesn't want to.

For once, there's no need.

Probably at least twenty minutes or so pass.* - Sun Nov  1 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains in her current position. Even as she speaks, she feels no need to practice specific body language, or move.

She simply lies limp. Still, few muscles move aside from those needed for speaking.

A glance is sent Index's way as Kat takes yet another silent breath.

"We....can go somewhere." she says.

"If you want to."
* - Sun Nov  1 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or do something. As long as it's not. . . - Sun Nov  1 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Training....or fighting. - Sun Nov  1 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For right now...I want neither of those. - Sun Nov  1 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then let's do... - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Whatever feels natural/. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Whatever we want. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lying here for a few hours, feels natural. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then we can do that. - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Sun Nov  1 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Though it'll be....uncomfortable. - Sun Nov  1 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says that fairly quietly.* - Sun Nov  1 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ....Actually. - Sun Nov  1 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Let's go home.... - Sun Nov  1 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No....To a hotspring.... - Sun Nov  1 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sun Nov  1 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Nov  1 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Afterwords, she sits up, a bit slowly. It requires willpower because all she wants to do is lie down, but she does it.

Once she's standing, Kat reaches down to brush sand off of her butt. Not necessary, but reflex still.

As she does so, most of the sand covering her becomes weightless. As a result it hovers up into the air. Once that wears off it falls to the ground, leaving Kat perfectly clean.

Kat's turning to face Index with eyes averted as she reaches up with her right hand to wipe tears away from her cheeks, with her right arm's armor.* - Sun Nov  1 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her left hand -- which is clean of her tears -- reaches forwards to take his own hand.

With that, she'd walk with him.* - Sun Nov  1 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right hand finds her gut. Gently she rubs the partially clenched appendage against her armor, as if to feel it. With a faint frow on her face she stares ahead at the water.

"I-I. . ." she says, very quietly.

"Dunno if....I wanna take my armor off."* - Sun Nov  1 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: frown* - Sun Nov  1 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, slowly.

Her lips tremble a bit.

"I...really...." she says, quietly still.

"Don't wanna take it off."* - Sun Nov  1 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, very slowly.

"Okay. We can go home....and do that."

Kat doesn't comment on the concept of taking off her armor.





Like, ever.* - Sun Nov  1 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She allows him to lead her to the house.* - Sun Nov  1 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the bed.

"Lie down. . ." she coos very softly and smoothly.* - Sun Nov  1 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this. She's literally a rag doll for the entire moment, relaxing quite a bit the second he picks her up.

Since she was placed in Index's lap and is thus already there, she doesn't much at all.

Only the smallest, absolutely necessary movements to get comfortable. Kat's arms reach up to wrap tightly and snuggly around Index's torso. Kat nuzzles her face into his chest. Her legs straddle Index's hips. Slowly, Kat takes in a very deep and quiet breath. Not to smell him, but to have oxygen in her lungs.

Although of course, this does prove that she at the very least doesn't 'mind' smelling him.

Kat nuzzles even more affectionately as she exhales this brief. Her legs close tightly against him.

She cuddles.* - Sun Nov  1 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) still has her boots on.


Yep.* - Sun Nov  1 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually stops moving. Her eyes close and her head faces the west.

She says nothing. Deep, silent breaths are taken.

Kat moves very little though.* - Sun Nov  1 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) briefly and gently nuzzles her face into him again in response to his voice.

"Okay. . ." she coos, quietly.* - Sun Nov  1 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is presumably set down on her back in specific. Assuming this is the case, Kat simply stares up at the cieling with arms and legs sprawled out.

She can tell that he's taking off her boots. She's aware.

Even so....she doesn't look. Kat doesn't feel the need to.

She also doesn't stop him in any way.

Even now, she just doesn't feel like moving.* - Sun Nov  1 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink in response to the kissing. Kat gulps. Her toes wiggle a bit in response, and her feet bend a little.

Silently she takes in another breath.

The teen's eyes become a bit doey as he reaches her thigh. They wander off, and her cheeks turn more pink.

Lightly, she bites her bottom lip.* - Sun Nov  1 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gulps once more as Index begins working his way back up her leg. Absent-mindedly, and slowly, she reaches out for a pillow. Her hand grips down on it and she draws it up to her face with a sigh.

The kind of sigh that suggests shame, almost.

Kat hugs it close to both her chest, and her face, burrying said face. She hides herself entirely. And then, her grip relaxes. She, relaxes.

The girl's right leg shifts and stirs a bit, eventually closing inwards some. Her left foot's toes very slowly curl and uncurl. Muscles within her thighs are easily seen tensing up and then relaxing, back and forth, in response to his actions.* - Sun Nov  1 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) continues awkwardly and very slowly shifting to and fro. It becomes apparent that the teen's body is moving mostly on its own. Just nerves, reacting to the pleasure being given to her. She's way too lazy at the moment, after all, to move with any conscious effort.

The occasional shakey sigh is released. Kat's very careful not to moan or coo.* - Sun Nov  1 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's left leg slowly, -- very slowly -- rises up. It's shaking as it does so. It's "opening," so to speak, as Index massages it. Slowly her right leg opens as well, lagging behind just a bit. As a result, Kat's left soon with both legs opened a good bit.

It's pretty shameless, and she hides nothing.

Kat's shakey -- labored -- breathing remains audible. It's very quiet and subtle.* - Sun Nov  1 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's face remains hidden behind her pillow. She'd made sure of that.

At this time, her trembling, shakey arms slowly fall off to the side. She lets them. Her pillow remains where it is thanks to gravity.

No audible reaction is given in response to the rubbing of her crotch, though, aside from the same labored breathing that suggests pleasure. The teen refuses to moan or coo.

After all, those would be forced.

Thus, they'd be a lie. She'd be lying, to Index. Kat 'never' lies. Ever, if she can get away with it.

Kat's body does speak for her though. Her belly slowly rises and falls, shaking as it does so. Slowly and very subtly her legs bend back and forth, while trembling and shaking. They do so only just a bit. In fact, one may wonder if they're moving in sych with her lungs, or Index's hand.

* - Sun Nov  1 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls her pillow down, slowly. It reaches her mouth. Once there, Kat opens said mouth. Gently she bites down on her pillow. Eyes remain averted. They're doe eyes.

Even so, unlike before, Kat's eyes have a certain....composure, to them. In other words, she's focused.

Slowly, the teen's legs close. They eventually are lying on the bed, next to each other.

She stares up at the boy. Her blush remains. A goofy smile is on her face, past the pillow in her mouth. One that's almost cheeky.

She shows little reaction to the kissing of her breasts, and her neck. She's simply studying him at this point, watching his every move.

Like....a teacher.* - Sun Nov  1 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off as her neck is licked and such. As a shakey breath leaves her mouth, she removes her pillow. Kat allows a hand to rest on her butt. In the mean time, her left leg moves to the other side of Index's waist. Both legs then, carefully, would wrap around the boy's waist -- tightly.

Kat's arms remain around her pillow, but, she lazily lunges forwards. Soon her mouth finds his neck. After taking a mouth-full she'd gently bite down. She uses teeth, too. In fact, she lets them sink in quite a bit, and even begins suckling.

It may even be an unpleasant feeling. Kat doesn't seem to care, however. Her tongue laps back and forth over his flesh.

"H-hmmm...." she coos, a bit loudly.

Her teeth clamp down even harder, though the difference is subtle. Even so, Kat's guessing -- this'll cause at least a little bit of pain.* - Sun Nov  1 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) manages only through an awful lot of willpower to not bite even harder. Slowly she pulls her teeth out of his flesh, and gently. He has a hicky now. Kat had bit 'that' hard, and suckled 'that' hard.

The girl's face then finds his neck. Affectionally she nuzzles her face into it, shaking her head as well, as she says "No more though. . ."* - Sun Nov  1 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want sleep. - Sun Nov  1 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, still with a blush on her cheeks. Afterwords she pulls herself out from under him. Carefully she places herself on her side and curls up into a ball. Kat's pillow is held close, inbetween her arms and legs. She hugs it tightly and cuddles it. Her face is burried in it.

The teen's eyes close, and she eventually drifts off to sleep.* - Sun Nov  1 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Sun Nov  1 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo, I need to talk to you a bit. - Sun Nov  1 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmmmm. - Sun Nov  1 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Nov  1 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she backs up and steps out of the doorway to let Kilm in.* - Sun Nov  1 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) crawls up onto the couch. With a silent breath she turns to face the south. Legs end up sprawled out underneath her form, and palms rest on the cushions inbetween her legs.

Kat's eyes rest on the floor rather than Kilm for whatever reasons.

Said eyes and expression overall suggest a good mood, though it's subtle.

Very subtle.

A glance is sent Kilm's way.* - Sun Nov  1 15:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sun Nov  1 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Haven't seen Index yet. - Sun Nov  1 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was in bed all day. - Sun Nov  1 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  1 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He left before I got up. - Sun Nov  1 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well first an unrelated question, How'd you get armor? It looks pretty nice and strong. I wish I had some. - Sun Nov  1 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms slowly rise up in response to Kilm's question. Her hands find her armor. Slowly, they begin wandering. Crawling around. Sliding, and kneading.

Slowly and silently Kat takes another deep breath.

Awfully intimate body language considering she's in front of Kilm.

Eyes remain on the ground, though. They're out of focus. Her expression continues to suggest a really good mood though.

"Secret. . ." Kat coos, quietly.* - Sun Nov  1 15:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

"Okay." she says. Despite the news, Kat still looks....quite happy.

"Thanks for letting me know."* - Sun Nov  1 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You look awfully optimistic today and happy today. - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I am. - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anything happened? - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm really, really happy. - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's nice. - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing I should talk about happened. - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh, You started keeping a lot of things from me even though I'm your best friend. - Sun Nov  1 15:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's not.... - Sun Nov  1 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That I'm keeping things from you. It's just. . . - Sun Nov  1 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The things that "happened" are just....Index. - Sun Nov  1 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing else. - Sun Nov  1 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's private, Kilm. - Sun Nov  1 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Please don't ask in the future. - Sun Nov  1 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  1 15:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm going to assume Index bought the armor for you. - Sun Nov  1 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's fine. - Sun Nov  1 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "Assume" whatever you prefer. - Sun Nov  1 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If he did then that's nice of him. - Sun Nov  1 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway, I've thought about it and decided that I'll be leaving for training after all. I have faith that you guys can take care of yourselves against Edge. - Sun Nov  1 15:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) holds her hand out for the offered tea cup with an absent-minded nod. Absent-mindedly she'd allow the raccoon to pour her some tea. Eyes wander off after this is done.

She'd be drinking her tea very slowly.

"I see." she says in response to her friend's words.

Her cup finds her mouth. Very slowly she pours the liquid into her mouth, sipping.* - Sun Nov  1 15:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. - Sun Nov  1 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing else.* - Sun Nov  1 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have a feeling we can't get along as much anymore. - Sun Nov  1 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me too, Kilm. - Sun Nov  1 15:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's voice is very smooth and somewhat quiet when she says that.

Eyes are averted.* - Sun Nov  1 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Our interactions are just subpar now. - Sun Nov  1 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Sun Nov  1 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I agree. - Sun Nov  1 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You've been pursuing your goals and I've been pursuing mine. - Sun Nov  1 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even though I still do want to stay best friends. - Sun Nov  1 15:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov  1 15:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But now I believe today you just agree with everything. - Sun Nov  1 15:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should leave. - Sun Nov  1 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sips more at her tea after saying this.

Very slowly.* - Sun Nov  1 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Am I doing something wrong? - Sun Nov  1 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Yep.' - Sun Nov  1 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head to stare up at Kilm.

Kat's eyes continue to suggest a good mood. They're guarded, though.

The teen simply waits, with tea in her hand.* - Sun Nov  1 15:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What did I do? - Sun Nov  1 15:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are you waiting for me to get the door? - Sun Nov  1 15:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No, I just want to know, What is it that i'm doing wrong right now as a friend? - Sun Nov  1 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Leave. - Sun Nov  1 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this in a very polite and relaxed manner.* - Sun Nov  1 15:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Heya, Kat. - Sun Nov  1 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning Zenaki. - Sun Nov  1 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right hand finds her mouth. Gently Kat begins rubbing at her bottom lip.

With eyes that suggest playful curiosity she says "Quick question."

Kat's staring Zenaki in the eyes with a blank expression on her face. She's studying.* - Sun Nov  1 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did you like Saeza by any chance? - Sun Nov  1 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks away since Zenaki fell asleep.

"Anyway." she says.

"'Morning Index."* - Sun Nov  1 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks back up at Zenaki.

"Yeah." she says.

"Like."* - Sun Nov  1 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm just asking since I killed the fuck out of her. - Sun Nov  1 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Oh? - Sun Nov  1 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeeeeah. - Sun Nov  1 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) coos that word.* - Sun Nov  1 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Why? - Sun Nov  1 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Sun Nov  1 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Better question Zenaki. - Sun Nov  1 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Why. - Sun Nov  1 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm - Sun Nov  1 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins walking forwards.

Eventually she's put herself six feet away from Zenaki. She's facing her with arms at her sides.

Kat's eyes are very, very cold when she stares up at her. Her lips are stretched into a thin line.

"Better....question." she repeats.* - Sun Nov  1 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why did you stand beside me this morning? - Sun Nov  1 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Sun Nov  1 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Why the question?  - Sun Nov  1 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I.... - Sun Nov  1 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Am only gonna say this once. - Sun Nov  1 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Oh god. - Sun Nov  1 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do not be my enemy, old friend and comrade Zenaki whom I care deeply for. - Sun Nov  1 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: What's wrong, Kat?  - Sun Nov  1 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wrong? - Sun Nov  1 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- No. Not gonna answer that. - Sun Nov  1 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You though.... - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You look beautiful today. - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Thanks... - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I -like- that look in your eyes. - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It turns me on. - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Zenak--- - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Hot. - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: What is wrong with her... - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uh... - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Something is so wrong today about her. - Sun Nov  1 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Did I do something wrong to you?  - Sun Nov  1 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply stares.

She looks amused. It's very, very subtle though.* - Sun Nov  1 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Anyway Index. I was thinking. . . - Sun Nov  1 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe we should talk. - Sun Nov  1 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ... - Sun Nov  1 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Zenaki is a turn on and we 'should talk'. - Sun Nov  1 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Not good. - Sun Nov  1 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ...U-Uh... - Sun Nov  1 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: S-Sure? - Sun Nov  1 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .... - Sun Nov  1 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Kat, I care for you. What's wrong? - Sun Nov  1 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns on her heel and begins walking away, leading Index off to wherever.* - Sun Nov  1 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Work on that Zenaki. - Sun Nov  1 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're not very good at it. - Sun Nov  1 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not half as good as....-me-. - Sun Nov  1 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ..... - Sun Nov  1 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Sure.... - Sun Nov  1 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hasn't stopped walking, for even a second.

She's walking at a lazy pace, too.* - Sun Nov  1 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop northeast of the door to her house. Arms rest at her sides and her weight shifts a bit.

Very blankly, she stares over at Index.

She waits for him to speak first, seeing as she's batshit crazy today and all.* - Sun Nov  1 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's tone is very polite and relaxed when she says "Good. . ."* - Sun Nov  1 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I woke up feeling really.....really good actually. - Sun Nov  1 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Really? - Sun Nov  1 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's great. - Sun Nov  1 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is cooing when she says "Y-yeah. . . ."* - Sun Nov  1 16:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I mean...You look good today. - Sun Nov  1 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: W-Well. - Sun Nov  1 16:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: YOu always look good. - Sun Nov  1 16:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hey. . . - Sun Nov  1 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is speaking fairly quietly, and slowly.

It's a very -careful- volume....and -careful- pace. After all, Kat has to be sure no one realizes she's completely lost her damned mind.

"I. . .was thinking." she coos.* - Sun Nov  1 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I-I.... - Sun Nov  1 16:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Leaving Sunagakure with me? - Sun Nov  1 16:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something -beta-. - Sun Nov  1 16:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't -want- to anymore. - Sun Nov  1 16:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're -free-! - Sun Nov  1 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can do.... - Sun Nov  1 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -Whatever- we want! - Sun Nov  1 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -Finally-! - Sun Nov  1 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're....we're teenagers! - Sun Nov  1 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's have fun. - Sun Nov  1 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I agree...We should just do what we want....So...Why not do everything? - Sun Nov  1 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  1 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) coos when she says "'Everything'. . ."* - Sun Nov  1 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Slowly she steps forwards. Slowly, her arms rise up.

Once they're on his shoulders, having basically crawlwed onto them, they slowly wrap around him. She pulls him into a snug hug, and closes her eyes.

Very slowly, Kat draws in a shakey breath as she closes her eyes. Once more, she nods.

"I -knew- you'd understand me. . ." Kat coos, softly.* - Sun Nov  1 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment longer to breathe. Kat's breaths are slow and -careful-. Each one is a bit shakey.

An educated person....may understand why.

It's adrenaline. A 'lot' of it.

Kat nods more. She holds the hug for many very long seconds. Thirty of them or so.

Afterwords, the girl unwraps her arms from Index. Arms meet behind her own back. She holds one arm with the opposite hand.

Very slowly, Kat begins walking backwards. She takes five steps, and stares up at Index from there. Her eyes suggest excitement, though her lips are pretty straight.

She's composed. She's in control of her emotions.

Kat says nothing.* - Sun Nov  1 16:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hmmmm. - Sun Nov  1 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know. . . - Sun Nov  1 16:32:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then, Let's find out together. - Sun Nov  1 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Exactly! - Sun Nov  1 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I....want....to plan. - Sun Nov  1 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That'd feel good. - Sun Nov  1 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wanna be careful. - Sun Nov  1 16:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Still gotta plan. - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If....we wanna 'win'.... - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We gotta plan. - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Win? - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I-I....I dunno. - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just....ya know. - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something...comes up. - Sun Nov  1 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I do agree...We have to plan to stay alive. But, while we're planning we should always just leave time to 'live'. - Sun Nov  1 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of -course-! - Sun Nov  1 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I never....-did- that before, Index! - Sun Nov  1 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I always planned, but never got to have fun with it. - Sun Nov  1 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's....exactly.... - Sun Nov  1 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What I'm thinkin'. - Sun Nov  1 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I never did show you...The place I bought for us. - Sun Nov  1 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You...bought us a place? - Sun Nov  1 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  1 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I remember you saying somethin' about that.... - Sun Nov  1 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: A place off the charts. - Sun Nov  1 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Show me. - Sun Nov  1 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Away from everyone. - Sun Nov  1 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Slowly she steps forwards. Once in range, she reaches up to take his hand, gently. Once her hand is in his, she slowly and gently closes it -- inch by inch. Carefully.

Eyes then find his.

"Yeah. . ." she says.

"I wanna go."* - Sun Nov  1 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll send Hassan....a letter. - Sun Nov  1 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'll like it. - Sun Nov  1 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm -sure- he will. - Sun Nov  1 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm -sure- he will. - Sun Nov  1 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. I'll let you help. - Sun Nov  1 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I promise. - Sun Nov  1 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, staring down at his hand.* - Sun Nov  1 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this.* - Sun Nov  1 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares ahead at the building. Her eyes suggest a good mood, though it's subtle.

Kat says absolutely nothing.* - Sun Nov  1 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Without any hesitation she begins walking forwards. Arms meet behind her back. Eyes wander as she moves.

Of course, Kat's well aware this could be some kind of horrible trap. However, she doesn't care today.

"I see. . ." she says.* - Sun Nov  1 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop at some point. Slowly and subtly she nods.

Afterwords, Kat slowly kneels down. Her left knee meets the floor, and her right leg moves forwards.

Kat's hands find her Sunagakure headband. Slowly, and carefully....metticulously, Kat unties it.

Afterwords, she carefully rises back up to her feet. For a moment, she holds the headband in both hands. Kat stares closely at it for the while.

Slowly, eyes wander to and fro across it. She takes in. . .every, single...detail.
Silently, Kat takes a very deep breath.

"Don't need this anymore. . ." she says, quietly.

With that, she then reaches up to stuff the headband into one of her armor's many pockets.

Afterwords, Kat abruptly turns and begins walking off towards the stairway. Kat's not sure why but the idea of being in an extremely dark and damp place right now sounds unbelievably comforting.* - Sun Nov  1 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This place.... - Sun Nov  1 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Reminds me of my dungeon in Konoha. - Sun Nov  1 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I like it. - Sun Nov  1 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You had a dungeon? - Sun Nov  1 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Didn't 'used' to call it a dungeon. . . - Sun Nov  1 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Uwuahaha. - Sun Nov  1 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Didn't 'used' to call it a dungeon. . . - Sun Nov  1 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: M-mm. . . - Sun Nov  1 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stands with arms behind her back, and one hand holding the opposite arm.

Kat's eyes wander.

"Reminds me....of the Kenryoku torture places."

Kat glances over at Index.

Many seconds then pass. Kat decides to choose her words carefully.

"We gonna use this?"* - Sun Nov  1 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: M-mm. . . - Sun Nov  1 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll think about it. - Sun Nov  1 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I miss torture but. . . - Sun Nov  1 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good to be....in control....of yourself. - Sun Nov  1 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That way. . . - Sun Nov  1 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You win. . . . - Sun Nov  1 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So. . . - Sun Nov  1 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll think about it. A lot. - Sun Nov  1 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For a while. - Sun Nov  1 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares for a very long while after saying that.

Slowly, her eyes wander.* - Sun Nov  1 17:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She lets him take her hand, and turns to follow him.* - Sun Nov  1 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: This is the dining hall. - Sun Nov  1 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I-I.....see. - Sun Nov  1 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Never had one of these before. - Sun Nov  1 17:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you like it? - Sun Nov  1 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) coos when she says "I do. . ."

Her eyes are wandering for the moment.

"A lot."* - Sun Nov  1 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms begin shaking as she enters this room. Quietly Kat draws in a shakey breath. Eyes wander, but Kat's completely absent-minded right now. She only pretends to look.

The truth is, she can't focus.

Eventually, Kat takes a few steps forwards. Once she's in front of Index, she turns to face him.

Slowly, trembling arms rise up. Eventually, she'd place her palms on Index's shoulders.

"Index...there's something we should talk about." she says.* - Sun Nov  1 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) silently draws in a very deep and shakey breath. Kat's eyes are first suggest excitement. Mania. There's a faint smile on her face.

Then, however, her smile slowly fades away. Only a faint frown is left.

The mania in Kat's eyes slowly fades away. What's left is only a murderous cold.

"It's Kilm." Kat says.

"I saw it in his eyes today. I heard it in his voice. His town. I can tell. He intends to kill me."

Kat pauses for a very.....very long while.

"Me....his friend who's done....so much."

Kat pauses once more for a very long while.

"I-I....I wanna kill him first." she says.* - Sun Nov  1 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: tone* - Sun Nov  1 17:13:48 2015
