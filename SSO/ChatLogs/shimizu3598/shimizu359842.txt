<br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something unique to me. - Tue Oct 20 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's useful, and very easy to do. - Tue Oct 20 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and begins walking away.

"This way." she says to him.* - Tue Oct 20 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should I come along? - Tue Oct 20 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can if you want. - Tue Oct 20 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Tue Oct 20 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Might as well to keep talking. - Tue Oct 20 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) thinks: Yeah, they probably are. - Tue Oct 20 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) thinks: What the actual fuck, Goku? - Tue Oct 20 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mokutsu(LordxPatrick) thinks: ..... - Tue Oct 20 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Coming, Trilliam? - Tue Oct 20 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was going to teach you. - Tue Oct 20 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Tue Oct 20 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face Trilliam. Her left palm rests in her hip and her weight shifts a bit. Kat's right arm rises then and her hand opens to reveal that palm to the boy.

Abruptly, the palm lights up. Explosive chakra comes forwards. A very loud, gunshot-like bang is produced as a result that echoes off of the nearby Sunagakure walls.

Overall this display is weak.More important its range is completely point-blank meaning of course that Trilliam isn't harmed or endangered in any way.

Kat assesses the child's body language with a stoic expression of her own.

"Exploding Palm." she says, telling him the name.* - Tue Oct 20 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It can put a hole in someone, kill with a handshake, deflect kunai. . . . - Tue Oct 20 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or save your life if someone dares to try and kill 'you' with a handshake. - Tue Oct 20 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Oh, He can learn this jutsu? - Tue Oct 20 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. He's gifted. Has explosion release like me. - Tue Oct 20 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nice. - Tue Oct 20 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Basically my special element. - Tue Oct 20 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway Trilliam. - Tue Oct 20 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You and Katsune have the special element Explosion. - Tue Oct 20 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have Storm. - Tue Oct 20 19:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I showed you the technique so that you can decide whether or not you want to learn it. Because...... - Tue Oct 20 19:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm. - Tue Oct 20 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That you'll never....ever, even attempt to try and teach anyone how to imitate explosion release. - Tue Oct 20 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If someone wasn't born with it, they shouldn't have the ability. - Tue Oct 20 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's how I feel. - Tue Oct 20 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- If they have an affinity for it like you or me though.... - Tue Oct 20 19:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was born with this gift. - Tue Oct 20 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's mine and no one should try and imitate it. - Tue Oct 20 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: I agree with your terms and eyes? - Tue Oct 20 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't ask me about the eyes. - Tue Oct 20 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You probably shouldn't know . . . Should you? - Tue Oct 20 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: I mean..Umm you never know information saves lives. - Tue Oct 20 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmm. - Tue Oct 20 19:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are the eyes of the devil. - Tue Oct 20 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't ever forget that. - Tue Oct 20 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I'll tell him about being careful with the hand-seals, Alright? Shake your head if I shouldn't before I do. - Tue Oct 20 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head.* - Tue Oct 20 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Tue Oct 20 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Tue Oct 20 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm sorta sounds like when I was little Gramps and Dad always told me to keep eyes on my opponets chest. - Tue Oct 20 19:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This technique is a basic one. I learned it when I was eleven. Developed it myself, after years of hard work. - Tue Oct 20 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Took that long for something so simple and easy. - Tue Oct 20 19:49:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she walks backwards into the nearby boulder and then absent-mindedly pulls herself up onto its surface. Kat sits. One leg crosses over the other and palms rest on the stone at either side of her while she watches the boy.* - Tue Oct 20 19:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gotta make sure you keep the chakra flat, like with Suimen Hakou no Waza if you know it. - Tue Oct 20 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It'd be cool if I could become Raikage for having worked under Niklaus as a Kumogakure shinobi for a while. - Tue Oct 20 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Flat, so that you can redirect kunai with it. - Tue Oct 20 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: I do not know of this Suimen . - Tue Oct 20 19:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You want to turn your chakra into sulfur and lightning at the same time. - Tue Oct 20 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When those two materials meet, an explosion is produced. - Tue Oct 20 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Ahhh so thats the science behind it. - Tue Oct 20 20:17:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to Bryson's side.* - Wed Oct 21 09:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way to Sunagakure's gates as she reads the finer details of her mission scroll. It'd seem that, in an village west of Sunagakure, someone's been on a killing spree. It's not an outpost technically speaking but just one of the villages that fall under Sunagakure's jurisdiction. Naturally Kat's expected to meet the village's head to get the rest of the details. For now, though, the teen knows at least one thing.

This person's been killing mostly children. So far there have been sixteen deaths and at no point were any bodies discovered. A nightmare one might expect only in fantasies. In time, Kat's arrived at her destination. Within the village are a handfull of shinobi guards, only one of which is a chuunin. 

Kat's to help this person mostly because her target's reportedly exceedingly dangerous. He's killed four shinobi guards already. Furthermore this chuunin is responsible for all of the other Sunagakure shinobi here and is also the only one capable of fighting someone this skilled. Upon questioning her comrade, she learns what the problem is. This woman is a genjutsu specialist.

Katsune's target however....has no eyes. He also has no mouth, ears, or even nostrils. As explained at the village, the chuunin has only encountered him briefly and she fled the very second she realized her enemy's strengths. Even then, she only managed to get away because she'd sent in a shadow clone. Normally she'd have even been far too slow physically to out-run the monster of an opponent.

With a nod, Kat simply asks her comrade to sit this fight out due to her being up against someone who counters her talents. In addition to this, she recruits a handful of the surviving genin. With that discussed, all of them wait until nightfall. In the mean time, Katsune rests. When she wakes up, it's to cicadas chirping.

The victims of Katsune's target -- dubbed "Slenderman" -- have mostly been reported to go missing after spending time at the park. It's also been said that they tend to occur at night. With that in mind, Kat and company make their way to said park. In time, they're standing at the entrance. Kat's hands rest on her hips and her eyes wander.

With a handsign, Kat signals her comrades to quietly hide themselves. Afterwords the teen slips into the earth, disappearing from sight herself. And so she's easily able to sweep the entire area undetected, by way of magnetic senses and such. As many as eight entire hours pass. In time, though, Kat gives up.

Not one single sign of her enemy is found. With a sigh, she heads off to the village's barracks. Katsune spends the entire day relaxing, only to spend another night hunting. In time, two full weeks have passed. On the first day of the third day, though, Kat gets lucky.

Finally her persistence has paid off. She's hunting completely alone today, and she finds the mysterious "man." She can sense him, stalking around above. He's at the edge of the park, and doesn't even seem awfully interested in said park itself. Ten feet tall, incredibly slim, and with dangling arms and legs to match. 

Kat can make out very little as far as the finer details go due to her only method of seeing him are magnetic senses. For three whole, entire, painful hours Kat follows her target. Deep, quiet breaths are taken. It's tempting to attack now, but Kat's told that her target is incredibly swift. Most likely, faster than her.

Considering she depends on speed, it seems unwise to attack him openly. For this reason, Katsune opts to follow him and wait until he sleeps. If he attacks someone she'll be forced to attack early. However, parents have started keeping their children indoors at night in light of all of the recent deaths. For this reason, Kat's plan goes smoothly.

Finally, she manages to follow him to a house. A very specific house. He slips in through the back door in a very surreal and unnatural manner. Literally he slips in 'through' the door. A crack in the door to be specific.

By now, Kat's tired. She's used up a lot of chakra. Even so, she persists. Before going to sleep, she's decided she can at least inspect the home more. Creeping into the ground, she senses it out as best she can. In time, she learns certain things.

Most notable is this. There's more than one "Slenderman." There are in fact seventeen. All of them are stored in the basement. The situation becomes much clearer.

Armed with this knowledge, Kat retreats to the barracks and sleeps for one more night. Over the course of the night she has non-stop nightmares. When she wakes up, though, she spends the entire day very discreetly gathering information on the associated house and its occupants. In time, she learns that the occupant is a retired and very old, but experienced fuuinjutsu specialist. A man with an awful lot of skill in fuuinjutsu and an incredibly frail body.

In time his body was incredibly strong and durable, but age and disease did away with that. Things become clearer still. Within two hours, Katsune's aquired the village head's permission to kill her target criminal. Fuuinjutsu means traps, and a weak body means puppets. The picture is clear, so Kat's plan is already decided on.

The girl hovers through the village during the day. Senses are locked onto the target house and due to the fact that she's been hovering, she moves with complete silence. Eventually her feet very softly meet the ground. She weights literally nothing, so she makes no noise as a result. Kat draws in a silent, shakey breath through the nose.

With a solemn expression on her face, Kat plants her fist to the wall of her target's house. Her sensory abilities tell her that the man is in bed. Without hesitation, she uses the house's walls as fuel. A trigger, for her Landmine Fist. Abruptly the ground shakes. The entire world shakes, including all of the houses even remotely nearby. Kat's hair is picked up and blown backwards alongside her skirt.

Dirt is thrown all over the place as the beam of energy races forwards, releasing an absurdly loud and reverberating boom. Instantly, her opponent is disintigrated. Already she senses the slender thralls in the basement slowly turning to dust. The house falls apart almost entirely in response to Kat's display. Even so, no villagers come near. They've been told not to.

And so now, Kat makes her way to the basement. After hours of searching she finds her dead opponent's fuuinjutsu notes. The ones responsible for the kinjutsu that turns children into thralls. Without getting permission from anyone, she takes a lighter and burns them to ash. Afterwords Kat heads back to Sunagakure with her mission complete.* - Wed Oct 21 20:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) removes her gauntlets and hangs them on her belt. With a silent sigh, she then cracks her knuckles and removes some makeshift brass knuckles she made at home. Cloths protect her hands and a very thin sheet of metal is glued to the surface of these objects. Naturally, these objects have no value whatsoever as weapons. They are useless in that regard.

That, however, is the point. Kat's right foot slowly draws backwards through the sand. Arms rise and hands clench into very tight fists. Blankly Kat stares ahead at her tree. Slowly, she pours earth natured chakra into her practice weapons. The metal, the cloth, and the glue are all strengthened significantly. That, after all, is the jutsu Kat's training.

Chakra Flow, for the earth element. Slowly the teen draws in a deep breath through the nose. Not for her training, though. For her immeasurable amount of rage. She chose to try and be a good person which left her calling people out in public whenever she noticed things not going her way. 

As a result, she has very few friends left in Sunagakure and none of them are enjoyable. Murder would have been better. It makes no enemies. Abruptly Kat launches her fist forwards. The teen holds her weapon there for a moment.

Afterwords she looks back down at it. A lot of time is spent inspecting it. In time, Katsune determines that no noticable amount of damage was done. Even so, she can barely focus. She daydreams in public.

Fantasies about murder. Something she'll have to enjoy and soon. Talking to people solves nothing when the people in question are arrogant or stupid. No. Only killing will leave her as happy as she deserves to be.

A barrage of punches are launched at her tree. Little to no damage is done to it though. An entire hour passes. By the time this occurs, Kat's breathing is labored. A very light layer of sweat coats her form, and only subtly.

At this point Kat realizes her knuckles are bleeding. Even so, she's hardly phased. Her adreneline levels are off the charts. Try as she might, she can't remain calm. There is only rage. 

Extremely murderous rage. Insane amounts of it. In time, her makeshift knuckle weapons have worn down. The glue on them breaks apart, and she's forced to abandon the tools. They fall to the ground, covered in her blood.

Briefly and with a very blank expression on her face, Kat glances down at them to witness this fact. With her left hand she absent-mindedly digs through a sack fastened to her belt at her left hip. Out of it comes two more of her weapons. She'd expected them to break down due to how incredibly fragile they are without her earth chakra poured into them.

For this reason she'd brought many with her. Two more are fastened to her hands. More chakra is poured into them. Abruptly she launches another incredibly rapid barrage of punches at her target tree. Rapid relatively speaking anyway.

Kat's no taijutsu specialist. Even so, her arms move much faster than those of any non-shinobi. In time, she's even manages to wear much of the bark down on the tree. It is a dead one after all. It's not in its prime and so its bark is very weak.

Kat's now punching naked and dead wood. There are many holes in it from her assault. It's funny. People always underestimate her. She launched a Landmine Fist at Tetsumi Jiki and the nearby houses shook in place.

Even so, all people saw were that she "lost." She'd ran out of chakra in reality, and had held back when she launched her technique the first time. She needed to be sure she'd kill no one. Now, however, she can launch six times as many Landmine Fists in a single day. She can also fly.

Even so, people consider her completely irrelevent. This is good, because when she goes to kill certain people she'll have no challenge. No one will even see her coming despite her being the second strongest person in Sunagakure. With this in mind, Kat punches more. In time more hours pass. Her tree is left with a rather deep hole in it despite Kat's lack of physical strength.

The density of her weapons contributed an awful lot to this of course. With her chakra poured into them, they're harder than steel. And by now, Kat's blood on her hands has scabbed over. They're incredibly sore and even a bit swolen. Only now as her adrenaline dies down does the teen realize how much it hurts.

For an entire minute she stares down at them, fairly blankly and absent-mindedly. Afterwords she throws her practice weapons aside. Her actual, purple gauntlets find their way back to her hands. Katsune then turns on her heel and wanders off to a new part of the desert. She'll find somewhere else to train.
* - Wed Oct 21 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sleeps for three or four days before training again. As she realizes, she over did it a bit in her last training session. Kat wakes up on the fifth day with a yawn. Several minutes are spent stretching, and she does so quite thoroughly. Thoroughly because today she plans an especially long training montage.

Kat's training with earth Chakra Flow was nothing more than preperation for today. Today, she'll learn and master the Domu technique. Time passes, and eventually Kat's in front of an entirely different tree. This one is still youthful and thus quite durable. To warm herself up, Kat pours earth release chakra flow into her gauntlets.

With that done, she launches a barrage of punches at her target. This warm-up is more for her brain than her body. She wants to get used to the feeling of flowing earth chakra into her weapons. When she's done this and has that feeling in mind, learning Domu should be much easier. In time, there are clearly derfined tears and scars on the bark she's been punching.* - Wed Oct 21 22:29:58 2015
