<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leads Zenaki into a house with a sigh. Once there, both hands find her own hips. Kat's weight shifts a bit, and she turns her eyes to Zenaki's hands. She checks both, for gloves.

"Show me your hands?" she inquires.

"Palms, and backs of them."* - Sun Oct  4 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is looking for fuuinjutsu seals though.

"Alright...feet?" she inquires.* - Sun Oct  4 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Telling you already. I'm looking for fuuinjutsu seals. - Sun Oct  4 16:34:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a very faint shade of pink. Eyes wander off, and her mouth falls very slightly agape.

Seeing the woman in that position isn't exactly what she was after. After a brief and silent sigh through the nose she nods.

"Right." she says.

An arm rises and with her right index finger she motions for Zenaki to turn around first. She's not exactly looking to see the woman's chest.* - Sun Oct  4 16:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Guess you're fine then." she says with a silent and subtle breath, once more looking her up and down. Kat's eyes are out of focus for the moment, as if....there's something about this that still doesn't seem quite right.

At a lazy pace, she turns and begins making her way to the door.

"Just let me know if you ever need anything, alright?" she inquires. The girl's hand finds the doorknob and she opens it, to let Zenaki out. She holds it for her.* - Sun Oct  4 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I should tell Zenaki right now instead of Fujitora . . . She might pass it to him when she sees him. - Sun Oct  4 16:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs, looking Kilm up and down for a bit. "As much chakra as this fucking jutsu takes...." she says.

"I have no idea how I'll ever master it."

The girl slowly slides her right foot backwards through the sand then. Arms rise and hands clench partially, as if to mimic claws.

Blankly, she stares ahead at her sparring partner.

"Anyway I'm ready whenever."* - Sun Oct  4 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "I want to spar -you- in specific for a reason." she says.

"I'm positive that -your- body can take it. You're durable enough."* - Sun Oct  4 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: To be honest . . . I almost burned myself but we'll see. - Sun Oct  4 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. We'll see, yeah. - Sun Oct  4 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I also didn't want to say what Ushinawa's will was in front of the people there. - Sun Oct  4 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm....? - Sun Oct  4 17:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But, I never knew all he wanted . . . Was peace. - Sun Oct  4 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. Well. - Sun Oct  4 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Spar? - Sun Oct  4 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sure. - Sun Oct  4 17:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then lifts her arms, quickly. She forms the tiger seal. Quite suddenly, the girl then kneels down. Palms smack against the ground, hard and face.

Suddenly, a wall begins rising up all around Kilm. An earthen, rocky wall hard as steel. It starts roughly fifty feet away from him in all directions, making it impossible for even him to out-run it at the speed it's rising. Even the floor would turn to stone, presumably making hiding like a mole impossible since the floor has chakra in it.

It'd form a dome. Kat intends to trap him in it.* - Sun Oct  4 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs. She senses Kilm escaping. The girl realizes though, she can't catch him in the trap she planned.

In response, Kat simply begins sprinting forwards, running directly over the corridor. Kilm is leaving as the corridor rises so kat simply....never lets the corridor finish forming entirely. She stops feeding it chakra and chases after him, eager to not let him to too far. She needs to out-run him.

Mid-stride, after taking only a few steps, Kat places her hands together to form the tiger seal. Abruptly, chakra is shoved throughout her body. And with that, she uses the shunshin jutsu.

As a result, the girl would end up directly behind Kilm. She comes skidding to a stop, and she's falling backwards as she does so. Legs are aimed to ram into Kilm's own legs and trip him.

She needs him off-balance. At her speed, it's questionable as to whether or not her shunshin speed isn't what determines how fast her kick is.* - Sun Oct  4 18:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns mid-slide as Kilm tries to stumble up to his feet. Even as he's forming his handseal, Kat's aiming to plant her fist into his side. She shoves it as quickly as she can while attempting to throw herself out of the way of his fireball.

Kat's fist will probably hit him since he's tripping but...maybe not. If it doesn't, her fist instead meets the earth.

And then....an extremely loud, ear-splittingly loud bang is heard. An explosion is made, from this point blank range.

It streams forwards like a wave. Likely, Kilm is caught since he simply can not out-run her by much even outside of shunshin.

Should Kilm get caught in it....he's probably left hardly able to even move.

He'd also be sent flying backwards, by maybe fifty or sixty feet...unless he has certain balance-related perks.

Even so. Kilm's blast is a danger, but Kat's landmine fist explosion probably eats it entirely.* - Sun Oct  4 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly pulls herself up from the ground, with limbs trembling a bit. A weak, half-hearted, apologetic smirk is produced. One that suggests it's forced.

Judging by body language though, the sheer chakra cost hurt her about as much as the blast hurt him.

"Hmph." she scoffs.

"Well. Looks like you're hurt as much as I hoped. Finally."* - Sun Oct  4 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Made that jutsu for Erebus. - Sun Oct  4 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And now that he's gone? - Sun Oct  4 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now...gotta find other uses for it. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You've already found one. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That was exhausting though. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: By that I mean . . . You can kick my ass even easier. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well....hmmm. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. Never "kicked your ass" before. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm surprised....you didn't dodge my kick. - Sun Oct  4 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Must not have heard or sensed me coming. - Sun Oct  4 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Was too focused on leaving the dome. - Sun Oct  4 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah . . . Gotta train that hearing . . .  - Sun Oct  4 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But not for my ears to explode from the sound that jutsu produces . . . - Sun Oct  4 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way....today I learned....my jutsu's practical. - Sun Oct  4 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then again...I already knew you had no taijutsu talent. - Sun Oct  4 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Normally getting that close is suicide. - Sun Oct  4 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I should get some more taijutsu talent. - Sun Oct  4 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should we go to the square? - Sun Oct  4 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. Yes. - Sun Oct  4 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to lead the way to Sunagakure with a nod. She sprints.* - Sun Oct  4 18:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Been one for a while now. - Sun Oct  4 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel to leave.* - Sun Oct  4 18:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wonder what that was about. - Sun Oct  4 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wonder if he meant leave the square or leave the village. - Sun Oct  4 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll assume square. Seems like a reasonable guy. - Sun Oct  4 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Probably square. - Sun Oct  4 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not psychotically dangerous like Erebus. - Sun Oct  4 18:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: My perfect match was a stoat. - Sun Oct  4 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: We can spar. I'll use my weakest technique only and nothing else. Maybe some taijutsu too, which isn't my specialty. - Sun Oct  4 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I want to be contracted to my perfect match... what is that process? - Sun Oct  4 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Is sparring really the only thing to entertain you? - Sun Oct  4 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What's a stoat? - Sun Oct  4 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Because believe me, I will find something to do. - Sun Oct  4 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Is that like a cross between Stallions and Goats? - Sun Oct  4 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: .......I don't date everyone and everything that moves. - Sun Oct  4 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: So yes, sometimes, sparring -is- the only thing. - Sun Oct  4 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Eh? What does dating have to do with it? - Sun Oct  4 23:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll show you what Stoats are some day. - Sun Oct  4 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Like what, Tetsu? - Sun Oct  4 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: I dunno, a game? Not sure exacty. - Sun Oct  4 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Actually, we can go spar if you'd like, I don't care. - Sun Oct  4 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Sir... do you know how I can find my perfect match? - Sun Oct  4 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Or, I can just go hang out with Taiga, whatever works, ya know. - Sun Oct  4 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So Seisuke, that was an interesting spar. - Sun Oct  4 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Yeah. - Sun Oct  4 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm recovered now for the most part. - Sun Oct  4 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: How do I learn to summon dragons? - Sun Oct  4 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Bryson it just happens - Sun Oct  4 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: .... - Sun Oct  4 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You don't. - Sun Oct  4 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I see... so its like a random occurance in life - Sun Oct  4 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Why? - Sun Oct  4 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: If Taiga gets a dragon then I want an even cooler dragon. - Sun Oct  4 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't seem to react to this.* - Sun Oct  4 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's why. - Sun Oct  4 23:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Did I miss anything squad related? - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Nope~ - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You gave me no reason Seisuke. - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mmmkay.~ - Sun Oct  4 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Well you see. - Sun Oct  4 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: The way my summoning is set up. - Sun Oct  4 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Doesn't even share. - Sun Oct  4 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: When you're free meet me at the place. - Sun Oct  4 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to wander off.* - Sun Oct  4 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders into the building, storing her gauntlets away and gently closing the door behind her.

She'd keep walking at a lazy pace with arms crossed until she gets to wherever Seisuke is -- or the couch. Whichever she finds first.* - Sun Oct  4 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. With that she turns and sets herself down. One leg crosses over the other as always -- since, ya know, she's wearing a body suit that leaves little to the imagination and all.

"I should mention..." she says.

"Fujitora removed the seal you put on me. I had to let him. Didn't want him starting something and the entirety of Sunagakure then deciding I needed to be arrested."* - Sun Oct  4 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Put back there if you want; I don't mind. - Sun Oct  4 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: --- - Sun Oct  4 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: My first question is. - Sun Oct  4 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What was he doing in your mouth? - Sun Oct  4 23:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Too lazy to explain....but.... - Mon Oct  5 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Uh..... - Mon Oct  5 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He sensed it basically..... - Mon Oct  5 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Bas...ic...ally.... - Mon Oct  5 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Won't happen again I'm sure. - Mon Oct  5 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He only found it because I asked him if he could sense it. - Mon Oct  5 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was a long conversation okay.... - Mon Oct  5 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ... - Mon Oct  5 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Mon Oct  5 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Take a seat on my lap and face me then please~ - Mon Oct  5 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander, in a shady manner. Eventually though, she rises to her feet and wanders over to the man. A bit roughly, she then sets her butt down on his left leg.

Eyes are averted when she says "The rule never said I had to sit on your lap in the way that you prefer."

Her expression's pretty blank. The girl pulls her legs up and leaves them stretched out towards the east. Arms remain crossed.* - Mon Oct  5 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. . . - Mon Oct  5 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) considers this for a moment. Eventually though, she nods. With that, she begins lazily turning in place. Her left leg is drawn towards her, and she sits with both legs sprawled out underneath him and pressed to his own legs.

Eye contact is maintained, and she opens her mouth.* - Mon Oct  5 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her tongue.* - Mon Oct  5 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression is a tiny bit sour when she closes her mouth, having had the seal placed successfully.

She stares. Her expression suggests she's questioning his integrity.

Kat says nothing.* - Mon Oct  5 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow. She waits for an explanation.* - Mon Oct  5 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Well you see, I've decided I need to get stronger, And I'm sure you'd like to as well. - Mon Oct  5 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. - Mon Oct  5 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But we'd also need to expand our arsenal, should we not? - Mon Oct  5 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: To be able to deal with a wide-variety of situations. - Mon Oct  5 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah, I agree. - Mon Oct  5 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So basically. - Mon Oct  5 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: My offer extends to you as well. - Mon Oct  5 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you have anything I don't already have, I'll pay you for any you discover on your journies. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Scrolls..... - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm also paying double for Advanced Elements or Clan Techniques. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But I won't ask you for yours. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can give you some for free but I hardly understand most of these techniques that aren't earth. Earth is my primary element. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My favorite too. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: All the best stuff I have is earth or explosion. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I probably have most of them. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Kilm gave me quite a few. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My thoughts are this. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm...a bit uncomfortable teaching you things you'll teach to other people. Especially...explosion jutsus. - Mon Oct  5 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm? - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Who ever said I was teaching others? - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And I won't ask you to. - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What can you do with earth scrolls though? - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I value your uniqueness. - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I can't even learn Earth Techniques. - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Not naturally. - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's simply a matter of hiding my own skill set. - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Explosion release? - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I doubt I can. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What can you do with thos scrolls? - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Nothing. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You said you're paying double for advanced elements or clan techniques. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Oh. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright, I get it. My bad. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You do? - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....Er....no not really. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm tired. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Well basically. - Mon Oct  5 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rubs at the back of her head with a frown on her face.* - Mon Oct  5 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you want you can rest right here while I talk, *pats chest* It'd no biggie. - Mon Oct  5 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll explain it to you. - Mon Oct  5 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's* - Mon Oct  5 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || A frown on her face, and a dead look in her eyes. As in, no drive.* - Mon Oct  5 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe you should rest for a bit. - Mon Oct  5 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink in response to having her head put there. Eyes wander off. Her eyes suggest only suspicion. The same sour look.

"Nothing." she says. "That's the thing. I'm bored."* - Mon Oct  5 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Mon Oct  5 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Missions maybe. - Mon Oct  5 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not the lame missions they give to fodder. Real missions. War. - Mon Oct  5 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit. I miss war. - Mon Oct  5 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo put bloodlust in me. It's still there. - Mon Oct  5 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's all I ever think about. - Mon Oct  5 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Whenever someone says something stupid...or immature...or whiney. - Mon Oct  5 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want to see their guts. - Mon Oct  5 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not that I judge people. I just want it. - Mon Oct  5 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression has relaxed by now. Eyes wander a bit awkwardly, due to being where she is.* - Mon Oct  5 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be thinking about what jutsus to give you. - Mon Oct  5 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh. - Mon Oct  5 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I have another gift for you. - Mon Oct  5 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances up at him, lifting an eyebrow.

"Yeah?"* - Mon Oct  5 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyeborws both rise. Seven hundred thousand yen for a kiss?

She blushes.* - Mon Oct  5 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's yours whether you do it or not. - Mon Oct  5 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself up to where she's sitting up straight. Arms cross, and she eyes the money.

A silent sigh passes through her nose.

"Ya know..." she says, staring.

"If I keep taking gifts like this I'm not gonna have any pride left."* - Mon Oct  5 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Okay." she eventually says with a nod. The girl takes his money and holds it in her lap, even as memories of Orakuru handing her expensive gauntlets two days before she betrayed him horribly flood her mind.

Eye contact is then made.

"You are single though, right?" she inquires.* - Mon Oct  5 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her eyes wander back down to the money. She stares for a long moment.
Her expression remains blank. Dull.

After this long pause, she hands it back, gently setting it in his lap. Hands find the couch, and she gently pulls herself off of him. Arms meet behind her back, and she takes a step or two backwards.

The girl stares, maintaining eye contact.

"Then why...was I in your lap?" she inquires.* - Mon Oct  5 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ignores him outright.

"Why is there a seal in my mouth?" she asks.* - Mon Oct  5 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. It takes a liar to know a liar. 

She nods.

The girl then turns and makes her way to the other half of the couch. A bit lazily she sets herself down. Arms cross, and one leg crosses over the other.

"I see." she says.* - Mon Oct  5 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. Eyes remain on the floor.* - Mon Oct  5 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I want you to know one thing, If there was one thing I meant throughout this entire time, It was that I considered you a friend. And as such, I will answer any questions you have truthfully, if you answer one of my own. - Mon Oct  5 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't have any questions. - Mon Oct  5 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can ask some though. - Mon Oct  5 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then I have one. - Mon Oct  5 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What is it? - Mon Oct  5 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If I said 'No', what would you have done? - Mon Oct  5 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes entirely.

Her response takes a long while.

"I dunno." she says. Eyes tremble a bit. War veteran or not, that hurts.

"You didn't."* - Mon Oct  5 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) uncrosses her arms, shaking her head. The girl's left arm reaches over, and her hand clenches into a fist.

She presses it to the side of his head, lazily.* - Mon Oct  5 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at him. She's composed once more. As she averts her eyes, she's bending her arm at the elbow once more, taking her fist back.

Both arms then cross.

"That fist has the power to knock out Kilm. He's a very....very durable man." she says.

"If I'd wanted to kill you, you'd have died before you could even realize you were dead. Would've got away with it to."

"So. . .you don't need to watch your back, and now you know it."* - Mon Oct  5 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: I'm going to kill this bastard... - Mon Oct  5 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: He's made me so mad. - Mon Oct  5 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. She's quiet for a very long time.* - Mon Oct  5 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the glass. There's a brief moment of hesitation. Eventually though, she reaches out to take it. Her left arm falls to her lap.

Eyes are averted when she reaches up to sip at it. She drinks it like it's nothing more than water, knowing full well what her tolerence is.* - Mon Oct  5 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She takes the glass away from her mouth and holds it over her lap.* - Mon Oct  5 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't even bat an eye lash. Eyes wander further off.

"...Why?" she inquires.* - Mon Oct  5 01:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hate being told what to do too. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . .Or used. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It doesn't suit you. - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) emphasizes "used" just a teeny, tiny bit.* - Mon Oct  5 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I won't order you around, unless you say you want me to, I won't order around my equal. - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll....admit. - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But I'm curious. - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: -omit - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm? - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I feel like....that's a bad way to go about things. See.... - Mon Oct  5 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus...me. Especially me. If...he hadn't been playing backseat hokage.... - Mon Oct  5 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tilts her head a bit. A shrug follows. "Know what?" she says.

"Completely different situation. Forget I said anything."

She reaches up to lazily pour more sake into her mouth.* - Mon Oct  5 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You know. - Mon Oct  5 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: The first thing I said to you was. - Mon Oct  5 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I want you to get to the point when you say what's on your mind with no reserve. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then I'll have to speak hypothetically, to get to the point. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's fine. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because it really is a different situation. I was gonna betray him at some point. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: His goals involved dethroning me at some point. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So, I was gonna betray. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But, hypothetically speaking...if that hadn't been the case. - Mon Oct  5 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Things would've gone very smoothly...especially with my plans....if.... - Mon Oct  5 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus hadn't been playing backseat Hokage. I feel like things just work better with one single leader. In this case, you. - Mon Oct  5 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So you're saying...You believe I should lead? - Mon Oct  5 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. Make sure you keep your head...make sure you stay humble at all times....humility makes you wise. - Mon Oct  5 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But...'lead'. - Mon Oct  5 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -If- you want to succeed that is. - Mon Oct  5 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Mon Oct  5 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But promise me one thing. - Mon Oct  5 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow at him, making eye contact for the moment.* - Mon Oct  5 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If I lose my way, be prepared to push me back onto the right path. - Mon Oct  5 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I am a half blind man, I can only see one of two paths., - Mon Oct  5 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If there's a fork in the road, I need you to be my other eye. - Mon Oct  5 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll do my best. I do suggest a council. Not a council with authority especially not one of those but...a council. People to give you advice. - Mon Oct  5 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A one-person council? Two people? Seven? Doesn't matter. - Mon Oct  5 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But....hearing advice is always a good idea. - Mon Oct  5 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And councils work best when you tell them all of your plans. - Mon Oct  5 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Pretty sure that's the only way they 'can' work. - Mon Oct  5 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't out of character. She's using common sense.* - Mon Oct  5 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow.* - Mon Oct  5 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually stands, though, with a shrug.

Eyes wander off and she drinks more sake.* - Mon Oct  5 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, being careful to move her sake glass.

Eyes wander, and she silently takes a breath through the nose.

Her left hand rests on her own up, and she makes no move to hug him back. She simply waits for him to finish.

Her expression remains fairly blank.

She nods, though.* - Mon Oct  5 02:04:35 2015
