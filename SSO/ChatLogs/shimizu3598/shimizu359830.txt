<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to crack her knuckles. A faint, cheeky smile is produced in response to Cypher's comments. For the most part though, she ignores him -- for now. Afterwords, she forms the tiger seal. Immediately afterwords in one quick, smooth motion she kneels down. 

Palms slap against the earth. Abruptly, Kat's sucked up underneath the earth. The teen streams through the ground at a very fast pace. If one could see her right now she'd be a blur. When Kat stops moving, she's beneath a cactus.

Immediately she reaches up to take hold of the plant from all sides of the base. Roughly and with gusto, she then yanks it down into the ground, leaving only the top of it above-ground. Kat's gauntlets protect her hands. With the target now "trapped," Kat reaches up to pull herself out of the ground. Immediately a food slides backwards, and Kat prepares an open palm.

A sharp breath is taken. The girl concentrates her senses and whatnot on her chakra circuits. She needs to launch her jutsu the very second they stop going wild. The very second she can force herself to concentrate enough to once more use a jutsu. Eventually, that time comes.

Kat's in a tiny bit of pain due to her haste, but she shoves explosion release chakra into her palm. Immediately she then throws the arm forwards. Her palm meets the cactus. Immediately a very loud, gunshot-like bang is produced. The catcus gains a hole in it, and its "guts" spray all over the place. Shortly afterwords, said head slowly topples down to the ground.* - Sat Oct 10 00:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Hours pass. Eventually Kat finishes her training. She's actually sweating just a bit when she makes her way over to Cypher.

With a sigh the girl sits down. Legs are left stretched out ahead of her and palms meet the dirt at either side of Kat's form. Eyes are to the south.* - Sat Oct 10 00:59:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. "Yes. . ." she says, making no moves to show him. After all, she's wearing a body suit. It's one piece.

"One on my palm. . ."

"And one on my waist."* - Sat Oct 10 01:20:38 2015

What she actually does, though, is show him her palm. Gently she pushes the hand away as she makes eye contact. The teen shakes her head.

"Big decisions shouldn't be made lightly." she says.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They don't think like shinobi. Shinobi calculate everything...plan things out. - Sat Oct 10 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Immortality teaches someone to not do that. That they don't have to because they're supposedly unstoppable. - Sat Oct 10 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because of that they can't relate to the rest of the shinobi in the world at all. - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So trying to enforce their will on shinobi...or lead them.... - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's not acceptable. - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sat Oct 10 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: I'll catch up with you in a bit. - Sat Oct 10 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Nobody wants free food. - Sat Oct 10 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oi, wanna go out to eat?  - Sat Oct 10 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Free food. - Sat Oct 10 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head to look towards Susumu's general direction. The girl's lifting an eyebrow during the motion.

Eyes wander and a shrug follows.

"Sure." she says.

With that, the teen turns to follow.* - Sat Oct 10 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a seat accross from the boy. Palms find the bench(presumably) as she sits down and legs swing back and forth. She's still a bit on the short side.

Eyes wander. Said eyes suggest a good mood.* - Sat Oct 10 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) unfortunately doesn't realize this restaraunt belongs to the boy she's having dinner with.

Eye contact is made. "I'm Katsune." she says before looking away.

"And I guess I am happy."* - Sat Oct 10 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The teen takes some time to look through the menu, a bit lazily. She takes her time.

Eventually though she decides on something. "Unagi sounds doable." she says, gently tapping at the displayed picture or description with her finger.* - Sat Oct 10 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms are both resting on the table when she's questioned. At this time one leg crosses over the other, and palms find the bench once more.

"Not bad. . ." she says, making eye contact.

"With the high alert stuff done with, more people are coming in. Friends are allowed to see me. So, not bad."* - Sat Oct 10 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander for a long while in response to Susumu's first comment. Eventually though she says, with a glance over at him, "Well. . ."

"Long walks on corpse-filled beaches have gotta be in the top ten somewhere. Especially when I've put them there myself."* - Sat Oct 10 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit. Haven't had much time to relax in ages. - Sat Oct 10 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'This' is nice....? - Sat Oct 10 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Back when I was a slave under an immortal tentacle monster tyrant.... - Sat Oct 10 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I grew attached to dice games and drinking games too? - Sat Oct 10 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm...Interesting. - Sat Oct 10 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There's not much of the world I've seen outside of Zetsumo Konoha and Amegakure. - Sat Oct 10 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I've been stuck within sunagakure my whole life. - Sat Oct 10 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: How about you show me some dice games sometime? - Sat Oct 10 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sat Oct 10 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can do that maybe, yeah. - Sat Oct 10 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this with only the faintest, most subtle hint of a smile on her face, and a nod. The teen picks up her chop sticks. Presumably her meal has already been cut up for her. If not, she picks up the nearest knife and begins gently and lazily cutting into it.

It's eel, so.

And eventually she's gently stuffing her face.* - Sat Oct 10 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good, so far. No hints at poison yet. - Sat Oct 10 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Heh. - Sat Oct 10 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is looking Susumi in the eyes as she plants more of the fish in her mouth and chews it up. Her expression suggests she's at least half-joking.* - Sat Oct 10 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) finishes her food eventually......?

She notes, definitely, that Susumu had seemingly rushed.* - Sat Oct 10 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts her chop sticks down halfway through her meal.

The former Hokage places both elbows on the table then. Hands meet, and she rests her chin on them. Snake-like but good-humored eyes stare over at Susumu.

They're the eyes of a predator. Someone that thoroughly enjoys killing and toying with people.

"It was good." she says.* - Sat Oct 10 04:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) directs her senses at him, still staring. She notes the position of the hand underneath the table. The specifics, which she's capable of when focusing.

"Guess I'll have to consider coming here more often then." she says.* - Sat Oct 10 04:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Sat Oct 10 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should we go. . .? - Sat Oct 10 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, sure. - Sat Oct 10 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Do you wanna go somewhere else? - Sat Oct 10 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can. - Sat Oct 10 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you want to. - Sat Oct 10 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I wouldn't mind. - Sat Oct 10 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: How about you go teach me some of those dice games? - Sat Oct 10 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not something....I typically play with strangers. - Sat Oct 10 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh well uh.. - Sat Oct 10 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm not really a stranger anymore.. - Sat Oct 10 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Still.... - Sat Oct 10 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well then uhm.. - Sat Oct 10 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: What would you like to do? - Sat Oct 10 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I...guess, we can try dice games or something. I have nothing better to do. - Sat Oct 10 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alight. - Sat Oct 10 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Would you like to go somewhere else for it? - Sat Oct 10 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or is it fine here? - Sat Oct 10 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This place would work. - Sat Oct 10 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit I never really...learned, the games. - Sat Oct 10 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know...... - Sat Oct 10 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A man's out to kill me right now. - Sat Oct 10 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Boy, really. Boy named Hideki. - Sat Oct 10 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm? - Sat Oct 10 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny. A friend of mine was an idiot once and was very rude to him while he was treating us to a game. - Sat Oct 10 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder...if he'd not be after my head if my friend hadn't been rude. - Sat Oct 10 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Perhaps. - Sat Oct 10 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: How will you deal with this hideki? - Sat Oct 10 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I won't. - Sat Oct 10 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: What if he comes to kill you? - Sat Oct 10 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm the former Hokage. I'm a jounin-tier shinobi. - Sat Oct 10 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mm? - Sat Oct 10 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not afraid of him. - Sat Oct 10 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I see. - Sat Oct 10 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Makes sense. - Sat Oct 10 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Judging by the fact he hasn't come for me yet. . . - Sat Oct 10 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's either afraid of me which he should be, or he gave up. - Sat Oct 10 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's been ages since I first found out about it. - Sat Oct 10 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Probably gave up. - Sat Oct 10 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: If it's been that long. - Sat Oct 10 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 10 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or died. - Sat Oct 10 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hope not. Never thought to kill 'im. - Sat Oct 10 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: New friends are more valuable than dead enemies. - Sat Oct 10 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted to kill me over a misunderstanding anyway. - Sat Oct 10 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Main reason I haven't gone after him I guess. - Sat Oct 10 04:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..A simple misunderstanding? Something like that should be resolved..And I do like the way you think, I to would say new friends are much more valuable then dead enemies. - Sat Oct 10 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thought about resolving it. Sending a letter came to mind but. . . - Sat Oct 10 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I did that I wouldn't be able to see his reaction. Wouldn't be able to be sure he was telling the truth if he said he's over it. - Sat Oct 10 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Going all the way to Kumogakure where he's surrounded by allies wouldn't be a great idea either. - Sat Oct 10 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..I guess not. - Sat Oct 10 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I've been waiting for him to come to me. - Sat Oct 10 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hoped it'd be soon. Expected it to be. - Sat Oct 10 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: It'll happen one day probably. - Sat Oct 10 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: So, you don't really know the dice game? - Sat Oct 10 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not really. . . - Sat Oct 10 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure I'm willing to gamble either. I never win even as much as I play, so I'd rather hold onto my money. - Sat Oct 10 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lost six-hundred thousand to Zetsumo once in a single day. - Sat Oct 10 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Damn. - Sat Oct 10 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't even have ten thousand on me. - Sat Oct 10 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well, anything else you'd like to do? - Sat Oct 10 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing comes to mind really. - Sat Oct 10 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You any good in a fight? - Sat Oct 10 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't have really any skills..But I can try. - Sat Oct 10 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good sparring partners are always nice. - Sat Oct 10 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Probably best we don't then. - Sat Oct 10 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Sat Oct 10 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Maybe some other time. - Sat Oct 10 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm. - Sat Oct 10 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Anything else on your mind? - Sat Oct 10 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not really. Wish I could get missions but....haven't been willing to ask. - Sat Oct 10 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I was on a mission to kill a giant scorpion. - Sat Oct 10 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: It was boring. - Sat Oct 10 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds like it. - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: C rank? - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: C rank? - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yep. - Sat Oct 10 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: It was me, and a few others. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Trilliam and uh.. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Two others. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was Bryson in your squad? - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't think so.. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Maybe. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The man with the bible. The medic. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nope. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I miss being Hokage. Someone sent that medic home. Told him he'd only get in the way. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: A bible? - Sat Oct 10 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not my place to speak to the squad though. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- And yes. A bible. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I see. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: A religious man. - Sat Oct 10 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well, uhm - Sat Oct 10 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Sat Oct 10 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I should go sleep. - Sat Oct 10 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, yea. - Sat Oct 10 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: I guess it is getting late. - Sat Oct 10 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. With that she stands up, leaving Susumu to pay for the food. "It was nice meeting you." she says before turning to walk away.* - Sat Oct 10 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Shouldn't. - Sat Oct 10 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Wouldn't want him to know where my house is hidden. I should really buy a normal house. - Sat Oct 10 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Got some errands to run on the way home. Short errands. - Sat Oct 10 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Ah, well alright. - Sat Oct 10 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She then turns once more to wander off.* - Sat Oct 10 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. Good night. - Sat Oct 10 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Yo Kat, We need to talk for a bit. - Sat Oct 10 14:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hm...? - Sat Oct 10 14:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides her right foot backwards through the sand and lifts both arms. Hands are clenched partially as if to mimic claws, and her eyes are locked onto her sparring partner. Senses are locked onto him.

"Before we begin. . ." she says.

"Are you durable?"* - Sat Oct 10 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't chest puff with me. I don't care if you can win without being durable. - Sat Oct 10 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want to know...if you're durable. - Sat Oct 10 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Briefly she looks him up and down, acknowledging that it'll be dangerous to use anything overly powerful against him.

"Alright." she says.

With that, the girl races forth. She sprints, moving as a blur.

The teen would go all the way to point blank range if not stopped, with eyes watching his feet and hands as she draws near.

She'd come skidding to said stop, and throw her right arm out as she does so with the palm laid flat.

Said palm would meet his chest. A very powerful bang is then sounded off as Kat releases explosion release chakra from the hand.

It's not meant to damage people so he shouldn't die. He will, however, undoubtedly be knocked back if he's hit, by at least a little bit. It'll also hurt, a lot.* - Sat Oct 10 17:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Zenaki. - Sat Oct 10 17:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yo, yo. Yan. Today, I wanna finally get started if ya don't mind. - Sat Oct 10 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Still trying to learn doton? - Sat Oct 10 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Are you trying to learn techniques or the basic formula to utilizing earth release? - Sat Oct 10 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands move as Susumi flees. They meet to form the tiger seal. With that, Kat disappears in a puff of smoke. She flickers out of sight even within the smoke, moving twice as fast as before and becoming basically invisible for the brief moment.

The teen approaches her sparring partner then at this pace. As she comes to a stop she attempts to sweep a leg underneath his feet, to trip him. She does this without any pause or delay whatsoever.* - Sat Oct 10 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I know the basics of Doton. And I learned a D-ranked technique plus Hiding like a Mole. - Sat Oct 10 17:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I see. - Sat Oct 10 17:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hm....Are you a weapon's user at all? - Sat Oct 10 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: No idea what that means. - Sat Oct 10 17:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Do you use ranged projectiles much? - Sat Oct 10 17:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Let's move out of here and somewhere else. - Sat Oct 10 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands part very briefly before meeting again in the same seal. Abruptly, Kat's body releases a very powerful aura of lightning. Normally this jutsus is useless due to how weak it is.

However, with Kat's ninjutsu prowess dictating that most of her jutsu could kill Susumu instantly and without effort...this parlor trick becomes a fun toy.


Undoubtedly, Susumu is shocked to his core. He'd be stunned, briefly.

Kat stares down at him, smiling faintly in a cheeky manner like the sadist she is.* - Sat Oct 10 17:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: what jutsu - Sat Oct 10 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You went too far Katsune. - Sat Oct 10 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We should spar. - Sat Oct 10 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And not hold back. - Sat Oct 10 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: M-mm.... - Sat Oct 10 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah, alright. I'll admit, that was wrong. - Sat Oct 10 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm sorry. - Sat Oct 10 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's smile fades into an apologetic one for the moment. Her left palm rests on her hip and with the right hand, she rubs the back of her head.* - Sat Oct 10 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And yeah I guess we could Kilm. . . - Sat Oct 10 18:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. . . - Sat Oct 10 18:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face Kilm.

"Anyway, you're next?" she asks.

The girl wanders over to where she's accross from him and stands with arms at her sides.* - Sat Oct 10 18:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mm.. - Sat Oct 10 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, eyeing him. "Keep showing off that technique and other people will figure out how to develop it. But. . .it is your choice."

With that, Kat begins racing towards him. She moves once more as a blur.

Should she draw near, Kat attempts to simply, roughly, swing her arm towards him with the hand clenched into a fist, mid-sprint.

'Should' this fist ever reach Kilm, Kat shoves explosion release chakra into it. The landmine fist is triggered.* - Sat Oct 10 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: They can have fun with that. - Sat Oct 10 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: mm.... - Sat Oct 10 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's mouth falls very slightly agape. To anyone other than Paine and Kilm, Kat simply appears to come to a stop, abruptly. She sways to and fro a bit, as if having trouble maintaining her balance. The girl ultimately though is left standing straight up.

Eyes are out of focus, as if she's in a trance.

Within the genjutsu, Kat's abruptly stopped by Kilm's roots. Eyes dart to and fro. With a scoff, the teen attempts to pull herself away. A subtle scowl is on her face.

"Tree branches...?" she spits out. The girl attempts to pull herself to and fro, wriggling and squirming.  She had genuinely not thought about Kilm using genjutsu so she's successfully caught. She should have suspected it, but he's never actually used it against her so she hadn't kept it in mind.

Should Kat's arms be free she, within the illusion, attempts to bring her hands together. Should they meet she forms the tiger seal and attempts to form the Raiton Flash jutsu to shake off the roots. She'd be engulfed in an aura of lightning.* - Sat Oct 10 18:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Of course, she can't actually use the jutsu right now presumably. Presumably, she'd only think she can....?* - Sat Oct 10 18:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) attempts to abruptly use the kai jutsu the second Kilm mentions genjutsu. She does so without handseals. Eyes dart over to him.

A subtle, sour expression is on her face. Lips are stretched into a faint frown.

She's salty.* - Sat Oct 10 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs through the nose. Abruptly she sprints off after Kilm. Hands meet to form the tiger seal. Chakra is shoved throughout her body as she's engulfed by smoke. And while hidden behind this smoke Kat, at a lightning-fast pace, crouches down.

With that, she then leaps after him. Kat goes at her full speed through the air because of how fast her legs moved to get her into the air in her fist place. Moving as a blur to Kilm's eyes, Kat aims to put herself into point-blank range.

He simply doesn't have the reflexes to react before she's at least half as far away either. And by the time she's that close, would he be fast enough to evade her? Probably not.

Once in close range, Kat would reach out with her legs and left arm to catch Kilm in a bear hug. Her right fist would then fly forwards to ram into his gut. She'd then hold it there as they presumably 'both' fly around.* - Sat Oct 10 18:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: glasgow smile* - Sat Oct 10 18:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: I pray that she can fix this, or my shinobi career is over. - Sat Oct 10 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || It takes time for Kilm to throw Kat off. Kat, however, can't transition from jutsu to jutsu instantly so Kilm has said time. In this time, Kat's successfully pulled free. However before she travels too far, Kat shoves her fist forwards. By the time she's six feet or so away, Kat's channeling explosion release chakra into her fist.

The landmine fist jutsu is triggered through her chakra flow gauntlets. As a result, the trademark beam of landmine fist is sent racing forwards quite quickly.

It's very, very big. From this range, would he be able to evade it?* - Sat Oct 10 18:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) crashes into the sand. The girl is tossed to and fro. For a moment, she skids accross the sands. Kilm's strength combined with the second impact that happens when she hits the ground...renders her barely able to even move or breath.

She's left on her belly. A muffled breath is taken past the sand at Kat's mouth. Her body trembles, and eyes are closed. The girl is wearing a scowl, though her face is hidden.

She struggles to move her arms.

Kilm with all of his new jutsus and genjutsu prowess....has finally managed to surpass Kat by a ginormous amount.* - Sat Oct 10 18:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I.. don't care what the price is... I don't care how deep in debt I'll be for asking this favor of you. I'm desperate to continue my career as a shinobi. - Sat Oct 10 18:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Some help please? - Sat Oct 10 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly picks herself up with another sigh as she catches her breath. She's left sitting down with legs sprawled out underneath her form. Her limbs continue trembling.

Eyes are downcast.

"That..." she says.

"Is a nasty jutsu."* - Sat Oct 10 18:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances up at Zenaki. Eyes wander off.

She says nothing to Dr. Frankenstein.* - Sat Oct 10 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: If they argue about who has bigger boobs again . . . I'm knocking both of them out. - Sat Oct 10 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Sat Oct 10 18:57:04 2015
