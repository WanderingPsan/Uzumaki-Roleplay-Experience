She averts her eyes afterwords though, not willing to let Zetsumo see that look on her face. Peering up like that...could be mistaken for something cute. Abruptly she turns on her heel to face the west, with hand still on her head.

Kat's left leg stretches out to the side and she steps off in that direction, to escape his petting. A breath is released through her nose. "...Yeah. Thanks." she says with little enthusiasm.* - Tue Sep 15 19:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I meant that how good their plans are and not if they're charismatic. If they make up plans that get people killed then they shouldn't ever be picked as squad leaders. - Wed Sep 16 08:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Unless it's a suicide mission with or without plans. - Wed Sep 16 08:19:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Work our way up in the Gezo. And then, Zetsumo would be proud of us. Maybe more trusting. - Wed Sep 16 08:25:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Wed Sep 16 10:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You probably wouldn't wanna spar if I'm holding back, would you? - Wed Sep 16 10:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Why do you want to hold back against me? - Wed Sep 16 10:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd only be using techniques I'm inexperienced with. - Wed Sep 16 10:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To improve them. - Wed Sep 16 10:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not doing that would make the sparring pointless. - Wed Sep 16 10:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It'll be less repetitive than using them while standing around. - Wed Sep 16 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Just....heh. Hold back a bit maybe? I dunno. Just don't kill me. - Wed Sep 16 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your jutsus are too strong if I'm holding back. - Wed Sep 16 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: One hit and I'm done. - Wed Sep 16 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Wed Sep 16 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 16 10:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and rises to her feet. She then turns to face Kilm. "West of here?" she asks.

"I'd rather not run into anymore unwelcome guests like before."* - Wed Sep 16 10:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sure. - Wed Sep 16 10:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and then turns to lead the way out.* - Wed Sep 16 10:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs silently as she slides her right foot backwards through the grass, planting her feet. Arms rise and hands clench partially as if to form claws. The girl does have little enthusiasm for this, but only because it's training.

She'd need to avoid using -any- techniques at all that she's mastered.* - Wed Sep 16 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. With that, the girl sprints forwards, abruptly. Arms fly backwards at her sides and eyes remain locked on Kilm even as she goes to the southwest. She intends to get into relatively close range.* - Wed Sep 16 10:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins following Kilm, turning in place to do so and chasing even as he flees. She stays within a thirty-degree radious. The beautiful truth is, he can't out-run her. He's staying within range whether he likes it or not, unless he chooses to fend her off with ninjutsu.

She doesn't stop for even a moment.* - Wed Sep 16 10:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't waste stamina. As if. She doesn't need to follow him anymore, and he doesn't gain even a tiny bit of ground for even a single second. Kat has him where she wants him and quite frankly, she's annoyed he has the audacity to even try this against someone who's so much faster than he is. It does nothing but waste time. But she'd punish him for it...right now.

Kat easily and without effort gains twenty more feet, 'while' forming the tiger handseal. It's just one seal, so it happens very quickly -- quickly enough that most would be unable to think much on it at all. Abruptly, Kat kneels down as her feet come skidding to a stop. Palms slam into the ground. Immediately, earth begins rising from all sides. It starts just a few feet in front of her, and then spreads out. 

Even so, the range is so very large...undoubtedly, Kilm can't avoid getting trapped. He'd have to run along the walls or break through to escape, and she's aware he's not fast enough for the former. Should Kilm not escape, he's encased in a very sturdy dome. It'd seal itself up immediately. Hidden mole and subterranean voyage will not work, presmably.

This technique has Kat's own chakra in it. It's not normal earth.* - Wed Sep 16 10:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her arms up as she hears lightning, and waits for Kilm to break through. After a moment of contemplation, Kat rises to her feet entirely. Arms cross, and she peers up at him a bit blankly. A shrug follows.

"I dunno." she says,

"Honestly, I don't see myself getting much out of this after all."* - Wed Sep 16 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Want me to start using jutsu? - Wed Sep 16 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No...it's just. - Wed Sep 16 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There's no point practicing if my walls can't block your lightning no matter what. - Wed Sep 16 10:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: To be honest. - Wed Sep 16 10:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think it'd work on anyone else. - Wed Sep 16 10:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course. - Wed Sep 16 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Point is, this training isn't working. - Wed Sep 16 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 16 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not sure if you need to train against someone who'd have a harder time. - Wed Sep 16 10:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I would, though. - Wed Sep 16 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The point isn't to train myself. I'm not stupid enough to use Earthen Corridor on you in a real fight. Obviously I already know you have lightning release. - Wed Sep 16 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd never use it against someone with lightning. - Wed Sep 16 10:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The point is to train the technique itself. - Wed Sep 16 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Wed Sep 16 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . It's not like the walls have muscle memory or anything like that. - Wed Sep 16 10:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What? - Wed Sep 16 10:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What are you getting at? - Wed Sep 16 10:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not sure if they would get stronger just from being hit by things that destroy them. - Wed Sep 16 10:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's dependant on your capabilities. - Wed Sep 16 10:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You will notice ways to save chakra from just using it though. - Wed Sep 16 10:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hate training jutsus. . . - Wed Sep 16 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What now? - Wed Sep 16 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Wed Sep 16 11:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's go back to town. - Wed Sep 16 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) walks away.* - Wed Sep 16 11:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Morning. - Wed Sep 16 11:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Morning. - Wed Sep 16 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 16 11:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hi. - Wed Sep 16 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Wed Sep 16 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Kilm, you may want to talk to Zetsumo on Katsune's behalf, she may or may not get in trouble for what happened earlier. I would speak to Zetsumo myself but I know he is disturbed by my presence - at least to a degree. - Wed Sep 16 11:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm....? - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He means about the middle finger. - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why would I get in trouble? - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. - Wed Sep 16 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The villages have not submitted, and it is likely they will not. - Wed Sep 16 11:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure how to feel about this war. - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: The loss of life will be great. - Wed Sep 16 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This is definitely going to be named something major. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure I mind that. There should be consequences for what these villages are doing. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Attacking Zetsumo for daring to retrieve his missing nin, after he gave Sunagakure a fair warning? - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know for a fact . . . If it comes down to it . . . Ushinawa will enjoy fighting against Kumogakure the most. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There's gotta be more to it than that. I feel like that's a front. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Indeed, Kilm. - Wed Sep 16 11:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You have to realize. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We both know what happened there . . . Though i'll say nothing about that anymore. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Zetsumo is a figure. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: People fear him.. They respect him, or they hate him. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have more reason to hate Zetsumo than any of these villages combined. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Their motives are self-righteous, I think. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm looking forward to the slaughter. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not saying Zetsumo's okay or anything -- only that my conscience will be clear. - Wed Sep 16 11:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ushinawa. - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Zetsumo is a harbinger of chaos, if that is what is needed to bring Kirigakure to their knees.. So be it. - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 16 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If we have to fight Niza . . . Give me a second to ask him a question before you go off and try to kill him. - Wed Sep 16 11:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: At this point . . . I kinda see that fight coming. - Wed Sep 16 11:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hasn't stopped walking.* - Wed Sep 16 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: Im still gonna . . . - Wed Sep 16 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're going all out? - Wed Sep 16 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right leg slowly slides backwards through the grass as she plants her feet. Arms rise, and hands clench partially as if to represent claws. Eyes lock into Kilm's feet, of all places. Not his eyes. Not his hands. Not his chest. But his feet.

The girl nods in response to his question. "Yeah." she says. "Pretty much. . ."
She chooses not to elaborate.* - Wed Sep 16 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her eyes from this point onwards remain on Kilm's feet at all times when she's eying him unless otherwise explicitely stated. Lazily, she kneels down to the ground. Palms meet the earth, and chakra is channeled through it. Naturally this happens very quickly.

Should Kilm not move, he'd soon find the ground shaking for only the briefest of moments as spikes ram their way through the earth from all sides. Big, thick, sharp spikes. There are four of them in all, as usual. Should Kilm move, Kat just bids her chakra to follow him. There will be no evading this jutsu until the spikes have left the earth, even if Kilm knows what's coming. She's sure of that.

This is quickly becoming her favorite jutsu.* - Wed Sep 16 13:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smirks fairly brightly in response to Kilm's pain. She absolutely refuses to look up at him and assess the damage, though. Eyes remain locked on the feet. Presumably it takes ages for Kilm to prepare her jutsu, in Kat's eyes with her reflexes. When he's spitting water, Kat simply stares. 

She's confident, due to her speed, so she doesn't move yet. He's so far away. It's not until after he begins moving that she does. She's a bit slow to react, but he's still fourty feet or so away by the time she's begun moving. Hands meet as she rises to her feet.

The tiger seal is formed, and Kat leans forwards, facing the southwest. Chakra is poured throughout her body, and she darts in that direction as quickly as she can. Presumably, turning his wave around will take Kilm a 'tremendous' amount of time. It doesn't matter how good his chakra control is. It'll take a long longer than just redirecting a smaller jutsu might. 

Either way, Kat would move as a blur, even to Kilm's eyes. Even for his reflexes, he'd undoubtedly be slow to react. Before he's had time to even come up with any plan whatsoever, Kat would be at the other hand of the wave -- a great distance away even from where Kilm had started out at. The girl produces a choking cough then as she falls onto a knee. 

Her right palm finds her gut and she takes a moment to compose herself. Her face turns a bit yellow. Kat needs some time to breath, and stop herself from being sick. Even so....Kilm's so far away, she's confident she'll be safe.* - Wed Sep 16 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is rising to her feet and turning on her heel even as Kilm approaches. The girl gives little thought to anything. Abruptly, she sprints to the northwest with arms trailing out behind her. Any jutsu he throws at her, she's confident she can out-run it. Either way, she has something planned.

After covering a certain distance, she intends to turn and sprint to the northeast. Often she glances back at Kilm's feet to determine where he is.* - Wed Sep 16 13:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches at the sight of the earth moving. Feet come skidding to a stop, and -very- briefly she takes a moment to assess the situation. Spikes...? No. Walls. She'd had to pause to take note of this. Otherwise, what if it had been spikes? She'd be impaled.

Kat sprints backwards. At the end of the motion, feet come skidding to a stop once more. They bend during this motion, and Kat's hands meet to form the tiger seal. Without any pause she performs the shunshin jutsu once more. Like a bullet fired from a gun she's launched through the air, straight through the opening above her.

Kilm can't see her right now due to earth being in the way, so he can't react to this fact. It's impossible. As such, she's no doubt flying outwards in no time as a blur before Kilm's eyes. Feet would come skidding to a stop some great distance away. She's turning to face him as she does so, and kneeling over once more. Notably, her feet are in the mud Kilm had formed before.

She's at the farthest end of it. And wow is it a lot of mud. She kneels over once more and resists the urge to throw up. Deep breaths are taken, and she's frowning.* - Wed Sep 16 14:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is laughing by the time Kilm catches up to her, inbetween coughs. Even as she coughs and catches her breath, still yellow in the face, she's forming handseals. The girl's swaying to and fro as she rises to her feet, with eyes on Kilm. Chakra is gathered around her body and sent to her feet, though this chakra isn't visible without senses. Out of the mud Kilm had created comes a dragon's head.

Its maw is open, and it's aimed at Kilm. Its muddy fangs drip down constantly, and its eyes suggest a smug expression. Mud balls are scooped up into its mouth even as it forms. And at this time...they all begin swarming forwards in absurd amounts. They cover the entire field, making it impossible for one as slow as Kilm to escape to the north even by way of shunshin, considering who's using the technique.

It's impossible to escape to the south as well. Perhaps nearly one-hundred bowling-ball-sized mudballs come forwards, all seeking to make this a very, very, very bad day for Kilm. A smug smirk is on Kat's face. It's diffcult to contain herself. She hadn't imagined getting to use this so soon.

Even if Kilm moves, the dragon's head simply turns to follow him. It keeps shooting.* - Wed Sep 16 14:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply forms the same handseals again as her dragon stops firing. Undoubtedly, Kilm is recovering at this time. Firing a jutsu of that magnitude immediately after being pummed to near death? Pleeease. Three handseals are weaved and chakra once more is sent into the mud.

Before Kilm even has time to fully prepare his jutsu -- before there's enough water to feasibly reach her under literally any circumstances -- Kilm would find himself assaulted by even more mudballs. The dragon head had formed once more. Once more, Kilm's being pummeled.

And the amount of effort required on Kat's part? Virtually none whatsoever. This uses twice as much chakra as Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot -- which is very, very, very little.

This time the shots are more concentrated on Kilm's exact location. He'll be forced to either dispell his water wave in the middle of preparation to dodge...or be pummeled literally to death.* - Wed Sep 16 14:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had actually forgot to eye Kilm's feet this entire time. They return there at this time, as her dragon dies down. "Oh." she says, forming more handseals even now.

"Forgot about that."

The girl has the audacity to form yet another dragon's head, and does so. Once more, a barrage of mud balls are flying towards Kilm. They spread wide once more. She wants to thoroughly beat him into submission. This'll teach him to use his wave technique when fighting her. The mud produced only makes her stronger.

Should he move, the head simply turns to keep following him. He can dodge if he manages to move in the opposite direction -- but the balls move faster than he does. He'd be forced to use shunshin, which is what Kat wants. In short, she's trolling him.* - Wed Sep 16 14:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I didn't know you had that jutsu. - Wed Sep 16 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Full of surprises. - Wed Sep 16 14:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lets her dragon pummel Kilm to unconsciousness. It keeps facing him and firing, never stopping.

He'd moved nigh-instantaneously and only for a very, very short range.

Thus, do you really think this dragon has stopped yet? The amount of time that has passed is basically one second or so.

Kilm is hopefully hit often in the nuts and in the head while vulnerable from Shunshin.* - Wed Sep 16 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) drops her handseal to allow her dragon to disipate at the sight of Kilm passing out. Her first win. It probably doesn't count since he decided to stop fighting, but she'll never admit that out loud. Then again, he probably should've kept his guard up. With a smug smile on her face she wanders over to his side and scoops him up.

She'd then carry him into town, intending to parade him around as her trophy. The trophy being not him, but the fact that he's unconscious and covered in mud.* - Wed Sep 16 14:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) roughly drops Kilm down on the dirt, from his place in her hands. Admittedly that's not a far fall since she's short. Afterwords the girl takes a moment to dust herself off, and wanders off to the side. She's planting her back to the wall and sitting down shortly afterwords.* - Wed Sep 16 14:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even more surprised by the jutsu. - Wed Sep 16 14:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What were you trying to accomplish during training by the way? - Wed Sep 16 14:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm...keeping my eyes on your feet. - Wed Sep 16 14:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Wed Sep 16 14:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No thanks. - Wed Sep 16 14:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's fine. If you don't want to, I can go alone. - Wed Sep 16 14:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 16 14:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll wait here. - Wed Sep 16 14:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet. The girl takes a moment to brush her butt off. Afterwords arms cross, and weight shifts a bit. She stares over at the back of Beth's head, blankly.

Presumably, Paine isn't in her line of sight at all. She's gotta be lying down even if she 'is' sleeping in the middle of nowhere.* - Wed Sep 16 15:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the hand. She can see very clearly even from this distance, with 'her' eyes.* - Wed Sep 16 15:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has no idea what's being said, though. Way too quiet for her ears, from this distance.* - Wed Sep 16 15:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Zenaki. - Wed Sep 16 15:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't be that harsh on her. - Wed Sep 16 15:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 15:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: And now I look pretentious by association. - Wed Sep 16 15:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You didn't go to zetsumo. - Wed Sep 16 15:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I wanted to. But he is busy, Beth. - Wed Sep 16 15:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I can't let him deal with my problems aswell.. Plus I can deal with it myself.. I warned you now.. - Wed Sep 16 15:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Zenaki, Don't go too far. - Wed Sep 16 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Shut up, Kilm. - Wed Sep 16 15:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm just saying. - Wed Sep 16 15:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Either way, You should know that she's still needed for interrogations. - Wed Sep 16 15:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) directs her eyes at Beth's head, of course. She knows all too well to be very careful where she sets her eyes.* - Wed Sep 16 15:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) raises her voice a bit, since she's far away. She could've sworn Beth removed her cloak, but it doesn't matter.

"Take the cloak off, Beth." she says, still eyeing her only blankly. She's not to heated, honestly. She wouldn't be willing to let Beth have her way with Zenaki, though.

She knows much, much more than you'd guess about the entire situation. More than Kilm; that's for sure.

"Or I'm attacking right now."* - Wed Sep 16 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If Kat's attacking you . . . Probably going to attack you too. - Wed Sep 16 15:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Why are they fighting again? - Wed Sep 16 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: And we will -never- be friends again, like we used to be. - Wed Sep 16 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You have ten seconds. - Wed Sep 16 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You can't even force me to do it. You can do even more horrible things to me. But that will only grow us more apart.  - Wed Sep 16 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Zenaki duel me please. - Wed Sep 16 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Fight will not solve this thing what had happend. - Wed Sep 16 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Kat. Don't attack her. - Wed Sep 16 15:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -sighs- Please Zenaki. - Wed Sep 16 15:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Why? - Wed Sep 16 15:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ignores the fuck out of Zenaki. This is personal now. Beth dared to ignore her warning and man, she doesn't like this chick anyway. Zenaki can have a rape fetish all she wants. Abruptly, the girl sprints forwards. She moves as a blur. If Beth doesn't have good reflexes, there's no doubt she'll not even have time to react.

If she doesn't have good eyes...honestly? She probably can't adequately track Kat's movement right now, whether she reacts or not. The girl moves to the southwest, with eyes locked onto the back of Beth's head -- for now. She intends to move them if Beth tries to so much as look at her. Kat, if allowed, intends to place herself twelve feet southwest of this woman.

The moment she's there, feet come skidding to a stop. She's facing the genjutsu user in the same motion, and arms come flying forwards. The heels of her palms meet, and loud crackling of lightning is heard as lightning streams forwards. It instantly forms a massive orb of the substance, and it's crying loudly as it races forwards. From this angle, the only person who might be hit other than Beth is Kilm, but Kat's aware he can dodge it if needed.

* - Wed Sep 16 15:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Man if Kilm gets involved I'm gonna fuck him up. - Wed Sep 16 15:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: They are tempting me.. - Wed Sep 16 16:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I will not fall for the bait. - Wed Sep 16 16:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes find grass near Beth's feet, and she does her best to track her without looking directly even at them. She keeps them in her peripheral vision. The girl turns and sprints forwards as Beth does, by only a very short distance before skidding to a stop. She intends to not let Beth gain even a tiny bit of distance from her.

Arms rise, and hands meet. However, only one seal is formed. The "boar" seal. She does nothing else for now, keeping her eyes right where they are.

"...I asked you to take off the cloak." she says.

"Don't try lying to a liar. I have literally no reason to throw punches."* - Wed Sep 16 16:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Sure is getting heated up. - Wed Sep 16 16:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Trying to duel Zetsumo's sister? Honestly, did you think this was a good idea in any way at all? - Wed Sep 16 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway, take off the cloak. - Wed Sep 16 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: They act like I attacked her.. Jeez annoying. - Wed Sep 16 16:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't take it off, and see what happens. I promise you, I won't miss again. - Wed Sep 16 16:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The lightning ball was a warning shot. - Wed Sep 16 16:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: I'd like to say I feel bad about what's happening... Sadly I do not. - Wed Sep 16 16:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Would've like to see the fight . . . Might not happen now though. - Wed Sep 16 16:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) never stopped in the first place? I mean, if Beth kept running. Or if she did, Kat resumes running. It makes no difference. Either way, Kat doesn't give Beth even an inch. Ever since being shamed by the genjutsu-using anbu agent, Kat's very skittish with genjutsu users. 

If she could organize a witch hunt, she would. Feet come skidding to a stop as Beth herself does. Eyes find Beth's hips. Slowly they move upwards, just enough to make out where the woman's hands are in her peripheral vision. Her hands keep holding the boar seal.

"Good." she says. "Now keep it off."

Eyes find the wall near Beth's feet again. She's well aware she likely won't need to look at her. If Beth were on Kat's level with ninjutsu or even taijutsu, Kat would be in trouble. As it is, though, she's confident. Beth can't be that fast, outside of genjutsu. Briefly she glances up at the sky.

If she sees feathers, she's gonna twitch.* - Wed Sep 16 16:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You got a problem with me having a cloak on? - Wed Sep 16 16:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Definitely staying out of this unless called. - Wed Sep 16 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands move, quickly. She forms four additional handseals. Once Kat's reached the fourth of all five, she sprints forwards. She finishes the last before reaching Beth, and abruptly her right arm lights up with electricity. It roars and crackles loudly, and sparks fly all over the place.

Now undoubtedly just barely within reach of Beth's punching or kicking range, Kat shoves her arm forwards. If and only if Beth isn't moving, Kat's feet had come skidding to a stop.

Lightning streams forwards. It's spread out as a very wide net, aimed to hit only Beth and no one else -- and Kat's aim is good, too. Kat's Electromagnetic Murder jutsu is set to stun; something she's very familiar with. It wouldn't kill, but if Beth is hit?

Undoubtedly, she'll be weakned so much she can barely move. The stream would keep tazing over and over again seemingly without any end planned. It's not like lightning ball. This is a technique that keeps shooting for a very long while, not too unlike Goukyaku in that manner.

Should Beth try to outrun her, Kat simply keeps sprinting while the jutsu fires. She's not gonna let her dodge this.* - Wed Sep 16 16:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is honestly caught off-guard by Suitengu's jutsu. The teen flinches, with only -maybe- a second's worth of her jutsu getting through. The girl's lightning disipates shortly afterwords, though, with her arm remaining cloaked for a long moment afterwords. Eyes find Suitengu's shadow, and she takes a moment to examine it with a subtle scowl on her face.

A very long moment. This...she'd never seen anything even remotely like it. Her heart beats on her chest very rapidly, and very hard. When Kat finally has figured out the gist of what's going on, she squirms. 

It'd take a moment, but with effort, and a quiet huff through the nose, Kat manages to rip herself free. Arms swing wildly at her sides for the very brief moment as her lightning fades away.

Briefly Kat glances over at Suitengo, before returning her eyes to the area near Beth's feet. An eyebrow twitches, and a bead of sweat slides down the side of her face. The woman's chest rises and falls quickly, and Kat takes a moment to silently catch her breath.

No words are spoken. She can't afford to give too much attention to Suitengo at the moment for an explanation.* - Wed Sep 16 17:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms slowly move to eventually rest behind her back. The girl turns to face Zetsumo with eyes on the ground. Her subtle scow remains so it's probably a bit difficult to make out the entirety of her emotions, but shame is apparent -- at least a bit of it.

This doesn't look good, whether she was in the right or not. That, and she can't explain the situation adequately without going further than she'd prefer with it.

The girl spends a moment to catch her breath before speaking.

"...I could've sworn Beth was using genjutsu." she says.
"Or trying to." She glances up at him, briefly making eye contact. "On your sister."* - Wed Sep 16 17:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Specifically, her right hand is wrapped around her left arm above the elbow. A submissive gesture, rather than an authoritive one.* - Wed Sep 16 17:31:31 2015
