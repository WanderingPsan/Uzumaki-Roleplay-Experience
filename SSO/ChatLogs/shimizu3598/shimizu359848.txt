<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She is shady. In Konoha she claimed she was just a humble bartender that can't fight. Asked me for a damned scroll. Now I find out she's a necromancer. - Sun Oct 25 19:51:15 2015

When it reappears it's at Index's feet. Suddenly it'd reach up and pull him underground.

The headhunter jutsu.* - Sun Oct 25 19:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) walks over to Index.

Once she reaches him, a foot is placed at the dirt encasing him. Said dirt softens up, and the boy would be set free.

Though, of course, he has Kat looming over him still.* - Sun Oct 25 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Kat, I've never asked anything from you before. So this one time, I need you to move away. - Sun Oct 25 20:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she'd take Index's right hand -- in a way that suggests a relationship rather than taking someone into custody -- and lead him away.

"Busy." Kat says to Angetsu.* - Sun Oct 25 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Ambassador for now I'd like you to say nothing more about Amegakure or this case to anyone but me and the Kazekage please. - Sun Oct 25 20:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm sorry, This is...All my fault. - Sun Oct 25 20:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I thought it was obvious so I never mentioned it. - Sun Oct 25 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But why would an Ambassador leave the Village? - Sun Oct 25 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Without permission from their Kage? - Sun Oct 25 20:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off.* - Mon Oct 26 06:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sends another shadowclone to Sunagakure after a good, long nap that replenished her chakra in full.

Katsune's said it before and she'll say it again. The shadowclone jutsu should be forbidden.* - Mon Oct 26 07:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo. - Mon Oct 26 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Mon Oct 26 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyone seen where Ikaro went? - Mon Oct 26 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No idea who that is. - Mon Oct 26 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna spar though? - Mon Oct 26 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Eh, Sure. - Mon Oct 26 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns on her heel and leads the way out of the village.* - Mon Oct 26 07:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face Kilm. Arms rest at her sides and fairly blankly, the girl stares ahead at him. Even so, something subtle about her eyes may suggest a good mood. Confidence. An unnatural amount of it.

"Feel free to go all out." Katsune says.

"This is a shadow clone."* - Mon Oct 26 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides her right foot backwards through the dirt. Both arms rise and her hands clench partially as if to mimic claws. Afterwords Kat forms the clone seal. She's consumed in smoke, and when it clears Kat has a clone on her back. With some handseals, it uses the henge jutsu to turn into a purple chuunin vest that Kat now wears.

"He's got me into a bit of trouble." Kat says.
"But he taught me this jutsu so I'm kind've thinking I forgive him. With the shadowclone jutsu, I just might be ready for Konoha."

Kat does nothing. She can't use another jutsu so quickly after using shadowclone, so she leaves herself open for Kilm.

"Remind me to teach you Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot when we're done training." she says.* - Mon Oct 26 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Also, Just sayin' . . . Ikaro is stronger than me in both ninjutsu. - Mon Oct 26 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think he's as strong as Ushinawa. - Mon Oct 26 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He wasn't Tethys's brother for nothin'. - Mon Oct 26 07:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and sprints to the west as she senses Kilm's chakra approaching. Kat doesn't intend to let this shadowclone die. It contains an awful lot of her chakra after all. She'd need a lot of sleep to recover that. "Maybe!" she shouts in response to his question as she flees.

Of course, his chakra for that jutsu can still follow her while she runs. He needs only to keep sending it after her. Even so, Kat knows full well it can't catch her. Having sensory abilities sure is amazing. Eventually, Kat's had time to prepare another jutsu. Her clone channels doton natured chakra into Kat as well as itself.

As a result, both now weigh nothing. And so, Kat flies. She hovers up into the air by ten feet, making it impossible for Kilm's spikes to reach her. "I don't intend to stay in the air all day because that'd be pretty lame. . ." Kat says, staring down at the dirt. "But I'm flying to remind you that that jutsu is useless against me."

Kat darts directly towards Kilm, intending to close the distance between them. She's weaving the tiger seal as she moves. Should Kat reaches him, she'll launch a mud sillhouette at him. She's only doing this though if she does manage to get within that range.* - Mon Oct 26 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the racoon with a nod as her feet hit the ground. And with that, Kat pulls her chuunin vest off. With a good-humored scoff that suggests laughter, she then throws her vest at Kilm. "Two versus two. Good." she says.

When the vest gets close to Kilm, its transformation ends with a puff of smoke. A clone of Kat comes out of it. Should Kilm have stayed put, he'd find the clone throwing a fist towards him. Should he move, its feet touch the ground. It sprints towards him with the fist stretched out.

Should this clone ever reach him, it'd come skidding to a stop and ram a fist into the earth. A landmine fist would be sent flying in Kilm's direction.

The main clone at the same time had began sprinting towards Kilm's raccoon. It weaves some handseals. Should it finish these seals, it's throwing an earth flash at the beast. The landmine fist is too dangerous and she doesn't want to kill it. Lightning, though, should be fine.* - Mon Oct 26 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The clone that's fighting Taiga is forced to end its earth flash jutsu. Abruptly it throws itself into the air. Doing a barrel roll, it attempts to evade every single senbon coming its way. Not speed, but reflexes. Whether or not it succeeds remains to be seen.

The clone fighting Kilm in the mean time would simply never get to use the landmine fist. It forms the tiger seal and flickers out of sight. It's forced to throw itself very far away, to the west. Its feet would come skidding to a stop some eighty feet away, and it's turning to face Kilm during the same motion.

It stares from there.* - Mon Oct 26 07:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head at the sight of the extra raccoon. The second clone is hit, and it's destroyed instantly. It disappears in a plume of white smoke, and its memories go to the real Katsune who's at the moment sipping lemonade at home like a boss.

The remaining clone stares blankly at the boxing-gloves-wearing racoon. She patiently awaits her death, doing nothing for now.

She has no chakra left.* - Mon Oct 26 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: At home. - Mon Oct 26 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should meet me there. - Mon Oct 26 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mind if I visit? - Mon Oct 26 07:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Oh alright. - Mon Oct 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I believe the real me just finished a nap. - Mon Oct 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Where is it again? - Mon Oct 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Northwest of Sunagakure. - Mon Oct 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Mon Oct 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords her palm meets her face. A loud bang is sounded off as the Exploding Palm is released. Instantly, the clone is destroyed. In a plume of white smoke, it disappears.* - Mon Oct 26 07:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) answers the door. One hand's resting on her hip at the moment, and she steps out of the way to let Kilm come in. Eyes are averted for the moment, absent-mindedly.* - Mon Oct 26 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The house is basically a bunker. Even the door is hidden by a few large boulders. Seisuke the Gezo prince paid an awful lot of money for this house. He'd given it to Katsune for free before his death. It's funny how Katsune's boyfriends are always saving her life after they're long dead.

Katsune nods and follows him into the house. Once they get to the living room she sits down. Boots are kicked iff as she turns and lies herself down on the couch with arms crossed. Of course, should Kilm attempt to sit down, she moves her legs -- only to rest them in his lap afterwords.* - Mon Oct 26 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That was a good spar. Even though I wasn't there I learned a lot from it. - Mon Oct 26 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You learned from it? - Mon Oct 26 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. This jutsu's not like the earth clone. - Mon Oct 26 07:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The memories all go back to the real person. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's pretty sweet. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The clones are all conscious too. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's very...very strong. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm twice as strong as I used to be easily. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: All because of this jutsu. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're probably the same because of your summons. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could tell, they're very capable. - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do you think you're ready for Konohagakure? - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. . . - Mon Oct 26 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well. - Mon Oct 26 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Like I said, If you sign the scroll, Me, You and Ikaro will go train with the Raccoons. - Mon Oct 26 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've got only minor details . . . Though Taiga told me that what they're going to teach me is what makes animals and people be known as Sages. - Mon Oct 26 07:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) there are two recliners in the room, and another couch. A recliner is a very comfortable and very cushioned chair, for the record, that you can lie down in.

"I'm interested." Kat says.

"Any downsides to signing the scroll? Anything stopping me from signing three different scrolls and getting a ton of summons?"



* - Mon Oct 26 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well the best summoners can have at best two types of animals. - Mon Oct 26 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You just can't sign a contract with every single animal you see. - Mon Oct 26 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I have to decide. . . - Mon Oct 26 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do I want racoons? - Mon Oct 26 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: For starters, You'll end up with reconnaisance raccoons first. - Mon Oct 26 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Then if you get good with them, They'll let you sign other raccoon summons which are like Taiga and Tanukichii. - Mon Oct 26 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Summons definitely seem way better than clones. - Mon Oct 26 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ikaro has already agreed to learning Raccoons. - Mon Oct 26 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: These clones take up all of my chakra. - Mon Oct 26 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Only good for spying. - Mon Oct 26 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: My raccoons take up barely any chakra . . . The C rank ones. - Mon Oct 26 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And they're meant for spying and getting knowledge. - Mon Oct 26 08:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I got the clones' memories but it's not the same as being out there. - Mon Oct 26 08:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gonna have to kill the orange-haired autist that put me in this position. - Mon Oct 26 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I bet it's like spectating. - Mon Oct 26 08:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be seen as a missing shinobi for not being in Sunagakure for four months. - Mon Oct 26 08:05:58 2015

She doesn't bother with a stance, because she suspects she'll have to attack first as annoying as that is.* - Mon Oct 26 08:14:30 2015

Chakra is sent racing forwards. Spikes would come out of the ground at Kilm's feet, forcing him to move.* - Mon Oct 26 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Know what's funny? It's as if every guy in Sunagakure has feelings for you in one way or another. - Mon Oct 26 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . If no one has that sage thing . . . Then the gezo have absolutely no knowledge of it. - Mon Oct 26 08:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's funny since they know basically everything that's going on in the world though. - Mon Oct 26 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns in place, rising to her feet as she does so. Explosion release chakra is shoved into her fist in the mean time, and she holds the fist out. It's prepared to meet Kilm's jutsu, and it does. The second his technique makes contact with it, it triggers the landmine fist.

Immediately, an explosive beam flies forwards at its full power due to feeding on Kilm's flames.

Because of how she'd used it, it'd be at its full power too. Kilm's flames would be overwhelmed. A (slightly weakened) landmine fist would then consume him, and probably send him flying backwards. The ground shakes violently in the mean time in response to the display of power. Kat's hair and skirt would be sent flying all over the place in the mean time.* - Mon Oct 26 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Honestly. - Mon Oct 26 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was just hoping to beat your raccoons up. - Mon Oct 26 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This spar might be pointless though. - Mon Oct 26 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Neither of us can hurt the other. - Mon Oct 26 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Unless we run each other out of chakra,. - Mon Oct 26 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Eh, I could hurt you if i didn't hold back and actually found an opening but yeah. - Mon Oct 26 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You never have any openings. - Mon Oct 26 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh yeah? - Mon Oct 26 08:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then don't hold back. - Mon Oct 26 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can't kill me in one hit anymore. - Mon Oct 26 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) carefully removes her gauntlets, one at a time. Afterwords, she takes them and tosses them towards her house. When they hit the door they fall to the ground. Kat's arms then find her sides once more and she stares blankly at Kilm.* - Mon Oct 26 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wouldn't want my weapons getting damaged. - Mon Oct 26 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) quickly forms the snake seal. The girl's skin turns pitch black, instantly.

Water's weak to earth so should Kilm hit her, his water will likely do even less damage than his other elements.

Immediately after covering herself in Domu, Kat forms the tiger seal. She flickers out of sight, moving to the west to evade Kilm's wave.* - Mon Oct 26 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Didn't say I'd let you hit me." Kat says.

"I only told you to go all out. You have a lot of power but if you're slow it doesn't matter."

Kat sprints towards him, moving as a blur.* - Mon Oct 26 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) throws an arm out with a good-humored scoff. The second her fist hits Kilm's lightning, the Landmine Fist would be unleashed.

Even as the explosion races forwards, Kat would keep moving. He'd be hit at point blank with her fist, in the chest.

The boy would not only be knocked back, but he'd take full damage too.

He's knocked out instantly.* - Mon Oct 26 08:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts her Domu away. Afterwords she carries Kilm inside and places him in a chair to let him sleep off all of the damage he took.

With a sigh, Kat would then set herself down on her couch.

Her gauntlets return to her hands.* - Mon Oct 26 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "That's what spars are for." she says.

By now Kat's facing the south. Her elbow rests against the couch and her palm is pressed to her face.

Kat's eyes are averted, and a faint smile is on her face.* - Mon Oct 26 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Atleast it was fun and now we're even again. - Mon Oct 26 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I guess. - Mon Oct 26 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure it counts as a win when you beat shadow clones though. - Mon Oct 26 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Clones can't use Domu. - Mon Oct 26 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Your choice to say whether or not that was a win. - Mon Oct 26 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway . . . Hope you come to a decision on whether or not you want raccoons. - Mon Oct 26 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll think about it. - Mon Oct 26 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since when I leave, You probably won't be able to contact me for a while. - Mon Oct 26 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So what do you want to do now? - Mon Oct 26 08:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Mon Oct 26 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kinda tired, and bored. - Mon Oct 26 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not being able to spend time in Sunagakure sucks. - Mon Oct 26 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm in the mood where I want to go and beat up some rogues with my summons. - Mon Oct 26 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The problem is finding some. - Mon Oct 26 08:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I need sleep actually. - Mon Oct 26 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe you can go catch up with your friend. - Mon Oct 26 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Mon Oct 26 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you later then. - Mon Oct 26 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good night. - Mon Oct 26 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Night. - Mon Oct 26 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go sleep.* - Mon Oct 26 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sends a shadowclone to the village.* - Mon Oct 26 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to the middle of the desert, in the flesh. No more clones, for a moment. When she makes it to her training grounds though, Kat makes the clone seal. Four clones are produced. It's a dangerous activity probably considering each clone has a fourth of her chakra. 

Even so, she should be able to learn much faster this way. All five Katsune's then pour doton release chakra into their gauntlets. Each Katsune finds a different tree. The gauntlets are strengthend. With this in mind, all five Katsunes begin launching rapid barrages of punches at their targets.

Naturally their fists take no damage, and the trees take awfully large amounts of it. Within only a few minutes, all bark in the way of their fists is sent flying towards the sand below. By the end of a few hours' worth of training, the trees have large chips in them. In time, Kat's forced to go home and sleep. Eventually though she returns to resume training.* - Mon Oct 26 09:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) summons only a single clone today. It's an earth clone, and has about ten percent of her chakra. That's all it's gonna need for a simple training session. Both Katsunes lay out carpets of mud, using the mud sillhouette technique. Afterwords they weave through three handseals each.

Abruptly, two different dragon heads are formed. They're both made of mud. With glowing white eyes, they stare ahead at each other. In time, the throats begin glowing too. When this finally happens, balls of mud begin flying forwards from each dragon.

With each mud bullet, a loud bang is sounded off. It's reminiscent of a gunshot each time. As a result, the sound produced is similar to that of a gatling machine gun. Each time mud bullets hit each other, mud is splashed all over the place. More loud bangs are released with each collision.

As such, an awful lot of noise is produced.* - Mon Oct 26 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually destroys her clone. When she does so, she gains none of its experience. At this time she realizes she should've been using a normal clone the entire time. Acknowledging this, she summons one of them this time around.

With the new clone made, Kat and her makeshift sparring partner resume training. Many hours pass. In time, there's mud all over Kat's training grounds. Even her clothes by now have some mud sprinkled here and there. Kat's eyes watch and study each mud ball that goes through the air. 

She's looking for weaknesses in her jutsu.* - Mon Oct 26 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hey. - Mon Oct 26 10:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is lying on her back in the dirt at the moment. Arms and legs are sprawled out at either side of her, and a glance is directed at Kilm and his friend.

Mud is scattered all over the place throughout Kat's training ground from where she's been training.

"Hi." she says.* - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Trying to train? - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hating every minute of it too. - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay, Thought you'd be here. - Mon Oct 26 10:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well, This is Ikaro. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The one I told you about. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Hey. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hi. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And for some reason he looks exactly like me when I was 15 -omit- - Mon Oct 26 10:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I hope you don't mind me asking. . . But what exactly are you training in? - Mon Oct 26 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Earth jutsus, and shadow clones. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Both are a pain. - Mon Oct 26 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: I see. . . I still haven't gotten around to even learning Shadow Clone yet. - Mon Oct 26 10:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Neither have I. - Mon Oct 26 10:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gimme time to master the jutsu and maybe I'll show you how it's done, seeing as you're a friend of Kilm's. - Mon Oct 26 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You up for another spar Ikaro right now? - Mon Oct 26 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: Sure. I don't mind. - Mon Oct 26 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Your move. - Mon Oct 26 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Eh, Do you know your other family members? Like Tethys's son? - Mon Oct 26 10:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: No. I was out of the village a majority of the time. . . Never met them. - Mon Oct 26 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Why were you out of the village? - Mon Oct 26 10:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Ikaro(EvolutionMe) says: To find myself. - Mon Oct 26 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see - Mon Oct 26 10:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks herself up, onto her hands. In the same motion she plants her feet onto the ground. With a silent sigh, the girl erects a massive earthen corridor. It's fifty feet wide in any direction from the center and twice as tall. When she's done, Kat stands straight and makes some shadow clones. 

There are five entire clones in all. One of Kat's clones walks forwards to the western end of her corridor. Once there, it plants a carpet of mud on the ground by way of the mud sillhouette technique. Preperations are now complete so it goes to stand beside its many sisters. All are in a straight, horizontal line.

All are facing the earthen corridor. So, all weave through three handseals at the same time. Very slowly out of the mud come five muddy dragon's heads. All of them have open maws and smug grins on their faces. Their eyes stare ahead, and glow.

The throats glow too. Many seconds pass, because Kat's in no hurry. She's focusing more on chakra cost than speed. That's the point of this training after all. In time, her dragons are ready.

Abruptly, bullets of mud begin flying forwards. Bullets from each head. They all race ahead and crash into Kat's earthen corridor. The walls are strong, so little to no damage is done. This technique is all about doing damage many times in a row. 

Each individual shot though is weaker than you'd expect. No damage is done to the corridor's walls. Many minutes pass as Kat and her clones erect more dragon heads. More bullets are fired off. Each time a bullet is released, it produces a very loud bang.

Each time they hit Kat's earthen corridor another bang is released, and each dragon's head releases about one hundred bullets before splashing back into mud on the ground. As such, the noise is so loud it probably drowns out any conversation Ikaro and Kilm are having, at least to some extent. Even so, Kat persists. In time, there's a crack or two in her earthen corridor.* - Mon Oct 26 10:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually gets tired of beating up her earthen corridor. The corridor is driven into the dirt, and Kat sends a clone forwards. The clone produces twenty or so earth spikes, by way of the earth and stone bamboo shoot jutsu. As planned, the real Kat then sends a river of mud forwards. It coats the spikes entirely and more importantly, covers the area in mud.

The mud is needed for the earth dragon bomb. To test her jutsu, Kat weaves through three handseals. Once more, a dragon's head rises up out of the mud. The usual lightshow is displayed, and a barrage of mud bullets come flying forwards. Each time a spike is hit, a loud popping sound is produced.

Many long minutes pass and four or five dragon heads are produced. By the end of this part of Kat's training, she's managed to topple one of her spikes. Only one. The earth dragon bomb jutsu is great, but raw power isn't its strongsuit. With a sigh, Kat eventually opts to test her jutsu against other things.

Her clone is made to prepare a lightning ball. Once it's done, it has the orb in its grasp. Kat erects another dragon's head, and sends forwards another barrage of mud balls. Kat's clone fires off the lightning ball. As suspected, at least a few of Kat's mudballs are consumed entirely.

Earth is weak to lightning after all. Naturally though, not all of the mud balls are consumed. Ultimately, the earth dragon bomb wins out. It's a higher ranked technique, so it's to be expected. With a nod, Kat has her clone prepare some more jutsus.

First is the landmine fist. The clone holds an arm out with its hand clenched into a fist. The second the fist is hit by one of Kat's mud bullets, the explosion is released. The signature beam comes flying forwards. It releases a very loud and reverberating boom as it consumes the mud, releasing all of the energy within its atomic makeup to produce the resulting shockwave of energy.

The ground shakes, and dirt from the ground is thrown all over the place. Kat's hair as well as her clone's is blown backwards and all over the place. Their skirts are tossed to and fro as well. Mudballs are disintigrated instantly as expected. Not a single one is left.* - Mon Oct 26 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has her clones all meet south of her and each one produces another clone. There are now eight of them in all. Without anymore delay, Kat erects another mud dragon's head. More bullets of earth are sent flying. Each clone weaves through some handseals.

When the clones are done they all send torrents of lightning forwards. Each bolt releases loud, reverberating booms. Overall the noise is probably pretty overwhelming. Each time a bullet is hit, it's turned to dry dust within the span of a second. With all of the earth flash streams flying forwards at once, Kat's mud bullets are all destroyed easily enough.

Earth is weak to lightning and the numbers aren't in Kat's favor either. Either way, she's surprised her mud dragon bomb stood up even as well as it did. She was expecting less. This display is repeated several times. By the time the teen is done, she's sweating just a bit.* - Mon Oct 26 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has her clones line up. All of them channel earth release chakra into their gauntlets, and then turn to face Kat. Each and every single clone turns in place and extends an arm, with hands clenched into fists. The real Katsune then goes through three handseals. Yet again, an earth dragon's head is produced.

Once more a barrage of bullets is sent forwards. Using great reflexes, the first of Kat's clones begins deflecting bullets. It actually manages to take one or two of them. Almost immediately though the clone is overwhelemed. It's disintigrated in a puff of smoke. 

The next clone in line does its best to deflect bullets of mud as well. With its doton-enforced gauntlet it doesn't do too poorly. In time, though, it too is done away with. This is repeated until there are no clones left. It takes two earth dragon bombs in all.* - Mon Oct 26 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gonna go sleep. . . - Mon Oct 26 11:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That sounds useful. - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Relaying a message . . . Yes. - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Think you'd mind teaching it to me some time? - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can right now if you want. - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's only a C rank. - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. I'd like that. - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight, Follow me. - Mon Oct 26 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and follows.* - Mon Oct 26 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Could be used for torture too. - Mon Oct 26 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The technique is called Finger Carving seal. - Mon Oct 26 18:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's a fuuinjutsu even though I don't believe this seals anything. - Mon Oct 26 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've only used it to write on walls and scrolls for now. - Mon Oct 26 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can use it to write letters on the spot. - Mon Oct 26 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In public. - Mon Oct 26 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's why I want it. - Mon Oct 26 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, watching carefully. After the display she pulls out a scroll of her own and unrolls it. Kat holds it with her left hand while her right hand rises. The index finger is extended, and she begins pouring chakra into it. "Hours of my life going into learning how to write on scrolls more easily." she says.

"I wonder if this is the best use of my time." Eventually one can see a very faint blue aura coat her finger. The teen brings her finger forwards and rubs it against her scroll. Visibly, the finger sticks. As Kat rubs, her scroll is rocked back and forth.

Kat had used the suimen technique out of habit. The blue fades away, and she tries again. The same thing happens once more. Many long minutes pass, and Kat's made no progress. Eventually with a silent sigh, and flops down onto her belly in the sand. The girl falls in slow motion due to the lightweight rock technique.

When she's lying down, her left elbow finds the ground. The associated palm finds her face. "Speaking of spending time, I wonder where everyone is today." Kat applies her finger once more. This time, she's successfully managed to generate heat with her chakra.

As a result, she easily burns right through the scroll. Katsune takes a moment to crack her neck, to the right and then to the left. Hours pass. Eventually, Kat successfully performs the jutsu. Slaving away pays off. The girl manages to draw an awkward smiley face on her scroll.* - Mon Oct 26 19:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Home. - Mon Oct 26 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mind if I come? The square is empty anyway. - Mon Oct 26 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's been hiding while I scout the village. - Mon Oct 26 19:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she places her palm against her face. A very loud gunshot-like bang is heard as the shadowclone shoots herself in the face with Exploding Palm.

The clone disperses in a plume of smoke. The real Katsune face palms at home for entirely different reasons as knew knowledge fills her head.* - Mon Oct 26 19:10:43 2015
