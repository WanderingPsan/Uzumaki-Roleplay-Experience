<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I am not God, Katsune.. - Mon Sep 28 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm only serve one.. - Mon Sep 28 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There are some things...that genin shouldn't hear. For their own sakes. - Mon Sep 28 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've tried to be honest with you. - Mon Sep 28 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see you as.... - Mon Sep 28 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A very valuable ally. I want you to be happy. - Mon Sep 28 16:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Then ask Yumiko to take him to a restaurant. They seem to be enjoying that. - Mon Sep 28 16:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you were to start asking me for things...I might be willing to give them to you. You never do. Of course, you aren't on the payroll so....we'll see. - Mon Sep 28 16:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But until you ask...you'll never know whether I'm willing or not. - Mon Sep 28 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You still don't understand. - Mon Sep 28 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You will soon. - Mon Sep 28 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Very soon. - Mon Sep 28 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll just make an example out of Kilm. - Mon Sep 28 16:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The truth is I missed your point before. About Hanabi and Flexus. That was embarassing so I hid the fact but...I wasn't trying to mislead you. - Mon Sep 28 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . .  - Mon Sep 28 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains composed despite what he said.* - Mon Sep 28 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll let you have the honors, Katsune. - Mon Sep 28 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Slit throat, decapitated head, or slit wrists.. - Mon Sep 28 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: How do you want Kilm to be sacrificed? - Mon Sep 28 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...When.... - Mon Sep 28 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I said you weren't on the payroll...that was me trying to hide things from these two. - Mon Sep 28 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The truth is, I meant for you to understand...Konoha will do anything you ask them to. - Mon Sep 28 16:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Take it from a practiced liar. It's best to never assume someone is lying. It's best to only work with facts. . . - Mon Sep 28 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ahh, man.. - Mon Sep 28 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Too funny. - Mon Sep 28 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Ease yourselves.. - Mon Sep 28 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Wanted to see how far I can push you.. - Mon Sep 28 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes. As subtly as she can manage, she slowly takes a deep breath.* - Mon Sep 28 16:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: As long as you too hang around me.. - Mon Sep 28 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're immortals. - Mon Sep 28 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Besides, you answered the question right. - Mon Sep 28 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You got the point.. without actually.. getting the point. - Mon Sep 28 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That you didn't like who I was putting trust into? - Mon Sep 28 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth is I never trusted them though. - Mon Sep 28 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You must've thought I was naive. - Mon Sep 28 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- But I get it. - Mon Sep 28 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I still do think you're naive. - Mon Sep 28 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: It's cute. - Mon Sep 28 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Mon Sep 28 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Probably why Kilm wants you so bad. - Mon Sep 28 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . - Mon Sep 28 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't blush or anything of course.

She has reason to be tense after all.* - Mon Sep 28 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Really Erebus? You're bringing the conversation there? - Mon Sep 28 16:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Believe it or not, Katsune. From what I heard, he embedded that infamor Ride or Die thing with you in mind.. - Mon Sep 28 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: He made a name for himself in Kumogakure and Kirigakure with it and your name. - Mon Sep 28 16:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I may stay quiet on certain things, but that doesn't mean I don't hear things. - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You have a fine shinobi.. - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: So that being said... - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Well . . . That's definitely a lie . . . I never mentioned her while using the ride or die motto. - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: For my first request... - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And most likely my last.. - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Atleast they don't sit on each other's lap acting intimate while at a restaurant. . . - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I want him to be Chuunin.. - Mon Sep 28 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I'd already planned to give him the vest today." she says.

Eyes find Erebus. They're a bit cold.

She pulls out the vest she'd been keeping handy and passes it to Kilm.* - Mon Sep 28 16:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Kilm, don't touch the vest. - Mon Sep 28 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply stares.

Gently she sets the vest down in front of her friend, on the desk.

Arms cross once more.* - Mon Sep 28 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're not understanding, Katsune... - Mon Sep 28 16:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're a leader of an entire village and country. - Mon Sep 28 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You move at your own pace. - Mon Sep 28 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My words, Kilm's words, Taiga's words, they shouldn't alter the pace you move for yourself. - Mon Sep 28 16:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It is mine. It's the truth. I planned to reward him the vest today. I'm a bit...unhappy you ruined it for him. It was going to be a cause for celebration. - Mon Sep 28 16:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Soon, Katsune. - Mon Sep 28 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Soon. - Mon Sep 28 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. She leaves the vest where it is.* - Mon Sep 28 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Go a head, Kilm. - Mon Sep 28 16:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Pick it up. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Katsune planned a massive party for you in Amegakure.. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I ruined her plans.. without knowing she had plans.. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You need practice, Erebus. - Mon Sep 28 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Time to waste millions to throw a festival... - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes.* - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: At lying..? - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.* - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Mind teaching me, madam expert? - Mon Sep 28 16:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. All you have to do is ask. - Mon Sep 28 16:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Cute. - Mon Sep 28 16:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I need a talk with you . . . - Mon Sep 28 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances up at Kilm in response to his whispering. With a nod she rises to her feet, in a seemingly lazy manner. The girl then pushes her chair under her desk and turns to walk away, leading him off.* - Mon Sep 28 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits and turns her chair to face Kilm to the west. One leg crosses over the other, and Kat's hands meet to form the tiger seal. Even now, she intends to practice the kai jutsu. She has to. It's just that urgent.

Carefully, Kat focuses on stopping the flow of her chakra.

"Alright." she says, giving Kilm admittedly divided attention. "What is it?" Even as she waits for a response, Kat shoves chakra throughout her chakra network once more. She repeats this throughout the conversation.* - Mon Sep 28 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do you know what I need to do? - Mon Sep 28 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: About what? - Mon Sep 28 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I need to put these feelings aside . . . They're distracting me in the worst time possible . . . They're making me weaker when I need to get stronger . . . I can't focus on them anymore . . . - Mon Sep 28 17:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: At this pace . . . I won't become strong enough. - Mon Sep 28 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe a good idea honestly. One day...I'll have less need to be worried at all times about my hokage duties. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Once Konoha's position is secure. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That day isn't now. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't afford to let feelings get in the way, so I don't. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This does not mean I don't want that date . . . It's just that I shouldn't focus on things like that anymore. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's true. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Besides . . . That's my only chance at a date most likely. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can save it if you want. An I.O.U. - Mon Sep 28 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And what if you can't carry that I.O.U out in the future? - Mon Sep 28 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Or do you already not have time at the moment? - Mon Sep 28 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Sep 28 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't intend to let anyone get that close right now. - Mon Sep 28 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't do my duty as hokage if I do. - Mon Sep 28 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 28 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . Okay. - Mon Sep 28 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I won't focus on my feelings anymore. - Mon Sep 28 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll focus on being a chuunin. - Mon Sep 28 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: On getting stronger . . . - Mon Sep 28 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm.... - Mon Sep 28 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) speaks somewhat gently.* - Mon Sep 28 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Has Erebus been speaking to you in private? - Mon Sep 28 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No . . . I came to this decision myself. - Mon Sep 28 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can't lie to me you know. I wanted to see if you'd tell me yourself. - Mon Sep 28 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am not lying to you. - Mon Sep 28 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Sep 28 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: When we're in a better position . . . I will afford being able to slightly focus on them again. - Mon Sep 28 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure how I feel about anyone going to Amegakure. - Mon Sep 28 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But that won't be till our dream is achieved. - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So...the plan is. No matter what Erebus tries.... - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We won't go to that village, of all villages. - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd mean our deaths. - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Be prepared at all times to flee from him. - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Focus on getting away, or you'd only slow me down. - Mon Sep 28 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- That is, flee if I do. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I saw him dodging those snakes earlier. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That means something. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Means he may be immortal, but he must have some sort of fear for some reason. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Once i'm strong enough . . . I'll bury him. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Careful. Even if we were able to attack him.... - Mon Sep 28 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's still an ally. A useful one. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "As long as we stick with him, we're immortal." - Mon Sep 28 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Think about that. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm against him killing people though. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even if he is an ally. - Mon Sep 28 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure what to think about his killing sprees yet. - Mon Sep 28 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He gives me good excuses. - Mon Sep 28 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe they are for the best, maybe not. - Mon Sep 28 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm still studying him. - Mon Sep 28 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Mon Sep 28 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We've come to an agreement though . . . Right? We won't focus on feelings till we've reached our goal or atleast a good enough position? - Mon Sep 28 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . I won't anyway. - Mon Sep 28 17:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way...even if he were afraid of numbers which I doubt. - Mon Sep 28 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have to keep him happy. "As long as we hang with him...we're immortal." - Mon Sep 28 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 28 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though there's a reason I said i'd bury him if he goes too far. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If he can't die . . . Why not make him lose all ability to move and just trap him? - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's not about the oxygen. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's about getting him trapped . . . - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm...? - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'd climb out eventually. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sealing him away . . . Trapping him. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suspect. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Restircting movement. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need to find out...if he sleeps. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let me handle that. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be subtle. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Mon Sep 28 18:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What now? - Mon Sep 28 18:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can't just win one battle. You have to win the war. - Mon Sep 28 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's what matters. - Mon Sep 28 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Mon Sep 28 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I guess you did win the first game though. - Mon Sep 28 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wasn't afraid to risk again. - Mon Sep 28 18:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Changed my mind. Don't do this. You'd die. - Mon Sep 28 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's that ruthless. - Mon Sep 28 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Ugh . . . - Mon Sep 28 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When he realizes you're not willing to do tasks for him, he'll impale you. - Mon Sep 28 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fine. - Mon Sep 28 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sounded like I could be more useful though. - Mon Sep 28 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the south. She silently takes a deep breath. The girl once more attempts to stop the flow of her chakra, her hands having remained in the tiger seal this entire time. This entire time, she's been practicing, only pausing when the conversation demands her complete attention. It's a good thing that this costs basically no chakra at all for her. Zetsumo taught her well.

As a result, she's capable of using it for an entire day even, back-to-back. That means it's relatively easy for her to practice it. "Don't give yourself challenges you can't possibly win." she says. "I made a mistake sending Beth and the others on that mission. I made a mistake sending you to escort that man. I don't intend to make too many when it comes to missions."* - Mon Sep 28 18:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As hokage...it's my duty to take risks with my subordinates. The survivors get stronger. - Mon Sep 28 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't risk 'you' though. - Mon Sep 28 18:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I survived that escort though . . . Though I almost lost my shinobi career. - Mon Sep 28 18:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hanabi and Flexus. - Mon Sep 28 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He asked me what they had in common, when I asked why he killed them. - Mon Sep 28 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm pretty sure what he meant was. . . - Mon Sep 28 18:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He killed them because I trusted them. - Mon Sep 28 18:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You going to nap? - Mon Sep 28 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. - Mon Sep 28 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just not sure I trust myself to do much today. - Mon Sep 28 18:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Most of your jutsus can't be used indoors. - Mon Sep 28 18:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) presumably recieves word of Erebus's siege by way of a bird or an NPC shinobi. These are shinobi after all. They're organized, and people will want to know where the hokage is and make sure she's informed.

She opens the scroll up and reads the contents.* - Mon Sep 28 18:46:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Diplomacy won't work. Him doing this means he's lost his mind and assumed i'm not loyal, which isn't even true. - Mon Sep 28 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one's this rash without a reason. He won't trust a word I say. - Mon Sep 28 18:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Is this the end? - Mon Sep 28 18:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 28 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mind if I use the henge jutsu on you? - Mon Sep 28 18:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) forms three handseals. The ones needed for the henge jutsu. Once done, a poof of smoke follows. When it clears, Kat is identical to Kilm. "Alright." she says.

"Hm. Follow me."* - Mon Sep 28 18:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Of going out there undetected? - Mon Sep 28 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mmh . . . Not sure. - Mon Sep 28 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: He 'might' know about the secret exit that is. - Mon Sep 28 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: He's been talking to paine. - Mon Sep 28 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Think you can put a hole in the wall somewhere? - Mon Sep 28 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Not here. Nearby. - Mon Sep 28 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Come. Follow me. - Mon Sep 28 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: We're underground. Put a hole here and... - Mon Sep 28 18:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: We can use subterranean voyage to flee. - Mon Sep 28 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Work fast, Kilm. - Mon Sep 28 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Every second counts. - Mon Sep 28 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Go. Do it. - Mon Sep 28 18:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That good enough? - Mon Sep 28 18:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) nods. With that, the fake kilm sprints forwards, moving as a blur. The second her palms are on some of the now-hot earth available to her, "Kilm" works her chakra. The "man" turns it to liquid. Abruptly she then darts into it, swimming away and leading the way for Kilm.

These two...will be swimming for half a mile at the very least. They will exit nowhere near the official secret exit. They're taking zero chances.

They'll go undetected. The real exit is at least twenty yards away. No one can sense that far.* - Mon Sep 28 18:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) || They're not headed for the real exit. They're headed half a mile east. -Not- the real exit.

Kilm will sense that though and follow Kat's lead, surely.* - Mon Sep 28 19:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) eventually pulls herself out of the ground, covered in mud. In Kilm's voice, and with a sigh, she says "Alright. We shouldn't be together right now. If people see us both at once we're in trouble. Big trouble."* - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Split up? - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure. - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I need a disguise. - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I can't look like you. - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Or maybe...you need a disguise. - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Or both. - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Both. - Mon Sep 28 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: People know you're my most trusted friend. - Mon Sep 28 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I'll wait in this tree while we discuss things. . . - Mon Sep 28 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) turns and darts up to the top of the nearest tree. Its leaves are so thick, she's sure she'll be hidden. This way if someone stumbles upon them, she can dispel the henge jutsu before fleeing. Once there, she plants her back to some of the tree's wood.* - Mon Sep 28 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Mon Sep 28 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Now what... - Mon Sep 28 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Have you thought about Erebus buying troops for us? - Mon Sep 28 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: It's very possible. That's why I don't want anyone to know we fled. - Mon Sep 28 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I'll send him a bird. - Mon Sep 28 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: In the mean time. Hm. - Mon Sep 28 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Where to go. - Mon Sep 28 19:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I need an excuse... - Mon Sep 28 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: What would be so urgent I'd need to leave the village alone? - Mon Sep 28 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Or even with you. - Mon Sep 28 19:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should we go back? - Mon Sep 28 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: 'Course not. We'll find out whether or not it's safe. I'll ask paine or Maloth. - Mon Sep 28 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Paine's loyal and Maloth is dumb enough to tell me anything even if he's not supposed to. - Mon Sep 28 19:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Pay attention Kilm. - Mon Sep 28 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I need an excuse. - Mon Sep 28 19:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) snaps, to get his attention.* - Mon Sep 28 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You know I don't think good. - Mon Sep 28 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm. - Mon Sep 28 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Err . . . A walk? - Mon Sep 28 19:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: A...walk? - Mon Sep 28 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: We might be gone for days. - Mon Sep 28 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Good idea but we need a better one. - Mon Sep 28 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Personally pissed off by rogues? - Mon Sep 28 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Has to be flawless. - Mon Sep 28 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I . . . have no more ideas. - Mon Sep 28 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Me either. - Mon Sep 28 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna just...nap in this tree with me? - Mon Sep 28 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Will you unhenge? - Mon Sep 28 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) rolls over. Eyes close and she lies on her belly with her chin pressed to the back of her hands. She sighs.

Of course, Kat still wears Kilm's face and appearance.

"Nope..." she coos, quietly, in response.

With Kilm's voice, the sound is probably creepy.* - Mon Sep 28 19:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sleeping with myself . . . would be awkward. - Mon Sep 28 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even sleeping with your unhenged self will be awkward. - Mon Sep 28 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: I just...need a nap. - Mon Sep 28 19:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Fine . . . - Mon Sep 28 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: First offer it is then. - Mon Sep 28 19:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Stay hidden. - Mon Sep 28 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) says: ...I'm too tired to make good decisions. - Mon Sep 28 19:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 28 19:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) goes to another part of the island, maybe another half-mile away. Once there, she rests in a different tree, hidden from eyes. A bird may be able to find her...maybe. She'll have to keep an eye out for one just in case.

The girl will also have to stay awake after all. Eyes scan the horizon, looking for shinobi to make sure she's not surrounded by hundreds or thousands.She sighs, still wearing Kilm's face. No matter what Kilm says, it'll be hard to believe if it's anything positive about Erebus.* - Mon Sep 28 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) allows the bird to find her once she spots it in the sky, having left her tree to make it possible. Once she reads the letter, she uses Exploding Palm to blow the bird up.

No loose ends. Even animals.

Kat gets back into her hiding place.

She can't trust Kilm's judgement though. The girl makes no move to go back to Konoha.* - Mon Sep 28 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) sends Erebus a message before turning on her heel and sprinting away. After some small amount of distance she opts to go underground once more while she moves locations. She has to be sure this bird doesn't lead anyone to her...so she has to move, unfortunately.

That means the bird can't find her anymore.* - Mon Sep 28 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) perches on a mountain top, using her hidden mole jutsu to make a cave. The jutsu allows one to leave an open hole -if- they want to. Thus it's easy to accomplish this.

Kat proceeds to cover the hole with some realistically-placed shrubs, at the base of a tree. It's a mountain top yes but there's grass here, as is the case with probably every mountain top ever.* - Mon Sep 28 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) spends a few hours putting a hole in the wooden wall of her former bedroom, in the secret exit to Konoha. The disguised girl uses a kunai as well as jutsus to quietly make this happen. Presumably this is at least twenty feet below the surface. If it's not, she simply makes a hole in the floor instead.

Once done, Kat dispells her henge jutsu and prepares to meet Erebus.* - Mon Sep 28 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kilm(Shimizu3598) spends a very long time setting up a hole in the wall accross from her bedroom as well. Once more is's big enough for several people to easily and quickly fit through. This one is left unhidden.* - Mon Sep 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) also moves two bookshelves to where they can cover up the second escape route. The girl leaves just enough room for her to easily slip in, and the hole is left very close to the eastern-most bookshelf. Enough to very quickly and easily get to.* - Mon Sep 28 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stands with arms crossed and weight shifted a bit. The girl faces the southwest. with the eastern hallway in her peripheral vision.* - Mon Sep 28 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) produces a faint and cheeky smile. The girl looks him up and down slowly. "Knew it was a good idea to keep birds down here." she says.* - Mon Sep 28 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is currently standing with her arms crossed. She's facing the southwest with the eastern hallway in her peripheral vision, and her weight is shifted just a bit.

Of course, the tale she'd spun about birds being down here was a blatant lie. There's no such thing.* - Mon Sep 28 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ignores the man's words outright, like the professional she is. After all, those distract from the point of this conversation.

"Have you calmed down yet? I hoped my letter from before would soften you up. After all...if I go anywhere else I lose my career."* - Mon Sep 28 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression is pretty neutral when her eyes find Erebus's again. It's one that suggests she's calculating. Studying, and judging.* - Mon Sep 28 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We both know if I don't lose my identity, you'll be able to find and kill me easily. - Mon Sep 28 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I played this game with Zetsumo for years. I always wanted to run away but knew it was suicide of some kind or another no matter what I did. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either I lose my name...or.... - Mon Sep 28 23:42:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny. I was just thinking about your immortality. - Mon Sep 28 23:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And Zetsumo. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your immortality...it makes you unfamiliar with the games normal shinobi play. The lies that are made with good intentions. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Just not shinobi-based fears. - Mon Sep 28 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm even willing to state my fears.. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Unless they don't interest you of course. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't. I'd rather you know that I have no way of harming you. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Much safer I'm sure. - Mon Sep 28 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Which makes me wonder....why you might try to kill me. Thought about it and...you have no reason to bring an army to do that. - Mon Sep 28 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll skip to the point though. - Mon Sep 28 23:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't trust Niza. Probably a snake like me, for political reasons. To keep his village safe. - Mon Sep 28 23:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Hence the reason I spoke of celebrating there for Kilm's promotion.. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I wanted to give him the leader role there. - Mon Sep 28 23:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. Like I said in my letter. We really should've communicated more. - Mon Sep 28 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's hard to get you alone. You're always so busy. - Mon Sep 28 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With you having so much power over me, and me being hokage... - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And us not communicating.... - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. It leads to an awful lot of confusion. - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Exactly why I'm worried about making a council like everyone keeps asking for. A council with actual authority. - Mon Sep 28 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm not going to stand here and lie to you.. - Mon Sep 28 23:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: A relative of a.. close friend of yours. - Mon Sep 28 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm has no relatives. - Mon Sep 28 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Does he...? - Mon Sep 28 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or at least...I don't think he does. - Mon Sep 28 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: No, it's not Kilm.. - Mon Sep 28 23:55:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's lips tremble a bit. Her eyes wander. The girl does her best to stay composed, however. For the most part, it works.

"Vengeance for his death?" she inquires.* - Mon Sep 28 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct.. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And I was asked to be the hitman.. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I admit. Bragging about killing him wasn't my brightest idea. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Right.. - Mon Sep 28 23:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes no move to leave, however.

After all...according to Kat's letter, this place has no secret exit.* - Tue Sep 29 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: *sigh*.. - Tue Sep 29 00:09:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leaves Konoha through one of the holes she made, using Subterranean Voyage.* - Tue Sep 29 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't here ICly.* - Tue Sep 29 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) left Konoha a few days ago. The girl is walking so it takes forever. She's taking her time after all. Even now, her hands are joined together in formation of the tiger seal. While walking, Kat does her best to stop her chakra flow.

Presumably the walking alone makes it more difficult, but Kat is persistant nonetheless. Apparently a former relative of Orakuru's wants her dead, and according to Erebus...he's "extremely powerful." Unfortunately the girl has no idea who that is. As such, she has to be prepared for absolutely anything as always. Since the day of her birth she's been in constant danger as far as she can tell, and even now it's no different.

For these reasons, she's convinced she has to master the genjutsu kai technique no matter what. Finally, the teen manages to stop the flow of her chakra entirely. Abruptly, and roughly, she then shoves it throughout her chakra network once more. The technique is performed successfully, but Kat's still so far away from complete mastery. No matter what, she reminds herself...she has to gain enough control over this jutsu to use it with no handseals at all.

After all, the very first time Kat was caught in genjutsu, it was a full-body-paralysis technique. She has to be prepared in case the same thing happens again. Once Kat's finished performing her jutsu, she begins stopping her chakra yet again. And of course, now...she's that much closer to Amegakure. Hours pass.* - Tue Sep 29 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits up in bed, on her butt. Once sitting, she lifts both arms. Both wrists met, and with palms open and directed at the doorknob, Kat channels lightning-natured chakra into her hands. A rather large ball of lightning is formed, and Kat launches it at the metal object.

Said door is creeping open afterwords, and Kat stares up at Kilm blankly.* - Tue Sep 29 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Hey. - Tue Sep 29 13:05:55 2015

"Supposedly Erebus wanted to celebrate in Amegakure because he already owned this place. Meaning it couldn't have been a nightmare trap after all...which is what I assumed."* - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Also an oranigization wants me dead. - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What organization? - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....Ushinawa's. - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Why? - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny. I was onto them from the start. Didn't have me fooled for a second. It's a good thing they saw me as a cute little girl. - Tue Sep 29 13:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They thought I'd be easy prey. Thought I wouldn't see through lies. - Tue Sep 29 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They didn't realize...I'm the most paranoid person in the world. - Tue Sep 29 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Does that mean I might have to fight Ushinawa someday? - Tue Sep 29 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. He told Erebus a lie about wanting to avenge Orakuru's death. - Tue Sep 29 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He hired him to kill me. - Tue Sep 29 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He hired Erebus? - Tue Sep 29 13:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yep. - Tue Sep 29 13:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hanabi had been trying to get information out of me. Asked what numbers Konoha had, tried desperately to warn me to leave. Told me people would come to take over. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Offered me power if I'd go with her. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tried everything...to get me to go with her. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I knew it was suspicious. It always sounded like she was worning about a faction she knew about, that was planning on attacking. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now we know. She was. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ushinawa claimed to be a relative of Orakuru's and said he's going to avenge him. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If this were true, he'd have killed me a long time ago. He was so chummy and nice though. This makes the truth obvious. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The truth is, he didn't realize Erebus had Konoha in his pocket. - Tue Sep 29 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The truth is.... - Tue Sep 29 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted me out of the way. His group had their eyes on Konoha the entire time. - Tue Sep 29 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's not happening. - Tue Sep 29 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He doesn't want to kill me anymore but...he may try so that he can make the lie look legitimate. - Tue Sep 29 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Understand? - Tue Sep 29 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 13:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's possible Erebus lied about this. About "someone related to Orakuru wanting to avenge his death," and having hired him to kill me. - Tue Sep 29 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's possible...but I believe him. - Tue Sep 29 13:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If Ushinawa dies . . . She'll obviously be bloodthirsty. - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll let her live. I only kill when I have to. - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Just be ready to fight her if she comes. - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She might want to avenge Ushinawa. - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ushinawa uses genjutsu. - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Be ready for him. - Tue Sep 29 13:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She wasn't able to defend herself at all. - Tue Sep 29 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But listen... - Tue Sep 29 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We don't want them to -know- that we know about this. - Tue Sep 29 13:15:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They don't want you dead. Only me. - Tue Sep 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Be cautious around them if you prefer...it's your choice since it's your life.  - Tue Sep 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But try not to let them know we know. - Tue Sep 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If they want you dead, I can't let them accomplish that. - Tue Sep 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can use it to our advantage if they think we're in the dark. - Tue Sep 29 13:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus said.... - Tue Sep 29 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A "force of immeasurable magnitude" is on its way here to kill me. Or maybe he said us...I don't remember. - Tue Sep 29 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He was referring to Ushinawa's group so it may be bigger or stronger than we thought. - Tue Sep 29 13:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right now? - Tue Sep 29 13:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Right now...? Doubt it. - Tue Sep 29 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They don't know we're here. It's why Erebus suggested we come here. - Tue Sep 29 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Speaking of Erebus I spoke to him. - Tue Sep 29 13:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Had him meet me in a place I knew I'd be safe in. - Tue Sep 29 13:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure. He's always been hard to read. Maybe because he actually does always tell the truth. It's possible. - Tue Sep 29 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I haven't caught him lying yet I don't think. - Tue Sep 29 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's so strong, maybe it's true. Maybe he doesn't lie. - Tue Sep 29 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like Zetsumo. - Tue Sep 29 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The immortality may do that. - Tue Sep 29 13:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Near the gates. - Tue Sep 29 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How so? - Tue Sep 29 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I had a poor choice of words. - Tue Sep 29 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: With a sign, Around 6 thousand troops started staring at me. - Tue Sep 29 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sign...? - Tue Sep 29 13:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He just snapped his fingers and they watched towards me. - Tue Sep 29 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Which just meant he had full control of the army. - Tue Sep 29 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Course he did. No one wants to cross an immortal. - Tue Sep 29 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe if I'd been there to order otherwise but I fled. - Tue Sep 29 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I wouldn't be seen as a leader anymore I'm sure. - Tue Sep 29 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A hokage can't be weak. It was stupid from the start. - Tue Sep 29 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Knew I'd ruin my name with this. - Tue Sep 29 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should've trusted my gut. - Tue Sep 29 13:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When I'm strong, people will follow me whether I've fled in the past or not. - Tue Sep 29 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hopefully no one knows I fled. - Tue Sep 29 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They can't be sure. That means a lie should be easy to spin. - Tue Sep 29 13:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. Erebus apparently.... - Tue Sep 29 13:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then...well. - Tue Sep 29 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Konoha and Amegakure would've had an alliance. Since he was working from the shadows, it would've looked great. - Tue Sep 29 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Now he doesn't like me? - Tue Sep 29 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure what the situation is. He told us to hide here. - Tue Sep 29 13:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Told me to "hide here with Kilm." - Tue Sep 29 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe you should ask but I dunno. - Tue Sep 29 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Tue Sep 29 13:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . We could message some. - Tue Sep 29 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be happy to slaughter Ushinawa for that alone. - Tue Sep 29 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Although... - Tue Sep 29 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I explained the ushinawa situation to Erebus. He may kill them to get them out of his own way. He should, because they'll be a problem otherwise. - Tue Sep 29 13:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For him. - Tue Sep 29 13:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth is...I told Erebus I didn't trust Niza. That was a lie though. - Tue Sep 29 13:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Getting so strong I don't need to kill anyone. - Tue Sep 29 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll take some time to decide which is the safest bet. - Tue Sep 29 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm betting it's the latter. - Tue Sep 29 13:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Latter most likely. - Tue Sep 29 13:39:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want Fujitora dead and Zenaki comfortable. - Tue Sep 29 13:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I still need Fujitora's jutsus. - Tue Sep 29 13:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me and you...we have to get strong fast. Remember what Zetsumo used to do? Steal jutsus through torture? - Tue Sep 29 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We should do that. - Tue Sep 29 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Tue Sep 29 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Having enough jutsus would make us very strong. The versaility. - Tue Sep 29 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm thinking.... - Tue Sep 29 13:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We capture missing-nin. - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then we torture them until they give us a satisfying amount of jutsus. - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do you know the interrogation jutsu? - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And if we find the wrong missing nin to take on? Like . . . If he's stronger than us. - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And yes I do. - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. Good point. - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe a dumb idea. - Tue Sep 29 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hope you do become the kage of this village though. I need something to do. Missions. - Tue Sep 29 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The sooner you get enemies the sooner I can entertain myself by killing them. - Tue Sep 29 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I want missions too . . . - Tue Sep 29 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Also . . . I'm not sure if this village has a kage. - Tue Sep 29 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "Village leader," kage...it's the same thing. - Tue Sep 29 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who cares. - Tue Sep 29 13:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yeah. Wonder why Erebus sent us here. - Tue Sep 29 13:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Could've gave me a mask if he wanted to keep his name cleared. - Tue Sep 29 13:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He must want us to work for whoever he assigns as the kage here. - Tue Sep 29 13:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Should I have told you that? - Tue Sep 29 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Probably not. Keep it to yourself. - Tue Sep 29 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 13:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Tue Sep 29 13:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ushinawa..... - Tue Sep 29 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I understand now. - Tue Sep 29 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He works with Fujitora. He gave Zenaki to him. - Tue Sep 29 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Probably. Maybe a bit of a stretch. - Tue Sep 29 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll find out for sure though. - Tue Sep 29 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sounds like a possible theory. - Tue Sep 29 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If.... - Tue Sep 29 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ushinawa and Fujitora are working together, it'd explain the "immeasurable force" comment. Of course it's possible Erebus was trying to play me. - Tue Sep 29 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We'll put a test to that immeasurable force. - Tue Sep 29 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ushinawa.... - Tue Sep 29 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The most intelligent and capable of that group. - Tue Sep 29 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He must be the leader. - Tue Sep 29 13:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He likes to work in the shadows like me which means he's extremely dangerous. - Tue Sep 29 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want him dead very soon. It has to be him first. - Tue Sep 29 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's the only way to deal wtih someone like that. - Tue Sep 29 14:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're becoming scarier. - Tue Sep 29 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been backed into a corner. - Tue Sep 29 14:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's possible Erebus plans on giving me to Ushinawa as a gift. - Tue Sep 29 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Since I explained things to him though, he may change his mind. It's why I did. - Tue Sep 29 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I knew that if the enemy's lying, I had to make sure Erebus had enough information to see through the lies. - Tue Sep 29 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Question is, will he care. - Tue Sep 29 14:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny. Ushinawa and friends suck at lying. - Tue Sep 29 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They won't last long. - Tue Sep 29 14:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway... - Tue Sep 29 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna go outside? - Tue Sep 29 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 29 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then picks herself up off of the bed and begins walking away, towards the entrance to the inn.* - Tue Sep 29 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Remember. . . - Tue Sep 29 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If anyone shows up...especially Ushinawa or one of his group with a lot of allies.... - Tue Sep 29 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I flee, follow me. Best to use Subterannean Voyage. - Tue Sep 29 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Most can't follow us underground. - Tue Sep 29 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That'll divide the number of people we have to fight. - Tue Sep 29 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That being said. - Tue Sep 29 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If it looks managable, we'll go for at least one kill. - Tue Sep 29 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Tue Sep 29 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That means less people to fight in the future. Less likely they'll be able to kill us the second time we meet them. - Tue Sep 29 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) brings her hands together to form the tiger seal. Eyes wander stay on the ground. The girl would love to be watching every single person that comes by but the truth is, that's just not practical. She does her best to stop the flow of her chakra. In the mean time she says "Anything you know about that group? Fighting styles, weaknesses...? Emotional weaknesses?"

Finally she manages to stop the flow of her chakra. Roughly she then shoves it throughout her body once more. She's getting better at it so she hardly has to concentrate now. However, that's with handseals. Kat's still far away from where she wants to be with this jutsu.* - Tue Sep 29 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: First thing I'll try will be talking. - Tue Sep 29 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I know how to soften them up that'd be best. - Tue Sep 29 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ushinawa uses Genjutsu at the very least. - Tue Sep 29 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though he said he's all around. - Tue Sep 29 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Unsure of Mariana . . . Most likely ninjutsu. - Tue Sep 29 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hideki unknown. - Tue Sep 29 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hideki summons snakes. - Tue Sep 29 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or at least, I think he does. - Tue Sep 29 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hanabi does. She gave him snake scales. Then I saw him talking to a snake. - Tue Sep 29 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fujitora.... - Tue Sep 29 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What do we know about him? - Tue Sep 29 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fuuinjutsu. - Tue Sep 29 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Right. Forgot about that. - Tue Sep 29 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: An old kazekage so most likely experienced. - Tue Sep 29 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fuuinjutsu...what good is that in a fight? - Tue Sep 29 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you catch a chance to touch your opponent . . .  - Tue Sep 29 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You could seal chakra away or movement. - Tue Sep 29 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Annoying. - Tue Sep 29 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Extremely annoying. - Tue Sep 29 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her butt in the dirt. With a genjutsu user presumably being the one hunting her, it's especially important she masters this jutsu. She's seen him paralyze. That means it's confirmed she'll need this jutsu mastered, and fast. Eyes close, and she subtly draws in a silent breath. She concentrates now on stopping the flow of her chakra and then shoving it throughout as quickly as possible.

She does this back-to-back, intending to push her chakra network to its limits. Occasionally they become warm with stress, warning her to stop. When they do, she does. And then the moment they cool off, she abuses them again. This goes on for probably an hour or more at the least.

"We should spar later." she says to Kilm, even as she continues her training. Chakra flow is stopped. "If we're not getting missions right now we need to have at least that to keep us warmed up." Roughly, she shoves chakra throughout once more. * - Tue Sep 29 14:35:31 2015
