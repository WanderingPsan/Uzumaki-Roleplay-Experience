<br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's back is to the wall and her arms are crossed. The girl's eyes are averted when she shakes her head and says "Kronos 'was' lonely while he was here, and tried very hard to make friends. I should say that much. It's possible him talking to her didn't mean anything."* - Mon Aug 31 02:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slips the gauntlets on.* - Mon Aug 31 03:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(Meme01) whispers: (One of u ask for Kronos to come back over ooc) - Mon Aug 31 04:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (skyped him) - Mon Aug 31 04:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (he could've passed out or something tho) - Mon Aug 31 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) follows.* - Mon Aug 31 04:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(Meme01) whispers: Mmm. Beth, keep yoursensing out to locate him. - Mon Aug 31 04:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(Meme01) whispers: I'm going to create a duck, so you can fly around and keep tabs on him - Mon Aug 31 04:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and climbs up into a tree.* - Mon Aug 31 04:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides out of the tree and then turns to follow, with palms on the back of her head and eyes averted.

"I can't explain very well because of the seals."* - Mon Aug 31 04:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off.* - Mon Aug 31 04:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scoffs a bit with a smile on her face. She said she was going to go get clothes and her baby sitter just walked away to go eat. Katsune takes advantage. While at the store she buys a bird and scroll. The girl then writes a letter and sends it off.

She's well aware that Amegakure people aren't shooting down birds that are 'leaving' the village. No...if that were the case, they'd have shot down the one that Paine sent out to trick Kronos, on Zetsumo's orders. * - Mon Aug 31 04:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || She buys two scrolls, actually, and two birds. She sends both off.* - Mon Aug 31 04:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow.* - Mon Aug 31 05:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink afterwords, and she frowns faintly. Eyes wander off, and she reaches up to scratch a cheek.

"...Right." she says, immediately turning on her heel and beginning to walk away.

"I'll wait at the training grounds."* - Mon Aug 31 05:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still walking.* - Mon Aug 31 05:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides her right foot backwards through the sand and lifts her arms up, taking a stance. The girl's hands are clenched partially, as if to suggest claws. After all, she'll be using both fists and palms in this sparring session.

Eyes rest on Zetsumo.* - Mon Aug 31 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, looking him up and down. "Yeah." she says. "I never use it against people that know I have it."

The girl then shrugs and rises up into a more upright position, having been cued to take an offensive position. Arms rise and hands meet to form seals. Palms meet after a sequence of five of them, and loud crackling is heard. Lightning-natured chakra seeps out of both palms in the form of one ball.

The girl then leans forwards and begins sprinting towards him, with the ball in hand.* - Mon Aug 31 05:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches at the sight of Zetsumo's water. Barely, she has time to come skidding to a stop and dart off to the side,spinning like a top on her feet in the process. As she does so, her lightning ball is sucked back up into her palms.

After all, he'd shot it the moment she'd taken her second step, so he was far away. She had time to dodge, barely.  It would've been extremely easy if not for one fact -- it's pretty hard for her eyes to keep up with just how fast this stream is.

With a subtle scoff through her nose -- one that suggests surprise rather than anything else -- Kat comes skidding to a stop once more. At the last moment, she'd got an idea. Arms rise and the heels of her palms meet. Without any delay, lightning-natured chakra leaves her palms in the form of a sphere.

Katsune directs it at the water, letting it fly. Whether or not it's conducted remains to be seen. Either way, with chakra flow gauntlets...no hand seals are required for this specific jutsu.* - Mon Aug 31 06:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is easily hit by Zetsumo's tendrils. Maybe she'd been able to dodge it had she seen it coming, but she didn't. Her attention had been on the man's water jutsu. She flinches fairly hard and releases a scoff-like yelp. Eyes briefly dart down to the point of impact. In the process, she's able to see the mud-wave aiming at her.

Had Zetsumo tried to wrap his tendrils around her waist -- which he surely would have done had this not been nothing more than a spar -- he'd easily have her beat. That not being the case, though, Kat turns on her heel and begins sprinting away without even a second thought.

The girl takes only a few steps to the east before she turns and begins sprinting off in a more diagonal direction, aiming to dodge. Once more she only barely manages to do so. Unfortunately, it hadn't occurred to her until only now to begin preparing a certain jutsu.

Just as the mud slide is skidding past her, Kat is forming hand seals. Five are weaved in all. Once they're complete, abruptly, a loud crackling is heard. Bright, vibrant lightning covers her right arm in full and makes its way to her palm.

Once there she drops down into a crouching position as quickly as she can. Her earth flash jutsu is directed into Zetsumo's general direction. It's a technique that can span a wide area and she has to aim it to the west for this to work, so only some amount of her technique's lightning might make it into Zetsumo's jutsu. Either way, it'd presumably be conducted as it races towards him.

The ground is disturbed in many areas with small amounts of dirt being send flying. It's nowhere near as impressive as Zetsumo's own earth flash, but loud thunderous clapping is heard nonetheless with each bright flash that follows.* - Mon Aug 31 06:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is hit in the face by a mud bullet. A very loud, pained yelp is released. The girl is sent turning briefly, and her face hits the ground shortly afterwords.

She's quick to put her palms to the ground, but she's left prone for a long while afterwords. Her head is shaken roughly as if to stop ringing in her ears. The girl is taken by surprise yet again when she's hit by even more cannon-balls of earth.

Naturally she's sent rolling off to the east, along the ground. Katsune squirms wildly in the process. Presumably, she'd eventually come skidding to a stop, now covered in mud. She's left prone on the ground with her face planted yet again. Arms rest at her sides, and all of her limbs tremble. They begin moving shortly afterwords, as if to allow her to pick herself up.

She's very slow at this point, though.* - Mon Aug 31 06:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hits the gate very hard. Immediately afterwords, like a rag doll, she falls to the ground. Very weak groans follow, as well as weak shaking.* - Mon Aug 31 06:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes out, completely.* - Mon Aug 31 06:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't resist of course, because she's unconscious.* - Mon Aug 31 06:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains on her back with legs and arms sprawled out around her. An energetic but blank expression is on her face, and her eyes are on the sky. She says nothing.

With her best friend as good as dead and her own death being as good as schedueled as far as she's concerned, she has little drive to do anything.* - Mon Aug 31 08:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) frowns a bit and averts her eyes, far. A shrug follows, as well as a quiet and brief sigh. The girl then turns to face the east. Her head rests in her left palm, and her elbow is planted in the sand. With her right hand she rubs at the back of her head.

"Never mind." she says.* - Mon Aug 31 09:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I accept it." she says.

A glance is then sent Zetsumo's way. A glance that doesn't seem to register his smile.

"Still, when I confessed I was thinking he dug his own grave and deserved to die for stupidity. The truth is, it wasn't like that."* - Mon Aug 31 09:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches in response to being flicked. Immediately the girl jumps up into a sitting position with a very quiet yelp-like scoff. Her lips stretch into a frown and both hands dart up to her forehead.

A glancfe is sent Zetsumo's way and she takes a moment to rub at said head. She does this as briefly as possible, specifically because of how shameful it looks. A subtle scowl is produced, and her eyes are averted.

"No really, Zetsumo." she says.

"You've got this all wrong. I'm not soft. I wouldn't say it for Orakuru if it wasn't true."* - Mon Aug 31 09:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander a bit, back and forth.

"Well I mean come to think of it...it's more complicated than that. He could be a traitor totally."* - Mon Aug 31 09:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is lying in the dirt on her side and facing the east. The girl rolls over onto her belly at this time and rests her head in both palms. Eyes wander absent-mindedly and in a way that suggests boredom. She says nothing.* - Mon Aug 31 10:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is also facing the north.* - Mon Aug 31 10:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and reaches down to her coin-purse-like-bag to pull out some yen. With that she then turns around and sits up, with palms resting at either side of her. Her money is then placed on the sand at her side to show that she has it.

"Sure." she says.* - Mon Aug 31 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Kilm who's obviously older. Her eyes are then averted and she holds her right hand out, with the palm up.* - Mon Aug 31 11:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the dice and begins shaking them within a very loose fist. She spends several seconds doing so. Afterwords she turns her arm a bit and tosses the dice forwards onto the sand. Eyes remain locked on said dice the entire time.* - Mon Aug 31 11:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lies back down and stares blankly at the sky again, briefly. Eyes wander off afterwords.* - Mon Aug 31 11:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches fairly hard, jumping up into a sitting position once more with a scoff as she's soaked. Arms rise to shield her face, and eyes close, but not before her hair is wet. A subtle scowl is produced, and her cheeks turn pink -- which contrary to popular and ridiculous opinion does not necessarily mean she wants the D.

An eyebrow twitches. Arms fall down afterwords and briefly she eyes Zetsumo. Afterwords she averts her eyes and slides her money over to the boss.* - Mon Aug 31 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the dice with a nod and sends them forward herself.* - Mon Aug 31 11:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has a smug smile on her face. Eyes wander off. "Hmm...?" she inquires.
"One-hundred thousand, you mean?"* - Mon Aug 31 11:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tosses the dice to Zetsumo, aiming for the chest. "You first." she says.* - Mon Aug 31 11:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. With a sheepish smile on her face and eyes averted, she rolls the dice.* - Mon Aug 31 11:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and slides the money over to Kilm.* - Mon Aug 31 11:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Mon Aug 31 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is too cool to explain herself.* - Mon Aug 31 11:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gives Zetsumo a glance.* - Mon Aug 31 11:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) said her former comment in a light-hearted manner.* - Mon Aug 31 12:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides twenty-five thousand over to Kilm, assuming that's how it works.* - Mon Aug 31 12:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles smugly at this and takes her money.* - Mon Aug 31 12:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes and reaches up to pour the beer into her mouth. Her smile's smug at first, though it fades into a weak almost-frown shortly afterwords. A glance is sent towards the beverage as it nears her mouth. The smell. She frowns a bit. Her left hand finds her nose and she pinches it shut. A breath is taken.

Afterwords she begins pouring it down her throat, chugging it.* - Mon Aug 31 12:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes another mug and eyes it a bit critically. A glance is sent off to the side, followed by a shrug. Afterwords she brings it up to her mouth and chugs it down as well, plugging her nose up once more. Three or four gulps are committed to this one.* - Mon Aug 31 12:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and takes another mug in-hand. "I grew up eating slop." she says. "You're never gonna find someone more durable than me."

She chugs another mug, this time without much hesitation. It doesn't take long for the taste to grow on a person -- particularly once they're tipsy.* - Mon Aug 31 12:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) drinks another mug, not feeling anything yet.* - Mon Aug 31 12:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes glaze over a bit. Her right leg crossed over her left, and her arms cross. She sways to and fro just a tiny, little bit. Her smug smile remains.* - Mon Aug 31 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up another mug and glances over at the two competitors. Briefly she considers ways she might cheat, but none come to mind. The alchohol is poured down once more.* - Mon Aug 31 13:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up her mug once more. A shakey breath is taken through the nose. She stares down only at her beer, and for a very long while. She doesn't sway, as she's doing her best to at least 'look' like she's not drunk -- as if somehow that'll magically make it more true.

...An eyebrow twitches.* - Mon Aug 31 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) also chugs of course.* - Mon Aug 31 13:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't take it back. Eyes are closed.* - Mon Aug 31 13:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up another mug. She stares down at it for a moment. Afterwords she begins it up to her lips. Slowly this time, she begins sipping, audibly. She sways to and fro a bit as she does so, with eyes wandering.

After only a second or so she lowers the mug. Eyes close, and more seconds pass. Another breath is taken through the nose, and she then resolves to pour the rest down.

The mug is held in hand for a while. She keeps it there, never putting it down. "I don't even chair if I'm dunk." she says with a slur.* - Mon Aug 31 13:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches a trembling arm over to slide her mug onto the table. Her left hand folllows to join her right, and she slides it over all the way to Zetsumo for no apparent reason. Eyes are averted. "Y-You drink it. I-Idiot." she says, with a faint blush on her cheeks.

Absolutely nothing is in that cup.* - Mon Aug 31 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scoffs quietly and pulls her coin-purse-like-bag off of her belt. In the process she pulls her haori off as well, alongside her bag of shurikens and kunai. Briefly she examines these things with a subtle scowl on her face, as if unsure whether or not anything's wrong.

Eventually she shrugs. "Not e-even mine." she says in the same slur.
"Don't care!"

She slides them over to the boss with her nose stuck up a bit.* - Mon Aug 31 13:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Of course most notably, she'd just given him the 300,000 yen.* - Mon Aug 31 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) releases a burp. It's brief, and Katsune-sized. She frowns and her eyebrows shift in a way that suggest discomfort. Briefly she glances around at the people in the room. Lastly with a scowl she stares at Zetsumo, as if daring him to comment.

Afterwords she looks away.

"Yeah." she says.* - Mon Aug 31 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches fairly hard as she's flicked. Immediately her arms rise up towards her forehead. They don't reach it, though. The girl misses, with both palms finding her face. She squirms a bit, and leans backwards.

The bench she's sitting on as a result is sent rocking backwards, and she hits the floor, hard. It's loud, and her bench audibly cracks in some places.

A blush is on her cheeks, and she picks herself up onto all fours. THe teen sways to and fro in place, and stares at the floor with the same scowl on her face. "H-hey!" she shouts, with a hiccup.

"Y-You're not boss of -me-!!"

She remains on the floor, not sure whether or not she needs to stand up, or what the point of that would be.* - Mon Aug 31 13:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is picked up. Briefly she squirms, though she stops shortly afterwords. Her skirt does fall down, but it doesn't matter. She's wearing a body suit. Her hair and arms hang down towards the ground. She examines her body briefly with a frown that suggests humble discontent.

Afterwords she looks back up at Zetsumo with a subtle scowl on her face.

"H-hey! Stop tellin' me what to do!" she says, swinging back and forth in the air involuntarily.* - Mon Aug 31 14:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't exactly shouting this, though. It's an inside voice. It's relatively humble.* - Mon Aug 31 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression relaxes shortly after she's given advice. A faint frown is on her face when she glances to and fro. She says nothing.* - Mon Aug 31 14:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) releases another burp. This one's a bit longer than before.

Nothing about her face suggests shame.* - Mon Aug 31 14:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. She says nothing. Rather than speaking she effortlessly curls at the waist, putting her head upright so that her brain doesn't explode.

She stares off at the wall, stubbornly, with the same frown on her face.

"I want cake." she says in a slur.* - Mon Aug 31 14:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. She stopped being completely shit-faced pretty much the second she got picked up upside down.

"....'You're the best.' "she quotes, nearly in monotone.* - Mon Aug 31 14:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) collapses back into her former position shortly afterwords. Being drunk, she doesn't have much strength at the moment.* - Mon Aug 31 14:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) collapses onto her hands and knees, having caught herself on her hands as she hit the ground. The girl shakes her head roughly and briefly afterwords, as if shaking off dizzyness or her drunken stupor.

Katsune then rises to her feet, swaying to and fro only a bit, and brushes herself off. Arms then cross and she remains standing with eyes averted, facing the east.* - Mon Aug 31 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs lightly at the water. She eyes it for a moment before bringing it to her mouth and drinking much of it in just a few gulps.

A glance is sent Zenaki's way afterwords. "Gonna go sleep..." she says. Afterwords she turns on her heel and walks away, drining more water as she moves.* - Mon Aug 31 14:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Mon Aug 31 14:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is sitting on her butt in the sand with legs stretched out in front of her and palms in the dirt at her sides. A glance is sent Zetsumo's way. "'Morning." she says.

She has no actual reason to smile, but her expression is still one that suggests a content mood nontheless.* - Mon Aug 31 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's almost-smile fades into a faint frown. Eyes wander off. A shrug follows. She's not drunk, either.* - Mon Aug 31 23:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. Eyes wander. She's not sure what he's talking about. She could guess, but her guess would be one that's not in her favor, so she opts not to.* - Mon Aug 31 23:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and reclines down to her back. Her head is rested in both palms, and one leg crosses over the other. She's not worried about being covered in sand. With the hidden mole jutsu in her arsenal, it's something that's easily dealt with.* - Tue Sep 01 00:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) absent-mindedly examines the horizon. Yeah, she's not interested in helping anyone capture her best friend, of course.* - Tue Sep 01 00:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and rises to her feet. With that she then turns on her heel and begins sprinting away.* - Tue Sep 01 00:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She says nothing. Obviously she'd not be trusted for this.* - Tue Sep 01 01:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Zetsumo. Arms cross and weight shifts a bit. Her expression remains blank, as if she gives no fucks one way or the other.

"Ya know..." she says.
"I'm really surprised you actually think Kuro was a threat."* - Tue Sep 01 01:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at him again. "You're slipping right now. You haven't been able to keep a cool head."* - Tue Sep 01 01:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. She's not a very supporting person.* - Tue Sep 01 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. With that she then turns on her heel to lead the way to wherever.* - Tue Sep 01 02:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Tue Sep 01 02:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and makes her way to the fridge. Her left hand rests on her hip for the moment and her weight shifts. "Anything in specific you want?" she inquires.* - Tue Sep 01 02:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and pulls out a rather large bowl of sushi. A very large platter is then aquired. She fills it up with the assorted raw fish. Afterwords she takes it in her left hand -- resting it on the upwards-facing palm as if she's a waitress -- and makes her way over to Kilm. As has become normal for her, she walks with a bit of a swagger. The older she gets, the prouder she becomes of what she herself is capable of, mentally and otherwise.

As a result, she becomes less submissive too -- even to Zetsumo.

The girl gently places the plate on the table in front of Kilm. It's equally far away from both her and him both. Briefly she makes eye contact with a blank expression on her face to let him know that it's for both of them. With that she sits down. Her right leg crosses over her left. The girl's left arm rests in her lap, and she picks up the nearest sushi roll.

Lazily she stuffs it into her mouth.* - Tue Sep 01 02:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hasn't noticed the eye color, but only because she never noted the original eyes. She's never looked.

After all, she wouldn't want him or anyone else to see her looking.

She's quiet.* - Tue Sep 01 02:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, still looking away.* - Tue Sep 01 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Tue Sep 01 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Tue Sep 01 02:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at him. She doesn't react though. "Either way, nothing I said got him into trouble. I just felt at the time like it did."* - Tue Sep 01 02:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Doesn't matter to me." she says.
"I'm not emotional."* - Tue Sep 01 02:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. Her eyes wander further off. Afterwords she slowly nods.

"All of it." she says.* - Tue Sep 01 03:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow at this. Afterwords she takes a moment to slowly look the boy up and down, taking in every detail.

"What?" she inquires, looking away afterwords. "New clothes?"* - Tue Sep 01 03:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "You do seem less entertaining lately."* - Tue Sep 01 03:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes eye contact. Her eyes seem to not be focused on the pupils, but the color. Afterwords she looks at him properly, as if giving him attention.

"What 'about' the eyes?" she inquires.* - Tue Sep 01 03:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the refrigerator, a bit slowly. Eyes wander off afterwords. Her expression's fairly deadpan.

"...Want some sake?" she inquires.

To her, the solution to this problem is simple. Kilm's being lame. Alchohol will make him less lame.* - Tue Sep 01 03:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow, looking Zetsumo up and down. "Oh." she says, having been standing with her palms on the back of her head. Arms cross at this time.

"Alright...."

She turns to follow.* - Tue Sep 01 19:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Truthfully though she doesn't appear to be in a bad mood.

"'Course I'm grateful." she says.* - Tue Sep 01 19:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her butt, looking the boss up an down to study his position as she does so. Arms cross, indian style. She only shrugs in response to his question, seeing it as rhetorical.* - Tue Sep 01 19:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, looking him up and down. "...Yeah. I'll find uses for this." she says. Eyes then find the ground. It doesn't take long for Katsune's gauntlets to begin crackling. They emit tiny sparks of blue electrcity. 

It's very bright. They start at the arms and make their way down, to the palms, as if she's preparing the usual lightning ball. This is because that's her intention. She's used to that technique, so she uses similar methods to get the chakra to form. 

Eyes find the ground, and a deep breath is taken. The lightning on her arms flickers out of sight and fades away. This is repeated many times. Eventually Katsune brings her hands together, both being clenched partially as if to grasp at something. Fingertips meet.

Occasionally a strip of lightning crackles at other parts of her body as well, before raining down to the ground.* - Tue Sep 01 19:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches as she's flicked in the forehead. Her head turns away a bit, and her left palm darts up to her head. "T-Tsch...!" she scoffs, rubbing at the sore spot. "A-ass..." she whispers, frowning hard. Eyes tremble.

She then turns to face him again. A nod follows, and she resumes her efforts.* - Tue Sep 01 19:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) focuses her chakra once more. She summons it to her gut. Once there she concentrates, hard. Chakra control isn't her strong suit. Enormous amounts of time pass. Maybe twenty minutes or more. Eventually, blue chakra becomes visible.

It sticks to her gut and sways to and fro, and stirs, in a spiral. An eyebrow twitches at the sound of Kitora's remark, and Katsune's expression becomes sour. Anticipation is apparent.* - Tue Sep 01 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes close, and she scowls subtly. As best she can she keeps her annoyance in check. It's hard to learn when you're not calm. Carefully, she spreads chakra further throughout her body. It takes a long amount of time, but not hours. 

Kat's mastered Suimen and it's hardest to get chakra to the feet. As such, this should be no problem for her.Eventually, chakra is coating her entire body. More deep breaths are taken. This chakra begins vibrating and moving very quickly and erratically. Part of the process of converting said chakra to raiton.

Eventually, loud crackling is heard. At her right side, most of the chakra is used up -- converted into a burst of raiton. It dies down afterwords. The teen's chakra is then more spread out, and little is left to her right side at all.

Once more, Kat gathers chakra and spreads it out. One final attempt is made. This time the crackling is much louder. A very large burst of lightning is released from all sides of her body at once. It covers six full feet or so, whipping out at the air in every direction to damage enemies that aren't there. Eyes then open and kat takes a moment to examine herself contently. A nod follows.* - Tue Sep 01 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet. Her palms then move to brush sand off of her butt.* - Tue Sep 01 20:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. Arms meet behind her back. "I dunno." she says.
"I don't mind much, really."

The truth is, she'd rather not making enemies of sociopathic Kenryoku murderers. It's why she's always watching her mouth.* - Tue Sep 01 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches, eyeing the finger nervously. By reflex, the teen quickly steps off to the side. Just barely she manages to dodge it -- unless Zetsumo manages to redirect it or something. Her reflexes 'are' quite good, and submissive or not...she can't just let him keep beating her.

A frown is on her face, and discomfort becomes apparent again. A glance is then sent Kitora's way.* - Tue Sep 01 20:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || And Zetsumo's rather far away of course.* - Tue Sep 01 20:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't a pervert though. At least not overtly. Eyes wander.* - Tue Sep 01 20:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes. Afterwords she turns on her heel. "I'm gonna go train." she says. With that the very proud and dignified teen would then begin walking away, quickly. She's already shamed herself enough for one day as far as she's concerned.* - Tue Sep 01 20:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs and comes to a stop. She then turns around to face the two. Palms rest on her hips and she glances back and forth between them. "Uh." she says.

"Honestly sex with a fat guy. No really. You're not gonna humiliate her otherwise."* - Tue Sep 01 20:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is a very sadistic individual.* - Tue Sep 01 20:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || With no empathy whatsoever.* - Tue Sep 01 20:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns around and wanders off with a nod. These two seemed like they might like some privacy.* - Tue Sep 01 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is on her back with arms and legs spread out. Eyes are on the sky and a faint frown is on her face -- one that suggests boredom. Extreme boredom.* - Wed Sep 02 04:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off, and her frown deepens.

"I have..." she lies.* - Wed Sep 02 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes go out of focus for a moment. Her frown returns. It's a slightly cold expression. Eyes wander off afterwords and her expression relaxes. Briefly she shakes her head, as if thinking to herself. With that she then turns on her side to face the south. Her left elbow finds the grass, and her palm finds her head. With her right palm, she rubs the back of said head.

"Maybe." she says.* - Wed Sep 02 04:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. "You said you'd interrogate him first." she says.* - Wed Sep 02 04:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs once more. "Beth told you I'm loyal." she says.* - Wed Sep 02 04:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rubs her face with her right palm. "Not really." she says.

The girl then turns over to watch the boss. "But show me anyway." Her frown remains.* - Wed Sep 02 05:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. In truth, she's too tired for anything exciting -- such as watching Zetsumo level villages.* - Wed Sep 02 05:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. Her expression remains the same. As always, she tells the truth. After all, as often as she tells the complete, unadulterated truth -- way more often than most people, and much deeper truths -- it's impossible to tell when she actually is lying.

"Truth is..." she says.
"I don't want to serve you. I do it because I don't want you to kill me. I don't want to live my life knowing one of your people might come after me either. I wouldn't be afraid of -them-. I just wouldn't enjoy myself if I had to think twice before following someone into a private area for a date."* - Wed Sep 02 05:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and turns to follow. She brushes sand off of herself as she walks. Sand in her hair falls down to the ground of its own accord, by the same means as the hidden mole jutsu.* - Wed Sep 02 06:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "It's true." she says. "No money. I like sushi though. Gimme a whole lot of sushi."* - Wed Sep 02 06:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is sitting with her arms crossed, and her right leg crossed over her left. It's tempting to rest her head on her hands, but that's indignant and she's not an indignant person.* - Wed Sep 02 06:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances up at Zetsumo with a shrug. "Kenryoku's the closest thing I've ever had to family." she says.

"When the people that adopted me died, I felt nothing. I should've been happy, but I didn't even feel 'that'. Didn't know my actual parents for long. I barely remember them. Their faces, a bit, but that's it."* - Wed Sep 02 06:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit and averts her eyes. "Wasn't trying to save your feelings." she says.

"I was just explaining I wasn't stupid enough to insult you."* - Wed Sep 02 06:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) finds the food now that it's finally arrived. A hand reaches down to pick up a skewered squid. A big one. Not because she wanted it in specific.

Because it's the only way to pick up an awful lot of food without looking hungry. If she were to grab a hand-full of something, it'd look silly. Eyes then wander off, and she takes as big a bite as she can manage without looking silly. She eats slowly enough to not be considered gross, but she barely chews.* - Wed Sep 02 06:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances blank towards Kilm, saying nothing. Not for any particular reason or not because it's him -- just because that's kind've how she is. She doesn't react to anything Zetsumo does either.

"I'm willing to do literally anything you tell me to." she says with a glance up at him, having paused for only the brief moment from her eating.
"Not sure what else you need to know."

Eyes find her squid.

"But...I do come from Iwagakure. That's where I was, at first." She stuffs more food in her mouth.* - Wed Sep 02 07:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stuffs her face more. She'd drink, but she's busy eating at the moment. In response to Zetsumo's question she says, with a glance up at him, "Sixteen."

"And I dunno. The truth is....I can't tell you about myself without sounding arrogant. That's why I never tell anyone when they ask. I'd look like an ass."* - Wed Sep 02 07:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. She doesn't speak, at least for a very long while. If she's gonna say anything at all, she at least should choose her words very, very carefully.* - Wed Sep 02 07:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I don't revel in it. That'd be stupid. I definitely don't mind it though....as long as I'm doing it for a reason. As long as I am, it doesn't matter who. Kids, old people. I don't even care."* - Wed Sep 02 07:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up a glass of sake and pours it into her mouth. Slowly but smoothly. She downs an entire cup fairly quickly...which isn't a lot of liquid. It's an awful lot of actual alchohol though, because it's sake.

That's not to say she's trying to get drunk either. She's aware of how well she can tolerate it.* - Wed Sep 02 07:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smoothly and especially lazily pours another cup of sake into her mouth. She's aiming for "almost tipsy."* - Wed Sep 02 08:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. Eyes wander off, a bit quickly.* - Wed Sep 02 08:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stuffs more fish into her mouth.* - Wed Sep 02 08:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Ea'ing" she murmurs past her entirely stuffed mouth, stuffing more in.* - Wed Sep 02 08:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, and eats more fish.* - Wed Sep 02 08:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, and rolls her dice too.* - Wed Sep 02 08:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides the associated bottles over to him. "Drink up." she says with a bit of a smile on her face.* - Wed Sep 02 08:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) fixes the bottle situation and then fills his cup.* - Wed Sep 02 08:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches over to quickly take a much bigger cup from her own collection and hold it in her lap. She does this quietly, while Kilm's still blindfolded, and keeps it out of view. "Yeah." she says. "I'm done."* - Wed Sep 02 09:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls.* - Wed Sep 02 09:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smirks.* - Wed Sep 02 09:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || In a cheeky manner.* - Wed Sep 02 09:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) fills up the same cup. Until the rolls stop being in her favor, she has no reason to cheat.* - Wed Sep 02 09:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) notes that since this is sake, it can't take long...especially since he drank 2 cups before we began. Sake is about 4x stronger than beer, and he didn't take that lonjg to get drunk before.* - Wed Sep 02 09:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolled too.* - Wed Sep 02 09:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pours.* - Wed Sep 02 09:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolled.* - Wed Sep 02 09:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs and rolls again.* - Wed Sep 02 09:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pours. This has gotta be it. He's gotta be drunk by now.* - Wed Sep 02 09:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I'm done." she says.* - Wed Sep 02 09:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet. "'Night people." With that she then turns to wander off.* - Wed Sep 02 09:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "My life wasn't that good anyway."* - Wed Sep 02 20:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwordsw she turns to follow, walking.* - Wed Sep 02 20:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) follows. Palms rest on the back of her head and eyes wander. Presumably, they don't follow the roads. It's apparent she gives no fucks at the moment. This is the wildnerness after all and they're with an army. 

Zetsumo is here too. Nothing short of a kage is a threat in the current circumstances. "If I die," she says, "someone give my gloves to someone cute. Really cute. Someone I'd like. Not Beth."* - Wed Sep 02 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) presumably at some point the group had camped somewhere. They camp often, as otherwise they'd arrive with empty stomaches and sore legs. No intelligent leader would do that, and Zetsumo's not unintelligent. When camping, Katsune seems to be in high spirits for once. That's what often happens when you find out you might be about to die.

People will often be excited rather than depressed. It's one part bravado and one part excitement due to the thrill. Kat is one of those types. That's not to say she acts like an idiot -- she's just social and not mean to anyone.* - Wed Sep 02 20:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's knees shake. A weak smile is on her face, and her lips twitch occasionally. Arms are crossed, and she stares off in Sunagakure's general direction. Anxiety is obvious to say the least.* - Wed Sep 02 20:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) calms herself and walks closer, though her weak smile remains. Not pretense. Bravado. Presumably she's wading through Amegakure men.

The teen places herself twenty feet or so closer if allowed. Eyes wander through enemy forces. She's curious as to whether or not she'll see anyone she knows, but presumably the enemy has lots of people too, so that wouldn't be likely.* - Wed Sep 02 21:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly sides her right foot backwards through the sand. She doesn't necessarily plant her feet into the ground. Arms rise, and her hands clench partially as if to form claws. Fingers stretch out, briefly, and a silent deep breath is taken. Eyes wander. She calms down for the most part. Fear is replaced by excitement.

This is still a very intimidating situation, but she focuses on turning her feelings into bloodlust rather than fear. The teen has placed herself thirty feet or so southeast of one of Zetsumo's monsters, at its flank. Hopefully close enough to where it won't likely hit her, and close enough that it might protect her from enemy swarms, or at least the fog of war.* - Wed Sep 02 21:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains where she is for now. For various reasons she opts to, for now, remain on the defensive -- not offensive. It's strategy.* - Wed Sep 02 21:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes find the ground, only briefly, and she frowns a bit. If something's underneath Zetsumo, she needs to know what it is. The ground beneath her own feet softens, and slowly Katsune begins sinking. Slowly as in not her full speed, but she'd be submerged within four full seconds.

The teen senses out whatever's beneath the ground, by way of the magnetic forces that hidden mole allows one to sense. Eyes close while she concentrates. It makes no difference, though. Them being open aids in absolutely nothing while underground.* - Wed Sep 02 21:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and begins sprinting forwards, molding the earth with her chakra as she goes to get it out of her way. She isn't slowed down in the slightest, because that's exactly how the hidden mole jutsu works.

As she runs, a kunai is taken from her kunai holster. The closest hedgehog is targetted first. Realistically....? Presumably....? With them all evenly spread out and moving in a circular motion, at least one is undoubtedly pretty close to her right now. She wasn't at all far away from Zetsumo and the hedgehogs were aiming to dig around both him and his monsters -- which puts her very close to them by default.

Within only a moment, Kat is eventually at one of these beasts -- unless it'd been forced to move out of formation and run off in an opposite direction. Either way, she chases it like a bat flying out of hell, not giving up for even a moment. Senses remain alert for the other hedgehogs' positions.

Should Katsune stumble upon the hedgehog's own tunnel -- which seems likely -- she plants her feet and sprints with even less effort, no longer using her hidden mole jutsu.* - Wed Sep 02 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (make sure to admin help - Wed Sep 02 22:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (You can use jutsus. - Wed Sep 02 22:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Besides hiding like a mole since the first was jut activating - Wed Sep 02 22:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is already on a hedgehog's ass so she's basically safe. She's on the same level as they are and thus immuned to the traps. Speaking of which, she's now literally at one's flank, within striking distance, since it'd been running away and not confronting her.

When the incoming pitfall is sensed by way of magnetic forces, Katsune runs lower -- still within striking distance by way of the length of her arm.

This summon also decided seemingly that the trap as more important than the kunoichi trailing it. At this time Katsune strikes with her kunai, aiming to visciously impale its left, back haunch. She'd smoothly cut through the leg entirely in this motion, likely severing a nerve and rendering the leg useless. The bone would be scraped at most, if touched at all.

Or at least, that's the attempt that she's making.* - Wed Sep 02 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop, pausing for breath. The girl doesn't need to apply chakra for the moment because she's not moving and she's not 'that' far underground. Eyes close and she then focuses her magnetic sensing on the goings-on above. Before acting, she's seeing what the situation is. Whether she comes up directly or in a sneaky manner depends on what's happening.

A breath is taken. Her face is a bit moist.* - Thu Sep 03 00:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way up to the surface. With a huff she appears at Kitara's side, pulling herself out of the ground by an arm. The hole seals up behind her and her feet are planted. After drawing another kunai from her holster, Katsune takes a stance next to her comrade.

Eyes wander and she assesses the situation. Briefly she glances up above to determine whether or not anyone's still flying.* - Thu Sep 03 00:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) only briefly looks at Kuro. Afterwords her attention is spread evenly towards her enemies once more.

"I'm on Zetsumo's side Kuro!" she shouts with a stern expression on her face, saying little more. A discussion in the heat of battle is impossible. A single short and meaningful comment or two would have to do.

"I fight for the winning team! You know that!"* - Thu Sep 03 01:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't going after him that. That nigga OP af.* - Thu Sep 03 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) though** - Thu Sep 03 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't attacking Kuro anyway. Her eyes are ahead. What you can infer about what she said, and what she actually said...are two different things.

Eyes find Dravae's insects. The woman turns and begins straffing to the north, to take shelter among Zetsumo's earth grudges.

Dravae's attack picking out Zetsumo and his Kenryoku specifically -- and ignoring Amegakure people that are clouding his vision -- doesn't seem viable. It's likely only the smallest few insects could possibly target her in specific.

Should they try, though, the air around Katsune lights up quite abruptly with a loud, reverberating bang of crackling lightning. Any and all insects in her vicinity would be fried, almost definitely.

At the very least, they're stunned so the grudges have time to make a move. Katsune's arms whip forwards rapidly and with her kunai she cuts up as many bugs as she can.

Albeit again, logically, there are not many near her.* - Thu Sep 03 01:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns and begins sprinting to the east with Zetsumo's suggestion. He'd signaled a retreat so she's retreating. Presumably everyone else is too? Presumably, she's also alongside earth grudges. Kunai are quickly sheathed in their holsters.

Katsune does her best to specfifically stay ahead of one of Zetsumo's beasts until she's scooped up. Can't risk spending chakra on a certain evasive maneuver when she has cover.* - Thu Sep 03 02:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face Zetsumo, standing with arms crossed and a blank expression on her face. Blank as in not cold or unenthusiastic. She looks neither pleased nor unhappy.

With a shrug she says "I wanted to fight but I was a bit lost after Kitora disappeared. I had no idea what was going on."

Kat's eyes then wander off. "And you didn't expect me to fight Kuro."* - Thu Sep 03 02:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) walks with her head held high and a blank expression on her face. Palms rest on the back of her head. A blank expression because she's torn between multiple emotions. 

On the one hand, her life mattered today. She played a major roll in thwarting Kronos's plan to use a pitfall to wipe out most of Zetsumo's army and definitely kill everyone ultimately. 

She wouldn't have been able to even notice the hedgehogs if not for Kitora's sensing but still, she played a roll. The entire situation was a thrill too. It also all went to show herself how capable she actually is.  On the other hand, the entire battle happened so that Katsune could be made to kill her boyfriend with her own hand. She also happened to like Kronos.* - Thu Sep 03 02:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go sleep, without a word.* - Thu Sep 03 03:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to Zetsumo's side with arms crossed, and a blank expression on her face. When she comes to a stop, her weight shifts a bit. Her eyes aren't even on him.

Almost as if it's become natural for her to just hang out with him. The man who wants to kill her best friend, and make her do it.* - Thu Sep 03 07:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances up at Zetsumo. She shakes her head during the motion. "Never heard of it." she says.* - Thu Sep 03 07:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) forgets to breath for a moment. A silent breath follows as she takes this in, and she slowly tilts her head to the side, carefully looking Zetsumo up and down. Am eyebrrow rises just a bit.

"...You mean...that's not just speed." Her mouth is very slightly agape, if only or a moment.

Why? Because she catches on quickly. With a jutsu, she can become five times as fast -- or at least, seemingly so. Naturally, she fantasizes immediately that this could turn her into a killing machine.* - Thu Sep 03 07:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scowls just a tiny bit with a glance over at Zetsumo. Cheeks turn a bit pink.* - Thu Sep 03 07:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Alright..." Kat says, looking him up and down blankly once more. Arms rise and hands meet. She forms the tiger hand seal. She then makes eye contact again and awaits further instructions.* - Thu Sep 03 08:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The teen then begins forming chakra in her gut. It doesn't take long. She's decent at chakra control, and she's a chuunin-leveled shinobi quite literally -- if only barely. It spins woldly once there.

She unravels it and then focuses it again, forcing pressure to build up. Once done, Katsune releases all of this chakra at once to the mentioned locations. The girl visibly tenses up at the end of this, and eyes wander a bit. That was just a test.

Katsune then turns to face the west. She repeats the same procedure with her chakra. This time, the moment she feels chakra in her muscles, she darts forwards. Conveniently enough as it so happens Kat is already in fact a blur to people with normal eye sight. A blur they can easily keep track of, but a blur.

As such, it should be no surprise that already, she flickers in and out of sight. The girl stops moving some ten feet or so away, having not gone far at all. "H-Heh!" Katsune cries out with a bit of excitement. Legs and arms tremble, and she struggles to even draw breath.

It's after this that Katsune realizes...she's light-hearted. She sways to and fro a bit, and her mouth falls very slightly agape. Abruptly, Kat's right palm finds her mouth. "Hchuck!" she gags, falling down onto her knees. Shortly afterwords, the girl turns to face the south. Out comes a small amount of vomit. She coughs several times more, choking.

Groans follow, and she blushes very hard. Shame....
More coughing. Kat's eyes turn watery, and she shakes her head. She says nothing.* - Thu Sep 03 08:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet with a shrug, and eyes closed. A shrug, to pretend she feels no shame. She doesn't want to give Zetsumo the satisfaction. Body language tells no lies, though. Her blush remains. The girl turns and walks away with her head held high.* - Thu Sep 03 08:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross.* - Thu Sep 03 16:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I'm curious." she says.* - Thu Sep 03 16:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Thu Sep 03 16:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is staring at her blankly.* - Thu Sep 03 16:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Yeah I suggest we do." she says. The girl then takes a few steps towards her, maintaining eye contact, as if to guide her towards the gates. She comes to a stop, waiting for her to begin moving.* - Thu Sep 03 16:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs silently through the nose, eying the boy with a faint frown on her face, up and down.* - Thu Sep 03 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scratches her cheek. Eyes wander. Her left hand rests on her hip and her weight shifts a bit as she tries to come up with ways to teach this.* - Thu Sep 03 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and wanders into the store.* - Thu Sep 03 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Alright...." Katsune says, turning on her heel and wandering off. "I'll be back in a few hours." she says.

The girl then wanders off, disappearing into her house for an entire hour or two at the least. Kitora is given the option to follow. It takes that long for her to fill out the scrolls, doing her best to be as eloquent and clear as possible in her instructions.

Due to the labor required, the truth is, she'd never do this if they weren't preparing for wars.

Eventually though, Kat comes to find Kitora afterwords. Both scrolls are then offered up. "There ya go." she says.* - Thu Sep 03 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Thu Sep 03 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) quietly and gently sets herself down. One leg crosses over the other, and her palms rest at either side of her on the bench.* - Fri Sep 04 02:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't speak since that'd be rude. She does reach over to Paine's plate if there is one, though, and help herself to some of her food, sicne she's not Zetsumo. Eyes are averted.* - Fri Sep 04 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) does it anyway.* - Fri Sep 04 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's mouth is full. "I do." she says, muffled. A gulp follows, and she takes another.

"Something about rewards for kicking ass at Suna." she says, stuffing her face more.* - Fri Sep 04 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eats more. She has nothing to say on this.

Or rather, she's way too intelligent to say anything.* - Fri Sep 04 02:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) faces Zetsumo with her arms crossed and weight shifted a bit.* - Fri Sep 04 04:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) waits for Paine to line up.* - Fri Sep 04 04:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right foot reaches up to scratch at the back of her left, and a glance is sent towards the west. The teen chooses not to take a stance.

"I'm ready." she says.* - Fri Sep 04 04:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, and slowly slides her right foot backwards through the sand. Arms rise, and her hands clench partially as if to form claws. She takes the usual stance, though her arms resume moving afterwords. The heels of both palms meet, and Katsune's palms light up. They crackle violently, with lightning pouring out.

This chakra forms a ball, and Katsune launches it at Zetsumo. In the same motion though, the girl darts off after it. She follows it, lagging behind by a bit at first and then a lot. It moves faster than she does. The ball goes directly for Zetsumo, while Kat deviates a bit to the east. Either way, eyes stay locked on him and she sprints in his general direction.* - Fri Sep 04 04:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't use handseals because she has chakra flow gauntlets.* - Fri Sep 04 04:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right arm begins darting forwards, with the palm open, even as Zetsumo approaches. The girl's feet come skidding to a stop. Eye contact is maintained with Zetsumo the entire time, and she hadn't even flinched. Her reflexes are very sharp. Zetsumo's speed is nice, but not so great that she feels at all intimidated by it.

Of course, one may see her palm and wonder what in the world she's doing. No hand seals, and it's not a fist. Just as one might be questioning that though, her palm would be at Zetsumo's hand in point blank range. A very loud bang is released. From Katsune's palm comes an explosion. Even for Zetsumo, it'd surely peel skin from his fingers and hurt. A lot. The fingers are a very sensitive area after all.

What would be minor damage to the torso, can be quite significant somewhere else. The moment Katsune's jutsu makes contact or fails, she'd begin sprinting backwards, having only waited so long to hopefully ensure she can land her attack. She happens to run a bit more quickly than Zetsumo, though it remains to be seen whether or not she can get away from him.* - Fri Sep 04 04:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) holds up an arm for Osamu to see, clenching and unclenching the hand absent-mindedly to show her gauntlet.

"Got them back, too." she says with eyes averted.* - Fri Sep 04 21:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face Osamu. She opens her mouth and shows him her tongue, maintaining eye contact for the moment.* - Fri Sep 04 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes her tongue back. A nod follows, and she turns to walk after him. "Sure." she says.* - Fri Sep 04 21:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I'll take some soup." she says.

"Miso."* - Fri Sep 04 21:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sips at her soup. Afterwords she shakes her head with a brief glance up at him, and a faint, sly smile on her face. "And why would I tell you that?" she says.

"I have no reason to, and Zetsumo won't force me to either."* - Fri Sep 04 21:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "He specifically said he'd kill." she says, sipping more at her food.* - Fri Sep 04 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink, Kat having assumed she's being ridiculed. Eyes wander off, and she scratches her cheek.

"Anyway." she says. "Like I said, complicated."* - Fri Sep 04 21:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I'll admit." she says.

"I used to think he was full of it. He always seemed so theatrical." she glances up at him.

"When I realized he actually was so dumb...it was kind of cute, actually."* - Fri Sep 04 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits.* - Sat Sep 05 01:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Just watching." she says. "But if you're training, I'd be glad to join. I need it."* - Sat Sep 05 02:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and rises to her feet. She's turning to follow Kilm as she brushes herself off.* - Sat Sep 05 02:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Never heard of that before." she says. "I can guess, though. I've actually been working on the same thing."* - Sat Sep 05 02:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The teen slowly slides her right foot backwards through the sand and she lifts her arms up. Taking the same stance as always, hands clench partially as if to form claws. "I've been training hard." she says.

"Honestly I'm looking forward to this. The only person I've actually fought lately was Zetsumo and he's too strong to measure yourself off of." A bit of a weak smile is on her face, and she looks Kilm up and down.* - Sat Sep 05 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow. "Yeah." she says. "Of course it was. I was there to kill my boyfriend and even then, I couldn't help but feel great about it while we were leaving."* - Sat Sep 05 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. "But it's fine." she says. Her mouth opens. It hangs agape for a short moment as if she's about to say something. Afterwords she shrugs and turns her attention back to Kilm, with mouth closing. 

"Anyway." she says. "You wanted me to make the first move."

And then it happens. Abruptly, sand is thrown up into the air. You'd almost hear a literal bang at the sound of Katsune leading into a sprint. A cloud is formed wherever she goes, from the sand. She's moving at at least ninety miles per hour easily. That's how much it takes to cause tunnel vision. The bare minimum.

And that's just for the very first, briefest of moments. At her full speed which she reaches almost immediately, Kat's going at least one-hundred-fourty. She's twice as fast as the average person with her level of speed training. She 'would' have tunnel vision right now if not for how phenominal her eyesight is.

While moving, Katsune begins throwing an arm forwards. The fact of the matter is, by the time she's stopped....her arm hasn't even reached the place she wants it to be yet. It'd lagged behind due to just how fast she is running. It's almost there, though. Very close. Roughly a foot away, and it's still moving, having not paused at all.

An attempt is made to plant her palm to Kilm's gut. Upon making contact, a loud bang would be heard. Explosion release chakra is conjured up, and an exploding palm would be delivered to Kilm's body.

Still, he has plenty of time to evade her. More than enough...if he's fast enough. Would his eyes even be sharp enough, or his reflexes good enough, though, to have moved before she was in point blank range? Probably not.* - Sat Sep 05 03:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) does indeed see them coming, her feet having come skidding to a stop as she watches Kilm skid off to the sidelines from her palm. Immediately she begins moving, darting to and fro, straffing. She does so smoothly and without effort, her legs moving at a blindingly fast pace.

Eyes follow every fireball that comes towards her, without effort. As she dodges, Katsune's hands are moving to form handseals. Having dodged two fireballs by now and weaved four seals, Katsune darts forwards. In nearly in instant, she'd be northeast of him and twelve feet away.

She's dodged more fireballs along the way when her feet come skidding to a stop. Abruptly her right arm lights up with electricity, with a loud and crackling, reverberating bang. The arm is then shoved forwards. Lightning cries out as it springs from her fingertips and races towards Kilm. It's a net, and it's at its full power.

Constant loud, tremor-inducing bangs are released. She aims for the chest.* - Sat Sep 05 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's legs begin bending the moment fire spills from Kilm's mouth. She's kneeling down. The girl in facts rest there for a very brief moment, showing off. She waits until it's almost upon her; only eight feet away. Once the fire is there, she kicks off. She leaps into a backwards somersault.

Almost immediately her palms touch the ground, and she keeps spinning like a wheel. No time is wasted in the air because this is a very ground-based somersault.

At the end of Kat's display she's only moved twenty feet or so to evade the attack. Kilm had started from so far away and the range of this jutsu is minimal, not counting point-blank techniques. And at the end of this display, her palms are on the ground. Nearly instantly, the ground beneath her turns to liquid. She's submerged up to the shoulders in no time at all, and she pulls herself the rest of the way to save time.

Once in this liquid, Katsune submerges herself by eight feet. During the motion, she's drawing a kunai. The teen then darts forwards. The goukyaku had slowed her down. A -lot-. It'll take her time to reach Kilm.* - Sat Sep 05 03:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Liquid-like mud is seen splashing and turning. It's lit up like a christmas tree, and waves are sprayed all over the place. The ground nearly shakes, and the clapping is enough to probably stress ears. Katsune hadn't come up. Of course...for the lightning to have actually hit the ground and gone under...all of those handseals, a decent amount of time has passed by now.

She'd had time to come up. Much time passes while this lightning is flying about as well. A 'lot' of time. It may travel fast, but the duration remains the same no matter how fast your jutsus are -- unless you make the conscious effort to stop it mid-way, assuming that's even possible.

Kilm wouldn't realize his mistake until it's too late. Kat would be at his feet. Abruptly the ground turns to liquid. He'd feel this happening even as a kunai drives into his foot.

If he weren't so durable, he'd be in a word of pain right now. Fortunately he is. It's strong enough to literally tickle, but only because she's using a sharp, bladed weapon. He might also have a hole in his shoe now.

Katsune had swam deeper when lightning came after her, not even stressing. There hadn't even been a trail showing where she was going because of how deep she'd submerged. Unless he'd been able to sense her movements underground, it's highly unlikely if not impossible that he saw her coming.* - Sat Sep 05 03:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) dives, after tearing a whole in Kilm's shoe. The girl is easily able to avoid Kilm's arm, due to how slow it is. She'd pulled away very smoothly and without effort. When the girl reappears, she's pulling herself out of the ground as if it's water, and she's thirty feet away.

Unfortunately she's not capable of using another jutsu after stressing her tenketsu for Subterranean Voyage. Instead, she throws a kunai at him, directly at the face.* - Sat Sep 05 03:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise, and she plants her feet. The heels of both palms meet and she begins backpeddling as they do, though Kilm's water is a bit close now. Katsune's heart beats fairly quickly. Just before she finishes preparing her technique, she realizes how horribly bad an idea this is.

The girl panics, and begins darting off to the side. At the last second she's hit, though, by the water. As if she's been hit by a truck, the teen is sent flying, and very hard. Moments later she hits a tree. The crack is very loud, reminiscent of thunder. Thankfully, it soon turns out that this crack is probably entirely from the tree. Presumably, it begins slowly falling over while pressure is continuously applied.

Katsune squirms, but is completely pinned. Shortly afterwords, while falling, a rib cracks. It breaks. The girl hits the ground shortly afterwords, should the jutsu not have been stopped. It seems likely that it won't be, either.

She lies limp.* - Sat Sep 05 04:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is completely unconscious. She doesn't even stir.* - Sat Sep 05 04:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) groans weakly past a deep, shakey breath. She remains unconscious though.* - Sat Sep 05 04:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still alive of course. Her heart's beating fairly fast. She breathes pretty quickly, and occasionally stirs. She's dangerously close to going into shock, it seems.* - Sat Sep 05 04:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gurgles. Abruptly, she then jumps up, curling at the waist. Very harshly and roughly, Katsune coughs. She's choking. Both palms find her neck, and she coughs harder. Water is sprewed out onto her lap, and down her face, with each cough. Her face is now soaked too due to how she'd risen up.

A sigh follows, and she attempts to breathe. She's stopped choking. Briefly she glances to and fro, assessing the situation. She's frowning, and her hair is soaked. Her entire body is soaked, actually, from the Mizurappa that nearly pummeled her to death....pretty literally.* - Sat Sep 05 04:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's skin is cold. Her face is white. She's light-headed and dizzy as well. She looks very...sickly.

"O-Oh my G-God." she says, slowly lying back down afterwords and trembling all over as she does so. More deep breaths are taken, and her arms rest at her sides. Eyes are on the cieling.

The girl says nothing else on the matter at this time.* - Sat Sep 05 04:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. Lips tremble. More breaths are taken. The girl has no words for what just happened.

--Blackscreen--* - Sat Sep 05 04:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself out of bed with a shakey, silent yawn. By now her mouth is dry and she's hungry. Without a word, the girl begins making her way over to the kitchen. She drags her feet a bit, lazily.* - Sat Sep 05 04:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. She prepares a bowl of cold cereal, and a glass of water. The glass is downed in one swig. Afterwords she refills the glass and goes to sit down with her meal, at a table.* - Sat Sep 05 04:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She rises to her feet and turns to wander off. "Good night." she says.

She's in her bedroom shortly afterwords, asleep.* - Sat Sep 05 06:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits, planting her butt on the road. Palms rest at either side of her and her right leg crosses over her left. Eyes face the south. "'Morning, Kilm." she says.* - Sun Sep 06 02:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "I was training. Didn't even know about it until I got back."

After all, if she'd been 'sleeping', that'd mean she slept through houses being bombed and stuff.* - Sun Sep 06 02:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She rises to her feet and turns to follow. Arms meet behind her back for the brief moment, and weight shifts a bit.* - Sun Sep 06 02:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides her right foot backwards through the side, planting her feet. Arms rise and her hands clench partially, as if to form claws. Eye contact is maintained, she the teen takes a moment to crack her neck, one side first and then the other.

"Sparring, right?" she inquires.* - Sun Sep 06 02:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "No holding back." She says. "I won't get any better if you do." A glance is sent off to the side, and she shrugs.

"Besides. I was being wreckless before because I thought I'd be showing off."* - Sun Sep 06 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Doesn't matter to me. Just don't put a hole in my chest and we're good."* - Sun Sep 06 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The teen then slowly squats down, with her knees facing Kilm for the most part. Arms move as if she's about to begin doing repitions; exercising. Afterwords, the girl leans forwards and places both palms on the ground. Once there, abruptly, the ground turns to liquid. The moment it does she disappears, darting underground as quickly as she can manage.

She goes straight for Kilm, leaving a trail of earth liquid as she goes. Just as she draws near -- some twenty feet away -- the trail would stop being apparent. She goes very deep under the ground.

When she reappears, she'd be directly behind him, ten feet away. Silently she pulls herself out of the ground with her palms -- and slowly to allow for said silence. She stares. Her feet gently touch the ground shortly afterwords, had this been allowed.* - Sun Sep 06 03:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is abruptly sucked underground once more, her palms never having left the ground. She'd come too close to him, and that was stupid of her. If she'd been able to transition from jutsu to jutsu like Zetsumo, this would've been a good idea...but that isn't the case. Another thing for her to remember when she's in a real fight, though.

The girl's body moves very quickly. With eigt full feet of the earth shielding her, it's likely she's quite...quite fine. The jutsu Kilm is using focuses on making sure the enemy is hit by at least something. Raw power isn't really its strong suit, even if Kilm's ninjutsu is spectacular.

When Katsune reappears, she'd be at Kilm's feet. Abruptly she'd reach out to take his ankles and yank him under the ground. Chances are, he's still casting his jutsu and thus might be left very open. During the same motion, Katsune would yank herself out of the ground with both arms.

As she rises up, a leg would be swept and aimed at his head. She doesn't bother with a kunai, as she knows it wouldn't even cut his skin.* - Sun Sep 06 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms dart towards the center of her chest at the sight of Kilm preparing his own handseals. Already she realizes she made a mistake. In the future she'll be avoiding that but for now, her hands form the tiger seal. A cloud of smoke engulfs her form, making it essentially impossible to tell what direction she's about to go in.

In the same instant, the girl vanishes -- maybe moving too fast for even Kilm's eyes to follow. When she reappears, Katsune's an enormous distance away. In fact, she's left the training grounds entirely. Immediately, the girl collapses. Her left palm finds her gut, and her right palm finds her face. The color of said face shifts to green, and she groans sharply.

A moment is taken to catch her breath and hold back puke. Of course, being so far away...she's bought herself a bit of time too, most likely.* - Sun Sep 06 03:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet, swaying to and fro as she does so. Her breath is caught, and a frown is on her face. Abruptly she then turns on her heel and sprints back into the area. Honestly, it's so clear why being a ninjutsu speciailist is a bad idea. It's quite easy to evade ninjutsu alone when not backed into a corner. 

Taijutsu is an essential part of a shinobi's arsenal, and that's why so many practice it. Kat comes sprinting back into the area. Eyes are locked onto Kilm when she comes back into view and she keeps moving.* - Sun Sep 06 03:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) immediately begins sprinting to the southeast. The girl makes her way to a tree, and leaps up to the trunk. She's eight feet off of the ground as she resumes sprinting, making use of Suimen. She leaps from tree to tree and keeps the Mizurappa far away from her. The truth is, she runs as fast as Kilm's jutsus move at this point.

It's as if she got a bit faster just from trauma alone the other day. She makes no attempts to engage at this time. She simply can't. Kilm's jutsu wasn't wasted. It keeps her at bay.* - Sun Sep 06 04:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) actually waits for Kilm to fire the jutsu this time. Eyes lock onto it and follow it. She doesn't even try. Normally, even someone of her speed may not see it until it's close. Katsune's eyesight is phenominal, however. She can afford to be lazy.

She begins walking the moment it's fired, and she sprints just before it makes contact. Feet skid roughly against the sand as she comes to a stop, after showing off. From there, Kat turns and begins walking -- just to show Kilm that spraying jutsus all over the place without thinking it through won't work. As his sparring partner, it's her job to show him what works and what doesn't.

Eye contact is maintained.* - Sun Sep 06 04:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins sprinting forwards, not even needing a moment to think the idea through. There's plenty of distance between herself and Kilm's jutsus at first, and that's before she began moving. The best part is, he's thrown most of them before she's even began moving -- so she's able to chart a path out for herself.

Katsune weaves to and fro through his jutsus, and she attempts to get within point-blank range. A kunai is drawn from her holster as she draws nearest.

The moment she gets to where she wants to be, as feet come skidding to a stop sending her around him in a circular motion, her body abruptly lights up. A loud, crackling, reverberating screech is released. The air all around the kunoichi's body lights up with electricity, and it goes for Kilm's nerves. Chances are, he's almost definitely paralyzed for the briefest of moments. Katsune lunges at him with her kunai.

During the same motion she's sprinting in his direction, to make absolutely sure he can't dodge it. Of course, it does literally no damage due to his durability. Even so, she'd be showing him that she could hit him right now if needed.* - Sun Sep 06 04:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's kunai is taken back, and she briefly flourishes it around her finger for the moment, straightening her back out. "Mhmm...." she chimes out, still eyeing him.

"Honestly I'm wondering if we haven't reached out limit for gaining something from this spar. Looks like we've both figured each other out, completely."* - Sun Sep 06 04:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Either way, not a conversation we can have. Truth is, we're slaves -- even mentally."* - Sun Sep 06 04:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Sun Sep 06 04:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I've always been capable." she says.
"I'm not a coward. I'm just not stupid." Eyes are averted.

"I'd rather take risks that allow me to out-smart people along the way. It's a lot more exciting that way. A lot more rewarding. It feels way better to out-smart someone than to just....win."* - Sun Sep 06 04:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Not gonna think about it." she says.

She is indeed brainwashed.* - Sun Sep 06 04:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Keep it up and I'll just give you a no."* - Sun Sep 06 04:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "Nope." she says.* - Sun Sep 06 05:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and turns to follow, with eyes averted.* - Sun Sep 06 05:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "Nope." she says. After all, it's probably very rare for shinobi to play sports. Why bother? If they want a challenge they can just go for some missions. A way better way for someone of this profession to spend their time is training, too. That could actually save their lives.

The girl's arms are crossed and her weight is shifted just a bit. She remains standing.* - Sun Sep 06 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) carefully descends to the ground. Her butt is soon planted, and her right leg crosses over her left. Both palms rest on the ground at either side of her. Eyes remain on her friend for the most part, though often she'll examine the ball and what people are doing with it. Naturally she's at least a 'little' bit curious about what in the world this is.* - Sun Sep 06 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shows no real reaction to anything, though. At times she even day dreams. She seems neither condescending, overly bored, or enthusiastic.

She 'is' a shinobi, after all. One can't impress her winning a game of basketball against villagers.* - Sun Sep 06 05:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shows no notable reaction.* - Sun Sep 06 05:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Maybe..." she says.

"I think I am a bit better at taijutsu than you."* - Sun Sep 06 05:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, smiling a bit. "Noo way." she says, eyeing the ball.

"Not interested."* - Sun Sep 06 05:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, lying down with arms stretched out behind her. She stretches a bit then, before resting her head on her palms with one leg crossed over the other still.

"Of course that's not a joke." she says.
"I said I 'want' to leave -- not that I'm actually stupid enough to actually consider it."* - Sun Sep 06 06:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head as she rises to her feet, rolling a bit in the process. "I'm really, really mad at Kuro..." she says with eyes averted.

"But I'm still not looking for a date."

The girl turns on her heel and begins walking away, towards the house.* - Sun Sep 06 07:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs in response, on the way back.* - Sun Sep 06 07:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head.* - Sun Sep 06 07:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Alright." she says.* - Sun Sep 06 07:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Sun Sep 06 07:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wakes up and wanders off.* - Sun Sep 06 10:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) like, stays here and stuff.* - Sun Sep 06 10:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (honestly shin) - Sun Sep 06 21:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (ninja game. ganking is fine) - Sun Sep 06 21:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (take pride in it) - Sun Sep 06 21:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) whispers: (Wuts a gank .-.) - Sun Sep 06 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: 2 vs 1) - Sun Sep 06 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (or 3 vs 1) - Sun Sep 06 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (etc) - Sun Sep 06 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) darts into the area. Her feet come skidding to a stop at Shin's side, and she stares ahead to assess the situation. A kunai is in each hand.* - Sun Sep 06 21:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't do much....actualy. The teen comes a bit closer to get a better view, but she mostly just stands around, for now.

She's a duelist. She's no good in the current situation.* - Sun Sep 06 21:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) follows.* - Sun Sep 06 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is moving at like, 300mph literally. She's not worried about anyone hitting her. She doesn't have tunnel vision either.* - Sun Sep 06 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Let's not forget that we 'can' climb trees. I don't wanna see everyone letting themselves get cornered. - Sun Sep 06 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes find the ground, very quickly, when she feels the ground shaking. Presumably there are six to eight feet at the very least between her and the clones. Otherwise? The ground would have shaken from their movement alone, rather than the explosion.

Either way, legs bend. In a blur, the woman then leaps. She'd have darted to a nearby tree branch, and she stands there now by way of the suimen technique. Eyes continue exploring the ground, for now.

She moves at roughly two-hundred-eighty miles per hour. One-hundred and sixty is roughly the bare minimum for tunnel vision and she moves twice as fast as the average person with her level of speed training. The teen flourishes the kunai in each hand, a bit playfully.* - Sun Sep 06 22:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Any thoughts on the situation, Kitora? Honestly I'm kinda bored, considering how safe we are right now with Zetsumo's masks. - Sun Sep 06 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm trying to find a way to do something and end this as fast as possible, but charging in by myself would be beyond stupid. - Sun Sep 06 22:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Enemy's playing defense and I'm not good at taking out massess. More of a one-on-one kind of person. - Sun Sep 06 22:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: This battle will be over pretty soon. - Sun Sep 06 22:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Stay near me I am sure they will get through. - Sun Sep 06 22:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright.... - Sun Sep 06 22:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Make sure to kep an eye out of Yumiko. - Sun Sep 06 22:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: I would not want Zenaki to be sad by her death - Sun Sep 06 22:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) just chills from her perch on the tree. She's squating down, and has been for a while now, with palms on the same branch. She is talking, but you'd not hear her in the middle of war. She's not shouting, either. No stress whatsoever, considering her confidence in Zetsumo.

For many good reasons she hasn't attacked anyone yet.

Eyes are on the enemy. She nods in response to Kitora's words.* - Sun Sep 06 22:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Gonna have to get Zetsumo to teach me that big earth technique later. - Sun Sep 06 22:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Which one? - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: The one that traps people. - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: I can teach it to you. - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'd start shooting lightning balls but mine aren't the fastest. I usually sprint up to the enemy before using it to make up for that. - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: See, I'm like...a duelist. - Sun Sep 06 22:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: No good in crowded situations unless I can get my hands on an officer. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: And yeah that'd be nice. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: I am sure you will have to fight sooner or later. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: If the battle does not end. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Mhm. Looking forward to it. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Right now I'm just planning on backing someone up if they need it. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Only smart thing to do. - Sun Sep 06 22:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Get ready. - Sun Sep 06 23:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: For? - Sun Sep 06 23:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: If the Raikage survives we will be at a disadvantage. - Sun Sep 06 23:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm not sure what you're suggesting but I'm ready. If the raikage's a problem maybe we should back up a mask. - Sun Sep 06 23:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: The one he's fighting. - Sun Sep 06 23:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: They act on Zetsumos will. - Sun Sep 06 23:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: I do not know how to controll them - Sun Sep 06 23:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: He's fighting a mask though, right now. He's attacking it. - Sun Sep 06 23:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: My dragon just swept him. - Sun Sep 06 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: So we whouldn't have to worry about the mask abandoning us. - Sun Sep 06 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Just be ready. - Sun Sep 06 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright. - Sun Sep 06 23:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Always expect the unexpected. - Sun Sep 06 23:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: And if death comes for us greet it with opened arms - Sun Sep 06 23:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) watches the raikage, closely. The teen studies his movements...his speed. Every time he dodges or attempts to do so, she pays very close attention with her exceptional eyes.

She wants to determine how strong he is.* - Sun Sep 06 23:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Careful, Yumi. If you're back there we can't keep an eye on you. - Sun Sep 06 23:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: I wish to help my master in the name of Zenaki. - Sun Sep 06 23:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: He just tanked one of 'Zetsumo's jutsus. Yeah, not messing with that guy. - Sun Sep 06 23:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: He is down and out. - Sun Sep 06 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: I'll try to strike the weaker people.. - Sun Sep 06 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm surprised he wasn't turned to dust. - Sun Sep 06 23:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah, (@ Yumi). Support. We need to be ready for if anyone tries to get the advantage in numbers against Zetsumo. - Sun Sep 06 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Stay back Yumiko. - Sun Sep 06 23:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: I do not want anything to happen to you. - Sun Sep 06 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Zenaki is down in the dumps. - Sun Sep 06 23:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Think Zetsumo's chakra will last? - Sun Sep 06 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: If we let this fight go on for too long, we'll be looking at a battle where we don't have Zetsumo as a shield. - Sun Sep 06 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: Yes he has a lot of chakra. - Sun Sep 06 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: If you wish...And I can sense chakra..I believe his chakras will last much longer than estimated... - Sun Sep 06 23:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright... - Sun Sep 06 23:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: There is something jamming our sensing abilities. - Sun Sep 06 23:33:20 2015
