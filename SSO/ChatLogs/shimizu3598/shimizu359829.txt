Her score would be near 100, if not 100 exactly. This is a girl that's been through something worse than hell. She killed her own lover during war among many, many other things.

She was given very lengthy and very thorough "mental fortitude training" as well from none other than Zetsumo himself for several very long months. He turned her into what she is today.

She puts the pen back down.* - Fri Oct  9 03:10:17 2015

Kat's eyes wander aimlessly for a moment.

When prompted, though, she nods.

Kat doesn't even use handseals. By will alone, she stops the flow of her chakra. Immediately afterwords she shoves it throughout, fiercly.* - Fri Oct  9 03:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Where do you want to train? - Fri Oct  9 16:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Wherever. In the village; outside it. Doesn't matter. - Fri Oct  9 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: We should train outside probably. - Fri Oct  9 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Fri Oct  9 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. Let's go. - Fri Oct  9 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've got lots of things to train now. - Fri Oct  9 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Lots of things to learn as well. - Fri Oct  9 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Fri Oct  9 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's see . . . I still have 5 scrolls to learn from and 3 B ranks to master. - Fri Oct  9 16:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She plants herself at his side. "I'll admit I was expecting a spar." she says, unaware that Kilm would probably wreck her now in all honesty.* - Fri Oct  9 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Too lazy right now to just train. I'll watch you train though. - Fri Oct  9 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Oh . . . You still don't like casual scroll reading nor just training then. - Fri Oct  9 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  9 16:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This jutsu is pretty damn good. - Fri Oct  9 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the jutsu fairly blankly. An astonishing feat. A mindblowing one.

Even so, she looks bored. It's not Kilm's fault. Even so, sitting around and doing nothing for days and days and days makes a person dull. It can't be helped.

That, and she's seen this jutsu before.

"So she taught you 'that' jutsu. . ." she says, only her eyes really suggesting amusement.* - Fri Oct  9 16:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm surprised she's so generous. - Fri Oct  9 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . 2 B ranks and 1 C rank for that B rank and 2 D ranks . . . - Fri Oct  9 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I had that jutsu I'd teach it to no one. It's as valuable as my landmine fist. - Fri Oct  9 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll teach you it since you're missing out and it'll only add further to your speed. - Fri Oct  9 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Won't be limited to ground or underground anymore. - Fri Oct  9 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd like that. - Fri Oct  9 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Fri Oct  9 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not giving it to anyone else though. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's very damn valuable. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm surprised it's not A rank or S rank. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If value was counted for in ranks then it'd make it S rank most likely. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For such a thing to even be possible...I'm surprised. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm way weaker when using it though faster . . .  - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now we'd be able to fight people that are capable of flying. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Good thing we don't really do physical combat. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct  9 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Know what else would be cool? - Fri Oct  9 16:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What's that? - Fri Oct  9 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Learning how to use jutsu while flying. - Fri Oct  9 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So that's the catch. - Fri Oct  9 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yep. - Fri Oct  9 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's why she's willing to trade. - Fri Oct  9 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Useful, but not deification. - Fri Oct  9 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You fly . . . But too much focus is needed to use jutsu while using it. - Fri Oct  9 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's possible though. - Fri Oct  9 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If we do learn how to do that . . . Then we can become really damn good and strong. - Fri Oct  9 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll see. - Fri Oct  9 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . What should we do if the syndicate blows over and the world is a bit more peaceful again? - Fri Oct  9 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure. - Fri Oct  9 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Been thinking about that. - Fri Oct  9 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I didn't have time to think these days . . . Nor does it help in any way for me. - Fri Oct  9 16:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm. . . - Fri Oct  9 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Fri Oct  9 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander for a long moment. Arms remain crossed. Eventually though the girl lazily walks forwards. She plants herself in front of the boy and stares up at him.

"When someone says something hurtful....you shouldn't beat yourself up."

She pauses for a long moment.

"You should tell yourself "fuck that person, I'm right as always and they're wrong"....."* - Fri Oct  9 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What are you on about? - Fri Oct  9 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You. - Fri Oct  9 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . But it's true. - Fri Oct  9 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Implying it's not okay for you to think. - Fri Oct  9 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm saying it's true - Fri Oct  9 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cause . . . It only brought us trouble when I tried thinking. - Fri Oct  9 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I just gotta let me instinct work for me. - Fri Oct  9 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cause instinct saved my life a couple of times. - Fri Oct  9 16:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's why I trust it more than thinking. - Fri Oct  9 16:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So yeah . . . In my personal experience . . . My instinct is better than how I think. - Fri Oct  9 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And don't tell me otherwise. - Fri Oct  9 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Her eyes wander off.

"Alright then. . ." she says.

The girl then paces off to the side, turning to face his general direction once more.

"But. . ."

She looks back up at him and maintains eye contact.

"Take a chuunin vest, or become a jounin, and lead little genin with that mindset? If they die, it's your fault. Always."* - Fri Oct  9 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that. - Fri Oct  9 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The only time I think is when I remember stuff, memorise stuff from scrolls or make plans for a mission or when I'm told to come up with something. - Fri Oct  9 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Otherwise . . . It's all instinct. - Fri Oct  9 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Did you grow again? - Fri Oct  9 17:02:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Fri Oct  9 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you're growing just to look down on me someday then i'll laugh when that happens. - Fri Oct  9 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct  9 17:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I get that tall I'll look for medical attention. - Fri Oct  9 17:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Agreed. Wouldn't want you to look down on me. - Fri Oct  9 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Being short has its bonuses as well as being tall has its bonuses. - Fri Oct  9 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Bored though. - Fri Oct  9 17:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: should do that tho . . . you out of the blue thought that i was ride or die material . . .that why i asked for it since you made it seem like i should have it. - Fri Oct  9 17:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can I tag along? Pretty damn bored. - Fri Oct  9 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to the western wall of Sunagakure and uses Suimen to scale the wall. She does this every single day and she's a chuunin so guards presumably don't care.* - Fri Oct  9 17:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hello there. - Fri Oct  9 18:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Fri Oct  9 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something tells me you'll learn better if you fight someone on your level. - Fri Oct  9 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If Kilm wants to spar with you though, that's fine. - Fri Oct  9 18:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryosei Ishimura(Velicious) says: Oh...you don't know what I can do yet, though. - Fri Oct  9 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Could practice my jutsu while sparring him though. - Fri Oct  9 18:17:23 2015
