<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I remember back when my brother was alive..No matter what I did, he always seemed to be able to beat me. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Now..I'd like to think he'd be proud of me. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well...for the most part. - Tue Oct  6 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I know you will be a strong shinobi, Trilliam. I can see the fire in you. - Tue Oct  6 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: If you say soo... - Tue Oct  6 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) keeps her hands in formation of the tiger seal, and turns her head to stare up at the sand above her.

Not a good sign, definitely.

She should really throw the match right there and take the hits, but she's also not looking to be hospitalized for a month.

And so she abruptly kneels down. The girl's palms find the earth. With that, she begins. . .

Digging.

She disappears within the ground, and drills her way to a safe depth. Roughly twenty feet or so, and she's sure to move diagonally as she goes. Her hole is closed up behind her.

Senses are locked on the chakra within the iron sand above her, to be sure she doesn't need to go even deeper.* - Tue Oct  6 04:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Now I want to spar... - Tue Oct  6 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The iron sand, it seems, was lower than twenty feet. Because otherwise, she'd have out-ran it due to being only a tiny bit slower than Tetsumi's sand.

Katsune is caught in the boy's coffin. A weak smile is produced.

"Heh." she scoffs, in a polite manner that suggests laughter.

She takes a moment to assess her situation and doesn't bother squirming. She knows the strength of this sand. If it can tank a landmine fist, she's not getting out of it.

Kat shakes her head.

"Yeah." she says.
"You win."* - Tue Oct  6 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I need to improve. - Tue Oct  6 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stumbles a bit as she lands on her feet, with a nod and a silent sigh of reliefe through her nose.

With that, the girl takes a moment to brush herself off. Presumably no more iron sand is on her now, but she still feels it as if it were. Frankly, she's a bit creeped out.

Palms find her hips, then, and weight shifts a bit.

Eyes wander.* - Tue Oct  6 05:07:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sets herself down on her back and lies with legs and arms both sprawled out. She gives no fucks. A silent sigh through the nose is released as said back touches the surface.

"I will admit though..." she says.

"Pretty sure I wouldn't stand even a chance in future fights. I'm pretty sure he was playing with us."* - Tue Oct  6 06:16:44 2015

At any rate, though, she's now standing up and walking away.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Oh what do you mean. - Tue Oct  6 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is lying down, but her arms rise and hands meet. Said hands form the tiger seal.

With that, Kat flickers out of sight. When she reapears she's at Trilliam's side. Hands find her hips and weight shifts a bit.

The teen is staring blankly to the south as she whispers something to him.* - Tue Oct  6 17:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the boy in full. She stares at him for a long while. Eventually she briefly looks him up and down.

"Wanna spar?" she asks.* - Tue Oct  6 18:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Where's Bryson? - Tue Oct  6 18:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He'd be able to heal you probably, Kilm. - Tue Oct  6 18:06:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.

With that, she turns on her heel and wanders back to where she'd been before.

"Alright then." she says.

Kat sits back down.* - Tue Oct  6 18:10:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lies back down, with legs and arms sprawled out.

The girl shakes her head.

"Tired now." she says.

"Ask later."* - Tue Oct  6 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds like you're the one enjoying something. - Tue Oct  6 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's palms both meet the ground.

Abruptly, four earthen spikes rise up out of the ground around Tetsu at a stupidly fast pace.

They're all razor sharp.

All of them stop two feet short of stabbing him to death.* - Tue Oct  6 18:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's palms remain against the ground. All spikes withdraw back into the ground, slowly. Eventually they're entirely gone.

Palms turn back up towards the sky.

The girl then shakes her head.

"If I wanted to punish you I'd go for the nuts." she says.

"That was a warning."* - Tue Oct  6 18:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Bad jokes or being a pervert. Either way someone should hit you. - Tue Oct  6 18:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) descend the side of the western wall of Sunagakure with a sigh. The girl finds a place with lots of desert trees and boulders. Kat takes a moment to crack her knuckles. With that, her right leg is then roughly thrown backwards, sliding across the sand. Eyes lock onto the nearest tree as she lifts her arms, with hands clenching partially as if to mimic claws.

Kat then sprints forwards. Her feet come skidding to a stop as she reaches her target. Even as said food is sliding over the sand, she's lifting her left arm. Chakra is poured into her fist. The second her knuckles meet the tree, all of this chakra leaves Kat's fist.

The ground shakes, and Katsune's hair is picked up. It billows to and fro in the wind, alongside her bodysuit's showgirl skirt. Kat's tree is engulged entirely by this explosion, being torn apart from the inside out as per the nature of the jutsu -- creating an explosion from the target's insides which is a literal quote. It's disintigrated instantaneously.

Kat's decided on a new goal, finally. She'll join Sunagakure's military, but only one one single condition. Hassan must make her a jounin. To get him to bite, she'll probably need to beat him in a fight. To this end, the former Hokage trains her favorite new jutsu.

Already, Kat's limbs are trembling. 'All' of them are. However, without pause, she turns on her heel and sprints over to yet another tree. Her body moves as a blur. As she draws near, the kunoichi leaps, even maintaining the speed as she travels through the air due to the speed at which she'd thrust her legs into the dirt.

Katsune is soon at the top of the tree, twenty feet above the ground. Upon reaching this location, her right arm is thrown forwards quite roughly. Once her fist meets the bark, the ground once more shakes. Even boulders rooted to the ground shake. The teen's entire 'world', shakes. 

The rumbling and roaring, reverberating boom produced is akin to that of thunder, only several times louder. Once more, the target is disintigrated instantaneously. Due to the explosive beam of energy produced, the ground is painted in explosive power as well. As a result, much of it is instantaneously charred black.

With that, Kat falls down to the ground. Her legs and arms are trembling already even as she falls. She's sweating. The teen sways to and fro, and draws in silent, slow, deep breaths. Eventually she falls onto her back. Eyes close, and she passes out cold.

That's how much chakra the jutsu consumes. Hours pass.* - Tue Oct  6 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually wakes up. Kat's mouth opens, and air comes out. A very long yawn. With a sour expression on her face, she rubs the back of her head. The drain on this jutsu is a little bit too intense. 

It makes it hard to even train it in the first place. She especially can't train it well during sparring sessions, because after one use she's done. Kat's never willing to use the second use of it, because that means passing out. For this reason she's for once flat-out forced to train a jutsu all by herself. With a shrug, Kat rises to her feet.

The second said feet meet the ground, the girl sprints forwards. The second she meets the nearest boulder, she leaps. Specifically she leaps at such an angle that her fist soon meets the surface, without any aid by gravity. During the same motion she's picking herself up, leaving her balanced on a single arm. With little to no pause, Kat shoves chakra into her fist.

Explosion release chakra. Yet again the ground shakes. Hair is blown back, and trees tremble in fear. Pebbles are thrown all over the place from the shaking alone. The jutsu's roaring persists for three entire seconds. During this time, Kat's picked up by ten feet or so from the force of it alone. 

And then, it ends. Kat tumbles in place, to direct her feet to the ground. Said feet soon hit the dirt with a soft pat. A silent sigh is released soon afterwords, and this kunoichi turns then to find another target. Another boulder. Kat's right arm is pulled close, and to the side. Legs part, and she takes a moment to stretch.

The mentioned arm is just about worn out. She takes a moment to stretch the other arm as well, perhaps just giving herself a reason to procrastinate. And with that, she darts forwards once more. As she'd done once before, Kat some skidding to a stop. Because it'll throw enemies off, she's lifting her arm up as she travels.

Said enemies will often, she's sure, not realize what's going on. They'll be confused by the fact that Kat's fist isn't being shoved forwards as if for a punch. And then the moment her fists touches them, they die. And that's what happens to Kat's boulder. Once more the second she touches it, an abomination-slaughtering explosion is released.

One might expect shards of rock to be thrown all over the place. There are none, though. The entire rock had been used to produce this explosion in the first place. As such, logically, it's disintigrated with no effort on Kat's part. Earth is one part of the formula. 

Lightning is the other. When they combine, they explode. Kat's limbs tremble, and she sweats. Once more, she collapses onto her back. Arms and legs are sprawled out while she sleeps, and her hair is a mess. Many more hours pass.* - Tue Oct  6 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) explores the desert until she finally finds what she'd been looking for. A god damned mountain. As it so happens, Kat had eventually run out of targets to practice on in her former training grounds. Rocks, trees, for half a mile were all obliterated. As such, she'd been forced to find new targets.

And that's where the mountain comes in. Weight shifts a bit, and with a blank expression on her face Kat's eyes very slowly wander the expanse of the earthen monument. It's quite large. Naturally the first thing that comes to mind is that if she obliterates the base of this mountain, rocks are going to fall. She could get hurt and Sunagakure could be angry if they somehow found out -- which they won't.

Few fucks are given anyway. Her own happiness comes before anyone else's. This jutsu has to be mastered. With a shrug, Kat sprints forwards. The girl comes skidding to a stop at some point. 

Rather than crouching as she does so, Kat this time remains sanding tall. She leans over as her weight and balance forces her to travel. The teen's right arm is stretched out in the mean time, and her hand is clenched into a fist. Once the surface of the gauntlet-clad body part meets rock, chakra is poured out.

As one might expect, the mountain is left with an unbelievably large hole in its base. This hole is hallowed out entirely. It's officially a cave, now. This had all happened very suddenly, however. Many rather large rocks come tumbling down to either side of the girl, and they ram very hard into the earth. The ground shakes from both the explosion and these stones.

Ultimately though, little damage is done in the grand scheme of things. There are no village-ending landslides presumably. There's only a cave. The damage had been done quickly. Moving as a blur once more, Kat begins making her way east.

It's decided that the safest means of continuing her exercises is to find a new secton of the rock to punch. One far away from this one. That way, Kat can train without risking too much destruction. Eventually she finds a good, safe place to punch. She comes to a stop, and stares ahead at it for a long while.

Many minutes pass as she studies it, doing her best to make sure she's not making a dangerous mistake. Once she's done, she nods. An arm is lifted, and her fist is planted to the side. She concentrates. Large amounts of effort are applied specifically to using as little chakra for this as possible.* - Tue Oct  6 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs, waking up on yet another day. Of course by now she's been to the village several times, just back and forth. She pays visits to Sunagakure often for food and water. Inbetween these visits though, Kat's always training. For entire weeks, she trains.

Blood, sweat, and tears by the gallons are invested into the Landmine Fist jutsu. Should Kat master it, she'll be able to knock people around all day every day. She'll be able to beat the Kazekage in a spar. Of that she has zero doubt whatsoever. Always...always, people underestimate this little girl's abilities.

Since the beginning of her career, people have underestimated her. They see weak ninjutsu, low chakra reserves, mediocre speed and even enormous amounts of jutsus but always, they're far from intimidated. What they never really realize though, is that Kat doesn't just have one or two of these gifts. She has all of them. The synergy is phenominal.

She's capable of nearly killing Tetsumi Jiki in a sparring session with a single landmine fist. When she's mastered it, then what will she be capable of? These thoughts motivate her to train even harder. Eventually, Kat stumbles upon a bandit camp. Inside of it are hordes of dead bodies.

Exactly what the girl had been looking for, although she'd been planning on making the corpses herself. With a shrug, Kat makes her way over to the nearest cadaver. She kneels down, and draws in a deep breath. The smell of corpses is something she's grown long used to. She used to have Zetsumo as company after all.

Her right arm moves forwards, and the teen plants her fist to the corpses side. If she wants to truly master this technique which was invented for the sake of slaying immortals, then...shouldn't she practice on actual flesh? For this reason, she'd saught out dead bodies. Explosion release chakra is shoved forwards through her arm. It meets her fist and flows smoothly into the corpse.

Once it gets inside, all Kat has to do is set it off. And she does so. As is to be expected, the entire corpse is obliterated instantly. The earth rumbles. Nearby corpses are sent skidding to and fro accross the ground due to the miniature earthquake. 

And the entire corpse is disintigrated. Too weak to resist Kat's jutsu in the slightest. A crater is left where the body had been. With a nod, the kunoichi rises back up to her feet. Hands meet and she cracks her knuckles.

With a swagger, Kat makes her way over to the closest building. Eyes wander its surface. Wood. Something she hasn't tested yet. With a shrug, Kat extends her arm once more. Her fist meets the paint that covers it.

Chakra is poured forwards, and the explosion is set off. At first, only the wall has a hole. That's where the explosion was detonated. The resulting beam, however, spreads. As a result, an enormous chunk of the building is turned to ash. The right side of it, as well as the corners and more.

With that, the house slowly falls over. It collapses in on itself. All that's left in the end is rubble. Slow, deep, silent breaths are taken through the nose. It takes time for Kat to catch her breath. 

Her face turns slightly damp. That's the second landmine fist used in one training session. However, she's not passing out. Already, Kat's getting better at this. Coming closer to mastery. 

Naturally she knows, she has to keep this up. She can't afford to slack off. Tetsumi Jiki. The boy that manipulates iron sand. Much, much stronger than her. 

He can pull of techniques every bit as fantastic as her's and every bit as quickly. And yet...he can do them all day every day. Meanwhile Katsune can only perform this jutsu a few times per fight. It's not enough. Should she miss even once, it's such an enormous waste.

The girl finds a house to sleep in. Willingly this time, she sleeps.* - Tue Oct  6 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wakes up and wraps some clean cloth around the lower half of her face, including her nose. "Hmph." she scoffs. If she's gonna be blowing up fresh corpses she should at least protect herself from potential bacteria. She has the constitution of a monster but she should still be careful of course. With that, she then turns and makes her way out of the building.

Another corpse is found and she walks right up to it. At a very fast pace she crouches down. During the same motion, her arm is flying forwards with the hand clenched into a fist. The moment Kat's fist touches her practice dummy, an explosion is triggered. Once more, it's disintigrated instantly.

Any germs that might've been inside are of course microwaved. Done away with instantly. The ground is charred, and the scent of burned dirt fills the air. Some dirt even turns to glass. With that done, Kat rises to her feet. 

Another corpse is found. This one, too, is obliterated. Regular breaks are taken. Eventually, Kat's destroyed every single corpse in the camp. She stretches out and rolls her neck to and fro.

It's a lot of work. With a shrug, though, she wanders along. Corpses are great dummies and all but she can still use other things for training too. Walls, houses, anything works. It's more about saving chakra than getting more damage out of it, right now.

Kat places herself before the base of the camp's wooden walls. She turns at the hip. The left arm rises and her fist is planted. Her right palm finds the opposite arm at the elbow. Small emounts of chakra are poured forwards. 

Very small amounts. The kunoichi is concentrating the entire time on triggering her jutsu. She needs to trigger it with as little chakra as possible, so she takes her time. Eventually, the blast is set off. She saves chakra, though she isn't yet aware. 

She can't be sure. Eventually though, with a sigh and a shrug, she turns and moves along. More things are obliterated. More time passes. At some point, she's even forced to target the earth beneath her feet.

To train more than one facit of this technique at once, she challenges herself to use the jutsu while somersaulting. Legs bend at the knees and roughly with great speed and strength she launches herself backwards. She doesn't exactly gain air because that's not her goal. Kat's right fist finds the ground almost immediately. Her left arm remains tucked in.

The moment the teen's fist meets the earth, an explosion is detonated. Dirt for thirty feet is sent flying and rolling back in all directions. Wide, dense clouds of the substance are formed. Birds fly away into the horizon for fear of their life. A crater is left into the surface.

It's disappointing, however. The crate is no deeper than three feet. Kat should expect ten or more. As such, she launches herself backwards once more. Once more, she makes a crater. 

Inbetween breaks she keeps this up for hours and hours. Eventually, it expands to days. The somersaulting grows old at some point. And so, she opts to simply kneel down and continuously punch the ground. Each time her fist touches it, she sets off her jutsu once more.* - Tue Oct  6 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) forms a handseal. Afterwords her palms slap against the ground at either side of her, the girl having already been lying down.

A miniature earthen corridor rises up out of the ground. It's seven feet high and seven feet wide. The opening she leaves for it is for once, big enough to halve the structure entirely. It creates a shield, and said shield soaks up any blood and gore that may or may not be coming her way.

With that done, Kat brings her palms back to the back of her head. Eyes wander off, and she silently sighs through the nose.

How dare he make her move her arms.* - Tue Oct  6 23:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins making her way to Kirigakure. The girl has grown tired of Sunagakure -- The Village Hidden Among the Hordes of Mute People. When people do talk, they're usually spineless boys that insist on attention whoring. Apparently it's a very popular myth that that makes girls want to talk to you??? Well, it fucking doesn't.

Days pass, as Kat's taking her time. Eventually she's forced to camp out in a cave. A little oasis in the desert. There's water but no food. Doesn't matter though, because Kat brought her own.* - Wed Oct  7 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops outside of Genjikagure on her travels. She's bored by now, and the girl isn't in a hurry to reach Kirigakure. And so, she opts to train. Slowly she draws her right foot backwards in the dirt and lifts her arms up. Hands clench partially as if to mimic claws.

With that, Kat begins throwing punches and kicks at the tree. One at a time, all in the smoothest motions possible. She focuses entirely on speed, and no power at all. After all, with 'her' kekkei genkai, that's all she needs to train. She does need to train it too -- taijutsu.* - Wed Oct  7 02:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops at some point in a forest while making her way to Kirigakure. Her right foot slides backwards through the grass, and arms rise. Hands clench partially as if to mimic claws. A deep breath is taken through the nose, slowly. Eyes are locked onto a tree some eight feet or so away from her.

Roughly, Kat shoves her right fist forwards. It hits the tree with a soft "thunk." Soft, because these gauntlets are primarily just leather. The second her fist touches it, they release a very loud and very large explosive beam of energy. Immediately the tree is disintigrated, enfulfed by its light.

Ten trees behind it are taken too, turned to nothing instantly. With that done, Kat immediately turns on her heel without pause. She makes her way over to another tree while moving as a blur. Upon coming within close proximity, she comes skidding to a stop. The girl's left fist is rising as she draws near.

It hits the bark of said tree shortly afterwords. Once more, the ground shakes. The roar produced by Kat's explosion is enough to be heard from a quarter mile away. Her hair is blown back wildly. Leaves on trees not caught in the blast are torn off by the resulting wind and shockwave alone. Without pause, Kat moves on to one final tree.

It too, is done away with nearly instantly. With that done, Kat's exhausted. Near passing out. So, with a huff, she sprints over to a nearby boulder. She leaps over to it, flipping forwards as she comes close. 

Upon reaching it, Kat plants her fist to it. One final explosion spits in nature's face. And with that, the teen collapses onto her back. She sleeps soundly for many long hours. When she eventually wakes, she stretches. After that, she turns on her heel and resumes making her way to Kirigakure.* - Wed Oct  7 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops near the Kirigakure gates. Non-shinobi, weak villagers scurry out, some clutching babies near their chests. With a sigh, Kat turns on her heel. That sight was enough to tell her she doesn't wanna be in Kirigakure right now. Hours pass.

Soon she's near the borders. The girl walks over the rather large lake, making use of Suimen. It's a very long walk, but worth it. Next stop will be Konoha. Kat needs to see for herself the damage reportedly done.* - Wed Oct  7 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops to rest in a tree somewhere. The same tree she'd slept in when she was fleeing Erebus. To this day she doubts he really was there to celebrate Kilm leading Kirigakure. Kilm's not capable. Erebus knew that, and Kat knew that.

She'd only made Kilm a chuunin so that Erebus wouldn't have the advantage as far as Kilm's favor went. She wanted him on her side. Kat's far from stupid. She'd never make that boy a chuunin or a jounin before he's proven himself which to this day he hasn't. It'd be nice yeah but you don't put genins lives in the hands of someone just so that said someone's feelings aren't hurt.

That's way worse than holding back promotions. Way more cruel.

Kat comes closer to Konoha.* - Wed Oct  7 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually finds the road between Genjigakure and Konoha. The girl turns on her heel and begins making her way north. She follows the path the entire way to her old home. Truth is, she should've gone back sooner. Before this happened.

Palms find the back of her head, and eyes wander. A silent sigh is released through the nose. It crosses her mind to take a headband somewhere. That'd mean fighting. She's not really a coward though. She just doesn't fight unless it's for something she actually believes in.

Orokuru ignoring her advice and going to Sunagakure; Zetsumo charging right into Suna and eventually Kirigakure, ignoring her fantastic advice each time -- those people can't ignore her advice yet expect bravery when their ignorance gets them killed. No. Kat leads herself. She's the only one smart enough to do that.* - Wed Oct  7 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What's up. - Wed Oct  7 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes Baen well before he's oh-so-close. Wayyyyyy before then. She sensed him the second he was within one-hundred feet.

As such, by the time he's in the square by the statue? Kat is sixty feet to the west. She'd slowly walked over there as Baen approached, keeping her eyes on him the entire time. Her hands are on her hips in the mean time.

"...Hello." she says.* - Wed Oct  7 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: You scared or something? - Wed Oct  7 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have nothing against you Baen. All I'm saying is, I have no idea who you are and judging by the weapon on your back you like to be up close. - Wed Oct  7 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing personal. - Wed Oct  7 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I don't use this spar. It's a promise to a...friend of mine. - Wed Oct  7 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: His confidence is also 'slightly' intimidating. - Wed Oct  7 05:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) the second Baen's hands begin moving, Kat's own arms rise. Her hands meet to form the tiger seal, just in case she has to dodge a jutsu.

And then? He uses shunshin.

Kat can track his movements due to her phenominal eyes and good reflexes.

She's a bit slow to react due to his speed, but by the time he's within twelve feet, Kat's activated her own shunshin jutsu.

-Her- signature technique too. Heh.

Kat flickers in and out of sight. When she reappears she's north of him, at the same distance as before.

The girl produces a faint, cheeky smile and only stares.* - Wed Oct  7 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, since her hands are still in formation of the tiger seal.

That, and as far as she knows, it'd take Baen time to draw his spear. Thus, he'd be twice as slow as usual to attack until it's already drawn.

With a sigh, she shrugs.

"Alright. . ." she says, keeping her senses locked onto him just in case.

"Anyway. Good to see you again I guess."* - Wed Oct  7 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Heh. Are you still the "Hokage" - Wed Oct  7 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm. No. I'm not stupid you see. I knew I wasn't ready to be Hokage. - Wed Oct  7 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was pressured into that. Not intentionally pressured but. . . - Wed Oct  7 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus was very intimidating. - Wed Oct  7 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yeah, well he's nothing now. - Wed Oct  7 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I'm glad he decided to leave after saying that. - Wed Oct  7 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Might of had to spark it on him. - Wed Oct  7 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Bwahahahahah~ - Wed Oct  7 05:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow. The girl has no idea what that phrase means.

"Spark it on him."

Kat says no words of course. She doesn't speak. Her body language does the questioning for her.* - Wed Oct  7 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Bwahahaha. - Wed Oct  7 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: It means, attack. - Wed Oct  7 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Wed Oct  7 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to look Baen up and down. With a shrug she says "Guess it's not fair to ask you how you ended up working for Erebus. That'd just be small talk anyway."* - Wed Oct  7 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I never worked for him. - Wed Oct  7 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'With' him? - Wed Oct  7 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I guess. - Wed Oct  7 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Our interests overlapped. - Wed Oct  7 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: And he let me spread my infamy so. - Wed Oct  7 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: He was my friend though. - Wed Oct  7 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs through the nose. "Yeah. Similar story here." she says.

"I did want to be Hokage, to honor a dead friend that wanted that. I told Erebus that, but only so he'd stop asking me what my sins were. Figured if I made him think I was a good person he'd leave me alone. One thing led to another...and I found myself enslaved to Konoha."* - Wed Oct  7 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- But. - Wed Oct  7 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Sounds about right. - Wed Oct  7 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wanted to be Hokage five years from now you see. - Wed Oct  7 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not any time soon. - Wed Oct  7 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Why? - Wed Oct  7 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why Hokage? Or why five years from now? - Wed Oct  7 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was a slave to Zetsumo for five years. During those years Zetsumo made me kill countless innocent people for "mental fortitude training." I was forced to torture for hours before killing. - Wed Oct  7 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: During that time I had one friend. A very close friend. - Wed Oct  7 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Orokuru, if you know him. - Wed Oct  7 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted to be Hokage. - Wed Oct  7 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was forced to kill him eventually, during the war against Sunagakure and Kirigakure -- against Zetsumo. - Wed Oct  7 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He died by my own hand. - Wed Oct  7 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He was my lover. - Wed Oct  7 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I know what it usually sounds like when someone says "I want to be Hokage." So. Sometimes I explain. - Wed Oct  7 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I see. - Wed Oct  7 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: When I ascend to the title of "Mankiller" I shall support your bid. - Wed Oct  7 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow, making eye contact.

"Why "Mankiller"?" she inquires, her expression still fairly neutral.

"Why that title?"* - Wed Oct  7 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Urek R. Mazino. - Wed Oct  7 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Also known as, my hero and Ideal being. - Wed Oct  7 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Wed Oct  7 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: He was the first. - Wed Oct  7 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Tetsujin is the second. I have his spear, he gave it to me as a promise that in one month's time, we shall face each other in combat for the title. - Wed Oct  7 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: If I win, I shall be the third. - Wed Oct  7 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Stronger than I expected, then. That, or suicidal. - Wed Oct  7 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: A bit of both~ - Wed Oct  7 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit. 

"Hmph."* - Wed Oct  7 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I've got a fight to win apparently. I'll see you later, Katsune. - Wed Oct  7 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Good luck. - Wed Oct  7 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had been exploring the village with her arms crossed. She's walking at a lazy pace and even with a subtle swagger. Ever since learning the landmine fist, her confidence has improved ten fold.

Kat comes to a stop. She looks Geralt up and down.

No words are said though.* - Wed Oct  7 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Wed Oct  7 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Former Konoha shinobi? - Wed Oct  7 05:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why are you still here? - Wed Oct  7 05:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why not? It's peaceful. Everyone else is gone. - Wed Oct  7 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Buildings destroyed. No shops to purchase food.... - Wed Oct  7 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Must be lonely and hard. - Wed Oct  7 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Lonely? I'm not exactly sure of the concept. I haven't exactly had the need of others. Though food is a bit hard to come by. - Wed Oct  7 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Other humans at least. - Wed Oct  7 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. Hands find her hips and weight shifts a bit. The now-much-taller teen takes a moment to consider his words.

She shrugs.

"Just wondering what people in general are still doing here. Expected a graveyard with no visitors."* - Wed Oct  7 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well, I'm not exactly a visitor, just a leftover I guess you could say. As for the graveyard statement, I prefer it this way. - Wed Oct  7 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Guess you could say I 'am' a visitor. - Wed Oct  7 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Came to see what was left. How hard and expensive it'd be to recover. - Wed Oct  7 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? You wouldn't be planning to fix it up would you? - Wed Oct  7 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some day. - Wed Oct  7 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe soon. Maybe not. - Wed Oct  7 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Been collecting money. Saving up. - Wed Oct  7 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mercenary work here and there. - Wed Oct  7 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Guess when you get around to it, I'll have to leave town then. - Wed Oct  7 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow.

"That so...?" she asks.

"Why?"* - Wed Oct  7 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Funny. - Wed Oct  7 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know the feeling sometimes. - Wed Oct  7 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Come to think of it -- probably why I like spending time with a certain man so much. - Wed Oct  7 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Wed Oct  7 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Murderer. Like myself. - Wed Oct  7 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No judgement when your hands are both equally bloody. - Wed Oct  7 06:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Wed Oct  7 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Former murderer anyway. - Wed Oct  7 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Keep my hands clean these days. - Wed Oct  7 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Wed Oct  7 06:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: That must be terrible for you. - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: No fun at all. - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Na. I miss the fighting and the risk. - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's all I miss though. - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm. - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Wed Oct  7 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why? Why cause death? - Wed Oct  7 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why not? It's always been a thing to keep my family entertained throughout the years, it's part of me. - Wed Oct  7 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What people do you kill? - Wed Oct  7 06:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? Depends really. - Wed Oct  7 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: My mood at the time, if I like the person, and so on. - Wed Oct  7 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why tell me this? - Wed Oct  7 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What makes you so sure I won't slaughter you for being this way? - Wed Oct  7 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you were going to, you would have by now instead of asking me these questions. - Wed Oct  7 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: This man was living in my village...? - Wed Oct  7 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head.

"Not true." she says.

"I'm in fact tempted."* - Wed Oct  7 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: But, wouldn't that make you the same as me in the long run? - Wed Oct  7 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well. That's why you're not dead yet. - Wed Oct  7 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was like you once. If someone had killed me back then....they'd have been a monster. - Wed Oct  7 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even now.... - Wed Oct  7 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm always tempted. To just kill. - Wed Oct  7 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way. This village is dead so you're not my responsibility. - Wed Oct  7 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: You have to admit, it had a bit of a joy to it. - Wed Oct  7 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People travel at their own risk. Villages are responsible for keeping you out. - Wed Oct  7 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs silently through the nose.

"And what if someone did that to you?" she inquires.

"Unexpectedly?"* - Wed Oct  7 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression remains blank despite her words.

"You're like a cockroach." she notes.

"Only a menace. No good to anyone in any circumstance whatsoever. Just...a cockroach."* - Wed Oct  7 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit. - Wed Oct  7 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I miss having company like yours. - Wed Oct  7 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Wed Oct  7 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Is that so? - Wed Oct  7 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't miss the enemies. - Wed Oct  7 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People who were convinced, killing you was completely fine and people who had no second thoughts about it. They were right too. - Wed Oct  7 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: I fortunately haven't had enemies strong enough to think about staying around me yet. - Wed Oct  7 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: And as for killing. - Wed Oct  7 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I said, I myself don't exactly kill. . .I sort have am, a middle man of it? - Wed Oct  7 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: I guess if you were to trace it back, it would be because of me though. - Wed Oct  7 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Information broker? - Wed Oct  7 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct  7 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes go out of focus for a moment. Slowly, she takes a step or two backwards.

What the fuck this is, she has no idea. Nothing she'd ever have expected to possibly be real; that's for sure.

The girl remembers to breath, drawing in a silent breath through the nose.

Kat says nothing. Eyes are focused once more when she turns her attention to Geralt once more. She's composed, though she can't speak.* - Wed Oct  7 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. With that, she turns on her heel and begins walking away.

"I'm done here." she says.* - Wed Oct  7 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way through Konoha's front gates and begins walking. Kat's expression is blank, and eyes wander. A silent sigh is released through the nose. Traveling. Without traveling companions, it's the most boring thing in the world.

At some point, Kat makes her way up the base of a tree by way of Suimen. Legs wrap around a tree branch, and arms cross over her chest. With that done, the teen begins pulling herself upwards. Sit-ups. Kat repeats repitions of these for two or three full hours before moving on. * - Wed Oct  7 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down, with her legs spraweled out underneath her form. The girl sighs. Her right arm rises with the hand clenched into a fist, and she plants said fist to the dirt. Kat's left palm meets her right arm. Kat's going to be training landmine fist.

And she's aware she needs to be concentrating. She can't afford to waste even a single landmine fist even during training. As much chakra as it costs, she has to make each one count. Learn from each one as much as possible. And so, it's very carefully that she pours chakra into her fist.

Eventually the expected explosion of her true signature technique is set off. Earth is disintirgrated for several inches of depth even as enormous amounts of other explosive energy is thrown in all directions. The ground shakes. Dirt is thrown all over the place. Kat draws in a silent, deep breath through the nose.

Not enough to knock her out, but tiring all the same. Kat takes a moment to cool off; to let her chakra circuits stop going wild. It takes a full minute. Eventually though, she's ready for another use of this jutsu. Once more, the unbelievably loud, reverberating boom is released.

Kat's hair is and skirt are blown back. Pebbles are thrown to and fro. The dirt turns black. It's near Kat's bed time anyway, so she keeps training. She can afford to run out of chakra.

With that in mind, the girl rises to her feet and turns on her heel to move to a better location. She's now left a crater so large in the previous position that it's no longer ideal for training. She sits down once more. This time, Kat's left fist meets the dirt. Once more, she begins preparing chakra.

She shoves only half of the required chakra into her fist, suddenly. With that, she attempts to perform the jutsu. As a result, she's left with only a tiny, loud bang. It's akin to the exploding palm jtsu. Another sigh is released, this time one of impatience.

Hours pass, with Kat having released many, many more of these tiny explosions. Eventually though she sleeps and then resumes traveling.  Any bandits she meets along the way are blown apart from the inside out without hesitation. More target practice.* - Wed Oct  7 16:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way to the top of a damned mountain. Apparently it takes longer to get to Sunagakure than she thought. As such, she's decided to kill her boredom by training a little bit more. She's using Suimen, so she's quite safe. With a shrug, the girl rams her right fist into said mountain near the peak.

She uses the inside of said mountain to set off the explosion. It's shifted to something easily flammable like sulfur. And then she simply drops a tiny spark of lightning. A massive explosion results, as per the nature of landmine fist. A large hole is left.

This, the mountain top is left flat and relatively soft. With a smile on her face, Kat crawls up onto it. With a nod, she lies down on her back with arms and legs sprawled out at either side of her. Eyes close, and she sleeps. A makeshift bed.

When she wakes up, Kat resumes traveling, really wishing Konoha had caravans right now.* - Wed Oct  7 16:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually shrugs. She's feeling pretty lazy right now, but she pulls her legs close and then rises up. Palms find her hips, and with a very dull expression on her face she stares up at the still-much-taller boy.* - Wed Oct  7 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.

She's in a bad mood because she took a wrong turn on the way back to Sunagakure.* - Wed Oct  7 16:43:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny. Those are pretty much all of the techniques I haven't mastered yet. - Wed Oct  7 17:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Okay, cool. Thanks. - Wed Oct  7 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, and begins thinking up ideas for a very long training montage.* - Wed Oct  7 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her back to the ground with a sigh. She's lying down flat. Palms are facing the sky, though she turns her arms over at the time to plant said palms against the dirt. With that, it begins slowly shifting. The earth turns to mud. From there, it shifts further until it's reminiscent of water.

Kat begins floating in the substance. Lazily, she paddles with her feet and strokes with her arms. She'll need to master an awful lot of jutsus to secure a jutsu trade with Lera. Gotta be worth it too. More versatility is always nice. 

The girl's not asking for anything uncommon either aside from the Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot, so it's not like Kat's committing shinobi taboo -- so long as she gets something of equal value in return. That and Yan has already started spreading Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot. It's stupid and she should probably kill him before it goes too far, but the fact remains. They're not that rare.

Lazily Kat turns in place and begins swimming. Arms meet at her sides, and she uses only her legs. Kat's training yes but she can afford to be lazy. The only thing she needs to focus on at the moment is reducing the needed chakra for this technique. Even aside from trades, though, this jutsu could still prove more useful when mastered.

And so, she's willing. Kat swims for nearly a mile before she stumbles upon an enclosure full of craters. The area she'd trained her landmine fist at. With a shrug she swims circles around the area. All the while she's concentrating hard, and withholding a smuch chakra from her hungry jutsu as she can.* - Wed Oct  7 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself out of the earth after hours of training. Kat had nearly mastered Subterannean Voyage, and now her training is complete. She's sure of it. She can now sense what goes on above with perfect clarity, by way of magnetic sensing. Said senses are as good now as they are with Hiding Like a Mole Jutsu. 

Of course, her general sensory training helps an awful lot. Either way, she's convinced -- it's mastered. With a nod, and a sigh, Kat sits down with legs sprawled out underneath her form. Palms meet the earth. She now begins chanelling chakra into its depths.

Something Kat's been wanting to try for a very long while...is using the Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot technique to strike underground targets. She has no doubt it's not only viable, but probably a rather easy thing to do. After all, the spikes form underground first. Afterwords they charge through it, tearing through earth to get to their target. If they tear through earth on the way out, why wouldn't she be able to strike underground targets with it?

These facts combined with her sensory abilities has her convinced. Hiding from her by going underground is a bad idea. Eventually, with her chakra, Kat forms the mentioned spikes. They're roughly as hard as steel. Steel release is almost a joke, you see. 

Literally earth can be moulded to be as hard as steel. It's canon. Once Kat's spikes are formed, she exerts her will to send them racing through the ground. They rip and tear, and glide. Eventually all four spikes meet at a center, within the ground. And so Kat's theory is proven. She can do this.

With a shrug, she continues practicing.

* - Wed Oct  7 18:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and begins traveling the desert. Once more, Kat's training has come to a halt. She needs to means of practicing her jutsu. New targets for target practice. Eventually, Kat stumbles upon a herd of gazelle or whatever japanese equivalent there is.

With a shug, she submerges herself within the ground and approaches. She wouldn't want to scare them off after all. Eventually, she's close. The girl rises up behind a bush. The second she does, she plants both palms to the ground.

Moving targets. Roughly, with her chakra, she shoves earthen spikes towards one of them. It's impaled instantly of course. That sends the others running. In response, Kat conjures up more spikes. Her chakra has to trail after them.

It takes time for her chakra to reach them, much less for the spikes to actually catch them. Even so, she succeeds. Hardly perfect accuracy, but when spikes are coming from four different directions you're typically 500% fucked anyway as far as dodging goes. It's a good thing this jutsu requires you to be on the ground to use it. If this weren't the case, it'd be comparable to a forbidden jutsu.

Abominable. More of the beasts drop dead shortly afterwords. Some are simply impaled and scewered while still standing. They're left there for any passers-by to see. When Kat's done, she rises up with a sigh. The girl resumes traveling, looking for more targets.* - Wed Oct  7 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and lifts her arms. Hands meet to form the tiger seal. Kat has a few more jutsus to master if she wants to secure a jutsu trade with Lera. If she masters them all, she can get one of four extremely valuable techniques. No one could turn up that offer.

A jutsu that makes her skin armor, a jutsu that makes her fly, or one that makes very useful clones. Clones that can be used as a medium for landmine fist. Roughly, Kat shoves raiton chakra throughout her body. It travels quickly. As a result, a very large plume of lightning is produced. 

It engulfs the girl and the air around her, shocking it and hissing loudly. Crackling. Immediately after this lightning fades away, Kat just produces the same effect. This is repeated over and over again for hours and hours. All the while, Kat's chakra remains perfectly fine and far from depleted.

Hardly phased. Her relatively large reserves paired with personal lessons from Zetsumo leaves her in decent shape. She's no unstoppable monster but she out-smarts literally everyone she ever fights anyway. Not a single one of them compare in creativity. Not. A single. One.

It's the only reason she wins, ever. More hours pass. Kat begins walking, at a lazy pace while she trains. The lightning courses out, mostly undisturbed. Kat needs to train this jutsu as thoroughly as possible so she makes sure to test out every single nook and cranny of it.

At some point, she opts to direct her chakra at the ground. The lightning is triggered as always, and she makes her best effort to conduct it through the earth. Little differences are noted, but she can definitely confirm an increased range. It's very subtle though. This useless technique still, even so, becomes slightly less useless.* - Wed Oct  7 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stumbles upon a farm. Inside a pin are chickens. With a completely blank expression on her face, Kat's eyes slowly wander to and fro. She looks for signs that the owners are home.  Eventually, with hands still in position for the tiger seal, she confirms that there are none.

Carefully, she climbs into the pen without use of her arms. She then walks up at a lazy pace to the nearest fowl. It scurries a bit, and she still stares with the same dull expression in her eyes. Abruptly, the teen shoves raiton-natured chakra throughout. The usual massive plume of lightning is released, shocking any targets nearby.

Namely, a chicken. Naturally it's made very angry. It's briefly stunned. It doesn't die, though. That's how stupidly and autistically useless this jutsu is.

Kat's target flees. As such, she's forced to sprint off after it. While she waits for her chakra circuits to cool off, she's left chasing it for a rather long while despite how much faster she is. Each time her chakra circuits cool off, Kat delivers another shock to her moving target.

Each time, she grows slightly more proficient in the garbage jutsu. Its only value is for trading to Lera. Otherwise? She'd never even bother. If she could get a refund on the time spent learning this jutsu she would.* - Wed Oct  7 19:20:32 2015
