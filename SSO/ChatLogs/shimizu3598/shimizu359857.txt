For a brief moment, Kat burries her face into her legs.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls a shakey hand to her mouth. The left hand. She covers her lips.

Kat's not sure she can keep from puking. For several long seconds, she takes deep and silent, but very slow and subtle breaths.

And then, she speaks.

"I...got raped." Kat says.

"But Zetsumo."* - Wed Nov  4 03:09:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks over her shoulder in his general direction, lifting an eyebrow.

When his actual question comes out, her eyes slowly wander off.

She sighs silently.

"Didn't know why." Kat says.

"Now I do."* - Wed Nov  4 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

"Good." Kat says.

"Because I killed my best friend...and all my other friends are afraid of me now. I don't have....anyone else to talk to."* - Wed Nov  4 03:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Maybe a few drinks and relaxing? - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That'd work. - Wed Nov  4 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the bottle in hand with a nod. Eyes wander off as she brings it to her lips. Afterwords, Kat lifts the bottom of it up, and begins pouring alchohol into her mouth. More than once, she gulps.

When Kat pulls the bottle away, she does so with a silent sigh.

"Now I remember why I started drinking." Kat says.

She passes the bottle back.* - Wed Nov  4 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was to hide my stress....about the rape... - Wed Nov  4 04:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I wasn't able to talk to him. - Wed Nov  4 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To open up to him. - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was hiding it. - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What it turned into.... - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was me keeping him close, while keeping him in the dark. - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander over to meet Index's.

"You see?" she inquires.

She looks relatively calm despite the topic.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But....you let me know..? - Wed Nov  4 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes slowly wander off.

"Yeah..." she says.* - Wed Nov  4 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "You're right." she says.

"No more sake."

Slowly Kat lies back down. She turns to face away from Index, and she lies on her side. Legs are pulled close to her form. Once there, Kat reaches up to wrap her arms around her legs, snuggly.

"Truth is, I -wanted- to talk to Kilm. I didn't...pretend to like him. I wanted his help. So he tried. He could tell I wanted help. It's why he tried. It wasn't evil."* - Wed Nov  4 04:24:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was in front of Kilm. - Wed Nov  4 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I did it so I could talk to him without him reading me. - Wed Nov  4 04:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So that he'd stop liking me. - Wed Nov  4 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I chased him away. - Wed Nov  4 04:28:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes water up.

"He died, trying to help me. Even during his last breath." she explains.

Tears begin sliding down the surface of her face.

"As he died, he told me 'I'll let you do this....if it makes you happy.'"* - Wed Nov  4 04:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly sits up in bed. Her legs are left sprawled out underneath her form. Palms rest on the mattress inbetween her legs. Eyes wander.

"He asked me...to find a way to bring him back." Kat says.* - Wed Nov  4 04:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's what he lived for. - Wed Nov  4 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's what his group was probably 'intended' for. - Wed Nov  4 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ... - Wed Nov  4 04:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The more I think about it, I can't help but feel, that this group was intended to make the world he thought you wanted. - Wed Nov  4 04:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits up. She wipes tears off of her face.

Afterwords Kat turns to face him.

She lifts an eyebrow at him. Her expression's pretty relaxed.* - Wed Nov  4 04:53:32 2015

Kat nods. Afterwords she takes a slow and deep breath. With that done, she turns around and lies back down. Kat faces the opposite direction. Her legs are pulled close, and her palms rest sandwhiched inbetween her legs.

"But...what'd you have in mind?"* - Wed Nov  4 06:05:13 2015

"Alright." she says.

"One day...to relax. We'll have that."* - Wed Nov  4 06:10:20 2015

"Actually...." Kat says.

"I need sleep. Kilm's beyond terrifying, due to what's driving him. His obsession with me, and his heartbreak over me not loving him. It's so terrifying....that I need some sleep. Just some time to rest.....and stuff."* - Wed Nov  4 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she crawls into the covers and curls up into a ball.
