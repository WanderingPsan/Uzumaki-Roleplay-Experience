<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You're dismissed Katsune. - Tue Oct 20 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to read through the scroll. Her expression is neutral when she nods and says "Right."

Neutral, because Kat used to be a "criminal" herself.

Afterwords she puts the scroll away and forms the tiger seal. Kat makes her exit by disappreaing in a puff of smoke.* - Tue Oct 20 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way to her house before going to complete her B-ranked mission. She flies, literally speaking. After getting supplies, among other things, Kat heads off. Maybe an hour passes before she arrives. Relatively little is chakra used despite her flying.

Why? Because it does use large amounts of chakra every second but -- there are less "seconds" that pass over all when you're flying. Any hills or trees that'd normally impede her progress are taken out of the equation so she covers enormous amounts of ground in a small amount of time. And eventually she arrives at her destination. The execution isn't schedueled for a few more hours so after informing the captain of this outpost that she's here, Kat takes a nap to replenish her chakra.

When she wakes, she eats. Afterwords she heads off to meet the captain of the outpost once more. Two shinobi are given to her to aid in her assignment. Genin, but capable ones. Not fresh out of the academy.

With glances at either of them, Kat nods and then allows the captain to inform her of what she's doing and why. It'd seem that a Sunagakure ninja who uses puppets for combat has begun experimenting on humans. No one's sure why. Naturally, the very first guess is that he's simply batshit insane. Kat agrees, thinking little else of it.

It's also made clear that of course, the puppeteer does not yet know that the outpost authorities are aware of his illegal activities. That's why this mission is labeled as an "execution" and not an assassination. Now that Kat knows everything she needs to know, she informs the man that she'll be successful and then she turns around and leaves.

And so with her head held high, Kat makes her way down the streets. The girl walks with a bit of a swagger. As she moves, she makes the clone seal. At her side a puff of smoke appears, and immediately a clone of her comes walking out. It follows at her right flank.

And so in time, all of them arrive at the criminal's house. "Don Kanonji" by name according to Hassan. They're fourty feet away and have started moving slowly as they drew near. Quietly, Kat simply orders her squad mates to go and block any exits other than the main one. One of them sinks underground by way of Hiding Like a Mole, while another makes use of rather exceptional but generic stealth abilities -- soft footsteps and the like. Katsune too uses Hiding Like a Mole, though she'd intended to do so anyway.

Her intel informs her that her prey has his lab in the basement. And so, Kat first intends to make sure that the basement has no underground exits. By way of magnetic sensing, she quickly confirms that it has none. Furthermore, with magnetic and traditional sensing abilties combined she manages to determine beyond any doubt that her target is in fact in his basement at this time. Excellent news of course, because that means she can walk through the front door.

So, Kat returns to the surface and joins up with her allies. Quietly she asks if any of them are good at picking locks. As it turns out, she's actually lucky for once. As it so happens, one of her comrades has a jutsu for making metal rust very quickly. Earth release.

Clearly the most versatile of all elements. With a nod, Kat requests that the man get rid of the door knob at the entrance. In time, they're at the associated door and this is taken care of. It turns to dust, and falls silently to the ground. Kat's palm finds the surface of the door and she applies her knowledge of the Suimen technique,

Using this as well as the Lightweight Rock Technique, Kat is able to hold the door completely still while her comrade then turns the henges, too, to dust. And so, silently, Kat removes the door. That rust jutsu is something she has to have. The door is passed to Kat's clone, and it silently places it aside. The clone then makes its way to Kat's back.

With it there, she's able to fly. And so, she hovers up into the air and moves with complete, literal silence. The ability is given to her fellow earth release user as well for the brief moment. That is, Kat reduces the person's weight so that he can follow her. By way of all of this patience and planning, the trio finally at some point make it to the final obstacle.

The basement door. With a silent sigh, Kat reaches up to place her palm against it. Abruptly, there's an explosion coming from the palm. It's loud, and reminiscent of a gunshot. Immediately the doorknob itself is sent flying, and loudly, across the room. 

With a loud clank it rams into the wall on the other side. Naturally, Don nearly wets himself. He flinches so hard that a corpse he'd been working on is molested by one of the surgical tools he'd been using. Blood squirts all over the place, and some of it gets on his own face. With knees shaking, the man slowly steps backwards.

His mouth is agape, and he stares ahead. He has no words. As Kat comes hovering into the room, she doesn't have any either. Blankly she stares at him. The teen had been planning on questioning him first and confirming his guilt. That'd be the humane and reasonable thing to do; and as always, Kat is humane and reasonable.

That's why she didn't simply landmine fist him through the basement floor. With the corpse right there in front of her, though, there's little to ask. Using a casual inside voice, Kat asks one of her comrades; "Any chance at all that he has this corpse legally?"

As of course expected, she's given a no. Both genin's knees are trembling as well just from the sight of the dead body. With a nod, Kat races ahead. She's moving as a blur. Within a brief moment, Kat's in range for her landmine fist.
 
As she comes skidding to a stop, her left arm is aimed ahead with the hand clenched into a fist. She's six feet away so her enemy can't get her with a sword or anything and she knows it. That's why she's so bold. Abruptly, Kat then shoves explosion release chakra into her chakra flow gauntlet. Using the weapon as the trigger for her landmine fist, an insanely loud beam of chakra is unleashed. 

The house shakes. Her opponent is consumed within the span of a millisecond. He's disintigrated entirely. Had he been caught on-guard with ten puppets in tow this would've been a different scene entirely. However, that was not the case. Kat's mission is complete so she heads home.* - Tue Oct 20 07:28:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Feats. Things most people wouldn't even stand a chance of mastering. - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Mastering? - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I should show you one of mine some day. - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Maybe my genjutsu technique that makes everything dark. - Tue Oct 20 09:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I guess impressive could be one of three... - Tue Oct 20 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: My Wind Armor takes ridiculous amounts of chakra and focuses them around my body at an insane rate that changes my body....My 2 finger Nukite takes all of the chakra that I would be using for Wind Armor and focuses it on just 2 fingers, it creates a blade so sharp I cut through Jiki's Iron Sand Armor and shield in one lunge and stil cut into his body. - Tue Oct 20 09:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds like you could've taken on Zetsumo alone. Then again, I never was skilled enough to test his strength that well. - Tue Oct 20 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But my greatest technique... - Tue Oct 20 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Well most impressive. - Tue Oct 20 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Is a technique I developed that uses my body as a medium and forms hundred of explosion tages made from my chakra, they all eplode at one, just before they explode they summon another to explode as well, it creates a never-ending massive explosion. - Tue Oct 20 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It could probably level a city. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And it's a forbidden jutsu. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: In short, its an explosion that keeps going until it kills the target. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Nope. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I never was good at fuuinjutsu. - Tue Oct 20 09:44:57 2015
