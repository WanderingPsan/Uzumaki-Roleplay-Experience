<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || As Kat and company draw near to the territory of their C rank mission's scorpions, Kat forms the clone seal. In a puff of smoke, a mud clone identical to Katsune appears at her side. It remains there until otherwise noted. Within a small amount of time, the scorpions are in view in the distant horizon. With a wave of her arm, Kat sends her clone forwards.

Immediately the unintelligent golem of a clone darts forwards. It moves as a blur. It takes only thirty full seconds or so for it to reach the scorpions. The moment it does, it comes skidding to a stop. Mid-slide, the clone kneels down. 

It forms the snake seal and them rams its palms into the ground. In response, the ground shakes. Out of the earth comes the beginnings of a dome of earth even as a scorpion jabs its stinger into the clone. Unfortunately for the scorpion, though, it's made of mud. You can't poison mud.

Soon, all of the scorpions are trapped inside. It's one-hundred feet wide in any direction and twenty feet tall. The clone is stabbed a few more times. Each time, the mud spills quickly from the hole and is then replaced as the clone regenerates. With the dome finished, though, Kat's clone leaps up to the top of it.

A hole was left in the cieling, so the clone slips out. Kat then motions towards the corridor with her head. "'Kay." she says. "Now we just kill em all before they come out." The teen then begins sprinting forwards. She moves as a blur. 

It may take a moment for the others to catch up, but that's perfectly fine. For now, she'll make sure the numbers are short among those that have actually left the dome. "Hope you all know Suimen!" she shouts as she moves.* - Fri Oct 16 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || When Kat arrives at her dome, she remembers something. Marrissa wanted an opening to use her wind sickle something or other. With that in mind, she comes skidding to a stop at the base of the dome. Her clone up above launches Exploding Palm after Exploding Palm specifically into the stingers if any and all scorpions that approach it. Between the clone's reflexes and speed, it has little difficulty. The real girl waits at the corridor's base until she senses Marrisa drawing near. Her palm is on the dome already. When she's finally caught up -- assuming she hasn't been keeping up the entire time, Kat uses her chakra to create a rather large, door-shaped entrance for Marrisa's jutsu.

The girl then forms a few handseals. The earth flash jutsu is performed, and the real Kat kneels down to ram a palm into the ground. Lightning races forwards, conducted by the earth. Many loud, reverberating, crackling booms are sounded off each time the lightning forces itself forwards. It comes forth as a wave and thus shocks many scorpions.

Many die, while others are simply stunned. The chuunin is doing her best simply to give Marissa time to use her own jutsu. A jutsu far more suitable for this than Katsune's own. Even so, she needs to make sure her comrade stays safe while she works. For ever second that passes, Katusne's clone is still fighting up above. 

It has little trouble considering what their opponents are. The clone is also sure to protect Susumu and Trilliam in the mean time.

* - Fri Oct 16 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Scorpions are racing out at a somewhat ridiculous pace for the record. Occasionally, Kat or or clone are forced to put their hands together and form the tiger seal. Each time, a massive and incredibly powerful torrent of mud races forwards. 

The effect it has is the send any and all scorpions crashing back into the dome, hilariously and effortlessly. Occasionally, Kat takes advantage of the mud. Hands meet to weave three handseals together. Since her opponents are knocked back, Kat uses the mud. Out of it comes a structure of mud, in the shape of a dragon's head. Its eyes and throat glow white, and a smug expression is on its face as it opens its maw.

Out of said mouth comes a wave of mud bullets. A barrage. With each bullet produced, it releases a loud bang as if it's a gatling machine gun. Hundreds of bullets race forwards. Each time a mud ball hits a scorpion, the scorpion dies instantly.

Even so, many more scorpions are left. With their numbers dwindled down, Kat takes a few steps backwards. Carefully she keeps a watchful eye over the genin she's leading though. She needs to make sure they're safe. That's without a doubt while Hassan sent her with them.* - Fri Oct 16 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: why* - Fri Oct 16 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) produces another clone. This one turns and sprints up to the surface of the dome to make absolutely sure Trilliam and Susumu are okay. Earth clones aren't entirely sentient but between the two of them, they're competent enough to protect two genin from mere giant scorpions. And that's pretty much all they do. The two clones make sure Susumu and Trilliam aren't forced to fight more than one scorpion at a time.

However, for the most part, the clones let the two fight on their own. The point of chuunin and jounin leading C ranked missions is usually to give an example and train genin. The girl knows this, so she plays her role accordingly. If Hassan just wanted the mission done, he would've sent Kat to do it all by herself -- which she's very much capable of.* - Fri Oct 16 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares at Trilliam's exploding clay. The girl's mouth falls very slightly agape for the moment. Eventually though she reclaims her composure and sends the boy a glance.

He's definitely got her interest 'now.'

Eventually though with a silent breath, Kat nods and turns around. She begins walking.

"Alright." she says.

"Back to Sunagakure."* - Fri Oct 16 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- And Trilliam? - Fri Oct 16 22:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She wanders ten feet southwest of her current position to avoid shocking anyone.

The girl's hands meet to form the ram seal. Abruptly, she then sees raiton chakra into her hands. At a phenominal speed, it coats her entire body then and spreads outwards as if to form an aura of raiton. It'd shock anyone nearby, which is Kat moved first.

No one's within its range at the moment.* - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Just Hiding Like a Mole. Not overly useful in actual fights, but it's a versatile technique. Unlike the last jutsu I taught you, this one can make caves and hide you underground a bit better. - Fri Oct 16 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Sounds good then. - Fri Oct 16 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and begins walking away, towards the gates.* - Fri Oct 16 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll see you guys around. - Fri Oct 16 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Aight. - Fri Oct 16 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Marrisa, wanna have a friendly small spar? - Fri Oct 16 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, having planted herself east of Index. She's standing with arms at her sides, though at this time she forms and holds the snake seal. "Alright." she says.

"This jutsu can be performed without handseals when you have some skill with it, but the snake seal helps a lot when you're still learning." After this pause, Kat slowly kneels down. Her hands part, and her palms touch the dirt beneath her.

They stay there, and her eyes follow said hands.

"After pouring doton chakra into your hands, you kneel down and shove it into the ground." Kat does so.

"It becomes almost as soft as water, so you can easily dig through it." Kat's arms extend to one entire foot beneath the surface of the earth, and she cups some dirt at that depth within her hands. She then pulls it out and holds it up for Index to see. After making eye contact to make sure he's paying attention, she resumes talking.

"Then you begin digging. The instant you're underground, you pour your chakra into the rest of your body too. You keep it there, like an invisible aura. This way you can keep making the ground soft as you go."

Kat then brushes her hands off and rises to her feet.

"There. Now you try." she says.* - Fri Oct 16 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Fri Oct 16 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms are crossed by now. The girl's eyes suggest a good mood as she watches him finish learning the jutsu, presumably after hours and hours of hard work.

With a nod, afterwords, she wanders up.

The teen stands at his side and faces the south.

"Back to town now?" she suggests.* - Fri Oct 16 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. We could do that, I guess. - Fri Oct 16 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What do you have a taste for? - Fri Oct 16 23:41:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then Sushi, The lady will get. - Fri Oct 16 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a step off to the side, putting herself out of reach of his arm.

With that, Kat begins walking away, leading the way to Sunagakure.

"Sure." she says.* - Fri Oct 16 23:47:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Table. - Fri Oct 16 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down and such.

Afterwords she looks through the offered menu.* - Fri Oct 16 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) just orders a bowl of assorted sushi. A very big bowl, with a lot of variety.

The teen probably won't eat it all, but no one ever taught her to not waste food.* - Sat Oct 17 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and takes the glass. She's not in the mood for sake but it'd be rude to not take it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up a roll of sushi. A wet one, stuffed with some sort of sauce. Abruptly with eyes averted she throws it at his face, a bit hard. Her body is augmented with the lighweight rock technique as well for the moment to improve her odds of hitting him.

She aims for the square center of his face.* - Sat Oct 17 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) produces a smug smile and stares at him, with palms still holding her face.

She stares.

At least half of her sushi remains, but she leaves it untouched.* - Sat Oct 17 01:04:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) walks through and all that.

Immediately the girl makes her way over to the nearest line-up of dresses. At a lazy pace she begins browsing through them.

She seems to take an interest in yukatas in particular, though the occasional glance is directed at a kimono or two.* - Sat Oct 17 01:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well if you want to wear it in public that's up to you, The dare was to wear it at your house while I was there. - Sat Oct 17 01:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up a black & pink yukata. It's a mini-dress.

With a shrug she holds it up and faces Index. Eyes are averted from him when she says "Maybe this one."* - Sat Oct 17 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she folds it over an arm.

"Yeah." she says.
"Not wearing it in public."* - Sat Oct 17 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She then follows him.* - Sat Oct 17 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression suggests a good mood in some ambiguous subtle way.

No out-of-place smile or anything though.

This is a teen that had "survival of the fittest" drilled into her head for years after all.* - Sat Oct 17 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 17 01:29:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go change, giving Index plenty of time to do whatever.

When she comes back she's wearing the mini-dress. It goes up to the top of her thighs, though her butt's not hanging out or anything.

Kat's arms are behind her back for the moment, and her eyes are averted. The girl's cheeks have just a bit of pink on them.

She owns no shoes that would match appropriately, so she's barefoot. This is after all a teen that prefers to look intimidating. She doesn't have much as far as nice clothes go.* - Sat Oct 17 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I...should have tried this on before we left the store. - Sat Oct 17 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords at a lazy pace she makes her way over to the couch. She sits with her legs pulled up onto said furniture and sprawled out underneath her form. Her dress is short enough that it's pretty much her bare butt that's resting on the cushions, though her dress does cover her up well enough that nothing is seen.

"Wasn't supposed to be...so short though." she says.

She decides not to lean forwards for a glass of water.* - Sat Oct 17 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods in response to his first suggestion.

She takes the offered water absent-mindedly then and sips.* - Sat Oct 17 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Sat Oct 17 01:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Although, I can hardly fight if kicking shows people things they aren't supposed to see. - Sat Oct 17 01:45:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes are averted when she says "You're wrong."

"People can attack at any moment. We don't have the luxury of always knowing ahead of time when we'll be fighting."* - Sat Oct 17 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't note that this is a world of shinobi because it's ICly obvious.* - Sat Oct 17 01:51:47 2015

Afterwords she rises to her feet, choosing not to fly for various reasons.

Afterwords she makes her way to the back of the couch. The back, so that Index might not be watching her the whole time.

Lazily she falls onto her palms, very slowly due to her lightweight technique.

When they meet the ground, she slowly begins doing push-ups. There are ten in all. Kat's dress manages to barely do its job and preserver her dignity.* - Sat Oct 17 02:15:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this in a facetious manner. Slowly she does hover up into the air though. After a brief moment of hesitation, she opts to simply fly sideways.

She lands with her side pressed against his and then leans over to hug him from the aside.

It's the only way she can imagine doing this successfully without sitting in his lap or cheating the dare.

Eyes are averted. Her arms specifically are wrapped around his torso.* - Sat Oct 17 02:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes, wearing a faint and cheeky smile on her face.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink. Eyes wander, and she silently draws in a deep breath. She's hesitant for a long while, even as her clone pours her more sake.

Eventually though the girl submits with a nod.

With eyes averted she hovers up into the air. Slowly she flies over in his direction while still facing the south.

Soon, her butt is gently planted in his lap. Her legs rest at his sides. The teen wiggles into a comfortable position without much hesitation.

Eventually she's leaning backwards with one leg crossed over the left.

Of course, with her dress being so short, it's her bare butt that's on his lap.

She sips at her sake.* - Sat Oct 17 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shifts a bit, uncomfortably, in his lap. Her legs end up back on the couch. Eyes wander as she drinks her alchohol.* - Sat Oct 17 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What exactly are all of your elemental affinities? - Sat Oct 17 03:06:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes her clone for a moment. "Drink a bottle of mustard." she says.

"Within the span of five minutes."

Her clone gets up to go fetch the mustard.

Because otherwise, he'd have to find a way to get it without Kat leaving his lap.* - Sat Oct 17 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mmmm..... - Sat Oct 17 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dare. But this is the last one. After this, I wanna go train or something. - Sat Oct 17 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, with a silent sigh. Eventually she passes her cup to her clone. Afterwords she draws a leg in to turn around. As a result, her thigh is made bare for the brief moment.

She's eventually facing him though, with legs resting at his side. For a moment she's hesitant and eyes wander. 

Eventually though, Kat leans forwards. Arms wrap around his neck, awkwardly, and her head rests over his shoulder. Eyes are averted.* - Sat Oct 17 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Afterwords she backs out of the hug, hovering up onto her feet during the motion.

Without a word she wanders off to go change.

When she comes back, she's in her usual outfit.* - Sat Oct 17 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Her arms are behind her back for the moment.

"You didn't." she says. She looks relatively relaxed by now.* - Sat Oct 17 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your silence 'does' make me uncomfortable. - Sat Oct 17 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns on her heel to wander off to the door.* - Sat Oct 17 03:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you want to be immuned, the only way is to blind yourself in literally every way. - Sat Oct 17 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I hate genjutsu more than anything. - Sat Oct 17 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Also why I think the concept of the savant gene is autism incarnate. - Sat Oct 17 05:19:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You look for things that seem unlikely or otherwise off. - Sat Oct 17 05:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For a shinobi, we know what's normal and what's not because we've seen things. - Sat Oct 17 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just thinking about it irritates me. If a single genjutsu user was as good as I am with ideas they'd be pretty much unstoppable. - Sat Oct 17 05:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks down at Bryson's offered hand. The girl smiles a bit. Only because she's truly convinced this man is not a ninja in any way, she reaches out to take it.

While shaking it, she makes eye contact.

"For starters..." she says, teaching him about ninja as he requested.

"I can kill you with a handshake by making your hand explode. That's a jutsu of mine."* - Sat Oct 17 05:31:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I see... so a touch from a shinobi is dangerous in all senses? - Sat Oct 17 05:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There exist people in this world that'd kill for petty reasons. Kill people through inhumane ways that leave no chance even for defending yourself. Kill people that can't possibly defend themselves because they're too weak. - Sat Oct 17 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Killing with a handshake...is not what I invented my Exploding Palm jutsu for. - Sat Oct 17 05:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because he was afraid to die. - Sat Oct 17 05:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off, a bit slowly. She doesn't respond for a long while.* - Sat Oct 17 05:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes eye contact. Her expression is blank, and she hesitates to speak for a long while. Eventually though she says,

"I started training when I was eight years old. Three years before meeting Zetsumo."

She pauses.

"I made that decision at that time to become a shinobi because I wanted to kill people. I wanted to kill everyone."* - Sat Oct 17 06:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. The teen takes a slow step or two backwards, and her composure only very subtly suggests small amounts of discomfort. Already she regrets saying so much.

Even so, for the most part she remains composed. This is a person that absolutely refuses to show weakness no matter what the situation is.

Kat's hands find her hips and she turns to face the west. Silently she takes a deep breath. Her weight shifts a bit, and eyes remain averted.* - Sat Oct 17 06:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted that and a lot more. Wanted to make me happy. - Sat Oct 17 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And I betrayed him. And then I killed him with my own hand. - Sat Oct 17 06:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Teach you how to get the most out of your chakra when it comes to it. - Sat Oct 17 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure....I should though.... - Sat Oct 17 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd be irresponsible. - Sat Oct 17 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Knowledge like that should only be kept in certain hands. - Sat Oct 17 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your hands....it'd be fine. - Sat Oct 17 06:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have no doubt about that. - Sat Oct 17 06:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Is the exact same thing as giving a child an insanely lethal weapon..... - Sat Oct 17 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No matter who you teach it to.... - Sat Oct 17 06:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I understand and I will gladly accept you teachings Katsune - Sat Oct 17 06:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then, give me time to either rest or prepare a scroll. - Sat Oct 17 06:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tommorrow I'll teach you that jutsu. - Sat Oct 17 06:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel to instead face the west -- as she's now realized she's pretty sleepy -- and begins walking away.* - Sat Oct 17 06:51:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good night. - Sat Oct 17 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gets dressed. She's wearing one of her many body suits -- which all look very similar for the record because anime logic -- when she comes out of her bedroom. Body suit and not T-shirt because Index is living in the same house now.

Her hair, even, is brushed -- and that's before she's had breakfast.

When Kat enters the room her eyes wander only briefly before finding the two plates. A glance is sent towards Index. Afterwords with a nod she lazily walks over to the table and takes a seat.* - Sat Oct 17 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She picks up her fork and begins lazily loading said utensil up with food.

"It's fine." she says.

"Thanks though."

She stuffs her mouth.* - Sat Oct 17 18:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Training is on my agenda 'every' day." she says, putting more food in her mouth afterwords.* - Sat Oct 17 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can. Not sure about missions but training, yes. - Sat Oct 17 18:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Sat Oct 17 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has finished her food. She rises to her feet, then, and pushes her chair under the table.

"Let's go?"* - Sat Oct 17 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Actually I did promise to teach Bryson something today. - Sat Oct 17 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Man's weak. Thought I'd help out. - Sat Oct 17 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No talent. Thought I'd make up for it with a really nice gift. - Sat Oct 17 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sat Oct 17 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Look at you being the good guy. - Sat Oct 17 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Haha. - Sat Oct 17 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) forms the tiger seal. A plume of smoke would appear in front of Index, with a loud poof.

Out of the smoke comes a leg identical to Kat's. The earth clone attempts to kick Index in the nuts.* - Sat Oct 17 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Is that your first time, Index? - Sat Oct 17 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: B-Being kicked? - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Y-Yes.. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: In that area. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Punched?? - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I've only had it happen twice. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm lucky it didn't happen more. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo, Arashi. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) dismisses the clone in another plume of smoke.* - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: T-This is probably the f-fourth time, I'm lucky i-if I can have kids any longer. - Sat Oct 17 18:49:48 2015
