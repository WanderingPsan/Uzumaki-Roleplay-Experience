<br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like I said; taijutsu isn't really my strongsuit. - Tue Oct 13 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: That was actually great. I've never fought someone that had so much range..I'm impressed. - Tue Oct 13 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Greetings Koji. - Tue Oct 13 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her right palm to the side of her clone's head. Abruptly, a very loud, gunshot-like bang is heard. A sensor would sense chakra coming from Katsune's palm, but no jutsu is visible due to it being hidden by her clone's mud.

A hole is promptly put through the side of the mindless construct. Mud splashes all over the place, first by the head and then from the clone disipating.

She nods in response to Saeza's comment.* - Tue Oct 13 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Grandpa Hassan...do you have any missions I can complete? - Tue Oct 13 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to the side and takes a seat in the dirt, since Saeza's presumably leaving at this time.* - Tue Oct 13 23:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scales the wall from the outside and watches from far above, with arms crossed.

She stays on the top of said wall.* - Tue Oct 13 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: This kid thinks on his feet...it's not always so easy though. - Tue Oct 13 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, you beat Trilliam... - Wed Oct 14 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So, where do you come from? - Wed Oct 14 00:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yeah, Trilliam, if I don't see Hassan before you do, let him know that Index is fine to be genin so long as he is approved by the Lord himself. - Wed Oct 14 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: I'll tell him and then he wull be officaly codenamed Charcoal. - Wed Oct 14 00:32:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hard to say considering who your opponent was. - Wed Oct 14 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I feel like that takes away from my accomplishment. - Wed Oct 14 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno what that means. - Wed Oct 14 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Nevermind~ - Wed Oct 14 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You said you wanted to relax right? - Wed Oct 14 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Not really." she says.

"But I might as well, yeah. Been training all day already."* - Wed Oct 14 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns around and begins walking away, to lead the way to her house.* - Wed Oct 14 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way into her house. Once there she goes to her bedroom and retrieves some dice. She's soon leaving her room with the dice in hand. Lazily she tosses them over to Index as she takes a seat on the couch.

Arms and legs cross.* - Wed Oct 14 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the dice. "I think the way Kilm's game worked was --"

Her eyes wander for a moment.

"Both people make a guess as to whether the next roll will be even or odd. If you guess right, you get money and if you guess wrong, you lose money -- or something."

The girl scratches her cheek.

"Not sure I wanna lose any money though."* - Wed Oct 14 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Drinking game or truth or dare come to mind. - Wed Oct 14 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Why not try both then? - Wed Oct 14 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Though Truth or Dare would be the best to do first, Ideally. - Wed Oct 14 00:57:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet. The girl wanders off to grab a bottle of sake. When she comes back, she has a stack of sake cups. She sets them both down on the coffee table before sitting back down.* - Wed Oct 14 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, smiling a bit. 

"Sure." she says.

The girl reaches out with her right hand, with her palm facing the cieling. Eyes are averted.* - Wed Oct 14 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Evens?" she says.

Eyes find Index and she waits for him to call something.* - Wed Oct 14 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stuffs one of the dice into the couch inbetween two cushions while she's at it.

They don't need two.* - Wed Oct 14 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Crap. - Wed Oct 14 01:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As far as the dice go. - Wed Oct 14 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I have an idea...Not sure if you'll like it. - Wed Oct 14 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. What idea? - Wed Oct 14 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's basically a game let's call it chicken. - Wed Oct 14 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Wed Oct 14 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll roll a die, first for a body part, and roll a second for an action. - Wed Oct 14 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Wed Oct 14 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If I back out of the action, I receive a penalty, either taking a drink, or truth or dare, - Wed Oct 14 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And every Five rounds we can make it harder? - Wed Oct 14 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you want. - Wed Oct 14 01:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. She scratches her cheek.

Eventually though, she shrugs.

"Sure." she says.* - Wed Oct 14 01:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or rigging the game. - Wed Oct 14 01:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: For the corresponding dice roll? - Wed Oct 14 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Wed Oct 14 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What do you have for actions? - Wed Oct 14 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Pinch, stab, kick, poke, lick, or kiss. - Wed Oct 14 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) produces a faint, cheeky smile in response to this.

"Yes, stab." she says, not making eye contact.

"It can't all be good things."* - Wed Oct 14 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: *stabbed through chest* - Wed Oct 14 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink. Slowly she draws in a deep, silent breath through the nose. Eventually though, she shakes her head.

"Gimme one of those penalties instead." she says.* - Wed Oct 14 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth. - Wed Oct 14 01:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anything I can imagine or anything I've actually seen? - Wed Oct 14 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Anything you can imagine. - Wed Oct 14 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Infinite chakra. Immortality is stupid and makes people hate you. - Wed Oct 14 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fair enough. - Wed Oct 14 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well then... - Wed Oct 14 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: My roll isn't it? - Wed Oct 14 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and passes the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Arm.. - Wed Oct 14 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: ....Kick her arm? - Wed Oct 14 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She rises to her feet and holds out her right arm, while facing the south. The girl's left hand finds her hip and her weight shifts a bit.

She waits to be kicked.* - Wed Oct 14 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: This is....I mean....She seems fine with it... - Wed Oct 14 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Wait....That means she could potentially end up kicking me in the face of Vice Vers---- - Wed Oct 14 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: S-She could stab me in the face?! - Wed Oct 14 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches. She can sense the kick coming but has to force herself not to dodge it.

The girl winces as his foot makes contact and draws in a sharp breath. Presumably it does sting a bit?

Afterwords she nods and sits down. The girl holds her hand out and waits for the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls one of them only.* - Wed Oct 14 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Kiss...arm? - Wed Oct 14 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She leans over to him and plants her lips to his naked arm. Eyes wander off in the mean time.

No blush. She doesn't care. Even so, she very briefly suckles for fairness's sake.

Her tongue doesn't touch him in any way.

Afterwords she reaches up to wipe at her lips. Her cheeks turn a bit pink.

"Gonna get the stab roll soon." she says with a weak smile on her face.

"I can feel it."* - Wed Oct 14 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tosses him the dice, a bit roughly.* - Wed Oct 14 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || She aims for the face.* - Wed Oct 14 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For not having long sleeves. - Wed Oct 14 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Rules don't say I don't get to throw stuff at you. - Wed Oct 14 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Leg... - Wed Oct 14 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Wed Oct 14 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes a bit. Eventually though she shrugs. "Does my leg need to be bare?" she inquires.

The girl turns in place at this time and places her legs in his lap. Both of them, for convenience's sake. Arms cross, and eyes remain averted.

Her expression's a bit sour.* - Wed Oct 14 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Cause if it does. I'm stabbing hard when I get to the stab roll. - Wed Oct 14 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: N-No...I-It doesn't... - Wed Oct 14 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and takes her legs back. She doesn't show much of a reaction, assuming he only licked between her knee and foot.

She crosses one leg over the other once more and holds her hand out for the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Wed Oct 14 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches forwards without any hesitation with her right hand. She takes some flesh of his cheek in hand and pinches, fairly hard with her gauntlet-covered hand.

The girl then gently pulls to and fro, though it'd likely sting.* - Wed Oct 14 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes the dice.

She does so politely this time, rather than throwing them.* - Wed Oct 14 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression is relatively blank now.* - Wed Oct 14 01:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She turns and lifts a leg, showing Index her foot.* - Wed Oct 14 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances down at the scene. Afterwords she reaches up to rest her legs in his lap once more, for comfort's sake. She leans back against the arm rest and tosses the dice up into the air with her thumb.* - Wed Oct 14 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Safeeeee. - Wed Oct 14 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches forwards and pokes.* - Wed Oct 14 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes the dice afterwords.

Of course, when she poked, her hand ws still covered by her gauntlet.* - Wed Oct 14 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Foot...Again. - Wed Oct 14 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She leaves her legs where they are.

In his lap.* - Wed Oct 14 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is wearing boots, though she definitely should've taken them off by now. She reaches out to take the dice back.* - Wed Oct 14 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leans forwards with eyes averted and casually kisses the hand.

She doesn't seem bothered.

Afterwords she passes the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: C-Chest.. - Wed Oct 14 02:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. . . - Wed Oct 14 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes a bit. She looks away, and says nothing. She makes no moves.* - Wed Oct 14 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, with her blush becoming darker for the brief moment. Afterwords she clears her throat into her left fist. Eyes stay averted.

After some brief amount of time she scratches her cheek. "We could go higher than just six numbers." she says.

The girl reaches over to take the bottle of sake in hand. The cap is removed and she tips the bottle to sip at the contents within.

She gulps a few times before looking down at the dice and saying "We could throw money into this somewhere -- though I probably have a whole lot more than you."* - Wed Oct 14 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes him the bottle. "Fine." she says.

Eyes wander.

"Extra actions are. . .cut, slap, rub, burn with fire, fondle, or shock -- as in with lightning."* - Wed Oct 14 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "I'll go get the matches." she says.

The girl then leaves the room and comes back with matches.

In case she has to burn someone. She sets them down on the table. She also brings more sake, and is drinking it when she enters the room.

When she sets down she rests her legs in his lap once more.* - Wed Oct 14 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, taking the poetically named "die."

She tosses them up into the air, aiming to catch them both in one hand.* - Wed Oct 14 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Leg.. - Wed Oct 14 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches over and slaps his leg, between the food and the knee.

She does so lazily and then lies back down.

The girl then tosses both dice at his face, though she does so relatively gently.* - Wed Oct 14 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: B-Butt.. - Wed Oct 14 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scratches her cheek. Eyes wander.* - Wed Oct 14 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: W-Wait. - Wed Oct 14 02:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Slap....B-Butt? - Wed Oct 14 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. The girl turns to face the south. She rests her eblow on the couch, and her face against her fist. The skirt covering her butt falls out of place. Cheeks turn pink.

Kat eyes the matches on the table.* - Wed Oct 14 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Got my own safety nets. . . - Wed Oct 14 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheek becomes a bit more prominent as her butt flesh jiggles to and fro. The girl takes a moment to clear her throat then before reaching over to take the dice.

She then rolls back over and tosses the dice up into the air.

She avoids eye contact.* - Wed Oct 14 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Atm.. - Wed Oct 14 02:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls her leg up. The girl's lips twitch and she produces a slightly cheeky smile.

Abruptly she then launches the leg forwards, ramming the hard heel of her boot into his arm.* - Wed Oct 14 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tosses the dice over.* - Wed Oct 14 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) kicks her boots off. They fall onto the floor. She'd rather then not be burnt to nothing. Her bare feet are left. Arms cross.* - Wed Oct 14 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sake. . . - Wed Oct 14 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Um...I think. - Wed Oct 14 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Back is fine though. - Wed Oct 14 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leans forwards and pokes his back with her index finger.

With a shrug she then pokes his neck too.

She rolled poking anyway so it doesn't matter to her.* - Wed Oct 14 02:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's slap lips anyway. - Wed Oct 14 02:57:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She drinks some ambiguous inadvisable amount of sake, gulping five or six times in the process with a silent sigh through the nose.

Afterwords she puts the bottle down.* - Wed Oct 14 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Back. - Wed Oct 14 03:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She reaches over to rub his back with her cold, metal gauntlets.

Images of her exploding palm putting a hole in him flash through her head.

Afterwords she lies back down.* - Wed Oct 14 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tosses the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 03:02:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls out a kunai. She smiles a bit as she leans forwards. The girl then presses it to his flesh and slices, aiming to leave him with a thin cut.


She cuts deeply enough for it to sting an awful lot, but not enough to scar.

Afterwords she flourishes the blade and puts it away. She lies back down and tosses the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Leg.. - Wed Oct 14 03:08:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, showing no real reaction. Afterwords she rolls the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 03:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Wed Oct 14 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scratches her cheek. Said cheeks turn pink. Eventually though, with a shrug, she pulls her legs up close to her form. They end up sprawled underneath her form. Palms rest in her lap and she hovers forwards.

Absent-mindedly and with eyes averted, she sticks her tongue out to lap across his cheek.

In the same motion, she punches him in the nuts with her left fist.

The girl smiles around her tongue.* - Wed Oct 14 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) coos softly in response to the sight of his horrible pain.

The girl tosses the dice to him.* - Wed Oct 14 03:22:40 2015

Eyes wander.* - Wed Oct 14 03:24:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. With a silent sigh, she hovers forwards once more. Palms rest on the couch inbetween her legs.

The girl sticks her neck out and aims to sweep it accross his neck vertically, from top to bottom. She blushes throughout.

Afterwords she clears her throat a bit and plants her butt on the couch. She stays upright, and keeps eyes averted.* - Wed Oct 14 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes the dice.* - Wed Oct 14 03:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leans forwards, slowly. 

"I dare you. . ." she begins.

Eyes slowly wander, and eventually find Index's.

A faint, cheeky smile is on her face. She's uncomfortably close. He can probably feel her breathing.

"To close your eyes."* - Wed Oct 14 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) channels earth chakra into her right gauntlet. It becomes even harder, ensuring pain.

Kat's eyes wander off and she then punches Index across the face, as hard as she can manage.* - Wed Oct 14 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander a bit. She scratches her cheek.

The girl is still wearing a smile; an apologetic one. She's a sadist. She can't help it.

"I went too far that time."* - Wed Oct 14 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) peers down at him as her smile fades away. Briefly she looks him up and down.

"-- Thought you were more durable than that." she says.* - Wed Oct 14 03:49:07 2015

"I'm used to durable people."* - Wed Oct 14 03:50:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

"You'll be able to swim in the earth itself." she says.* - Wed Oct 14 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

"It's what that boy was using in your spar before. This jutsu once saved me from the legendary Kenshin himself."

She's making eye contact when she says this, and her expression makes it clear -- she's telling the truth.

"It's saved me from Erebus, and a lot of people. It's great for escapes, because most people can't follow you underground. And --"

Kat holds a finger up.

"If you can use taijutsu or weapons really well, it's great for attacking an enemy from underground."* - Wed Oct 14 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a very, very valuable jutsu. - Wed Oct 14 03:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. - Wed Oct 14 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is smiling a bit when she says that.

"No. My owner Zetsumo did. All I did was run away when I saw that Zetsumo was dying. I always knew Kenshin would win because I'd figured Zetsumo's weaknesses out way before then. I knew he was no match for fast enemies. The man's fighting style was the biggest mess I've ever seen. All power. Almost no skill whatsoever."

She pauses for a brief moment.

"I'm guessing the immortality and lack of equals to spar with did that to him. When you lack fear, you suck in combat. Every time I ever lost, it was because I was over-confident."* - Wed Oct 14 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. Eventually, she turns in place and rises to her feet. Arms cross, and she turns to face him.

"Anyway." she says.

She glances over in his general direction when she nods.* - Wed Oct 14 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over in his direction. With a shrug, she then turns to face him and extends her arm.

Lazily she'd bump her fist into his.* - Wed Oct 14 04:07:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leaves Sunagakure with her mission scroll -- presumably B ranked -- in-hand. Over her left shoulder is a bindle with food and medicine and stuff in it. Even now she's eating a rice cake. Eyes wander. The desert is hot and such, but if she needs food or water she can easily and quickly find it.

She can fly, after all. That, and she's getting used to Sunagakure's deserts. She's headed to the northwest because according to the map Hassan gave her, that's the general direction of the Land of Plains. In time, she's there. At no time does Katsune visit Taiyokagure.

Presumably, Kat's collecting allegiance papers from daimyos in specific and not kages. As such, it's likely in her best interest to avoid any and all ninja villages for now. She simply doesn't have time for it and she'd rather not stop by any she's unfamiliar with. Even going near ninja villages means possibly encountering enemy ninja and Kat would rather stay on the safe side. The girl does, however, visit many other settlements along the way.

Villages that aren't stuffed full of shinobi. Unfortunately she's under the impression she's on a time limit of some kind. As such, she generally spends no more than a day in any one village. Even so, the girl finds time to relax. In the Land of Plains she finds new sorts of food and new sorts of people.

Due to being in any one place for no more than twelve hours, she makes aquantances but no friends. The girl even goes so far as to visit some hot springs. A smug smile is on her face when she notes that if Hassan asks why she took so long, she can simply claim she was attacked several times along the way. While in these villages, Kat probably hears comments on the light release kekkei genkai.

Supposedly this region is literally famous literally for ninja with that ability. When the girl's rested up and resupplied, she leaves. Her straw hat is planted on her head in the mean time, for a lot of reasons. Supposedly she's a wanted woman. That's what Erebus said.

In addition to this, she knows Hideki is hunting her and she knows a guy with white eyes and a mask is looking for her too. While she's not actually worried, she'd rather not making hunting her 'too' easy. As such, she avoids showing her face too much outside of Sunagakure.  The girl can probably kill just about anyone these days, but she still has a ginormous weakness. Genjutsu.

Something she'll have to work on, and soon. While traveling, the girl does of course run into at least a few enemies. Even in the Land of Plains, while she's on her way to her next destination, she runs into some bandits. Among them are rarely missing-nin, but there are some. Quickly and smoothly she steps from side to side, evading thrown weapons.

She does all of this with eyes averted entirely and senses locked onto her opponents. This isn't something she does just for people with genjutsu. She does this for literally all of her enemies outside of sparring sessions. When sparring she only watches opponents because it's not a serious situation. It can't be helped, until she trains against her weakness to genjutsu -- which is something she intends to begin working on immediately.

As such, very rarely, the girl catches a kunai or knife to her flesh. It only grazes her due to her phenominal reflexes, but occasionally she is hit. Enemies die shortly afterwords, being disintigrated by the chuunin's world-shaking Landmine Fist. And finally, after a journey that's already been incredibly long, Kat ends up in the Land of Demons. This is one of the places Hassan has sent her to.

While there, Kat thoroughly explores. She'd until now decided that she was on a time limit, but now thinks better of it. Hassan didn't explicitely give her one, so why not enjoy herself. The girl takes to the air, flying. Eyes can the land below.

Trees, plants in general....even the water. All of it is very different than anything she's ever seen before, even in paintings. This region is very new to her. Time passes. Eventually though, Katsune's curiosity is satisfied at least for the day. 

She stops to rest in the nearest settlement, once more avoiding actual ninja villages. At an inn she sleeps before rising up and exploring the town. The shameless hethen of a teen walks around with a bottle of sake in-hand, drinking it even as she goes. She's met with the occasional scowl because of it, but she pays people no mind whatsoever. At more than one stand, she stops to buy seuveneirs.

In this land of exorcists and demons, she manages to find many items suggesting as much. Exorcist seals that probably don't actually work, shrunken heads, and bobble dolls of oni. She finds at least one of each of these things, and packs them in a backpack she aquires along the way. Probably not very wise for a shinobi, but she doesn't care. The weight won't be too much of an issue for a girl that can change her weight with a jutsu.

Eventually though, and finally, Katsune meets the daimyo. It takes time, as his guards are hesitant to allow her to meet him. Eventually though, she's in the same room as him. Carefully the girl explains why she's there, and offers him a scroll from Hassan that she presumably was given. One with his personal seal on it and such.

She also shows her Sunagakure headband. In time, she's managed to get him to agree to give her allegiance papers. Presumably Hassan did all of the arrangements long ago and she's just a courier. Not a negotiater. As such, she'd had no trouble.

With a respectful bow she leaves at some time. Only five more regions to go. The next one on her list is the Land of Wood, so she's headed to the west. There are no shinobi villages here, so she expects little trouble. The occasional bandits are shown a display of Kat firing her landmine fist at the air through her chakra flow gauntlets.

Each time the ground and nearby houses shake. Her hair and skirt are blown all over the place, and on at least one occasion Kat's casually stuffing her face with an apple while said face is hidden by her hat. Every single time, the girl's would-be opponent's turn and flee in the opposite direction. Kat uses to be forced into a similar life style, so she can't judge them. Killing them when she can avoid it would be self-righteous in her eyes.

Kat collects the daimyo's allegiance papers with a smile and a nod and then leaves. Little happened in the Land of Wood. Little developments and little for her to learn. She does rest many more times in the Land of Demons on her way to The Land of Stone. Eventually though, she's where she needs to be.

A place ruled by a priest of all things. In every settlement she visits, she finds at least one temple. Casually she sneaks into a temple on more than one occasion, just to have a look around. With childish curiousity she eyes statues and architecture. Little respect is shown to any deity of course.

Religion is of course perfectly fine and healthy. Kat, however, was raised by Zetsumo and has always lived in Hell. As such, she's chosen not to believe in any deities. Even so, she admires the art and the apparent love and hard work put into maintaining these temples. If nothing else, she can respect that itself and does so.

More trinkets are collected. Katsune finds many idols in particular in these lands. She however chooses not to touch them. As someone who doesn't practice the associated religions, it'd be disrespectful. At least some amount of superstition is involved with her decision. The girl gets a massage before leaving this particular settlement.

Her next stop is the daimyo's palace. And by palace I mean temple, because the guy's a priest. When she arrives at the capital, all she can see for miles are temples. Already she's looking for scythes and immortals. Erebus.

Definitely not doing the world's religious communities any favors as far as reputation goes. This place makes her uncomfortable. As such, she spends the smallest amount of time possible here. She goes straight to the daimyo and waits for him to see her. When she finally meets him, she bows and waits for him to give her the allegiance papers she needs.

The girl double checks the paper for authenticity before leaving, with a friendly wave. The Land of Grass is her next stop. It's the closest region out of those on her list. She visits only one final settlement within the Land of Stone before leaving. She needs sleep, so she gets it at an inn.

When Katsune arrives in the Land of Grass, she's pleasantly surprised by the people she meets in the first village she comes accross. Social and very good at speaking. Near impossible to find such things anywhere else. For a brief moment, she humors the idea of ditching Sunagakure and staying here. At some point though, she forces herself to re-stock on supplies and be on her way.

She needs to see the daimyo and get those papers. Once more the girl is in a region that houses a shinobi village. As such, she's careful to eye any travelers she passes by. As expected, the girl is occasionally forced to even kill some shinobi. Missing-nin, living among bandits and hoping to take her stuff. 

She makes short work of them though. The girl possesses a kekkei genkai and can fly. Few people are a match for her. Before meeting the daimyo, she bathes at an inn. She needs to be clean and such to represent Sunagakure.

That, and daimyo's are rich. The girl knows her priorities. She's handed the papers with little delay, having not had to wait at all to see the very social daimyo this time. With a nod, she takes them in hand and sees herself out of the building. By now, she's eager to go home so she flies. 

Katsune intends to waste no more time. Her next stop is the Land of Crabs. To save energy and chakra, she hires a boat with a yawn. Inside she sleeps in a very cozy bed for over fifteen hours. So far, this journey has been exhausting.

Never before has a mission tired her out quite this much. She's never done one that spanned so much time and space before. When she wakes up, she wanders off to the side of the ship and drinks sake alongside dirty, sweaty sailor men. The girl fits right in, even if she's occasionally forced to break wrists.

Like the ship's laborer's, she wobbles all over the boat. Between her sake and the waters, she has difficulty maintaining her balance. Eventually she passes out on deck, without even a roof over her head. Her company laughs and such. While she sleeps, however, the ship is attacked by a giant crab.

After a very long and taxing fight, she manages to slay the beast. She takes no chances whatsoever, and flies the whole time. Lightning release jutsus are fired from a distance. With it being conducted by water, Kat has a relatively easy time with her enemy. All of her new friends die, and the ship sinks.

With a frown on her face and a bottle of sake in her head, Kat flies away, rubbing the back of her head with one hand as she goes. Soon, she meets the daimyo she's assigned to see. He gives her his allegiance papers, and Kat's on her way. With a nod, the girl once again follows the road. She's off to her final destination. The Land of Wolves.

While there, Kat explores the region fairly thoroughly. Mostly she's flying. While it's arguably much more enjoyable in her opinion to explore while on the ground, Kat does have some time limit, malliable as it may be. She can't spend two months in this region. She has to get back to Sunagakure eventually.

Even so, she explores thoroughly. Trees, forests, and especially caves -- this place has a lot to pique her interests. It crosses her mind that Orokuru had promised to show her the world some day. She now sees why. With that memory shrugged, off, Katsune finally lands on the ground and begins making her way to the daimyo.

She does indeed encounter wolves along the way. Casually she lifts an arm, though, with her hands clenched into a fist. Very casually, she blows them all to hell in one fell swoop. One giant, beam-like blast. The world shakes, and Katsune grows to love her abilities only that much more.

When Katsune does spend some time in one of this region's settlements, she isn't there for long. She bathes and changes clothes, and sleeps. After that she relaxes for several hours but collects no seuveneirs. She's been traveling for a very long while now so she's very homesick. She's ready to see Sunagakure again.

When she meets the daimyo she's very pleasant, patient, and polite. After a very long evening, she even manages to finally secure his allegiance papers. With those in hand, Kat heads back to the Land of Wind. She takes a boat for most of the journey, though she's careful this time to stay sober in case giant crabs attack. When she finally makes it to land, Kat simply flies the rest of the way.

It's a long trip, but her chakra definitely does indeed last for the entire journey. For twenty full hours she's in the air, with skirt and hair flying all over the place. And finally, she's near Sunagakure. She lands only to hide her jutsu from the public, and walks the rest of the way. She bathes before going to the town square.* - Wed Oct 14 18:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's go. - Wed Oct 14 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then rises to her feet and turns to follow.* - Wed Oct 14 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Seems like Fujitora is busy. Would've liked a mission that I could complete later. - Wed Oct 14 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is sitting down and facing the south. Turning her head all the way would be uncomfortable but she glances over in his general direction.

 "Hey." she says.* - Wed Oct 14 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo. - Wed Oct 14 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm Kilm. - Wed Oct 14 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Pleasure. - Wed Oct 14 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Likewise. - Wed Oct 14 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I wonder what I should do today. - Wed Oct 14 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I am supposed to teach you a jutsu. - Wed Oct 14 20:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She then rises to her feet, brushing herself of as she does so.

"Let's do that now." she says.

"You've waited for over a week already."

The teen then turns on her heel and walks off, leading the way to wherever.* - Wed Oct 14 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should I stay or follow? - Wed Oct 14 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If I do follow . . . Ain't going to stay long anyway. - Wed Oct 14 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have to sleep soon. - Wed Oct 14 20:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can. - Wed Oct 14 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still walking.* - Wed Oct 14 20:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Good luck with learning the jutsu. - Wed Oct 14 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think I'll just sit here. - Wed Oct 14 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Appreciated. - Wed Oct 14 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop with both arms at her sides. The girl becomes completely weightless.

"Alright." she says.

"Subterannean Voyage."

Katsune then gently leans forwards, allowing herself to fall. She does so a bit slowly due to her weightless state. Both palms soon meet the dirt. When they do, Kat slowly picks herself up onto only her two arms. Her hair sticks to her back by way of suiment. Both legs stay side-by-side in the air. She's facing away from the two boys.

A few seconds are spent waiting until she's able to make use of a second jutsu.

"Don't let anyone tell you you can't use this for a quick escape in the middle of a battle." she explains.

"Because you can."

The chuunin then demonstrates, to make absolutely sure Index doesn't doubt her at all. The ground turns to liquid. It develops a smokey texture. The second it shifts, Kat darts into it. She disappears nearly instantaneously into its depths due to how fast she's capable of swimming.

Almost immediately afterwords, Kat reappears nine feet away. When she does so, she's hidden behind raging waves of liquified earth. She's swimming so quickly that it produces this effect.

The girl does five full laps around Kilm and Index.\

When she's done, the girl goes deeper. All entrances above-ground leading to where she might be disappear. Mud is left in their places, as Kat presumably isn't capable of getting rid of all traces, because this isn't Hiding Like a Mole. Even so, it is quite impossible to follow her without a similar jutsu.

Kat submerges to 100 feet below the surface. Once there, she crosses her arms and floats in place. She waits for Index to get the general idea. She can stay submerged for basically as long as she wants.

After a full minutes, Kat lazily rises up to the surface. She appears twelve feet away from him, and is facing him when she slowly pulls herself up out of the earth, hands-first.

She's covered in the mud-like substance, though it slides right off quickly, smoothly, and easily. She's left perfectly clean. A silent breath is taken through the nose due to her having swam that much mostly while holding her breath.

Arms cross and her weight shifts a bit.

"You want to use your chakra to turn to ground into liquid." Kat ssays inbetween very subtle breaths.

"Not water. A very, very thin liquid. It's very similar to gas. And then you just swim. You need to make sure your chakra's covering your entire body so you can keep moulding earth as you go."* - Wed Oct 14 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Reminds me of the time i've taught you this jutsu. - Wed Oct 14 20:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I reccomend using it during somersaults if you're trying to escape. Don't pull a Kilm and nearly get grabbed by Erebus when you're trying to use your feet for the jutsu, like a dope. - Wed Oct 14 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm...Thanks for the suggestion. - Wed Oct 14 21:18:43 2015
