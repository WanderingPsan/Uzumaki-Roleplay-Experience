<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: And according to the family tree I saw while in Iwagakure...I can expect to live for a very long time anyway. - Thu Oct 22 01:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd be more comfortable going to the spa with you if I had any idea who you are. - Thu Oct 22 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The secrets, though, make you a stranger to me. - Thu Oct 22 01:53:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders out of her bedroom after a long nap. The teen's wearing a long, white T-shirt when she gets a bottle of sake from the kitchen. Afterwords she makes her way over to the couch and sits down. Legs end up sprawled out underneath her form.

With eyes averted and a blank expression on her face she tips the bottle up to drink from it and she gulps several times before lowering it to breathe.* - Thu Oct 22 02:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Makes you look like a drug dealer. - Thu Oct 22 02:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns in place on the couch. Carefully she wiggles into a more comfortable position. Legs are soon in Index's lap, and she crosses one over the other.

She's careful to look down and make sure her shirt still protects her dignity in the mean time.

It does, if only barely.* - Thu Oct 22 02:39:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Black pants If I recall correctly. - Thu Oct 22 02:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I thought it'd be fun. - Thu Oct 22 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe because I made a lot of jokes about how Sunagakure sucks and no one would want to come here. - Thu Oct 22 02:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) prods at one of Index's hands with one of her feet.

"Massage my feet then." she says.* - Thu Oct 22 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Depends. - Thu Oct 22 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Worldwide law? Suna-gakure law. . . - Thu Oct 22 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has paused briefly to take a silent breath at some point, in response to the massaging. That's what's responsible for the brief hiccup when she said "Sunagakure."

Eyes wander, and only the very most subtle hint of a weak smile appears at her lips.

Toes of one of her feet curl to and fro.

"O-or. . . .Konoha, law?" she inquires.

Her bottle of sake gets to her lips once more.* - Thu Oct 22 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hhm. - Thu Oct 22 03:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one spoke out unless they could back up their obnoxiousness with strength. - Thu Oct 22 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gulps occasionally in response to the massaging. She takes silent breaths often and often, she waits until she's sure she can keep a straight face before she actually speaks -- specifically because she'd rather him not hear her making those noises.

"W-we'll see. . ." she says.* - Thu Oct 22 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If it doesn't work out. . . - Thu Oct 22 03:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's toes wiggle to and fro every now and then between Index's fingers. Muscles within her legs occasionally twitch accordingly, as if reflexes would have her pull her leg to and fro but she keeps that from happening.

"'How' did you kill Hideki?" she inquires, glancing up at him. If anything her eyes suggest surprise and admiration rather than suspicion or anything of that nature.

An eyebrow is lifted for the brief moment.* - Thu Oct 22 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was under the impression that while he was weak, he was probably stronger than you. - Thu Oct 22 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander, a bit awkwardly. She pours a few more mouth-fulls of sake down her throat.* - Thu Oct 22 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Oct 22 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.

Body language subtly suggests labored breathing every now and then, but there's little else.* - Thu Oct 22 03:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Although. - Thu Oct 22 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That sounded...Cliche. - Thu Oct 22 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And Shonen type. - Thu Oct 22 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, smiling a bit. "Sure." she says, with eyes averted.* - Thu Oct 22 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Mud, huh? - Thu Oct 22 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's right. - Thu Oct 22 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: So remember what I taught you about hakra? - Thu Oct 22 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You have a natural chakra nature. - Thu Oct 22 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Try grinding your chakra against itself to create a sharp cut. - Thu Oct 22 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Okay. - Thu Oct 22 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: What do you mean by natural chakra nature? - Thu Oct 22 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It comes natural. - Thu Oct 22 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You were born with it. - Thu Oct 22 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: The reason you were able to cut the paper I gave you is because it amplified what you can naturally do. - Thu Oct 22 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Okay. - Thu Oct 22 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: So, I'll try. - Thu Oct 22 04:44:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Um. - Thu Oct 22 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: You push both chakra in the same direction, right? - Thu Oct 22 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki(LadyofSpades) says: Or... is it opposite? - Thu Oct 22 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Opposite. - Thu Oct 22 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Try again. - Thu Oct 22 04:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) recieves and reads a scroll. Afterwords she closes it and turns on her heel to walk away to the east.

As she moves, she forms the clone seal.

Kat's consumed by a puff of white smoke. When the smoke clears, an identical clone of her is on her back. Its arms are wrapped around her neck, and its legs around her waist.

The clone's palms are on her shoulders.

A very bizzare display, no doubt.* - Thu Oct 22 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is on the wall to the north when she shows up. The girl's senses are locked on the earth beneath her feet, and a blank expression is on her face as she stares down at the two visitors.

Specifically her eyes are only on Baen. On his eyes.

On Katsune's back is a clone. It's legs are wrapped around her waist and its arms are wrapped around her neck. The clone's palms are on her shoulders.

As you might expect, she has no intention of explaining this bizarre display.

"Hi." she says.* - Thu Oct 22 21:59:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Hmm. - Thu Oct 22 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Five years is a long time - Thu Oct 22 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It is. I'm still waiting to see whether or not I'll need that long. - Thu Oct 22 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Tell Hassan to let me into the village. It's been like six months. - Thu Oct 22 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I want to. I'd let you stay if I could, and if I had the authority...I'd beat everyone who gives you trouble. - Thu Oct 22 22:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: That would be great. - Thu Oct 22 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He 'is' very busy so I'm not sure whether or not I'll be able to talk to him. I could try though. - Thu Oct 22 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: That would be appreciated. - Thu Oct 22 22:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) holds her right hand out. Baen's own bird flies back to him, along with his scroll.

Afterwords Kat turns on her heel and walks back into the village.* - Thu Oct 22 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hey hows it going. - Thu Oct 22 22:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) returns to the same place she'd been before, on the wall. Katsune still has her clone on her back.

For the moment she watches the genin below, so that she has some idea as to what they're doing here.* - Thu Oct 22 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: So? - Thu Oct 22 22:17:36 2015
