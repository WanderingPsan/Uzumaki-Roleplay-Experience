<br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Um...yeah. Alright. - Sat Sep 12 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Another glance is sent towards the woman's strange choice of clothes but she makes no more comments on it. Without any pause, she turns on her heel to walk away, and lead the way to the hot tub.

Presumably both women are soon visible. With a foot, katsune tests the water. She stirs said foot around for a moment.* - Sat Sep 12 12:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, with a breath. "It's nice." she says, her blush fading away. Attendents roam in the distance, ready to be of service if needed.

The girl then lowers a foot into the water, carefully. The associated leg turns to and fro a bit for the moment. The rest of her follows, and she sets herself down on her butt. Both legs stretch out, and palms rest on the floor at either side of her. One leg crosses over her left.

* - Sat Sep 12 12:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a brief moment to stab Kilm in the eyes again. She does it without looking at him.* - Sat Sep 12 13:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Eyes off, before I test how durable you are when my lightning's run through water. - Sat Sep 12 13:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But you look cuter now. - Sat Sep 12 13:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I shall begin saying my prayers. - Sat Sep 12 13:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink again. A glance is sent over at the scene. "Hmph." she coos. Carefully she then pushes her lower regions forwards, relaxing a bit. Eyes wander off.

She does her best to relax and pretend there's not a topless woman and pervert in the same hot tub as her.

The water is fairly hot; enough for thick steam to be rising off constantly. It hides nothing, though, especially from Kat or Kilm's eyes.* - Sat Sep 12 13:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) submerges herself a bit further. Not completely, though, as she'd feel uncomfortable doing so with eyes on her and the current question being asked. Briefly she examines Hanabi's chest once more; moreso out of shock rather than interest.

"Um..." she says with another breath. "Because....."

Her eyes wander.

"Reasons..."* - Sat Sep 12 13:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm - Sat Sep 12 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And what might those reasons be? - Sat Sep 12 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: It feels so good to not be constricted by anything. - Sat Sep 12 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If...you're naked, then people are gonna think it's okay to be all over you. - Sat Sep 12 13:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scratches a cheek. * - Sat Sep 12 13:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: So hard not to look at Katsune. This is a challenge. - Sat Sep 12 13:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lowers herself further in the water, drawing in a breath for a moment. In part, this is to hide her face and calm herself down. It's also in part to simply get her hair wet all over, so that she doesn't look silly.

She comes back up shortly afterwords with the blush gone, and with a breath.

Her thighs rub against each other, while she scratches a lower leg with her foot.* - Sat Sep 12 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Or...something. - Sat Sep 12 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That is why you defend yourself. - Sat Sep 12 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 12 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah...okay. - Sat Sep 12 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do not know much about human male and female interaction but what I do know is that  there is nothing more comfortable than being able to do as you please. - Sat Sep 12 13:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a shakey breath, followed by an equally shakey sigh. Subtly, the girl wiggles her butt to and fro to scoot off in the opposite direction. She covers less ground than her aquantance, though -- only an inch or so.

"I..." she begins, glancing off into the distance.

"If Kilm weren't here...sure..."

She turns her head further, and scratches her cheek once more.* - Sat Sep 12 13:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) releases a subtle breath, briefly glancing over at her. With that, she then reaches over her shoulder to find a nearby bell, installed into the floor. She's short, so she has to push herself up a bit to actually reach it.

With that done, a woman makes her way over. Said woman gasps at the sight of Hanabi. With a blush she avoids eye contact at first, hesitantly. Afterwords though she clears her throat. Awkwardly she asks "How can I help you?"* - Sat Sep 12 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: U-um.... - Sat Sep 12 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "I-I'm good..." she says.

"Mice...would be nice, though."* - Sat Sep 12 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...They do not carry mice. - Sat Sep 12 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The woman confirms they do not carry mice. She does so awkwardly.

"Okay..." Kat says in response.
"Sake." she says.
"Lots of sake. For me, and no one else. At all."

For her nerves.* - Sat Sep 12 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Naturally the attendant then scurries off with a nod if not stopped.* - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Shame. - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I guess Hakaze will have to wait. - Sat Sep 12 13:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What's a Hakaze? - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: My companion. - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not many things that eat mice.... - Sat Sep 12 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . - Sat Sep 12 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not many things eat mice... - Sat Sep 12 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Can it eat...birds? - Sat Sep 12 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Im sure it can. - Sat Sep 12 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: If it wanted to hunt them. - Sat Sep 12 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sat Sep 12 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Im sure it can. - Sat Sep 12 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, I can show you where to buy them when we leave if that'd work. - Sat Sep 12 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: But Hakaze has grown rather lazy since I started feeding her mice. - Sat Sep 12 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. . . - Sat Sep 12 13:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That would be nice. - Sat Sep 12 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What is your name? - Sat Sep 12 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Katsune. - Sat Sep 12 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Nice to meet you Katsune. - Sat Sep 12 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah.... - Sat Sep 12 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ah . . . I'm Kilm. Relaxed too much for a bit. - Sat Sep 12 13:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has noticed this. She's been through more than one encounter of this nature, though, so she's not overly surprised. Thus, she's not expecting things to change whether she requests it or not.

"Train..." she says, glancing up at the scene once more. A bit closely, even. In part comparing, and mostly just noting that the size is absurd.

"And do missions...and stuff...."

Kat's sake is delivered on a platter. The attendant says nothing, eager to scurry off...which she doe immediately. It's delivered to Kat only. Anyone else wanting any would have to wander over, which would be a pain.* - Sat Sep 12 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did we ever get your own name? - Sat Sep 12 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still very clearly quite uncomfortable.* - Sat Sep 12 13:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You can call me Tachibana or Hanabi. - Sat Sep 12 13:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Either one works. - Sat Sep 12 13:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright... - Sat Sep 12 13:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 12 13:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What about you guy? - Sat Sep 12 13:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Sat Sep 12 13:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Anything to add to the conversation? - Sat Sep 12 13:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up a bottle of sake. The cork is removed. Without much thought on the matter, she picks it up and begins pouring alchohol down her throat.

Of course, she's extremely resistant so she's definitely not getting drunk. Only very lightly buzzed, to calm herself down.* - Sat Sep 12 14:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Oh . . . You heard that? - Sat Sep 12 14:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Err . . . Cause bored. - Sat Sep 12 14:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) replaces the cork. Afterwords she reaches over her shoulder to set the bottle aside.* - Sat Sep 12 14:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had downed about half of the bottle.

She's not drunk.* - Sat Sep 12 14:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I haven't nose bled. That is a good sign. - Sat Sep 12 14:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Now i'll be slower if I play. - Sat Sep 12 14:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . . We going to have massages? - Sat Sep 12 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No... - Sat Sep 12 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Definitely not. - Sat Sep 12 14:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . What else is there? - Sat Sep 12 14:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) Kilm says: So . . . . We going to have massages?
Katsune says: No...
Katsune says: Definitely not.
Kilm says: Hm . . . What else is there?
(*Kilm had started staring towards Katsune and her good parts again. It's hard.*)

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches for her bottle of sake again, with a silent sigh through the nose. Briefly she glances back and forth between Hanabi and Kilm, expecting him to explain. She pulls the cork off and begins stirring the liquid around, by moving the bottle.* - Sat Sep 12 14:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I 'did' pay for that. - Sat Sep 12 14:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, bringing her bottle up to her mouth and pouring alchohol down her throat. Not that she'll be getting drunk. She'd be a toxic angry drunk anyway.* - Sat Sep 12 15:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well that's pretty good. - Sat Sep 12 15:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares at the jiggling melons that have been placed in her face. Her blush returns in full. Eyes wander off as a lump travels down her throat. She lowers the bottle, and shakes her head.

"Nope..." she says.* - Sat Sep 12 15:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She can drink a lot . . . - Sat Sep 12 15:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But I still beat her in a drinking contest once. - Sat Sep 12 15:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nine or ten mugs of beer. - Sat Sep 12 15:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Somewhere around that. - Sat Sep 12 15:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) didn't drink more than ten or so tiny sake cups during that drinking contest, for the record.

This might be a bit more alchohol than that.

Katsune doesn't faint, since presumably Hanabi's not leaning in overly close now that she's beside her.* - Sat Sep 12 15:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances towards Hanabi's hand, but doesn't show much of a reaction to it. A shrug follows in response to her question and she passes her bottle to her to answer her question.

It's at least down to only a fourth, if that. More bottles are on the platter behind them, though -- not that anyone should need more than what's left in just the one.* - Sat Sep 12 15:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Beer's like juice, but.... - Sat Sep 12 15:15:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. We can get massages. - Sat Sep 12 15:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We didn't give them a try yet. - Sat Sep 12 15:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, and reaches over to find the bell again. Once more it takes her a moment due to her challenged height.

If anyone's going to be lame and ruin everyone's fun, it won't be her. With the bell having chimed, an attendant makes their way over.

When prompted the girl says "Um...massages please."

The attendent clears her throat and once more is a bit flustered due to the choice of clothing on 'some' people. With a nod, though, she directs them to three nearby massage tables and scurries off to go get masseuses.

Katsune then sets her bottle of sake down and rises to her feet. Eyes wander down to her form, and she takes a moment to carefully brush herself off...as if this is dirt and not water. She's a bit tipsy. With a nod, she then turns and wanders over to the nearest table. Palms find her hips and weight shifts a bit. She stares at it, and sighs. Another nod follows.* - Sat Sep 12 15:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Have you ever tried these before? - Sat Sep 12 15:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: These what? - Sat Sep 12 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Massages . . . - Sat Sep 12 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You lay face down. - Sat Sep 12 15:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Either one..." Kat says in response to Hanabi's question. The girl then carefully crawls up onto her own table. Wiggling to and fro, she then places herself down on her belly. Both legs touch, and she stretches out.

She doesn't comment on being quiet but...considering everything that's happened to her lately, and Kenryoku's secretive nature, she has reason to be quiet.* - Sat Sep 12 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You sure either? - Sat Sep 12 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh . . . - Sat Sep 12 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm... - Sat Sep 12 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either. - Sat Sep 12 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well I have already made up my mind sooo~ - Sat Sep 12 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) could be wrong. She's had an awful lot of sake.* - Sat Sep 12 15:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And no this is my first time being in a place like this. - Sat Sep 12 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I personally think it's better to face down. - Sat Sep 12 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Why is that? - Sat Sep 12 15:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: For back massages. - Sat Sep 12 16:27:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Probably some elaborate ass plan. - Sun Sep 13 00:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Dislocate his arms. I'll have my men cough him too. I'll question him in the morning. - Sun Sep 13 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: . . . ? - Sun Sep 13 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Later. - Sun Sep 13 00:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Whatever it takes. Just make sure he has no chance of escape. - Sun Sep 13 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 13 00:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) watches blankly, showing no interest in catching this guy -- even though she could.* - Sun Sep 13 01:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: One of Kirigakure's men. - Sun Sep 13 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That was Baen. - Sun Sep 13 01:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I recognized him from when he showed me around Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 13 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: SO, we just gonna let him go? - Sun Sep 13 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: He's already gone. - Sun Sep 13 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: BEsides. - Sun Sep 13 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: Pft. - Sun Sep 13 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: There is someone else. - Sun Sep 13 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Urgh...Where... - Sun Sep 13 01:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: <*Yawns*> Have my people look around the area. - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: What the hell... - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Why am I..? - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Understood. - Sun Sep 13 01:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: .. - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Why am I restrained...? - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: How did you restrain me..? - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: <*Whistles*> - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I didn't do it. - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: But what matters is that you are. - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well this day surely has been interesting. - Sun Sep 13 01:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: This day is getting worse and worse for me... - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: First that gezo shit head turns up. - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Then he shit talks me. - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Then Tethys kicks me out of the village... - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Now this this... - Sun Sep 13 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. . . - Sun Sep 13 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Ugh...The world can just fuck itself today.... - Sun Sep 13 01:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yes? No? maybe? - Sun Sep 13 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: So what's all this shit about? - Sun Sep 13 01:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'd kindly like to leave this place and move on if you don't mind. - Sun Sep 13 01:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Ushinawa what happen? - Sun Sep 13 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks had turned a bit pink. Not because she's interested in that sort of way, mind you. No, it's just...this woman is too much.

Eyes are averted for the moment and she scratches her cheek. "Um..."

A shrug follows, as well as a silent breath. "Alright. Sure." she says.

She turns to face Hanabi, as if to follow. She's eying her blankly, as far as eyes and such go. Kat may not be the type to do anything she's even remotely uncomfortable with, but in Kenryoku...options are limited.* - Sun Sep 13 01:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (PolicePassword) - Sun Sep 13 01:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms meet behind her back. She's composed when she glances at Hanabi, not quite willing to maintain eye contact. A shrug follows. "The same thing as before would work for me." she says.* - Sun Sep 13 01:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was there anything 'you' really wanted to try? - Sun Sep 13 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've done everything here now, counting massages. - Sun Sep 13 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well this would be the second time I come here. - Sun Sep 13 01:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: If you could order I could pay. - Sun Sep 13 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: There is no problem with that. - Sun Sep 13 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sun Sep 13 01:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Alright. You can pay." she says. It'd be rude to not accept her offer, after all.* - Sun Sep 13 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit brightly -- a crooked but warm smile -- in response to the request for sake, with a nod. She can't tell whether that was a joke or not, considering the person saying it. Afterwords she turns on her heel and leads the way to the locker room.

Once there, she stares at her locker for a long while, not quite willing to strip. Eventually, though, with yet another shrug, she begins removing her gauntlets. Her locker is opened and they're placed inside. The rest of her clothes follow.* - Sun Sep 13 01:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over her shoulder, not looking at Hanabi and noting the very distorted, blurred reflection on the locker's surface. Her cheeks turn a bit pink, and she pulls out another bikini.

Maybe the first time she would've went nude, but with her now knowing Hanabi's interests, she's having second thoughts. "Good." she says in response to her last comment.

"Amegakure gets dull. We should take fun wherever we can get it."

She begins getting dressed; at a lazy pace, to intentionally give the impression that she's not uncomfortable. It requires effort.

She chooses the exact same bikini style as before. It's nice and it suits her, so why not?* - Sun Sep 13 01:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) keeps her eyes for the entire trip to the spa, despite presumably being behind Hanabi, for only one reason really. She'd much rather not risk Hanabi noticing and thinking it means something.

She walks with a swagger. Despite the question, she's actually fairly comfortable. She's getting used to this behavior, especially since it's not the first time by far that she's seen similar things.

With a shrug she says "I had a boy friend...but I killed him, during the battle in Konoha."

She does say this in a relatively non-chalant matter. Even so, her tone suggests no bragging..or shame. There's neither.* - Sun Sep 13 02:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, briefly examining the woman's downstairs features -- just innocent, normal curiosity. That, and it's not really possible to relax without doing so in this situation. Her eyes are on the water afterwords. The girl makes her way over and once more dips a foot in. It's quite, quite hot. Not boiling, but enough to definitely affect someone, which is the point.

Once she's determined that she won't be boiled alive she begins making her way inside. A moment is spared to allow both legs to adjust to the heat. Afterwords she begins carefully setting herself down. Her butt meets the floor of the tub, and her palms follow. Wiggling a bit, she stretches out and makes herself comfortable with a very quiet sigh through the nose.

Her smile returns, though it's a slightly uneasy one. Eyes wander, and she shifts to and fro a bit in the water, striving to get comfortable.* - Sun Sep 13 02:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It is in the past. - Sun Sep 13 02:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) points over her shoulder. Kat had set her towel over it, which left it hidden from view by coincidence. She'd known it was there, but had left it alone up until now for the sake of not looking like she's trying to get drunk -- which she's not.

"It's here." she says. After a brief moment she sits up, and turns in place to reach over for it. An entire bottle is aquired, and she then sits back down. The bottle is tilted so that the mouth faces Hanabi, and she peers up at her for the moment.

"Did you want some?" she inquires.* - Sun Sep 13 02:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, and lazily removes the cork on her bottle. It'd be rude not to at this point. So, for that reason, she averts her eyes and tilts said bottle up. Sake is poured down her throat fairly smoothly and carelessly, in large amounts. She's sure she'll need it for one, but she's also certain that she can hold her liquer -- whether that's true enough or not.

A quiet breath is released through the nose when she lowers the bottle back down to her chest, holding it in her bosom to keep it from getting too wet.

Legs stir and rub against each other in the water and she watches them do so.

"Is that true?" she asks, referring to Hanabi's former living situation. She can't tell if it's some sort of metaphor or not.* - Sun Sep 13 02:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes Hanabi's lower legs, in a very not-weird manner. She's staring into space, mostly. A shrug follows. She's not sure whether Hanabi's completely serious and speaking literally or not, so she speaks as if it doesn't matter either way.

"That would be bad, yeah." she says.

"I'm doubting it could've been 'that' much worse than life with Kenryoku but...I'm sure it sucked."

A casual glance is sent her way, and eyes then wander. She keeps her sake bottle where it is for now. Already it's warming her up even more than the water is, so she's careful not to go overboard. Even so, she's already drank quite a bit.* - Sun Sep 13 02:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'I' was forced to carve up little girls like they were thanksgiving dinner, and then murder them. - Sun Sep 13 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For no other reason than Zetsumo wanting me to be headstrong. - Sun Sep 13 02:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ..Not that it was that bad. - Sun Sep 13 02:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ohhh~ - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Fun~ - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: After a while, carving up the pretty ones got fun. - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There was something about it. . . - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I would have taken that over being forced to sit in cold water. - Sun Sep 13 02:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah... - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well that made you who you are today. - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Which is nice. - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Wouldn't you say so? - Sun Sep 13 02:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. With a shrug, she brings her bottle back up to her mouth and slowly, smoothly pours down another large amount. Once she's done, she says "Yeah. I guess."* - Sun Sep 13 02:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anything's better than being on the side of the self-righteous people that are fighting Zetsumo, I guess. - Sun Sep 13 02:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 13 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What is he like? - Sun Sep 13 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Sep 13 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you think he has use for someone like me? - Sun Sep 13 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gulps. The girl shifts in place a bit, and sits up straighter. A near-silent breath is taken, and her eyes wander. Her blush remains, having been refreshed by this question.

"U-um..." she murmurs. "He's bad..."* - Sun Sep 13 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I.... - Sun Sep 13 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Sun Sep 13 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Bad? - Sun Sep 13 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: He is powerful. - Sun Sep 13 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not...what I meant. - Sun Sep 13 02:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: He is a true alpha specimen. - Sun Sep 13 02:53:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nothing, really. - Sun Sep 13 02:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmmm... - Sun Sep 13 02:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He can be fun. - Sun Sep 13 02:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Come on tell mee~ - Sun Sep 13 02:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Noo.....definitely not. - Sun Sep 13 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm. - Sun Sep 13 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because...no. - Sun Sep 13 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stirs her sake around a bit.* - Sun Sep 13 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Not even a bit? - Sun Sep 13 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hint* - Sun Sep 13 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not even a hint. - Sun Sep 13 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Meanie. - Sun Sep 13 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You don't wanna know. Trust me.... - Sun Sep 13 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I do though. - Sun Sep 13 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is definitely more loose-lipped than usual, though. Normally she'd not have said even this much.* - Sun Sep 13 02:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should I...? - Sun Sep 13 03:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I could order some more. - Sun Sep 13 03:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares down at the nearly empty bottle. She stirs it around more, staring at the contents of it.* - Sun Sep 13 03:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. - Sun Sep 13 03:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Very well~ - Sun Sep 13 03:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, with a soft sigh. Unfortunately there are enormous amounts of things on her mind that she can't talk about. Not one of them is something you say to a stranger and in most cases, even a friend.

"Um..." she says with a breath, not seeming to react to Hanabi's close proximity.

"Well...." She reaches up to slowly pour more sake into her mouth, just sipping now and savoring the taste. She doesn't drink much at all, even remotely, but it's visbly gulped down.

"Um..."* - Sun Sep 13 03:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmmm. - Sun Sep 13 03:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances in the direction of the finger, smiling a bit. "Well..." she says.

"Have you fought much? Serious fights."* - Sun Sep 13 03:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. . . - Sun Sep 13 03:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hadn't reacted to the poke this time, though she'd certainly felt it.* - Sun Sep 13 03:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Presumably, Kat's second bottle arrives at this time. The attendant quickly scurries off afterwords.* - Sun Sep 13 03:15:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And no one ever hits me. Ever. - Sun Sep 13 03:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls her bottle up to her mouth and pours down the entire 1/4th left. Her smile brightens up a bit.* - Sun Sep 13 03:17:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She keeps her bottle in her hands despite it being empty.* - Sun Sep 13 03:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches over her shoulder to set her bottle aside. Afterwords she begins scooting forwards, putting herself in the more comfortable position she'd been in before. Toes curl to and fro, and her legs rub against each other, kicking just a tiny bit back and forth, though not doing much to the water other than producing some very small, subtle waves.

"This 'is' nice..." she says, watching her own feet.* - Sun Sep 13 03:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Indeed it is~ - Sun Sep 13 03:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: What type of ninjutsu do you use? - Sun Sep 13 03:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Katon? - Sun Sep 13 03:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm...lightning.... - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I can use Katon. - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Earth.... - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Ah. - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I see. - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aaand explosion release. That's a secret though. Don't tell anyone.... - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Explosion? - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's so good.... - Sun Sep 13 03:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: First time I've heard of such a thing. - Sun Sep 13 03:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd show you, but it's loud. - Sun Sep 13 03:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm - Sun Sep 13 03:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I gues since you are telling me what you can do I gues sits only fair I show you mine. - Sun Sep 13 03:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Sep 13 03:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks up at her, still smiling a bit.* - Sun Sep 13 03:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods in response to her first comment, watching eagerly. Eyes wander to carefully examine the full length of the technique afterwords, not shying away from any area.

Despite this, when Hanabi's out of the water, her focus is indeed captivated mostly by the wings. They are..wings, after all. Colorful wings too.

"Yeah." she says with a subtle slur. "That's great."

Eyes wander downwards afterwords. Her goofy smile remains. As a matter of fact, she happens to be studying the scales and slimey nature of the exterior, though it's not like she's blind to anything else that's defined. Eyes linger for a moment long enough to suggest comfort, and wander off afterwords.

"Never seen someone with wings before. ."* - Sun Sep 13 03:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) briefly nuzzles her cheek against the feather, not-too-intently.

"Yeah. Sounds like you'd be fun to fight." she says, still not looking at her, for dignity's sake.* - Sun Sep 13 03:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you're good at it, that is. - Sun Sep 13 03:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been working on my ninjutsu. Bet I can hurt Kilm now. . . - Sun Sep 13 03:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Swords...heh. - Sun Sep 13 03:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I love sword users. - Sun Sep 13 03:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They die easy. - Sun Sep 13 03:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But hey. If that's what you like. .  - Sun Sep 13 03:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well there is only so much I can do. - Sun Sep 13 03:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And it is the only thing that is easily accesible to me you know? - Sun Sep 13 03:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure what normal taijutsu is like. I always combine mine with ninjutsu, so I can't say whether or not you should stick to hands and feet. - Sun Sep 13 03:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yeah...I'm sure you'll be fine. - Sun Sep 13 03:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yeah I hope. - Sun Sep 13 03:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Do you know of anyone that knows kenjutsu or katon ninjutsu? - Sun Sep 13 03:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. Zetsumo could teach you tons of katon stuff. - Sun Sep 13 03:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: really? - Sun Sep 13 03:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We also have 'one' guy that uses a sword but he's really shady and not one of us. - Sun Sep 13 03:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 03:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Bet the sword guy's a spy, but it's your choice. - Sun Sep 13 03:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno if he'd want to teach either. - Sun Sep 13 03:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He doesn't like showing people his stuff. - Sun Sep 13 03:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Really secretive. - Sun Sep 13 03:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Well as long as he could teach me something I do not care if he is a spy or not. - Sun Sep 13 03:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sun Sep 13 04:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I will try to learn as much as I can form Zetsumo - Sun Sep 13 04:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And try to learn from the shady guy. - Sun Sep 13 04:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hey Katsune. - Sun Sep 13 05:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Sun Sep 13 05:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: So . . . Uhh . . . What now? - Sun Sep 13 05:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno really. - Sun Sep 13 05:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm kinda tired...buuut... - Sun Sep 13 05:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have got better at some stuff. - Sun Sep 13 05:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We 'could' spar, if you're that bored. - Sun Sep 13 05:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I'm not bored, I was just you what you want to do. - Sun Sep 13 05:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Honestly...what I 'want' to do...is sleep. - Sun Sep 13 05:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Would if I could. - Sun Sep 13 05:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright . . . By the way . . . What did you get better at? - Sun Sep 13 05:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Secret. I'd rather surprise you. - Sun Sep 13 05:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Okay . . . Show me it in a spar then. - Sun Sep 13 05:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright. - Sun Sep 13 05:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel to lead the way to the usual training area.* - Sun Sep 13 05:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly.... - Sun Sep 13 05:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd rather train. Thinking about this fight...hmph. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's gonna go on for a while. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You can just show me it. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I kinda want to train my jutsu too. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's just...chakra control. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My jutsus are stronger and faster now. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's all. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Sun Sep 13 05:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Betting I can hurt you if I hit you. - Sun Sep 13 05:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A 'lot'. - Sun Sep 13 05:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Considering I still can't hit you cause of your speed . . . Probably. - Sun Sep 13 05:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna train for now? - Sun Sep 13 05:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Instead of sparring. - Sun Sep 13 05:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sure. - Sun Sep 13 05:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I want to finish Earthern Corridor. - Sun Sep 13 05:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 13 05:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This B rank is very tiring . . . - Sun Sep 13 05:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl turns on her heel, then, and makes her way over to the nearest tree. Palms find her hips when she comes to a stop, and her weight shifts a bit. Eyes wander up and down the length of the plant. Afterwords, she begins kneeling down.

Her right knee finds the dirt, and palms follow. Eyes remain on her target as chakra travels through the ground, quite quickly. Absurdly so, even -- though relatively speaking it's nothing special. Upon reaching the base of this tree, Kat's chakra kneads at the earth at a rapid pace. Spikes are formed below the surface.

There are four of them in all. All of them are made of both earth and stone, and they're quite hard; maybe even comparable to iron at this point. Abruptly, they eventually come darting out of the ground. They rip through the subterrain so harshly and easily that it sounds almost like a sword being ripped out of a sheathe. Katsune's tree is pinned from all sides.

Naturally it's not knocked over or torn to pieces. It is, however, shaken quite roughly. Loud creaking is heard as the tree is forced to cry out. Its wood splits on all four sides due to the piercings. Katsune's chakra in the area then fades away.

Unfortunately she has to send more all over again. This jutsu isn't mastered just yet. When it eventually does make its way to the tree, Katsune tries something a little different. Spikes are formed exactly where the last four were made; underneath them. Once done, the teen shoves her spikes right back into the last, forcing them further into the tree.

Already she's sweating just a tad, and she takes a breath with a shrug in response to Kilm. The tree screeches louder than before. With that, it begins slowly falling over, to the northeast. Halfway down its descension speeds up, and it hits the ground with a very loud boom. "Wonder if I could handle a B rank jutsu." she says.* - Sun Sep 13 06:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm not that bad chakra wise and this B rank jutsu is destroying everything I have. - Sun Sep 13 06:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls her eyes over to study Kilm for a moment. She's frowning a bit, and looks him up and down. He's so...driven. Way more motivated than her. It kind've makes her jealous.

He's training three or four times as hard as she is, and with a much more advanced jutsu too. With a shrug, she goes back to her own training. Her chakra is left near this tree this time, and she does her best to keep performing the jutsu without the usual wind-up required. A spike is produced, and roughly launched forwards. Yes, a single spike -- which is apparently very possible with this jutsu.

Albeit, due to it not being the usual usage, the power of it seems to be greatly reduced. The tree's trunk is shaken and such but it's large undisturbed. More spikes follow in rapid succeession. Occasionally the girl has to stop and take a breath. She's not capable of transitioning from jutsu to jutsu, so this is difficult.

She has to take a moment to regain her focus, and control of her chakra. Eventually, the girl decides she's molested this tree enough. Eyes wander over to the one next to it, and chakra is bid to travel in that direction. Once it's at the tree's base, spikes are produced once more. Two; only one from either direction. 

This effect is made to happen again afterwords, pinning it from two different directions. Katsune continues doing this until the tree is thoroughly decorated with spikes from top to bottom. The spikes are all woven in together by now, touching side-by-side. Finally, the tree comes tumbling down. Rather than let it fall, four final spikes are produced. They skewer the tree, leaving it hanging in mid-air.* - Sun Sep 13 06:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wow. - Sun Sep 13 06:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flops down onto her back, with arms and legs spread out.

The girl stares at the sky. To finish her training, she works on convincing herself that she's a salami.* - Sun Sep 13 07:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay . . . You've stopped . . . - Sun Sep 13 07:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this lazily, with eyes wandering. She seems unimpressed.* - Sun Sep 13 09:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . Yes . . . He also said he wants me to come home to Kirigakure . . . But I said that I can't leave you. - Sun Sep 13 09:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Sounds like you're pulling my leg. One-thousand men? That'd be suicide. - Sun Sep 13 09:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It takes a liar to know one. - Sun Sep 13 09:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: It was a surprise . . . We only had 100 troops there. - Sun Sep 13 09:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: But . . . Are you sure you want to go or not? - Sun Sep 13 09:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's annoying me that you're even asking. - Sun Sep 13 09:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I'm sorry, It's just that we either go together or stay together. - Sun Sep 13 09:42:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) briefly bumps her hip into Kilm's to lighten the mood, albeit with the same stoic expression on her face, and eyes still averted.

"Anyway." she says.* - Sun Sep 13 09:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I need at least 'some' time. - Sun Sep 13 09:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: If you went ahead and asked Tethys early, when you shouldn't have, then that's just too bad. - Sun Sep 13 09:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop, having takin only a step or so presmably. She glances down at the woman's hand.

"A member of Kenryoku." she says.

"One who killed Orakuru."* - Sun Sep 13 21:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Slaughtered. Beautifully. - Sun Sep 13 21:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Arms cross, and weight shifts a bit.

"No." she says. "I say it like I want to see if you care or not. Who are 'you'?"* - Sun Sep 13 22:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.* - Sun Sep 13 22:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Swordsman, then? I love swordsmen. - Sun Sep 13 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They die so easy. - Sun Sep 13 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks the agent up and down, slowly, sizing her up. Arms uncross, and she begins slowly walking backwards. With her right hand, she'd retrieve a kunai. Briefly it's flourished around a finger.* - Sun Sep 13 22:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches, hard. Eyes go out of focus a bit due to fear, and her breath catches in her throat with a near-silent gasp. She's successfully paralyzed, though she's presumably quite aware of what's going on. Naturally, she immediately begins willing her body to move. Knees shake due to the strength of this jutsu not being completely binding, as every spare neuron she has orders her to retreat.

After all, she'd had a bad feeling about this from the start. If not taunted, she'd planned to walk away and go jump into a hot spring with some lewd chick. Why tell comrades about this woman when she has no idea what ANBU even are?

And then her risk is cut. She's a bit slow to react -- just slow enough that she's hit. However, that was before she was hit. It's at this time....her gauntlet-protected arm is cut -- specifically, at the wrist. The very sturdy chakra flow material is presumably cut through, and blood is drawn...but likely, it'd still absorbed an enormous amount of the damage before being penetrated.

Even so...Kat would be in an enormous amount of pain. Some bone was torn. The wrist might be broken or at least sprained. As a result, the genjutsu is undoubtedly broken. Adreneline no doubt bids her to move whether she's in pain or not.

The moment Kat's cut, her body releases lightning-natured chakra all over. It releases a loud, crackling roar of electricity. The raiton flash jutsu. Undoubtedly, Rymei would be numbed and slowed down. Even as this lightning is being conjured up, already Kat is rapidly backpeddling at her full speed. Mid-stride -- after gettting twelve feet or so which surely takes no time at all -- Kat turns on her heel, not losing more than the very smallest amount of time if even that, due to how dexterous she is. She'd then sprint forwards.

The girl runs straight north. "KIRIGAKUUUUUUUURE!!!!!!!" she shouts at the top of her lungs. A guess. Not a difficult one either. She'd been suspicious from the start, and now she's assuming. She's not sure, but it doesn't matter. The word alone would no doubt draw enormous amounts of attention, immediately.* - Sun Sep 13 23:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) presumably loses her head. If successful, the girl falls over, limp, and hits the ground roughly.

At this time, one of the shinobi puts a hand's fingers in his mouth. He whistles, loudly. The other 9-14 immediately begin throwing kunai as they pursue this person. One or two of them begin forming handseals for jutsu, and ninjutsu follows.

This is very close to the town square. No doubt Rymei will be captured soon, and it's unlikely they'll let her live now.

Why couldn't she just let Kat go do lewd stuff with Hanabi like she planned, when she started walking away?

Kat's remarkable constitution presumably plays no role here.* - Mon Sep 14 00:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Admin**(Jjking218) says: Constitution is more0 - Mon Sep 14 01:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) falls asleep, unharmed apparently. She collapses on the ground. In the mean time, nearby shinobi presumably take some time to realize they're in a genjutsu. Will they break out and chase if Rymei doesn't gtfo?

Or will they pass out? Who knows. No one cares.* - Mon Sep 14 01:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains passed out on the ground.* - Mon Sep 14 01:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stirs. Eyes open, and she shakes her head. Slowly she turns her head to look around. A palm finds her head and she rubs at it.

"U-Uuuh..." she murmurs, with mouth a bit wattery. She doesn't even remember what all happened yet.* - Mon Sep 14 01:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: To answer your question, I am Yu. - Mon Sep 14 01:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: If I had only gotten here sooner. - Mon Sep 14 01:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Sep 14 01:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) presumably is allowed to carefully catch herself on hands and knees. Slowly she sits up afterwords. The girl's expression is sour. Eyes wander, and she examines nearby shinobi.

A silent, deep breath is taken as she works to contain her rage.

It's unfortunate she has seals placed on her.* - Mon Sep 14 01:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Ask one of these guys when they wake up. - Mon Sep 14 01:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: There are seals present on your body. - Mon Sep 14 01:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) still has all her chakra cause she wasn't allowed to use any jutsu.* - Mon Sep 14 01:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Never again...not even once, will I look at handseals. Not like I gave a fuck anyway. I dodge the jutsus carelessly enough. - Mon Sep 14 01:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: ..."Let me out" - Mon Sep 14 01:50:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns on her heel to face the north and walks away.* - Mon Sep 14 01:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: YOU CANT RUN HIDEKI - Mon Sep 14 02:09:04 2015
