<br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes the bottle with a shrug. With that she rises to her feet and says "I'll be outside."

The girl then wanders off.* - Mon Sep 14 03:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Now I feel better . . . I don't share thoughts with anyone anymore. - Mon Sep 14 03:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Good. - Mon Sep 14 03:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: What do you want to do? - Mon Sep 14 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I dunno. - Mon Sep 14 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Sleep. - Mon Sep 14 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I feel like going to the . . . spa . . . again. - Mon Sep 14 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . - Mon Sep 14 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: No. I'm no going to the spa with you. Stop trying to interest me. - Mon Sep 14 03:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's not working. - Mon Sep 14 03:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I mean it just casually. It was relaxing. - Mon Sep 14 03:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I never felt anything for you, you know. - Mon Sep 14 03:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Didn't you say that already? - Mon Sep 14 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I've already told you I wanna be sure I'm not leading you on. - Mon Sep 14 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: And you said that yesterday. - Mon Sep 14 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I don't believe you when you say you're gonna back off. Well I mean it. I want some space. - Mon Sep 14 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Mon Sep 14 03:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I might go alone then, I never got my massage. - Mon Sep 14 03:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I should sleep. Long day. - Mon Sep 14 04:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Mon Sep 14 04:00:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go sleep.* - Mon Sep 14 04:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down, wiggling into place when she does so. Arms wrap around her legs, and her eyes remain averted. The girl's expression is blank.* - Mon Sep 14 06:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Now I feel way different, Whether it's for the better or for the worse. - Mon Sep 14 06:01:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Mm...so, Kilm. - Mon Sep 14 06:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Think you could teach me that jutsu? I might need it if we're going to war. - Mon Sep 14 06:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hm? - Mon Sep 14 06:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Could use it as a shield. - Mon Sep 14 06:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Which one? - Mon Sep 14 06:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: The box...thing. - Mon Sep 14 06:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hm . . . Let me think about it. - Mon Sep 14 06:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . Only if you teach me your C rank later. - Mon Sep 14 06:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright... - Mon Sep 14 06:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Follow me. - Mon Sep 14 06:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to follow.* - Mon Sep 14 06:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, eying the teen's display of the jutsu. "Definitely gonna put in effort." she says. "I saw what Zetsumo used this for in the war. It's useful." The girl then turns to face the south.

Hands meet and arms stretch out. A moment is spent cracking her knuckles. "First this..." she says. "Then I'm developing an anti-genjutsu lightning technique. Fuck genjutsu."

Arms come to her chest and Katsune forms the tiger handseal. Afterwords she lazily kneels down -- lazily, for dignity's sake. The truth is, she's very eager. This jutsu is better than anything she's ever learned so far. For a moment she feels a bit guilty; she's been so cold to Kilm.

Both palms touch the ground. Chakrs is sent out at its full speed, as the girl holds nothing back. Abruplty, the ground splits some twenty feet away. It does so in four different, haphazard locations. Dirt is thrown to and fro, though no actual structures rise up.

Kat shrugs and tries again. Once more she repeats the seal and then touches the ground. Spikes are formed in the earth. Abruptly they come soaring forwards. These spikes move a bit more slowly than usual though. 

It's easily noticed that they're weaker than usual too. They come forth haphazardly, and are sprawled out all over the place. They maintain their slant though, as conditioned from the Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot jutsu training. The girl takes a moment to crack her neck; first to the right, and then to the left. Hours pass.

Occasionally Kat had stood up and wandered accross the yard, to stretch her feet. Arms cross in the process. Eventually she's coated in a very damp layer of sweat. Very long breaks are needed. Thankfully no longer than the ones Kilm had needed, but only for one reason -- she has such a fantastic teacher right now.

Kilm needs very little chakra for this technique so naturally, his teachings rub some of that off on her. Admittedly Kat could probably go on for much longer than she is, but she feels that she has time, so she uses it. More hours pass. An eyebrow twitches. Admittedly a great deal of her fuel comes from how badly the mysterious un-named ANBU agent had shamed her the other day.

If not for Orakuru's gauntlets -- a gift from the man she killed, so carelessly -- Kat would be dead right now. Rymei had went straight for the wrist. Just like Kat, she'd underestimated her opponent. She'd never make that mistake again. No more insults carelessly thrown around, and no more pretentious behavior.* - Mon Sep 14 07:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Yo'. - Mon Sep 14 07:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander over to the man. Casually, and stuff, since she's with Kilm of all people. Her breath catches in her throat when she sees who the voice actually belongs to, though. Eyes go out of focus, briefly, and she frowns. It takes her a moment, but eventually she regains her composure.

Briefly, Kat looks him up and down. It's tempting to assess him at least a bit carefully to determine how dangerous he might be, but she stops herself. Eyes don't focus on the hands.

Never again.

Eye contact is regained immediately, and she rises to her feet. Briefly she glances over at Kilm, a tiny bit anxiously.* - Mon Sep 14 07:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hadn't reacted to Kilm's first comment; one that might've usually led to her throwing something at his nuts.

Arms cross, and weight shifts a bit. She keeps her eyes locked on Tethys, not willing to risk looking elsewhere, all things considered.

She knows more than you might guess, but it changes nothing.* - Mon Sep 14 07:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. After a moment, she turns on her heel to face the south and averts her eyes completely. It'd be shameful not to at this point, even if she still feels far from safe, for so many reasons.* - Mon Sep 14 07:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Ahh, she's a tough cookie. - Mon Sep 14 07:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can't afford to spend time thinking about it. It's not something we can risk. - Mon Sep 14 07:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: To be honest, Can't spend that much time talking. - Mon Sep 14 07:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Traitorous thoughts will just get us killed during the next interrogation check. - Mon Sep 14 07:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: See you. - Mon Sep 14 07:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. The girl begins walking backwards -- a bit quickly, in fact -- in response to the sound of him approaching. Eyes find him and she watches his feet as he walks by.

He's slow, so if he seems to be getting to close, she'd actually go so far as to sprint backwards. At no point would she allow him to get within striking distance. She notes, with her exceptional eyes, the length of his blade.* - Mon Sep 14 08:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up where she left off with her training. Learning the Earthen Corridor jutsu. She was interupted, but she can't afford to lose any momentum with this. With it being possible that Amegakure will be attacked at any time, she has to be ready. The tiger handseal is performed, and she then kneels down.

Chakra yet again is poured into the ground. Kat's starting to get the hang of this, and she's sure of it. Dulled, very wide spikes abruptly spring up out of the ground. They're almost stone slabs. A breath is taken, and the kunoichi takes a moment to examine her handiwork.

Four slabs in all, and all of them are quite small. All four are much weaker than even her usual earth spikes would be. She shrugs at the thought, ignoring the sweat dripping down her face. More hours pass, and Kat turns to face the south. She walks backwards, taking six or seven steps.

Once there, she initiates the jutsu's seals and such once more. Unlike before, she spends great deals of time compacting earth beneath the surface. Deep, but slow and silent, breaths are taken. She kneads the earth to and fro, as if it were clay. The girl's lips stretch into a crooked frown.

Why can't jutsus just be easy? She curses herself for not having Kilm's insane level of drive. Slowly, the earth slabs she'd form rise up from the ground. They catch near the surface, and she begins stretching them out. More earth is gathered from below, and she attempts to add it to her current walls.

Mud and earth drips down from the sides. It cracks in various places. Kat's efforts are wasted, though she doesn't realize it yet. A bit desperately, she bids more earth to rise up into the current structure and attempts to salvage it, as if it's clay and she can just replace some of it. At this time, though, the entire structure falls apart, crumbling down to the ground.

Kat's eyebrows furrow. A breath is taken, and she rises to her feet. Eyes wander. Abruptly, she then darts over to the nearest tree, moving as a blur. The girl's right leg darts forwards and she kicks it, very hard.

Immediately she regrets it. A loud gasp is released and her face turns white. Hands clench into fists and she bounces around for a bit. "Tsch!" she scoffs, grasping the foot in her right hand. "Stupid jutsu!" she curses loudly. "Stupid Zetsumo!!!!"

She then marches off, intent on coming back on another day to resume her training.* - Mon Sep 14 08:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) resumes her training the next morning, having slept on what she learned. Once more the handseal is formed, and once more she crouches down to put it to good use. Having rested and given her brain time to file the information away, so to speak, it's no wonder that she has an easier time of things today. At Katsune's bidding, the ground shakes. Loud, creaking sounds are released as stones are ripped from their resting places in the earth.

Slowly, walls rise up from the subterrain. All four at once, already as a box-like shape without a roof. Deep, slow breaths are taken throughout this entire process and it is...quite, quite slow. Nowhere near what one might expect for someone with Katsune's level of chakra control. That is, if this weren't a B ranked jutsu.

Eventually, the structure stops rising. Already, Kat's face turns a bit damp. This requires large amounts of chakra, even with Kilm's guidance. The structure trembles on all sides. Eventually, though, Kat manages to succeed in what she's trying. Slowly, earth stretches out accross the top of this strcuture. It's sealed with a roof, like a lid.

With a breath, Kat rises into a standing position. She sways in place as she does so. Palms find her hips, and weight shifts a bit. The girl nods, looking her creation up and down. Her faint frown remains.* - Mon Sep 14 09:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Heya Kat.  - Mon Sep 14 10:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks up at Zenaki. Briefly she looks her up and down afterwords with a nod, with a blank expression on her face.

"'Morning." she says.* - Mon Sep 14 10:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: That was the worst combination of words. - Mon Sep 14 10:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I've been quite well... Away from some things that had happend. But that isn't important now.  - Mon Sep 14 10:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, I almost died a few days ago. - Mon Sep 14 10:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thankfully I have my gauntlets.... - Mon Sep 14 10:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. These gauntlets are a 'lot' stronger than I thought. She hit me so hard it rang throughout half the village. - Mon Sep 14 10:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Mon Sep 14 10:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Last time I let taunting bother me. - Mon Sep 14 10:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Especially when.... - Mon Sep 14 10:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I need to tell him something. Of recent events.  - Mon Sep 14 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Something bad happened? - Mon Sep 14 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Yea... I rather not talk about it. - Mon Sep 14 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 14 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. You probably hear about it soon enough.. After I've done my thing. - Mon Sep 14 10:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 14 10:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: That fucking bitch... Can't wait till I get permission to punish her.. Heh.  - Mon Sep 14 10:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: It probably doesn't concern me though. Don't know why I would be interested in hearing about what happened. - Mon Sep 14 10:44:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances off after Kilm but remains where she is for now. She's too tired to train. She just spent more than an entire day mastering the jutsu he taught her.* - Mon Sep 14 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... Well, Kat. If you ever need anything. Tell me hm.. - Mon Sep 14 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: So, that has to be Zenkai... - Mon Sep 14 11:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Honestly, I'd ask for lessons again but I doubt I'd have the energy. - Mon Sep 14 11:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Lessons hm..?  - Mon Sep 14 11:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 14 11:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My chakra control wasn't good enough before to learn how to heal. - Mon Sep 14 11:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. I see.  - Mon Sep 14 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe a waste of time though. Truth is, I probably wouldn't be dedicated enough to get that good at healing. - Mon Sep 14 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm, always helpfull to have sorts of knowledge hm. - Mon Sep 14 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: True, yeah. - Mon Sep 14 11:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I can teach you how to make bandages from your surroundings? Like grass and sand.. Just to temporarily stop the bleeding.  - Mon Sep 14 11:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That could be useful.... - Mon Sep 14 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It sure is. - Mon Sep 14 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: . . . . Women..... - Mon Sep 14 11:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It doesn't last to long. And the one with the bandage needs to come to you ever so and so many minutes. To get your chakra in it again so it lasts again some time longer. Hm~ - Mon Sep 14 11:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: But honestly. I didn't really used it much. Just healed people.  - Mon Sep 14 11:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. I have time for lessons, if you do. - Mon Sep 14 11:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uh yea sure why not hm.. Need to wait for Zetsumo anyways. - Mon Sep 14 11:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to follow. Truth is, she's not sure this'll be too helpful but she has nothing better to do....and being nice to the only medic in town that doesn't hate her is probably a good idea.* - Mon Sep 14 11:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, stretching out her arm. Her left palm rests on her own hip for the moment and her weight shifts a bit. Her open right palm faces the sky.* - Mon Sep 14 11:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow. She hadn't expected an actual jutsu, and is pleasantly surprised. "I see..." she says. The girl turns her arm to and fro, studying Zenaki's handiwork. With her left hand, she reaches out to poke the construct to test its consistency.

"Should've known it'd be a jutsu."* - Mon Sep 14 11:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This..... - Mon Sep 14 11:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) watches the materials fall as she speaks.

"Makes me wonder what else a person could do with this technique. I mean, if they practiced, and made it better."* - Mon Sep 14 11:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. Who knows. Probably make something like clotihng or armor aswell. If you have enough chakra for it.. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Exactly. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dunno how practical it is. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Buuut maybe I'll take the time to find out. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm.. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: After all, my gauntlet didn't come out without a scratch the other day. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You are lucky, still. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Very' lucky. - Mon Sep 14 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a good thing she was as arrogant as I was. - Mon Sep 14 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Last' time I make that mistake. - Mon Sep 14 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 14 11:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. Mmm... Think about it if you want to learn it or not. - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah, I'd like to learn this. - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhhmm.. - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Righty. You need my arm to practice? - Mon Sep 14 11:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, and takes a seat next to the doctor. "Sure." she says. Legs stretch out in front of her and palms rest at her sides. She waits for the arm.* - Mon Sep 14 11:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not....what I had planned when I sat down. - Mon Sep 14 11:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. A hand scoops up some of the nearby sand. Eyes wander to and fro in a shady manner. It occurs to her, having an arm available won't actually help her at this point. She opts to not mention that, though. Offending doctor Frankenstein seems unhealthy.

Katsune holds the sand in her palm, and places her left palm on top of it. From there, she begins pouring chakra into it. Hands knead and rub at it, very gently. The girl's chakra control isn't so bad, so it's likely the sand shifts and stirs in her grip. She doesn't want shifting and stirring, though. 

She wants slime. Clay.* - Mon Sep 14 11:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up some of the sand in the top-most hand, with the palm still facing downwards. Chakra is kneaded through it as it drizzles down, like sand from an hour glass. The girl repeats this motion more than once, turning her hands to and fro. Eventually, one can see the sand stirring. It winds and turns to and fro.

Still not what she wants. With a shrug, Kat reaches over to grab a handfull of grass, ripping it from the ground. Maybe that'd help. She places all materials inbetween her hands and begins grinding them together, while still pouring chakra into them. Eventually, a sticky sheen actually does become apparent.

More labor is put into her efforts. The collection of materials is brought down to her right thigh. Very carefully, she smushes it into place. As if it's dough, she begins gently and very, very slowly pushing it forwards. Chakra is kneaded through it all the while.

Slowly, the materials become more of a clay substance. Kat smushes them together, sideways, making it look more and more like dough. It's a disk, soon. Once this is complete, she simply rolls it back up yet again, packing it in while feeding it chakra. In time, Kat deems this substance fit to be placed on Zenaki's arm.

After all, it's now time to make it hard. There are probably many better ways to phrase that. The substance is wrapped around her arm. Gently, Kat pats it down, causing it to stick. Hands move to and fro, smushing it in more closely.

Finally, Kat's palms begin kneading and rubbing, as if she's giving someone a massage. The clay becomes more and more sticky. It doesn't seem to become harder at all. Eventually, though, it does become a bit dry. Pieces of it begin crumbling and falling off to the ground.* - Mon Sep 14 12:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Sep 14 12:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think. . . - Mon Sep 14 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I may be struggling with this as much as I was Earthen Corridor. - Mon Sep 14 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And that took me ages. - Mon Sep 14 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hmm.. You are doing well already. It's a bit  tricky at first... But just keep on trying.. If you can... - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You can try it on your own leg.. Or on a tree or anything..  - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Practice if you feel like iit. - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, taking her own arms back. Her palms are placed in the grass at either side of her, and eyes wander.

"Time for a break..." she says.* - Mon Sep 14 12:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You both done? - Mon Sep 14 12:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I see. - Mon Sep 14 12:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I would suggest an activity . . . But . . . Hm. - Mon Sep 14 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm..? - Mon Sep 14 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Like what? - Mon Sep 14 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I still have tons of light novels to read. - Mon Sep 14 12:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not sure. - Mon Sep 14 12:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anything to be honest. - Mon Sep 14 12:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm... - Mon Sep 14 12:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I've been to the spa three times in the past few weeks. If I do that anymore the receptionist is gonna think I'm some kind've rapist. - Mon Sep 14 12:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm. - Mon Sep 14 12:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like I said before. - Mon Sep 14 12:23:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I need some space. - Mon Sep 14 12:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I was already giving you some. I just want something to do. I mean . . . I could read the collection of light novels that I now have . . . Though I have social needs. - Mon Sep 14 12:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well you're making me uncomfortable. - Mon Sep 14 12:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So you're gonna have to go find someone else to help with your needs. - Mon Sep 14 12:24:19 2015

Carefully she then sets herself down on her belly, with her elbows furrowed. Palms rest pressed against her face, and she begins reading. One leg crosses over the other behind her.* - Mon Sep 14 13:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's palms meet. Eyes continue scanning the contents of the scroll as her hands form the tiger seal. Without testing the jutsu, the girl begins manipulating her chakra. It's stirred to and fro within her core, and throughout her limbs. An easy thing for her to do.

Eyes then close. Slowly and silently, Katsune draws in a breath. Once her lungs are full, she pushes at her chakra. Roughly, it's sent spiraling up into her brain. Undoubtedly, she learns the technique nearly instantly.

Unfortunately, she's not done yet. To avoid any disasters like before...she'll have to learn how to do this technique 'without' handseals.* - Mon Sep 14 13:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and wanders over to Kilm's side. The girl's back meets the fence, and slowly she lets it slide down until her butt is planted in the dirt.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls her scroll up and rises to her feet. The girl then takes a moment to brush herself off before turning on her heel and walking away.

She needs a nap.* - Mon Sep 14 15:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Tue Sep 15 09:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Ugggggh I don't -want- to practice Kiai. - Tue Sep 15 09:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise and hands meet. Eyes remain open and on the ground. Slowly Katsune draws in a breath. As she does so, chakra is gathered in her core. When the process is completed, she begins very slowly and carefully pushing chakra into the rest of her circuits.

Chakra flows smoothly. When Kat had tried shoving chakra to where it's supposed to go before, it'd given her headaches. For someone with chuunin levels of chakra control, she's surprisingly slow to learning this. What a pain! More breaths are taken in response to this thought.

It's not to help with chakra control though. It's to keep her from getting frustrated. Eventually, legs are pulled close to her form. They cross. Eyes close, and she resumes manipulating her chakra.

Just to practice chakra control, the girl begins very gently pushing chakra back and forth. Not just into her brain, but into her entire body. An eyebrow twitches. In part just to procrastonate, and in part to mix it up, the girl attempts to stop chakra only in her left hand. After all, it's said to be easiest to control chakra in the hands.* - Tue Sep 15 09:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's chakra trembles within the hand. Surprisingly, Kat finds herself strongly tempted -- and nearly forced -- to control chakra in both hands at once. It's probably most natural, after all. One-handed jutsus are more difficult than those used with two hands, in her experience. When tested, it does prove to be easiest, so she sticks with it.

The girl concentrates, hard. Hands eventually become a bit cold. A spark or two of electricity, actually, seeps out of her chakra flow gauntlets. She'd accidentally moulded lightning-natured chakra. Occasionally, her hands actually seem to become a bit warmer.

Too much chakra. And finally, she seems to successfully stop the flow of chakra in the appendages. Abruptly, without giving it much time to sit, Kat shoves additional chakra back into them. Hands twitch. It hurts, a bit. 

She'd probably want to be careful if she's gonna be doing this with the chakra circuits in her brain. Then again, what does she know? Her idea of studying is usually pummeling trees for hours on end. Zetsumo's tyranny led to Kat never getting to join the ninja academy. It's why she'd approached him so long ago.

Everything Zetsumo's ever taught her has been hands-on, practical things. She doesn't even know Bunshin no Jutsu or any of the other basics...aside from Henge. As a result, the girl is a little bit rustier on basic ninja things than you'd guess. A lot rustier, even. All of Kat's success in training even to this day is from pure intuition and intellect alone.* - Tue Sep 15 09:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I told myself I'd master the B rank water jutsu today . . . Hm . . . I'll wait a bit more . . . I've already practiced it a bit today. - Tue Sep 15 09:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) attempts one last time to stop chakra flow in her brain. She's hesitant at first, and pussy-foots around a bit, and does this in only one little section of her brain at a time. Eventually, she's confident. Chakra within her brain sways to and fro. It does so by a lot at first, and gradually less-so. Finally, at some point, it's come almost to a complete hault.

And then she succeeds, completely. With a slow, silent, and deep breath, she holds the chakra in this manner and attempts to do the same with all of the rest of the chakra in her body. Just as she starts to feel an uncomfortable numbing sensation, she shoves the chakra forwards, disrupting all of the chakra in her body all at once.

Katsune opens her eyes with said eyes averted, and lazily reaches out to pick up the scroll Zetsumo gave her. She then opens it up and carefully reads its contents. The girl needs to be absolutely, 100% sure that she learned this jutsu properly.* - Tue Sep 15 09:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She sets the now-useless scroll aside and forms her handseal again. She's done it properly, but she's not where she wants to be yet. When Kat had been nearly killed before...she'd been in a certain situation. Her arms, and hands, weren't moving. If she ever encounters this bloodthirsty jerk again, she needs to be able to do this jutsu 'without' handseals.

So, she practices more. Chakra is stopped throughout her entire body. Just to improve chakra control for this specific technique, she focuses for now on one single goal. One single aspect of the technique. Rather than anything else, for now, Kat only attempts to hold her chakra at a complete hault for as long as possible.

Naturally she succeeds at haulting it. Finally Katsune has become fairly good at this. The problem is, she can't keep it haulted for long. Occasionally, chakra sways in one or two different locations within her body at a time. A silent breath is taken each time.

After many small failures comes a large one. Chakra begins flowing, all over and entirely, despite Kat's best efforts. Lazily she tilts her head to the side, cracking her neck. She repeats this motion in the opposite direction. It's been at least half an hour now.

Many more failures follow. Gradually, though, she seems to hold her chakra in place for longer and longer each time. In part, it's discipline she needs. But also, her body seems to become a bit numb when she holds it for too long. Paralyzed, even.

Kat can only wonder if this is what happened to her before.* - Tue Sep 15 09:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet. Once more they form the tiger seal. Normally Kat might have taken her time but...with the war going on, she should master this jutsu as quickly as possible. Not because of Chivalry. Because she's bloodthirsty. Chakra throughout her entire body is stopped.

Once more, it's then shoved throughout. The girl rocks it back and forth in the same motion, eager to explore every single corner of this jutsu. Rather than giving her chakra time to slow down on its own, Kat attempts to stop it even while it goes wild. It takes time, but eventually she succeeds. Naturally, this is repeated.

She intends to keep this up for a while. Eyes are on the ground.* - Tue Sep 15 10:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wasn't able to use my hands before, so I need to know how to use it without handseals. - Tue Sep 15 11:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It took me a few days to master Kai . . . Give or take. - Tue Sep 15 11:15:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Kinda isn't good enough, you must be determined. - Tue Sep 15 11:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You must be convinced in your resolve to kill anyone who gets in the way. - Tue Sep 15 11:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Or you will die. - Tue Sep 15 11:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He died, though. To my jutsu. - Tue Sep 15 11:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well...alright. He fell. He was unable to move. - Tue Sep 15 11:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then Zetsumo finished the job before I could. - Tue Sep 15 11:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But trust me -- it was my kill. Zetsumo says as much too. - Tue Sep 15 11:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You are a very capable shinobi. - Tue Sep 15 11:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Tue Sep 15 11:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: However. - Tue Sep 15 11:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Tue Sep 15 11:49:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He did try to kill me though. - Tue Sep 15 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And I was slightly hyped up . . . - Tue Sep 15 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Right after killing Kitora. When he started the war for my sake. - Tue Sep 15 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I have no regrets. - Tue Sep 15 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I understand. - Tue Sep 15 11:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I really wish I could've been there though. - Tue Sep 15 11:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anybody need to learn the genjutsu kai technique? - Tue Sep 15 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm done with this scroll. - Tue Sep 15 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I'll take it. - Tue Sep 15 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hands it over.* - Tue Sep 15 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I probably should've asked Zetsumo first....buuut. - Tue Sep 15 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Oh well. - Tue Sep 15 11:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Any other topics to talk about? - Tue Sep 15 11:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Genjutsu and how it should be kinjutsu? - Tue Sep 15 11:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Teach me how to dougie. - Tue Sep 15 11:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't see why every genjutsu should be Kinjutsu. - Tue Sep 15 11:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's just another thing to take advantage of if your opponent is weak against it. - Tue Sep 15 11:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: mmm... - Tue Sep 15 12:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: People weren't supposed to actually think about that. . . - Tue Sep 15 12:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd train but.... - Tue Sep 15 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Everyone here knows everyone's stuff. - Tue Sep 15 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No fun. - Tue Sep 15 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: 'Cept for the new guy anyway. - Tue Sep 15 12:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had been lying on her belly with hair draped over her back in a manner that suggests...well. She'd been sleeping at some point. Arms are wrapped around her pillow, and she's covered all the way up.

The girl's face is facing the east. At the sound of Zetsumo's voice, an eyebrow twitches. She frowns a bit. She'd already been awake, but having the smelly man in her home isn't welcome. A slow, silent breath is taken. Slowly, she rises up into a sitting position with legs sprawled out underneath her form and palms resting on the mattress inbetween her legs.

Naturally she's not wearing clothes or anything, but she's decent...ish. Nothing lewd, and it'll take her about two seconds to get dressed if she's motivated. A glance is sent to Zetsumo's feet.

"...How'd you get in my house?" she inquires.* - Tue Sep 15 15:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is wearing a subtle scowl, too.* - Tue Sep 15 15:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches a bit at the sound of a whip lash and leans a bit to the right, her scowl shifting into more of a frown. Eyes wander. She's hesitant for a few long seconds. Eventually though, she shrugs. Legs move first, and she turns to face the west. With eyes averted -- due to the fact that she's not dressed -- she gently slides down to where feet touch the ground and stands up.

The girl's left hand moves to find her bed's comforter afterwords and she pulls it over her chest, letting it hang down and cover her up mostly. Kat's body is made to face him.

"I've done some stuff." she says.* - Tue Sep 15 16:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then walks up to Zetsumo. Without any hesitation or fear whatsoever, she stands up on her tip-toes, her challenged height forcing the gesture. Arms rise with the comforter/blanket in both hands. She then tosses it over Zetsumo's head, intending to cover him up so he's not eying her down like a creep.

Afterwords she'd turn around and make her way over to her gear. It takes time, but eventually she'd be in her body suit and boots. With snapping sounds, her gauntlets are attached as well.

When done, whether Zetsumo had complied with Kat's preferences or not, Kat would turn to face him. Palms rest in her hips and her weight shifts a bit. She waits for him to lead the way out.* - Tue Sep 15 16:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aiyana(PrisonerOfWar) says: We should go. - Tue Sep 15 17:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Hrm. . .? - Tue Sep 15 17:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Mmm. I'll be to the south. - Tue Sep 15 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmph - Tue Sep 15 17:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Nah - Tue Sep 15 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Not me - Tue Sep 15 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I've mastered it. - Tue Sep 15 17:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. Arms are crossed at the moment, and weight is shifted a bit. She shakes her head. "No...Kilm spent days teaching me the Earthen Corridor technique, and I've been working on Kai, so I haven't had time..."* - Tue Sep 15 17:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I know what it is, never learned it. - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like I said. "I've done some stuff." - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Gonna let me learn it? - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Then show me what you've managed to accomplish with the Earthern Corridor. - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: And I consider it. <@Amai> - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I will* - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I take part in full on wars - Tue Sep 15 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Ommit - Tue Sep 15 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then turns to face the southwest. Eyes fall on the enormous amounts of trees, and wander over them to guage how much ground they cover. After assessing them, arms rise and the tiger seal is formed. Chakra is gathered in her hands. Lazily, she then kneels down. Both palms meet the earth, and rapidly chakra is sent forwards undernearth the surface, invisibly.

To a normal person without supernatural reflexes, it'd appear that nearly instantly, the ground in that area begins shaking. Grass parts and earth rises, with dirt drizzling down as it does so. Walls rise in a big, circular dome, and they do so very quickly. Kat visibly takes a slow breath, as if strained a bit by this technique. Eyes are locked on the structure for a moment. Eventually, though, the jutsu is complete. Twenty trees or so are left trapped inside a dome.

The girl then rises to her feet, swaying a bit, and turns to face Zetsumo to assess his reaction. It's clear by how much effort she'd needed to apply that this jutsu is nowhere near mastered. That, or her reserves of chakra are nothing phenominal.* - Tue Sep 15 17:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Oh yeah - Tue Sep 15 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: IC stuff  - Tue Sep 15 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: ^Not Ic - Tue Sep 15 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, and begins lazily making her way to twelve feet west of Zetsumo. Once there, eyes wander over the grass he'd mentioned. She's hesitant for a long while because this is gonna be a pain. Eventually though, she shrugs.

Five handseals are weaved. It takes time, because handseals are not her strongsuit. With that done, her right arm abruptly lights in with a thick coat of electricity. It hisses and chirps very loudly, and crackles wildly. Its bright blue glow paints grass the same color for ten full feet in any direction. The girl then kneels down and places the palm on the ground.

Lightning streams forwards, being channeled through the earth and thus strengthened immensely. The range is increased as a result. Grass and earth are upturned and thrown all over the place. This jutsu is repeated a few times, and eventually, fourty full feet of length and twenty feet of width are cleared.

Once this is done, Kat rises to her feet with a shakey sigh. The drain on her chakra is a pain. The grass is all removed mostly, but the earth is dry. To fix this, Kat allows herself to abruptly sink into the ground. It turns into liquid as she does so. Not even mud, but something much more wet. It's like water. Rapidly, Kat then begins swimming forwards. She moves as a blur, and swims over the earth many, many times over. 

It takes many long minutes. Eventually, though, a mud-covered Kat is seen pulling herself out of her finished platform. It's all mud now. Legs rest in said mud, and she stares blankly at it. She takes the time to catch her breath and recover her chakra.* - Tue Sep 15 17:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself out of the mud, planting her feet on the grass during the motion. She's turned to face Zetsumo when he shows her the required handseals. With a nod she follows his movements, facing the west again shortly asfterwords. It's only barely that her eyes can even follow the canon balls shot forwards, due to the speed. They're blurs.

The girl's heart beats a bit faster. Such a technique -- it'd definitely be the strongest she's ever had in terms of raw power. Of course, she'll probably never get to use it since she has a lot of trouble creating mud, but it'll stll be a fun toy. She nods more in response to further instructions. Lazily, Kat takes a moment to crack her neck.

Arms then rise, and hands meet. Three handseals are formed. A deep, slow, silent breath is taken afterwords. Chakra is channeled into the mud presumably through her feet. Naturally, Kat doesn't struggle that much to form at least 'something' with her chakra. 

She has an awful lot of experience with the doton element and her chakra control is great -- chuunin level in fact. The mud rises up by four feet or so. It waves over forwards and then sways to and fro with mud dripping down in large amounts. Shortly after being formed, though, this mud abruptly falls back down. Kat takes another breath as mud splashes to and fro beneath her.

Splashing, because she hadn't stopped trying to move it. It bubbles. Occasionally small walls of mud rise up, one at a time, from different areas. All of them belong to the dragon head she's trying to form. Balls form in the distance as well, and they slide and roll on over to the beast's maw. The shape of them often distorts, though, and often she loses some of them on the way to her creation.

Hours presumably pass, this being a B ranked technique and her being only barely chuunin-level. It's a good thing her chakra is naturally so immense. Eventually, though, Kat does finally manage a genuine dragon's head. It's maw faces the west, and its nostriles are appropriately large. It's complete with fangs and big, reptilian eyes. 

Mud drips down from it constantly. The beast's body sways to and fro, as if unstable, because it is. Kat's body tenses up visibly. An eyebrow twitches. By now a very light layer of sweat coats her face. The rest of her is covered up so one can't tell, but she's sweating all over of course.

Silent breaths are taken, and she's scowling a bit by now from the effort and her frustration over this taking so long to master. It's every bit as difficult as Earthen Corridor, if not moreso. Balls form in the dragon's mouth. They fall apart shortly afterwords though, each time. Occasionally, one might see several in the mouth all at once.

Each time though, they're hollow. Bubbly, and not worthy of being used to kill someone. More hours pass, with Kat not having moved from her position. She is a ninja after all. Discipline is mandatory.

Finally, the girl manages to send a ball rolling forwards. It traverses the entire mud platform. Afterwords, it even keeps rolling -- not for very long, though. It covers about six feet before falling apart into a splash of mud. More follow behind it, with very similar results. Occasionally, identical results.

Kat's hands part. Once more she forms the handseals. Ram, horse, and then finally dragon. An appropriately-themed sequence. Chakra is channeled into the earth and a great deal of time is spent forming her ball this time. It's fed to her dragon, and she keeps it small -- hoping it'll be easier to control a tiny ball. This one is gold-ball-sized.

It's held for many long seconds. Eventually, though, it's abruptly thrown forwards -- and hard too. In the distant horizon, it hits a tree trunk with a loud thunk. No real damage is done, but it's progress. More mud is drawn with Kat not having even spent much time to assess what she just did.

By now she's impatient, and ready to have this technique completed. Many small balls are formed, of roughly the same size as before. Very, very carefully she positions them within the mouth of the dragon, having them become part of his head. She's careful to not let them be consumed entirely, but rather keep their shape within small little pockets. Eventually, she sends them all flying forwards.

The balls scatter, not showing great deals of accuracy. Without any pause, Kat simply gathers more. She'd thrown only fifteen or so in the last batch -- presumably much less than Zetsumo. This action is repeated, over and over again. Eventually, a barrage is conjured up. 

That being said, the balls are still small. Hands part and yet again, handseals are formed. Kat needs to be sure she does this right, as she's ready to go home. A much bigger ball is formed. Five more are placed on que. 

All balls tremble and sway to and fro, as Kat has difficulty keeping them this dense and all at once. Several long minutes pass, with her never willing to let the balls go. They're fed to her dragon, and made part of him, very carefully. Finally, though, a ball is shot forwards. It's done with a loud, audible bang due to the raw power.

Another ball is formed, even as the other four wait for their turn. She's not willing to work with only four. Yet another hour passes. Finally, Kat shows enough success to be considered done for the day. By no means is she a master, but with a silent huff, Kat manages to send all five balls flying forwards. 

Each come with a bang, and all go in a straight line. Accuracy seems to be lacking as well. By the time the balls have flown fourty feet, they're falling out of line and scattering in the wind. Each crashes into the ground loudly some great distance away.

The girl's legs tremble from lack of chakra, and she shakes her head. Arms part and then cross. Kat slowly walks backwards with a sight. The girl then turns to face Zetsumo and peers up at him blankly, still sweating.

"How's that....?" she inquires.* - Tue Sep 15 18:53:52 2015
