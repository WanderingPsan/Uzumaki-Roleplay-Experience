<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: But trouble is exciting is it not? - Thu Oct 22 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: We were bandits, until Zetsumo lost his mind. - Thu Oct 22 23:16:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Oh~? Did you maybe have a crush on your commanding officer at some point Katsune? - Thu Oct 22 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander to and fro a bit awkwardly. Her cheeks turn pink.

Abruptly when teased, Kat picks up her right foot and attempts to ram it down on Index's left foot's toes. She does so with force, aiming her heel in specific at him.

Her boots are of a unique variety that allow flexibility and stealth. They're not heels or anything. She's a ninja after all.

Either way, it'll probably still hurt.* - Thu Oct 22 23:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.

She avoids eye contact.* - Thu Oct 22 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Man but isn't that a surprise. - Thu Oct 22 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Actually quite girly, it was unexpected. - Thu Oct 22 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: . . . - Thu Oct 22 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's blush becomes more pronounced.

Silently she draws in a deep breath through the nose.

Ultimately though she decides to say nothing, and not kick him a second time either.* - Thu Oct 22 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Would you prefer if I drop the subject~? - Thu Oct 22 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: There is no subject. - Thu Oct 22 23:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: What do you wanna Do Princess-Katsune? - Thu Oct 22 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I dunno. - Thu Oct 22 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm fine just lying around but since you probably won't get to be here for long.... - Thu Oct 22 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I'll be here for a while. - Thu Oct 22 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Don't worry about that. - Thu Oct 22 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I'll be able to harasss you for a while longer. - Thu Oct 22 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: So you have your choice of where you'd like to relax at. - Thu Oct 22 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I guess you're afraid to suggest hot springs, since I said no before. - Thu Oct 22 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Not afraid, I just realised, I was going at getting to know you the wrong way. - Thu Oct 22 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'll admit. . . - Thu Oct 22 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: There's not much to get to know on either side. We already know everything about each other, right? - Thu Oct 22 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Everything we're both willing to tell. - Thu Oct 22 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: But I'm still a stranger, Aren't I? - Thu Oct 22 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah. You hide things. - Thu Oct 22 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: If you ask the right questions, I won't lie to you. - Thu Oct 22 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: That's the one thing I will never do. - Thu Oct 22 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: So. - Thu Oct 22 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: If I asked if you want to head to a Hot sorings would you say yes? - Thu Oct 22 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I....guess, we could do that. Yeah. - Thu Oct 22 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Well, If you don't want to, I could take you to dinner, and we can talk more about your crush. - Thu Oct 22 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hmmm. - Fri Oct 23 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I think we're past dinner. Let's do the hot springs. - Fri Oct 23 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Sounds good, Lead the way. - Fri Oct 23 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and wanders off.* - Fri Oct 23 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leads the way to the hot springs she and Index had used in the past, presumably. He'd said hot springs after all rather than "spa." She'd gone home first, too, to change clothes.

At this time she stares ahead at the water with arms behind her back. For the moment she's wearing her yukata rather than her usual body suit, for the sake of convenience.

Eventually though, with a glance over at Index, she begins stripping. This is done with very litte movement needed, as she needs only to untie a sash. Her yukata is left at her side afterwords.

With that done, Kat begins walking forwards. She's wearing a two-pieced bikini. It's dark purple in color, and not overly modest.

With a foot she prods at the water as she'd done the last time they were here.* - Fri Oct 23 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She never looks at his chest, simply because she wouldn't want him to get the wrong idea. As such she doesn't notice his tattoo at this time.

Eventually though she dips her foot the rest of the way in. After giving herself time to get used to the heat on her foot, she gently pushes herself the rest of the way in.

Within several seconds' time, she's setting herself down on her butt. Palms rest on the rocky bed of the spring at either side of her and legs are stretched out side-by-side for the moment. Said legs rub back and forth against each other, briefly.* - Fri Oct 23 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Carefully she leans backwards at some point to dip her hair in. She wants it entirely wet since it is wet already up to her shoulders. Do to the heat, her breathing's a bit labored for the brief moment.

The teen clears her throat once she's done and scoots a bit closer to Index in the mean time. She leaves herself only an inch or so away from him.* - Fri Oct 23 00:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's planning on making that sort of freedom impossible. - Fri Oct 23 02:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If there's peace, then what value do we have? - Fri Oct 23 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's so limited...Isn't it? - Fri Oct 23 02:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Sure." she says.

The teen then pulls her legs close and rises to her feet; slowly so as not to splash water anywhere.

Even as she stands up, she's making the water on her body weightless to dry herself off. At a lazy pace she then steps out of said water and begins making her way over to her clothes.* - Fri Oct 23 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods as she puts her yukata on. Eventually she's dressed.

With that out of the way she makes her way over to Index's side and places her palm on his arm.

In short, she dries him off too.* - Fri Oct 23 03:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I feel like Mud Silhouette is better but I suspect if I taught you that you'd think I was cheating you. - Fri Oct 23 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. Tonight, I'll teach you Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot. - Fri Oct 23 03:08:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and begins walking away, to the west.* - Fri Oct 23 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) was also kidding.

Her yukata isn't that short.* - Fri Oct 23 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gets dressed. Afterwords she'd lead the way out of her house, only to stop nearby. They can of course take care of these lessons right beside the house.

For the brief moment her left hand rests on her hip. Her right thumb's part of her gauntlet rests inbetween her teeth and she chews on it. Eyes wander.* - Fri Oct 23 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Earth and Stone Bamboo shoot is perfect for killing people from a distance. - Fri Oct 23 03:14:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I prefer focusing on survival above all else, but I'll let you choose. - Fri Oct 23 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot can only be used while you're on the ground. - Fri Oct 23 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't see myself taking flight anytime soon. - Fri Oct 23 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Say you're indoors, though. - Fri Oct 23 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's useless then. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or if you're on water. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm...That's true. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Rare situations but they exist either way. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Silhouette it is. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are you sure? I'm not trying to talk you into it. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I just genuinely think it's better. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's one of my favorites. - Fri Oct 23 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way you can learn the other tommorrow. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah.. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords her arms rise and hands meet to form the snake seal.

"Alright." she says.

"For starters you use the snake seal."

She glances over at him to see whether or not he's watching. If not, she'll simply assume he already knows how to make the snake seal.

Afterwords, Kat pours her chakra forwards. Abruptly, hundreds of spores of mud appear in the air at her feet. Almost instantaneously, it forms a river. All of the mud races forth in the form of a river. It rams loudly into the ground over and over again, and the sound is reminiscent of that of a waterfall repeatedly ramming into its associated body of water.

The range is extreme. It travels so far that one might wonder where the end might be, because it's nowhere in sight. Over all, Kat performs this technique several times. She shows Index that the range can be adjusted easily and also more than once uses the justsu very slowly so he can see the process.

It starts out as little sports of hovering mud before it eventually forms a river.

In other words, there is no need for pre-existing mud.

With a silent sigh, Kat's hands eventually part. Hands find her hips and she turns to face Index. "Alright." she says.

"Now you try."* - Fri Oct 23 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Kat, Thanks. - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I think I'm going to head to sleep...It's been a...'exciting'...Day. - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good night. - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Looking forward to it tomorrow. - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is a bit tense for a brief moment. When she realizes where his lips are aimed, though, she relaxes a bit. Her cheeks, however, turn pink.

Eyes are averted. Eventually she nods and turns to walk away -- mostly to hide her blush.

"Anyway." she says.

"Training to do. And stuff."

Arms are behind her back for the moment.* - Fri Oct 23 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmmm. - Fri Oct 23 03:40:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Katsune are you busy? - Fri Oct 23 03:58:56 2015

"'Kay." she says.

She then turns on her heel to follow.* - Fri Oct 23 04:01:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this in a polite manner. Hands are on her hips for the moment, and she's staring.* - Fri Oct 23 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I wish to pursue a relationship with you and I want to know if you are in one - Fri Oct 23 04:07:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods once more and begins walking. Arms meet behind her back as she does so. Eyes are averted.* - Fri Oct 23 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Kay. - Fri Oct 23 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's go finish your lessons, Trilliam. - Fri Oct 23 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: okay. - Fri Oct 23 04:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Fri Oct 23 04:12:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands rest on her hips.

With a blank expression on her face she watches Trilliam expectantly.* - Fri Oct 23 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) spends a few hours helping Trilliam through the last few struggles he has with the technique.

Eventually they're done.

With a nod she says "Alright. Good. That's my jutsu."* - Fri Oct 23 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. It is just a D rank. - Fri Oct 23 04:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something to think about, right? - Fri Oct 23 04:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) can presumably see the chaos from a long distance away. Smoke flying up into the air and such. As a result, she summons up an earth shadow clone and has it henge into her chuunin vest as always. With that done, she puts the clone vest on and stores her real vest away.

The reason for this? Who knows.

Now that she's dressed as she prefers, Kat flies into the area. She hovers fourty feet above the ground and with her exceptional eyes, she does her best to figure out what's going on.

Her senses are locked onto the smoke and such below.* - Fri Oct 23 18:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the tiger seal. The girl then disappears in a puff of smoke. Yes, in mid-air she uses the shunshin jutsu.

When Kat reappears she's standing at Hassan's side.

She'd rather be in the air for as little time as possible. That way, people may not realize she was flying.* - Fri Oct 23 18:43:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: ......... - Fri Oct 23 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) places a hand on Susumu's collar. Abruptly she pours an awful lot of earth release chakra into his body to make him weightless.

With that done she pulls him close to her chest, leaving him facing the opposite direction. The teen's left palm finds his mouth and she'd hold it shut, making use even of the suimen technique to make sure it's held firm.

And with these preparations made she turns and begins walking away with him in tow.* - Fri Oct 23 18:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops in the sand and slides her right foot backwards through it. Kat's body turns and for a brief moment...one could be -sure- that Kat fully intends to launch her prey into the wall.

Eventually though, the teen manages to control her anger. Slowly she draws in a silent and very deep breath.

Kat stands straight, and sets Susumu down on the ground. She leaves the boy facing her and standing up on his feet.

Her left hand remains on his collar and her right, gauntlet-covered hand is clenched into a tight fist.

Katsune's expression is very cold when she says, while maintaining eye contact, "I want to know. . . -exactly- what you did to that little girl with your jutsu before we get started."* - Fri Oct 23 19:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is facing the south. Her eyes are cold though no one can see her face. Her arms are crossed and her weight is shifted.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has stuck Susumu into the wall, having him suspended by his upper arms and stuck from the lower back down in rocky hard earth.

Her expression is cold and she's staring with arms crossed and weight shifted a bit.

"Anyway. Details. Tell me everything."* - Fri Oct 23 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct 23 19:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) removes her chuunin vest. Katsune holds it off to the side in one hand. Abruptly in a puff of smoke, the vest reveals itself to actually be an identical clone of her. It's an earth shadow clone, and had been the entire time.

For tactical reasons, it'd been henged into a vest.

At this time the clone walks up to Susumu and places a fist against the side of his head.

"One wrong move and it'll blow your brains out." Kat informs.

Afterwords she turns on her heel and begins walking away.

"I'll leave you waiting for twenty minutes at most." she says.* - Fri Oct 23 19:17:58 2015
