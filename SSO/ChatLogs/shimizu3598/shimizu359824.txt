<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Show me your panties~? - Sat Oct  3 21:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: I had to make the mood serious to embarrass her. - Sat Oct  3 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) absent-mindedly throws a kunai at the back of his head, hilt-first.

"Anyway." she says.

"I really do hope you do come back."* - Sat Oct  3 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You're the only fun person I have to talk to right now. - Sat Oct  3 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . - Sat Oct  3 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) reaches up to pour soup into her mouth afterwords. Eyes wander, and her expression becomes a bit sour.

If she said that, she must've drank too much sake.* - Sat Oct  3 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shrugs and bumps fists with him. She has gauntlets, and senses are focused on his hand, so she's comfortable enough doing so.* - Sat Oct  3 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: See you. . . - Sat Oct  3 21:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Did who? - Sat Oct  3 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: ...Did they 'happen'. - Sat Oct  3 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Yes. - Sat Oct  3 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) face palms a bit by reflex in response to some things said in her whispered conversation. She does her best to hide it, by subtly rubbing at her nose. Her eyes are closed a bit.* - Sat Oct  3 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Anyway, Yeah . . . We gotta talk. - Sat Oct  3 22:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: So, You remember Hideki right? - Sat Oct  3 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yes. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Well . . . He really wants us dead now. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: I -almost- died. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Why? Erebus? - Sat Oct  3 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Stay quiet. Someone may come by. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Alright, Not because of Erebus. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: He still seeks to avenge Orakuru. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: He wants you dead . . . A lot. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: . . . - Sat Oct  3 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) stares into space at the ground, with eyes going out of focus to prove as much. A slow, silent, and subtle breath is drawn in through the nose. Eyes wander.

"Should've known." she says.

"Assumed Ushinawa...should've known he was too intelligent for that."* - Sat Oct  3 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Erebus warned me. Said it was a relative of Orakuru's. - Sat Oct  3 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Ushinawa is dead . . . Died in Kumogakure mansion. - Sat Oct  3 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Mariana is dead . . . Died in the hospital. - Sat Oct  3 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Did Hideki's eyes ever turn red? - Sat Oct  3 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: I did not see if they were red . . . They were normal. - Sat Oct  3 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: He has that snake form though and a snake that can bind your movement. - Sat Oct  3 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Anyway . . . There are still two of Ushinawa's relatives total now . . . Misa and Hideki - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Annoying. To dare....swear to avenge Orakuru. To dare...when he knew a long time ago that I was the one that killed him. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I said it in front of him tons of times/ - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: He must be dumber than I always assumed. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: He probably didn't remember if he had to capture me just to find out. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Easy prey. Much easier than Ushinawa. I'm not worried. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: We'll kill him. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: No. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'll...beat him nearly to death. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Then let him live. - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: That'll show him I'm not a bad person..... - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: And then he'll owe us. - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: He's fast though . . . With that snake form on . . . - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: But I bet you're faster. - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hey. . . - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander over to Kilm's. She stares, with a fairly blank expression on her face. Only a very, very faint frown is there.* - Sat Oct  3 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Alright alright . . . You're way faster. - Sat Oct  3 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: . . . I bet he doesn't use shunshin that much and has side-effects. - Sat Oct  3 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. With that, she turns on her heel and makes her way over to the boy. She stands in front of him, and stares up at him.

...And then she realizes something. Kilm's way too tall. Annoyingly tall.

A hand reaches up to rest on his shoulder, and "Keiko" aims to gently pull him down into a kneeling position, not willing to ask for permission.* - Sat Oct  3 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) thinks: She's going to explode my face again. - Sat Oct  3 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) thinks: I'll take it like a man. - Sat Oct  3 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) thinks: It won't hurt that much I bet. - Sat Oct  3 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. With that, her right palm finds Kilm's chin. Katsune then leans forwards. At a lazy pace, she plants her lips to his. Eyes wander off, and she turns her head. The teen's mouth opens, and she aims to even go so far as to slip her own tongue into his mouth.

With a fairly blank look in her eyes, she aims to kiss him. A very long, passionate kiss.

Eyes close at some point, should she have been successful in this.

Her mouth tastes very strongly of sake.* - Sat Oct  3 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) thinks: Wh-Wh-Wh. . . I can't think. - Sat Oct  3 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) holds the kiss for an entire thirty seconds or so. An enormous amount of time. She doesn't shy away from anything either. Her tongue wrestles and massages at his, and she takes breaths occasionally through the nose.

Eventually, though, with a bit of suckling, she gently pulls away with a very subtle and quiet gasp.

Eyes then lock onto Kilm's. Her palm remains where it is.

Her expression's still pretty blank. Not doey or anything silly or theatrical. A serious, I-mean-business look. The one she often carries, ever since, ya know....being raped, beaten, having to kill her lover. Ya know, all of that.* - Sat Oct  3 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to slowly look Kilm up and down. Her expression is serious, yes. Sincere. There's also an apologetic undertone to it, though. Sympathy is apparent.

"Look..." she says, quietly.

"We can't...be a couple." Eye contact is made and maintained as she gets to that last part.

"Ever. But, you've been way too loyal for me to be as mean as I was before." She takes a brief, subtle, and silent breath through the nose. One visibly marked by her chest.

"So, I'm sorry. Okay?"* - Sat Oct  3 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Why? - Sat Oct  3 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Why to the couple part? - Sat Oct  3 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Sat Oct  3 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: We're not a good match, Kilm. - Sat Oct  3 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You don't make things exciting for me. - Sat Oct  3 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: You're breaking my heart . . . And yet I was about to offer something that could've been exciting . . . Something that came to mind. - Sat Oct  3 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: And the offer will still stand. - Sat Oct  3 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's palm comes back to her side, and both arms meet behind her back. The teen's left arm is held with her right hand, and she takes a step or two backwards. She stares over at him, listening to what he says.

She shakes her head. "If it's something romantic...don't want to. We wouldn't make a good couple. It's always been that way."* - Sat Oct  3 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: A new organization . . . Filled with friends and allies . . . And we do what we think is right as that organization . . . A neutral one. - Sat Oct  3 22:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: As for what you said . . . You never know unless you try something . . . Though if you don't want to try to be a couple then I understand since i've given an impression of me being incredibly boring. - Sat Oct  3 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Either way, I'll be doing what I think will be cool. - Sat Oct  3 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Thanks for the kiss though. - Sat Oct  3 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. She gulps, and takes another breath. Katsune waits for a very long time to respond. She takes a fair amount of time to consider his proposal, and it shows.

Eventually though she shakes her head, and makes eye contact again.

"Not what I need, Kilm." she says.
"I need blood. And death. I -need-. . .those things."

Her eyes are a bit cold...snake-like, like a predator's, when she says her last few words.* - Sat Oct  3 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: And you'll be able to get lots of that. - Sat Oct  3 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: It's not like people won't attack us. - Sat Oct  3 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: If they get in our way then we'll just kill them . . . Their own fault for trying to pick on us . . . - Sat Oct  3 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Heck . . . I know we'll have to start some fights ourselves and kill people. - Sat Oct  3 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head.

"We can keep in touch. I can maybe help sometimes. But that isn't for me."* - Sat Oct  3 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: You really want to kill things? - Sat Oct  3 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: It's complicated. - Sat Oct  3 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Don't expect you to understand. - Sat Oct  3 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sat Oct  3 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: We can't be a couple . . . But we can still be best friends. - Sat Oct  3 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. We can be. - Sat Oct  3 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Might even be in the same village pretty often. - Sat Oct  3 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct  3 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: I think we should switch the topic now. - Sat Oct  3 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. She walks over to return to his side, and faces the north.* - Sat Oct  3 22:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Will we pursue Hideki or wait for him again? - Sat Oct  3 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: I doubt he's coming back. - Sat Oct  3 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: I wouldn't mind going to him . . . I have a score to settle now. - Sat Oct  3 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I need. . . - Sat Oct  3 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: To make contact with him. Need to meet him. Just once. - Sat Oct  3 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: For questions? - Sat Oct  3 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I need. . .to see what his chakra feels like. That way, he can never...ever sneak up on me. - Sat Oct  3 22:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Sat Oct  3 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I can sense chakra now. Been training it. - Sat Oct  3 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Sunagakure is on the lookout for him now though. - Sat Oct  3 22:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Either way, If i see him first, He's as good as dead. - Sat Oct  3 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: I also want you to do something. - Sat Oct  3 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hmm? Do what? - Sat Oct  3 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Believe in me . . . Believe in me that I can accomplish anything . . . It'll give me some confidence when i'll start doing major things. - Sat Oct  3 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: If you could do that . . . That'd be great. - Sat Oct  3 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Also . . . If you ever reconsider about -everything- you said . . . You know that you can tell me . . . Doesn't mean i'll think about it . . . I can't let it stop me from progressing right now. - Sat Oct  3 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Mmm.... - Sat Oct  3 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Not gonna happen. No really. - Sat Oct  3 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Not gonna happen. - Sat Oct  3 23:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: Which one? - Sat Oct  3 23:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I can feel your chakra. - Sat Oct  3 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: It's pretty distinctive. - Sat Oct  3 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Sat Oct  3 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Probably. - Sat Oct  3 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Just know....as it turns out. These disguises aren't perfect. - Sat Oct  3 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: .... - Sat Oct  3 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) sighs. A shrug follows.

"Just...don't get interrogated. Your choice though."* - Sat Oct  3 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct  3 23:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. She turns to wander off.* - Sat Oct  3 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be in Konoha . . . Probably. - Sat Oct  3 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) turns and walks away immediately as the sight of Baen.

She does so fairly discreetly, and since he's facing the east and this is a city with thousands of people...lots of people walking by. Well, he's not gonna notice unless he can sense her and knows her chakra's feel.* - Sat Oct  3 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Eberus---(W.e df his name is), He's....Dead. - Sat Oct  3 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) comes to an abrupt stop at the sound of something Seisuke says. Eyes go out of focus.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: The...Knight...ripped him to shreds...In about...Five seconds. - Sat Oct  3 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: His body...was mush. - Sat Oct  3 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Thank God. - Sat Oct  3 23:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hi. - Sat Oct  3 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I've never seen...A body riddled with so many holes. - Sat Oct  3 23:20:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I'm sure. - Sat Oct  3 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Did you watch his body...make sure it wasn't getting up? Ever? - Sat Oct  3 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hole through the brain? - Sat Oct  3 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: It wasn't even a body. - Sat Oct  3 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: It was a pile of mush. - Sat Oct  3 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Huh. - Sat Oct  3 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) senses Zenaki. She takes a few steps to the west in response before turning to face Seisuke. Eyes are averted, and her arms cross.* - Sat Oct  3 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I guess....hm. - Sat Oct  3 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Well. - Sat Oct  3 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: That means...only one person wants me dead. Can only be one. Surely Erebus was bluffing when he mentioned others. - Sat Oct  3 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I.... - Sat Oct  3 23:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I need a drink. - Sat Oct  3 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: That wasn't Human... - Sat Oct  3 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Did you back out of the fight? - Sat Oct  3 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Definately, I value my life. - Sat Oct  3 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah. Wow. Someone that can kill Erebus. - Sat Oct  3 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: He made Edge look as useful as Kilm... - Sat Oct  3 23:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I know who's hunting me. Boy named Hideki. - Sat Oct  3 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: He's no threat. - Sat Oct  3 23:27:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: S'up. - Sat Oct  3 23:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What's happening here? - Sat Oct  3 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Hideki.. - Sat Oct  3 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'll want to meet him so I can get a feel for his chakra. Make sure that way that he can't sneak up on me. - Sat Oct  3 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You know... - Sat Oct  3 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Someone came here and tried to kill someone earlier but failed. - Sat Oct  3 23:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. . .Who was trying to be killed? - Sat Oct  3 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Err. Who was he trying to kill, rather. - Sat Oct  3 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Them fighting behind me, is annoying. - Sat Oct  3 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Guess we can go somewhere. - Sat Oct  3 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Unless you're planning on fighting. - Sat Oct  3 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I'd appreciate it, But if you have business I can wait. - Sat Oct  3 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: If I fought, I'd be aiming to kill. - Sat Oct  3 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hope Taiga's alright but there are tons of people here. He'll be fine. - Sat Oct  3 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: . . .Huh. - Sat Oct  3 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Shall we go? - Sat Oct  3 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Sure. - Sat Oct  3 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) turns to follow him.* - Sat Oct  3 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Remind me.... - Sat Oct  3 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Remind me. . . - Sat Oct  3 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm? - Sat Oct  3 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: To free Zenaki now that Erebus is dead. - Sat Oct  3 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll let Fujitora live if I can, since he has a daughter....but. - Sat Oct  3 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: We'll see. - Sat Oct  3 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) removes her gauntlets and places them in the bin as well.

And of course, now Seisuke knows they were weapons.

Once at the couch she sits at his side with arms crossed and one leg crossed over the other.* - Sat Oct  3 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit in response to this. It's a slightly cheeky smile.

"Nope." she says, nearly cooing the word.* - Sat Oct  3 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's smile fades away. Eyes wander, and she scratches her cheek. "Yeah...shouldn't have said yes to that." she says.

She draws in a silent, deep breath and then sighs through the nose.* - Sat Oct  3 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shrugs, knowing full well she also agreed to consequences if she didn't obey the other rules. She hesitates for even longer. Eventually though, she rises to her feet. Both arms meet behind her back, and she walks over to where she's in front of Seisuke and facing the southeast. Eyes wander.

Eventually, though, with another sigh, she sits down. Her butt is planted on his right leg, and she pulls her legs up. Both are left lying on the couch. Arms cross once more and one leg folds over the other.

"Never said. . ." she says.

"'Lap' couldn't mean...leg. . ."

She emphasizes 'leg' a bit.* - Sat Oct  3 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Rude.... - Sat Oct  3 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says the word in a facetious tone.* - Sat Oct  3 23:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eyes the cup for a brief moment as, by reflex, her hand reaches up for it. She pauses before said hand makes contact with it. Eventually though she shrugs, taking it, and reaches up to pour some of it into her own mouth.

Today's a very good day after all. Naturally she'll be less tense than usual. Erebus's death is cause for celebration.

Assuming this is a glass like before, she drinks a mouth-full, albeit at a slow and steady pace. There are a few gulps.

Afterwords she hands it back to him.* - Sun Oct  4 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances over at him. For a moment she considers what he said. With a shrug, she eventually wiggles into a more comfortable position, turning her back to him a bit.

"You're right." she explains.
"It's not."* - Sun Oct  4 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods, leaning back. She doesn't comment on his fear of the knight.* - Sun Oct  4 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Wish I 'had' been allowed to watch. - Sun Oct  4 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) silently and subtly sighs at the sight of the glass, fully aware she shouldn't drink too much. Eventually though she reaches up to take it and sip some of it once more, so as not to be rude.

Of course, considering there was time for Seisuke to travel to the land of Iron and come back...it's likely been a full day since they were last here, if not more.* - Sun Oct  4 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "Want to do the private and seargent exams eventually, but no...not yet." She passes the glass back.* - Sun Oct  4 00:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. "That'd be nice. If you're a private, you know how strong I need to be...among other things."* - Sun Oct  4 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: First, do you know which exam you'd like to take~? - Sun Oct  4 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: From what I heard before...a long time ago.... - Sun Oct  4 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: There's a combat exam, and a written exam. That's all I know. - Sun Oct  4 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Yeah. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Written is probably a lot easier, in terms of survival. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I mean...if you have a cheat sheet for me.... - Sun Oct  4 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: They change the questions each test. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Thought so. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And the written exam, isn't exactly, 'written'. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's a Verbal Exam. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I seeee. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: The last Private, had to face about One hundred and Eighty Shinobi. - Sun Oct  4 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: In a battle Royale - Sun Oct  4 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Probably not for me then. - Sun Oct  4 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not going for Hokage anymore anyway. - Sun Oct  4 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm? Gave up? - Sun Oct  4 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Everyone always told me...about how all of the villages were nightmares equally. - Sun Oct  4 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: But...running from Erebus, I had time to see the world myself. - Sun Oct  4 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: They might not be perfect....but it's doable, I think. Haven't seen much of them but. .  - Sun Oct  4 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll at least....take some time to be sure, first. - Sun Oct  4 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Plus...I'm not strong enough to be a kage. I always knew that. - Sun Oct  4 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So you'll get stronger before trying? - Sun Oct  4 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Only said yes to Erebus because I needed to make sure...he had no reason to kill me. - Sun Oct  4 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: And...yes. I'll at least... - Sun Oct  4 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Get a lot stronger first. - Sun Oct  4 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's reasonable. - Sun Oct  4 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'm rooting for you. - Sun Oct  4 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Strong enough that I never have to run away when someone shows up. - Sun Oct  4 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That'd be embarrassing. - Sun Oct  4 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll get some pom-poms, and cheer you on. - Sun Oct  4 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Give me a K. - Sun Oct  4 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Give me an A~ - Sun Oct  4 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y'know. - Sun Oct  4 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) reaches over to pick the cup they'd used for sake up. She holds it by the cup part, and reaches over to lazily stuff the stool of it into Seisuke's mouth, absent-mindedly....

To shut him up.

Her eyes are averted as she does so.* - Sun Oct  4 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's right eyebrow twitches. A faint, cheeky smile is produced. The girl pushes the cup further in. Her eyes find his throat, and she tries to choke him on it.

Like, to death.

Fairly aggressively.

She holds little back. Relatively gentle or not, it's still his throat.* - Sun Oct  4 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) stops, abruptly. Eyes wander off. Her smile fades for the most part, and she slowly pulls the cup back out. She holds it off to the side.* - Sun Oct  4 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) puts the cup back down. She says nothing.* - Sun Oct  4 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Katsune... - Sun Oct  4 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Sun Oct  4 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I think I need another drink. - Sun Oct  4 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. She pulls herself off of him and sits at his side. Palms rest at either side of her on the couch, and one leg crosses over the other.* - Sun Oct  4 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Oct  4 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: III.... - Sun Oct  4 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Played a bit too rough. I guess. - Sun Oct  4 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: My bad. - Sun Oct  4 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's smile becomes an apologetic one of shame. Eyes wander off, and she scratches her cheek.* - Sun Oct  4 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. For clarification she wasn't quite 'that' forceful; it';s more the fact she actually tried to shove something down his throat, and that being an extremely dangerous activity, that should be cause for alarm.

She allows him to pull her close, her body lying limp as he does so.* - Sun Oct  4 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. She wiggles into a more comfortable position at his side to ensure that she's okay, with a gulp. Eyes stay downcast, and she clears her throat for a brief moment, subtly.

She says nothing.

Once more, she scratches her cheek. This time, the left cheek.* - Sun Oct  4 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Oct  4 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: M-mm.... - Sun Oct  4 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I suppose you really liked my cheering so much you need a part two. - Sun Oct  4 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Oct  4 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) reaches forwards with her right foot, aiming a kick for his right chin.

"No..." she says, smiling a bit. Eyes remain averted.

"I'm talking. Stop before I aim for the nuts."* - Sun Oct  4 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's right palm finds her own chin and she rubs at it. A tongue is stuffed in her cheek. "If. . ." she begins.

"I had my gauntlets. . ."* - Sun Oct  4 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances down at him. "Hmph." she scoffs quietly, to herself.

Normally she'd never let him rest his head there no matter what...but, she did try to choke him. And so, she lets him.

"Not gonna humor that question with a response." she says. Palms rest at either side of her.

Legs swing back and forth below, lazily.* - Sun Oct  4 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) reaches down to place her left hand on his forehead, absent-mindedly, with eyes still averted.

Gently, she pushes his head away so that he's facing the opposite directon.

"Mhmm..." she says through clenched teeth.* - Sun Oct  4 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: What do you mean....? - Sun Oct  4 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances down at him. She keeps his head facing away, just to bother him.* - Sun Oct  4 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) || She's not teasing, either.

She enjoys his pain.* - Sun Oct  4 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sun Oct  4 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. "I should." she says, with eyes wandering. Her smile fades into a neutral expression, and she releases Seisuke's head.

"I will....soon. Gonna have to dye my hair and stuff so...it'll be like, tommorrow. But yeah. I'll be me again."* - Sun Oct  4 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) lifts both arms. Hands meet to form the tiger seal, and Keiko's henge disipates with a puff of white smoke coming from her face.

The girl is left with her own real features. Of course, that includes curves too.

A shrug follows. She opts 'not' to remove her contacts in front of him, as that'd be pretty disgusting.* - Sun Oct  4 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sun Oct  4 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Flexibility. I can kick people without them being able to look up a skirt. - Sun Oct  4 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I wear the skirt over it for a reason. - Sun Oct  4 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: It's not revealing...I think? - Sun Oct  4 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm. - Sun Oct  4 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I feel like if they got the upskirt shot, with the kick they'd be content with dying. - Sun Oct  4 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: *nod* - Sun Oct  4 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) puts her hand on Seisuke's forehead and once more pushes his head away to face the opposite direction. This time, she's a tiny bit less gentle.* - Sun Oct  4 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) is still in her usual outfit though probably, for the record. The Keiko outfit....which, she should maybe consider wearing for the rest of forever honestly.

"Yes it is." she says.

She removes her hand.* - Sun Oct  4 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sun Oct  4 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander as she considers this question, honestly trying to remember. Eventually though she shakes her head.

"Nope." she says.
"Never."* - Sun Oct  4 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. . . - Sun Oct  4 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Up for a Swim? - Sun Oct  4 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mmmm..... - Sun Oct  4 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Not a fan of swimming.... - Sun Oct  4 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Really~? I would've pegged you as a world class swimmer but that's fine. - Sun Oct  4 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I've swam miles at a time honestly. - Sun Oct  4 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: 'Was paranoid so. . . - Sun Oct  4 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: For the past month or so... - Sun Oct  4 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I swam underground with a jutsu for miles.... - Sun Oct  4 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Everywhere I went. - Sun Oct  4 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances over at him in response to his request. With a shrug, she then lazily crawls over to him. Her butt is planted square on his lap, and she wiggles into place.

She faces the south, and arms cross. Her expression's fairly blank.

"Yeah....Kilm taught it to me. I've gotten better at it than him apparently. He tires out a lot faster than I do, with it."* - Sun Oct  4 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Sun Oct  4 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Got any affinity for earth? - Sun Oct  4 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's legs swing back and forth below, lazily.

She doesn't react to the gasping.* - Sun Oct  4 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sun Oct  4 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Lightning? - Sun Oct  4 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances over her shoulder at him, not quite sure why he's stuttering.* - Sun Oct  4 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Might have to teach you something some day. Soon, maybe. - Sun Oct  4 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Probably spent money to hide me and Kilm, right? - Sun Oct  4 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink as well once she realizes why he's blushing. One leg crosses over the other, and her legs stop swinging.* - Sun Oct  4 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Y-Yeah, But it's fine. - Sun Oct  4 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. She clears her throat a bit in the mean time, subtly.* - Sun Oct  4 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Earth...lightning...and explosion. Last one's a secret. - Sun Oct  4 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Explosion...? A Advanced Element? - Sun Oct  4 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) doesn't budge. She doesn't even stretch.

She remains perfectly still.

"Yeah. . ." she says.* - Sun Oct  4 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods.

Of course, she'd only actually told him about the element as a sign of trust.
Her legs pick up just once, and then fall down. Eyes wander a bit awkwardly.

She, too, scratches her cheek.* - Sun Oct  4 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Good at a lot of things. . ." she says.

"But yes....basically yes." Arms uncross and stretch out before her as she speaks, with palms meeting as they do so. Legs stretch a bit as well. Afterwords she wiggles off to the side a bit, scooting over to his right leg.

Once there she faces the southeast, with hair still hiding her face for the most part and her head turned away.

She leans in close, so as to appear comfortable.* - Sun Oct  4 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Raikage, huh? - Sun Oct  4 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm told me about him. Said he beat him once when they were younger. - Sun Oct  4 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Gotta wonder how I compare if that's true. - Sun Oct  4 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Actually I think he said that was recent. - Sun Oct  4 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I doubt Kilm beat him. - Sun Oct  4 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's blush eventually fades away. She keeps eyes averted, and silently takes a breath.* - Sun Oct  4 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Doubt he'd lie to me. - Sun Oct  4 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Not recently at least. - Sun Oct  4 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm...may be dumb. Very dumb. - Sun Oct  4 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: But...he's very strong. - Sun Oct  4 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: 'Course, it's possible Niza held back. - Sun Oct  4 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe. - Sun Oct  4 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I would if I were him. - Sun Oct  4 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I have a gift for you, If you...Want to learn it. - Sun Oct  4 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow and turns her head enough to peer over at him. "Yeah...?" she inquires.* - Sun Oct  4 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: There's a scroll for you. - Sun Oct  4 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eyes the scroll, pretty blankly, while she listens.* - Sun Oct  4 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Never use this technique in front of Kenshin. - Sun Oct  4 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: He'll kill you. - Sun Oct  4 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) tilts her head a bit. She's assuming he's joking about that part at least, though her expression remains relatively neutral, if good-humored.

"And why's that?" she inquires.* - Sun Oct  4 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: This is a still taken from the body of his dead student. - Sun Oct  4 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sun Oct  4 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: He doesn't like when people use his techniques without going through him first. - Sun Oct  4 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So knowing this do you want the scroll? - Sun Oct  4 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Depends. . . - Sun Oct  4 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: What exactly...is it....? - Sun Oct  4 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: On? - Sun Oct  4 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's basically, a speed based Taijutsu attack to simplify. - Sun Oct  4 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Oct  4 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Sun Oct  4 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Speed.... - Sun Oct  4 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Kinda my speciality too. - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. I'd like it. - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Kay. - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: All I want from you. - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Is a Hug. - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: First. - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: *nod* - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) thinks: Will she get flustered?~! - Sun Oct  4 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) rolls her eyes.

The girl then turns in place, pulling her left leg close as she does so. She's left straddling him with both legs sprawled out underneath her form, and each lying against his.

With a nod, she leans forwards and hugs him with little to no hesitation. A slightly goofy smile is on her face, and her head rests on his shoulder for the moment, facing away. She's hugging him around the neck, and fairly snuggly too.

Passing on a technique is serious business. * - Sun Oct  4 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods and releases him, taking the scroll. The girl turns it to and fro with the same smile on her face as she examines it.

Even so...she senses the scroll out, focusing on it for a moment to check for the chakra that's probably stuffed inside any and all fuuinjutsu seals.

Just a precaution.

She's a ninja, so would you really expect her not to. Afterwords she pockets it, seeing as learning this technique will surely take ages anyway.* - Sun Oct  4 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods, with a glance up at him. With that, she then pulls herself away and rises to her feet. Arms meet behind her back. After a moment of consideration she turns on her heel and wanders off towards the door.

She's eager to start getting a feel for the technique.* - Sun Oct  4 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Authority. - Sun Oct  4 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What does 'authority' have to do with it? - Sun Oct  4 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Good question. - Sun Oct  4 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her feet next to Tetsu. Arms are behind her back, and eyes are averted.* - Sun Oct  4 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: And. - Sun Oct  4 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She left without Koeki's permission? - Sun Oct  4 02:47:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, that's not good. - Sun Oct  4 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Even if Koeki is a bad kage. .. A shinobi isn't allowed to leave without permission. - Sun Oct  4 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: My name is and nver was "Ko" or "Keiko" now. Got it? - Sun Oct  4 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers something to him.* - Sun Oct  4 02:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's mouth is very slowly agape. She stares at the back of the redhead's head.* - Sun Oct  4 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh good. - Sun Oct  4 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Alright. Anywho, why in prison, though? - Sun Oct  4 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: We tried to walk in. - Sun Oct  4 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) closes her mouth and looks away. Her cheeks turn a bit pink. It's faint.* - Sun Oct  4 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. I'd let you all out, but I doubt it's within my power. - Sun Oct  4 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Never is...and never was, Ko or Keiko...is what I meant. - Sun Oct  4 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Don't want anyone to know those names. - Sun Oct  4 02:55:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is only whispering though because it's private af. Duh. She aint buddy buddy with nobody.* - Sun Oct  4 02:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well, anyway. . . - Sun Oct  4 02:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) opens her mouth as if to speak. Eventually though, it closes, as if she's changed her mind.

"Well. Sparring can be fun."* - Sun Oct  4 03:13:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls out a hat the second she senses Fujitora. She places it on her head. Cheeks turn a bit pink.

Well. Forgot about 'him.'* - Sun Oct  4 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) hesitates for a moment. Eventually she produces a silent sigh. The teen's right hand reaches up to find her hat, and she lazily removes it. It's tied to the same belt that keeps her coin purse on her person.

A glance is sent Fujitora's way.

"Hey." she says.

A faint, cheeky smile is on her face.

Senses are locked onto him in specific.* - Sun Oct  4 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's head tilts a bit and eye contact is maintained. Lazily, she lets her arms fall to either side of her form. Weight shifts a bit.

"Amegakure?" she inquires.

"Last time I saw you, was Kirigakure."

She ignores Tetsu for now.* - Sun Oct  4 03:25:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was on a bench. He'd been dragging a scythe around. Asked me my sins. - Sun Oct  4 03:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls out travel papers.

They list her as "Hibakusha Keiko".* - Sun Oct  4 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was 'going' to feed all of the kages information. My birds never seemed to make it to Koeki though. - Sun Oct  4 03:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly steps backwards, as casually as Fujitora had stuck his hand out and thus at roughly the same speed.

As she moves, an arm rises. Her fist is clenched, and aimed square at Fujitora.

Her eyes are a bit bright. Dangerously so. Her mouth is very slightly agape for the moment, as if she's about to comment.

It closes, though, as if she thinks better of it. Either way, the body language is clear. "Na. Don't do that."

A faint smile is on her face. A snake's smile.

Of course, she doesn't actually speak.* - Sun Oct  4 03:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) drops the arm, lazily. She keeps both at her sides once more.

"Anyway." she says.

"Erebus probably did give me a reputation with is. . .neurotic nature. If...you want to check me with genjutsu, for honesty...I'll allow it. I'd even tell you...literally anything you like. So long as I'm not bound during the procedure."* - Sun Oct  4 03:43:08 2015

In the same motion she's lifting her arm up and clenching her hand into a fist. It's aimed at the man and she holds it steady.

She'd moved only by reflex though. Fujitora gave her no warning before going in to touch her, and she's aware of course that he's good with fuuinjutsu.
