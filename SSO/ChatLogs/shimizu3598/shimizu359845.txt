<br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- When he wakes up I will. - Fri Oct 23 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It's a loooooooooooooooong story - Fri Oct 23 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't stop walking.

No one's been told they're not allowed to follow her though.* - Fri Oct 23 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yo. Mad, we should spar later. - Fri Oct 23 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Madelyn(BoyVaporeon) says: Why? - Fri Oct 23 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Why not? - Fri Oct 23 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I'm too old for this... - Fri Oct 23 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) releases the binds that hold Susumu. Afterwords, using the Lightweight Rock Technique, Kat picks him up once more. Once more she carries him along, holding his mouth shut with her left hand combined with the Suimen technique.

"Alright." Kat says.

"I've decided to get you healed and wait until I can speak to Saeza before you're punished. In the mean time you can wait in a prison cell. Worst case scenario, it's a meager punishment for having killed a hospital-full of people."

Kat begins walking.* - Fri Oct 23 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You'll be questioned before anything is decided on. - Fri Oct 23 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you did rape Saeza and several witnesses say as much -- she'll be the one to decide your punishment. - Fri Oct 23 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I'm going to go ahead and tell you for mercy's sake. - Fri Oct 23 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you raped her and she wants you dead, I 'will'. . .blow your brains out. - Fri Oct 23 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Fri Oct 23 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: God I WISH I could talk.. - Fri Oct 23 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face Koji upon hearing his footsteps, soft as they may be. They probably echo within the jail. The teen's arms are at her sides when he explains things to her. Eyes are averted when Kat nods.

"Alright." she says.

"Thanks. I'll go talk to Saeza. Was trying to find her actually."

* - Fri Oct 23 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do you know where she is right now? - Fri Oct 23 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Yes, she is actually out in the village. Would you like me to escort you? - Fri Oct 23 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can if you want, or stay here. Makes no difference to me. - Fri Oct 23 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Fri Oct 23 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and begins walking away.* - Fri Oct 23 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Fri Oct 23 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Still can't talk Susumu? - Fri Oct 23 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) thinks: Is this them? - Fri Oct 23 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I found out yor name through Kat, I bet you feel preety bad huh - Fri Oct 23 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It's almost like this entire chain of events was caused by that jutsu of yours - Fri Oct 23 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sees Saeza upon exiting the jail. So, she walks right up to her, having found her even easier than expected.

Kat's walking at a lazy pace. Palms find her hips when she comes to a stop and her weight shifts a bit. Eyes are locked onto her and a neutral expression is on her face.

"Hi." she says.* - Fri Oct 23 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I must admit, I'm pretty impressed by it - Fri Oct 23 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hello. Katsune what is your rank? - Fri Oct 23 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'll be honest - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I worked really hard trying to save you - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Chunin. What matters, though, is that Hassan gave me permission to punish Susumu. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It'd be a shame for you to die - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I asked. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Very well. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I risked my own life to do so - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He implied I can even kill him if I choose to do so. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I intend to if it seems appropriate. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm...I don't believe that his death at your hands would be good enough for him.... - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: He doesn't deserve it.... - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should we speak in private? - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: We should. - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) thinks: That's exactly what we're going to do. - Fri Oct 23 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Afterwords she turns to follow her.

As she moves, her earth clone from before crawls up out of the ground. Kat had been keeping it handy due to it containing half of her chakra. At this time it uses the henge jutsu to turn into a chuunin vest once more.

Kat secures it to her chest as she follows.

It's heavy so she can't exactly sprint right now, but she can certainly walk;* - Fri Oct 23 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's palms rest on her own hips once more, and she maintains eye contact. "Alright." Kat says.

"I'm sorry for digging but I just need to know. Can you tell me exactly what Susumu did to you?"* - Fri Oct 23 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm aware of his abominable abilities. I've told him before not to use them outside of extreme situations. - Fri Oct 23 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: He used a...A spell I guess...It made pink words come out of his mouth.... - Fri Oct 23 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Pink. Not yellow this time. - Fri Oct 23 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: They hit me and then....Well I stripped and....Sort of....Rubbed my...Nethers against his face. - Fri Oct 23 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So. He raped you. - Fri Oct 23 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct 23 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be forced to ask Bryson to confirm this before I do it. But. - Fri Oct 23 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: You don't have to ask him. - Fri Oct 23 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: There's plenty of other witnesses. - Fri Oct 23 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I have a list. - Fri Oct 23 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. I'd like to have that list. - Fri Oct 23 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have to make sure you're telling the truth - Fri Oct 23 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) directs her senses at the scroll to make sure it's not laced with fuuinjutsu. If it is, she'll presumably sense it due to the chakra infused inside.

Eyes are locked onto it too. Eyes that can spot a trap a mile away.

Assuming all is clear, though, Kat takes the scroll in hand. It's held away from her with a Chakra-Flow-enhanced chakra flow gauntlet when she flicks it at the air. Furthermore she pours pure, unadulterated chakra into it to trigger any fuuinjutsu inside.

Afterwords, Kat would open the scroll.

She keeps it facing the opposite direction.

After all of these subtle precautions and only then would Kat turn the scroll towards her own person to look at it.* - Fri Oct 23 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My gut impulse was to blow Susumu's brains out for this. - Fri Oct 23 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But after I calmed down a tiny bit I decided to ask you what should happen to him. - Fri Oct 23 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's the most humane thing to do. - Fri Oct 23 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls the scroll back up with a nod and stuffs it into a pouch on her hip. Eyes are locked onto Saeza then.

"What do you say should happen to him?" she inquires.* - Fri Oct 23 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You implied you want him dead but. . .I need to hear it. Explicitely, from your mouth. - Fri Oct 23 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . . . - Fri Oct 23 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Asteroth the bar tender. - Fri Oct 23 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's....a necromancer? - Fri Oct 23 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Asteroth the Amekage is a Necromancer. Yes. - Fri Oct 23 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thank you for this information. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was going to talk to Hassan about this first to make completely sure he's giving me permission to kill. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: No problem...Don't say I told you though. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now it's twice as important I do. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Mhm... - Fri Oct 23 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'll be in jail for at least twenty four hours probably. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: After that I'll speak to Hassan. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he gives me permission....I'll let you kill him personally. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I approve of that. - Fri Oct 23 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Very well. - Fri Oct 23 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Thank you. - Fri Oct 23 20:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns on her heel to walk away.

"No problem." Kat says.

"I'm not a fan of rapists."* - Fri Oct 23 20:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: \I feel like we're overlooking her state of mind - Fri Oct 23 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: If my suspicions are correct\ - Fri Oct 23 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: She may have tried to burn ddown the hospital after we prevented her from attacking Susumu - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: I don't know...if he was innocent he'd probably speak up. - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: In order to get revenge - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: He can't speak - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: She busted his jaw - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I will talk to him. - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders into the building. As she does so, Kat is pulling out a few cloths she'd prepared. One of them is very long -- long enough to be wrapped around Susumu's entire head.

"Alright." Kat says.

"Susumu's guilty of a few things." she says, staring at Susumu with a cold expression on her face.* - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've confirmed it. - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'd greatly appreciate it Ms. Zenaki. - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I remind everyone here that Hassan gave me permission to punish him personally. - Fri Oct 23 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's my responsibility. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Katsune seems to have returned - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There won't be anymore questioning due to the nature of this case. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not to Susumu at least. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I can't even defend myself, Sad. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: That's true but we shouldn't kill in private.  - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmmm - Fri Oct 23 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I might as well sell my soul now. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Then can I ask you some questions Katsune - Fri Oct 23 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hassan implied I can kill him. However. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He only implied. So. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I intend to ask him one final time. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: However, I believe he should be sentenced to death. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Make it nice and slow, Kat. - Fri Oct 23 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Yes... - Fri Oct 23 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Cause as much pain as possible... - Fri Oct 23 20:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Make an earth pillar...then impale him with it. - Fri Oct 23 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyoko(Emeralia) says: Leave him there until it eventually makes it's way out of his mouth. - Fri Oct 23 20:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Katsune - Fri Oct 23 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: How much information did you gather - Fri Oct 23 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Before deciding his punishment - Fri Oct 23 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Upon seeing Susumu reach into his pocket, Kat places her left, gauntlet-covered fist on the bars.

She watches the gem.

Eye contact is made.

Does Susumu freeze in place, or does he still bring it to his chest?

In the mean time, Kat positions herself more appropriately. Her back is straightened out, and her right arm rests at her side.

Her body language is clear.

This is a stance. A fighting one.* - Fri Oct 23 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm still gathering information. I am a former Hokage. Of course I am responsible. - Fri Oct 23 20:29:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) waits for several full seconds to make sure Susumu isn't doing anything crazy. Afterwords she reaches into her pocket to retrieve the jail cell's key.

With that done, she fits it into the key hole and turns it to open the cell door.

Hand cuffs are aquired from a nearby wall. Now with these things done she walks forwards.

"But first, you're being cuffed and muzzled. Not putting Zenaki or Bryson in danger with you."

Kat looms over him, within four feet of range.

"Stand up." she says.* - Fri Oct 23 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Turn around. - Fri Oct 23 20:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I need to be sure you can't weave handseals. - Fri Oct 23 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) cuffs Susumu's hands to the bars. Each hand to a different bar. Care is taken to ensure that Susumu can't possible weave handseals with two hands.

One-handed seals aren't something Katsune has knowledge of, probably.

Afterwords Kat gently fits a cloth into Susumu's mouth if allowed. Carefully she then ties a sash over it to make absolutely sure it stays in place. She ties it very tightly.

When she's done, the teen rises to her feet. Hands rest on her hips.* - Fri Oct 23 20:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs silently. She kneels down then and reaches up to carefully remove the sash on Susumu's mouth.

Just before doing so she makes eye contact. Her eyes are cold.

"One single word I don't understand, or maybe even one word spoken too quickly for my liking -- speak one, and I'll blow your brains out with my jutsu." she says, knowing full well he knows which jutsu she refers to.

Afterwords his muzzle is removed in full. It's removed gently.* - Fri Oct 23 21:00:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides accross the ground without even moving her limbs, because of her Lightweight Rock Technique.

Her palm is left against Susumu's head in case he gets any ideas. The left side of it specifically.

Either way, she remains kneeling on the ground and has given Fujitora room to approach.* - Fri Oct 23 21:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares back, blankly. Her arms are at the moment crossed and her weight is shifted a bit. She says nothing, because she's waiting for him to speak.* - Fri Oct 23 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryomen(Punkamainia) says: I was wondering if you can train me. - Fri Oct 23 23:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) checks the scroll with her senses first, to see if she can detect fuuinjutsu -- the chakra stored within fuuinjutsu seals.

Afterwords she holds the scroll off to the side with her gauntlet-covered hand and pours doton chakra into it, doubling the strength of the chakra flow weapon.

In the same motion she pours pure, unadulterated chakra into it to trigger any seals there.

Afterwords, Katsune turns the scroll to herself and opens it up.

The teen's holding it far away from her face in the mean time.* - Fri Oct 23 23:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct 23 23:44:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Speak in private? Are you even capable of speech right now? - Fri Oct 23 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then why not "speak" here? - Fri Oct 23 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this in a polite tone rather than a cold one.* - Fri Oct 23 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: I didn't. - Fri Oct 23 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts her scroll away.

Susumu apparently just died right in front of her and that's pretty fucked up so it's pretty hard to not be distracted right now.

Even so, she stares ahead at the fighting to the northeast of her.

The girl has absolutely no idea what's going on at the moment though, so she doesn't act on anything.

For now, she just locks her senses onto the two and takes some time to assess the situation.* - Fri Oct 23 23:50:11 2015
