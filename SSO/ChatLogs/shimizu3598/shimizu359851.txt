<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm gonna go sleep too. - Wed Oct 28 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns around and walks away.* - Wed Oct 28 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually wakes up and after an hour of laziness, finally decides to get up out of bed. She picks up a bottle of sake as she does so and drinks the last few drops.

The girl then licks the bottleneck a bit and wanders into the living room.

She's rubbing the back of her head with the opposite hand as she moves. Her hair's very messy and she's wearing only a T shirt.

Kat has no idea what happened before because she drank too much, so who knows.

Soon, her butt is planted on the couch. Legs end up sprawled out underneath her form. The precious bottle is held inbetween her legs for now, and she stares into space.* - Wed Oct 28 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Brownies. And milk. - Wed Oct 28 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But I doubt we have either of those. - Wed Oct 28 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I can run to the store if you'd like. - Wed Oct 28 11:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) summons up a shadowclone. Lazily she then reaches up to smack it on the butt and send it scurrying along with a blush.

"Na." she says.

"Let her do it."

The clone leaves the house.* - Wed Oct 28 11:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Within twenty long minutes her clone has returned. By then, it's used henge to save the real Katsune's dignity.

After all, if a panty-clad Kat clone is running around in nothing but a T-shit, obviously it'll embarrass the real teenager too.

So, the clone is wearing the usual bodysuit when it hands Katsune a basket-full of warm, baked brownies as well as two cartons of fresh milk.

It'd bought these from a stand somewhere, or something.

With a nod, Kat wills the clone to disipate and so it does so in a puff of smoke.

She then hands Index his own milk and sets the basket between them on the couch while she eats.

There are an awful lot of brownies inside so of course, it's apparent that half of them belong to him. * - Wed Oct 28 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs as she pulls out one of the pastries.

"Killing unbelievably powerful people every other day pays a lot. May as well spend it."


"...On food."

She then stuffs her face -- pretty literally, too.* - Wed Oct 28 11:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "There are more important things for kages to spend money on." she says, speaking from experience.* - Wed Oct 28 12:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up a brownie in her left hand.

Her cheeks are just a tiny bit pink.

Abruptly, and a bit roughly, she'd shove a brownie into Index's mouth.

In the mean time she feeds herself too, albeit at a much lazier and more comfortable pace.* - Wed Oct 28 12:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.

She drinks milk.* - Wed Oct 28 12:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No plans. - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Wait. - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Forgot I had something to tell you. . . - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . . - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm pregnant. - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: omit - Wed Oct 28 12:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sunagakure might be under attack soon. - Wed Oct 28 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: By a man named Edge. - Wed Oct 28 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I keep hearing that name... - Wed Oct 28 12:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is he powerful? Or have a big army? - Wed Oct 28 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something something used to be kazekage I don't care much but I'mma kill the fuck out of 'im. - Wed Oct 28 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. I'm a chuunin. - Wed Oct 28 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't know things. - Wed Oct 28 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They don't tell me things. - Wed Oct 28 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't care to know either. - Wed Oct 28 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just train. Get ready. It's why I told you. - Wed Oct 28 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me? I'm probably gonna keep resting. - Wed Oct 28 12:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But when you pass the private, they'll tell you a lot. - Wed Oct 28 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'll probably do me more good than training right now. - Wed Oct 28 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Wed Oct 28 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In the mean time. . . - Wed Oct 28 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm? - Wed Oct 28 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll probably try to get information on Edge. - Wed Oct 28 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For reasons. - Wed Oct 28 12:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Wed Oct 28 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I happen to like Sunagakure and know nothing about that man. I know of no reason for me to not want him dead. - Wed Oct 28 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I'm gonna do my best to kill him and make sure Sunagakure stays standing. - Wed Oct 28 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's fair enough....Hm.... - Wed Oct 28 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I probably....Should focus on increasing my arsenal. - Wed Oct 28 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The question is how to go about it. - Wed Oct 28 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I should stop being lazy....so I can master jutsus to teach you. - Wed Oct 28 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't blame you for being lazy at times. - Wed Oct 28 12:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If I train non-stop, I burn myself out. - Wed Oct 28 12:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Man. - Wed Oct 28 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I was enjoying slacking a lot. - Wed Oct 28 12:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Wed Oct 28 12:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She scoots closer as well, wiggling a bit in place to do so.

When their hips meet she leans against him.

The girl says nothing though and simply continues stuffing her face in the mean time.* - Wed Oct 28 12:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Other good news too. If Hassan's distracted by Edge, he has no time to be worried about you. - Wed Oct 28 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're safe. I'm pretty sure about that. - Wed Oct 28 12:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Oct 28 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hassan's strong, but no matter how strong you are. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You wanna keep your weapons on hand when enemies are nearby. - Wed Oct 28 13:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Can't let Edge just waltz on in and try to poison our water or something. - Wed Oct 28 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Wed Oct 28 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're shinobi. - Wed Oct 28 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some of us aren't as. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Barbaric and crass as Zetsumo when it comes to war. - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some of us. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are careful. - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Edge may be that type. - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The type to actually use his brain. - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So. We shouldn't take any chances. I agree with Hassan completely. - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There's a reason I like him so much. - Wed Oct 28 13:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That just means he's all the more dangerous. But I understand his reasoning. - Wed Oct 28 13:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I've just realised. - Wed Oct 28 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm techniqually a Genin aren't I? - Wed Oct 28 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Oct 28 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wouldn't worry about it though. - Wed Oct 28 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Well. 'Are' you worried about it? - Wed Oct 28 13:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I asked Hassan to make me a chuunin because I didn't want dick-breath dickhead Yan bossing me around like a pompous dickhead. - Wed Oct 28 13:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did I mention he reminds me of dicks? - Wed Oct 28 13:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyone tries to boss you around. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And it seems uncool. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let me know and I'll go straighten them out. - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That being the case you have no need to worry too much about rank. - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo. - Wed Oct 28 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes a bit when Kilm comes in. She's wearing nothing but a T-shirt and her legs are curled up with feet facing the west. As such, her butt's revealed as much.

In response, with the blush on her cheeks, Kat pulls a pullow over to cover herself up.

"U-um. . ." she murmurs for the brief moment with eyes averted.

"Hi."

Kat doesn't bother to mention that he should've knocked. She suspects Kilm will realize that immediately.* - Wed Oct 28 13:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: My brother. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have one more brother but I do not know where he is. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Doesn't mean you can just bring your entire family to crash here. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's fine. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's my fault. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My clone didn't lock the door behind her. - Wed Oct 28 13:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No it's not fine Kat, At the very least he should've knocked, or even sent some kind of message giving us a head's up. - Wed Oct 28 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I gave her a message earlier that i'd be coming once my brother finishes learning. - Wed Oct 28 13:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I...did invite him. Forgot about that. - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was hours ago. - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So you wanted me to stay in the village until after the attack happens? - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Thought I'd be asleep by the time he showed up. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Wasn't 'actually' gonna talk to him. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I see. - Wed Oct 28 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't know where you can go, But If this ends up being a war, I don't think you're crashing here every battle that occurs on Suna's soil. - Wed Oct 28 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Of course . . . I'll most likely be leaving. - Wed Oct 28 13:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So why are you here? - Wed Oct 28 13:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cause she invited me for now. - Wed Oct 28 13:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I did. - Wed Oct 28 13:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I hope you haven't forgotten what I've told you Index. - Wed Oct 28 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since that's basically the job i've given you. - Wed Oct 28 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sips at her milk, very slowly. Eyes wander a bit awkwardly. A very faint blush is on her cheeks.* - Wed Oct 28 13:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Meanwhile, I will have my own things to do. - Wed Oct 28 13:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ... - Wed Oct 28 13:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) clears her throat. Her milk carton is resting in her lap soon.

"I um. . ." she begins.

"Asked Kilm to keep from going off to train, for now. Until Sunagakure's not threatened anymore."* - Wed Oct 28 13:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm beginning to reconsider it though . . . Since it's beginning to sound like you don't want me here anyway. - Wed Oct 28 13:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: By all means, Don't let me stop you. - Wed Oct 28 13:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's for your safety afterall. - Wed Oct 28 13:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Regardless of what I think, I'd rather -you- not die, And just wait as well. - Wed Oct 28 13:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) decides suddenly that she's extremely thirsty, again.

Her carton of milk meets her mouth once more, and she drinks. . .for a very long while.* - Wed Oct 28 13:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's a 'really' good idea. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wish I could teach you but I haven't mastered that jutsu yet. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or I would. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a very tricky jutsu. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am still unsure if that was sarcastic or not. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No, it wasn't. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're my best friend Kilm. - Wed Oct 28 13:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You'll always be my best friend. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Good to hear. - Wed Oct 28 13:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If I fall into darkness . . . You and my brothers will be the ones dragging me back into the light . . . Know that. - Wed Oct 28 13:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am not sure why learning a C rank was that tiring to him but nevermind. - Wed Oct 28 13:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As for my safety. - Wed Oct 28 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd honestly be safer with the raccoons. - Wed Oct 28 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: -No one- that isn't a raccoon summoner can get there. - Wed Oct 28 13:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up her basket of brownies she'd bought for herself and Index and reaches out towards Kilm.

"Brownie?" she offers with eyes averted.

She's drinking more milk by the time he has a chance to respond.* - Wed Oct 28 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No thanks. - Wed Oct 28 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and takes them back.* - Wed Oct 28 13:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's good. - Wed Oct 28 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Still, what I said is true. We probably do need you. - Wed Oct 28 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For the battle....or battles. - Wed Oct 28 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I do not see how I could do much in my current state though. - Wed Oct 28 13:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Truth is. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, first of all, think of it this way. - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can -barely- beat you in a one-on-one fight if I out-smart you. - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But let's say there are twenty enemies. - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who's better suited for killing them? - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You, or me? - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll tell you this. - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd rather you keep around Ikaro instead of me. - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He's stronger than me. - Wed Oct 28 13:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: In taijutsu and ninjutsu. - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: One-on-one fights are well and good....and plenty to be proud of.... - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The only thing I beat him in is Genjutsu. - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But the truth is if you consider skillsets overall..... - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're just plain better than I am. - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've always said that. - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's always been true. - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I desperately try to be good enough to beat you in one-on-one fights but. . . - Wed Oct 28 13:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I wonder how our temple summoners are doing? - Wed Oct 28 20:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Birds have really light and weak bones to let them fly. Dragons though? Sure look heavy to me. - Wed Oct 28 20:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, peering up at him for the brief moment. Afterwords she quickly walks off after him.* - Wed Oct 28 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: See ya both. - Wed Oct 28 20:40:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this and says nothing for now.* - Wed Oct 28 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Arms are behind her back and she takes some time to look around as they move.

"Not like...I'll be wearing dresses often. So I don't think I'm gonna ask for much." she says.* - Wed Oct 28 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Oct 28 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.

"It'll work." she says, though the last one was definitely pink, to contrast against the black dress.* - Wed Oct 28 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And I guess I could wear dresses. - Wed Oct 28 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Buy me some and I'll wear them." she says.

The teen absent-mindedly takes the offered arm with eyes averted.

"For that dare. I don't actually -like- dresses so I won't pick any out."

* - Wed Oct 28 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, eying them.

"Both are extremely ugly but that one's doable." She says, nodding towards the chinese dress.* - Wed Oct 28 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "I like that one." she admits.* - Wed Oct 28 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes at the sight of that one while biting her cheek. Naturally she vows to not wear that one no matter what, though she says nothing.

"N-no. . ." she says. "Nothing else."* - Wed Oct 28 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) places her hands together to form the clone seal.

A puff of smoke appears directly in front of Index.

From it comes a foot, aimed for Index's nuts.

A shadowclone.

It'd disipate immediately after completing its task.* - Wed Oct 28 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What was that? I was busy training my shadowclone jutsu. - Wed Oct 28 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) summons another clone, even after Index falls. She's facing the opposite direction as it, too, kicks him in the nuts -- ramming a foot into his hand that covers them, even, if needed.

"Hope they're behaving. . ." she says, while "training her jutsu."* - Wed Oct 28 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clone begins kicking Index in the gut, over and over again.

"Sometimes, I honestly have no idea what kind've trouble they get into." she says.* - Wed Oct 28 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Must be because. . . - Wed Oct 28 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I haven't mastered the jutsu yet. - Wed Oct 28 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "I wish. . ." she says as her clones ram a pointy boot up his butt, by way of a kick.

"Lately they've been so nice to people. . .I'm worrying about it."* - Wed Oct 28 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Gets rid of her clone, though, with that. With a single handseal it disappears in a puff of smoke.* - Wed Oct 28 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: -omit- - Wed Oct 28 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, saying nothing more.* - Wed Oct 28 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down with arms behind her back, on the couch. The girl shakes her head in response to his question. Only Kat's eyes really suggest a good mood.

Sadism.* - Wed Oct 28 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. With a yawn Kat stretches out on the couch and takes a pillow in hand, hugging it.

She lies on her belly and nuzzles her face into said pillow.

Beating people up puts her in an extremely good mood.* - Wed Oct 28 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Making shadowclones made me tired. . . - Wed Oct 28 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) fell asleep while Index was in the shower.

She's sleeping on the couch.* - Wed Oct 28 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually wakes up. Briefly she glances down at him and then nuzzles her face into her pillow. She says nothing, though, at least for now.

Her face ends up facing the north.

After many long seconds she rolls over to face that direction, too, and curls up into a ball with her pillow held close.* - Wed Oct 28 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hhm. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good. - Wed Oct 28 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's good. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You talk in your sleep, You know that? - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Perfect time to mess with her. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: U-um. - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I do....? - Wed Oct 28 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yep~ .."I love Cats..." - Wed Oct 28 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ..."I want to hold them and squeeze them in my arms." - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ....Plus some other stuff, I'd rather not repeat. - Wed Oct 28 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . - Wed Oct 28 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes a bit, though Index can't see this. Her face is then burried into her pillow.

She says absolutely nothing.* - Wed Oct 28 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hmm....? - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dozed off again. - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lies through her teeth.* - Wed Oct 28 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Oct 28 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You know....This floor is really uncomfortable. - Wed Oct 28 23:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Want a pillow? - Wed Oct 28 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) may or may not be teasing.* - Wed Oct 28 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Cushion. . .? - Wed Oct 28 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes fairly hard behind her pillow. She pretty much ragdolls through the tackling and such.

"C-cat. . ?" she inquires, rolling over onto her belly in the mean time. Her pillow remains in her face.* - Wed Oct 28 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) keeps her face burried.

"I see." she says with a muffled voice.* - Wed Oct 28 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head, eventually facing the south. She allows all of the touching and stuff.

"I see I haven't kicked you enough yet." she says.* - Thu Oct 29 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. A silent breath is taken through the nose, and she avoids eye contact.* - Thu Oct 29 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink. The girl turns her head until her chin is resting on top of her pillow and stares down at the couch's cushions, still saying nothing.

Her face is hidden, specifically so that she can hide her thoughts.* - Thu Oct 29 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) does little to nothing. Subtly she bites down on the corner of her pillow.* - Thu Oct 29 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) does and says nothing, still.

She removes the pillow from her mouth, because that's gross.

Her mouth rests against it from then on.* - Thu Oct 29 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's legs twitch a bit, and then slowly open up, with her knees moving upwards towards her hips.

Silently Kat takes a breath through the nose.

"M-Maybe. . ." she says.

"We should go train."* - Thu Oct 29 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly sits up, leaving her legs sprawled out underneath her form. A glance is sent Index's way and her blush remains.

"Or....something." she says.

The truth is, she's still way too lazy to actually train.* - Thu Oct 29 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She turns in place and scoots closer, putting her hip against his. Her legs remain curled towards her form with her feet facing the west.

"I dunno." she says.

"Lying around shouldn't still feel like a great idea after all of his. . lying around, but it really does. . . ."* - Thu Oct 29 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, leaning in closer and even smiling a bit.

A nervous, awkward sort of smile that suggests sympathy.* - Thu Oct 29 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: H-hhmmmm. - Thu Oct 29 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her arms up and puts her hands together to make the clone seal.

In a puff of smoke a clone identical to Katsune appears.

With a nod, despite no words having been spoken, the clone turns on its heel and makes its way to the kitchen. After a brief amount of very quiet digging it finds two bottles of sake.

Two.

It brings both of them to Katsune and quietly hands them over. She takes both, holding one in each hand.

The teen makes no moves to open either of them at this time.* - Thu Oct 29 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Such a good jutsu. . . . - Thu Oct 29 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pops the cork on the bottle in her right hand. With that, she silently draws in a breath through the nose. The bottle's head finds her mouth and she tilts the bottom of it up.

Sake is smoothly and quickly poured into her mouth.

She gulps several times before eventually pausing for air.

While she catches her breath, the bottle rests in her lap.* - Thu Oct 29 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Oct 29 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks the bottle in her right hand up a bit and moves it over to the side. The left hand's bottle is rested inbetween her legs so it can stay by itself. Slowly, Kat then reaches over for Index's left hand. She'd take it by the wrist and glance up at him. Assuming no resistance or apparent objection, she'd then pull it over to her lap.

Once there, she pauses for a very long while. Five full seconds if not longer.
The teen's hand then carefully and slowly moves. She'd manipulate the boy's thumb very carefully, as if he were a puppet. Said thumb would be placed against the top of the very dark purple cloth that covers Katsune's crotch.

She fits the appendage into it, just a bit.

Afterwords her eyes wander, and she pauses.* - Thu Oct 29 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly pushes the thumb further in. In time, he'd notice the flesh getting much, much warmer. The thumb meets some soft cloth his eyes can't see.

It's very soft; almost velvetty.

Kat lets his thumb rest there for three full seconds. Very long seconds that seem much longer than they actually are.

Afterwords, she picks the thumb back up and sends it down once more, very gently and slowly.

This time it meets what feels like bare flesh. Very soft flesh. After some amount of distance, one might be forced to wonder what exactly they're touching.

Kat takes a silent breath before speaking.

"This. . .comes off." she says.

Her eyes wander, a bit awkwardly. Index's palm is pressed to her covered crotch.

"For future reference. . . ."

The teen makes absolutely no eye contact at all.* - Thu Oct 29 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances down at the scene in Index's lap.

Slowly she then removes the boy's thumb, without moving his hand away. His fingers are left against the dark purple that covers her up.

For long seconds she leaves it there. Afterwords, very slowly, Kat begins pushing the hand downwards.

In time, the entire hand is resting against her warm depths. His thumb and pinky would be -- definitely notably -- touching the flesh inbetween her thighs and her crotch.

The teen then closes her legs a bit, into the hand. She leans in closer. Her cheeks are very pink and very warm when she rests her face against his arm. Said arm is placed inbetween her breasts, and she stares down at his hand.

Her bottle of sake is set aside, and she reaches up to hug the arm close.

"There." she says, quietly. Katsune of course has absolutely no intention of explaining her actions.* - Thu Oct 29 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise once more with Index's arm still being hugged. Hands meet to form the clone seal. A puff of smoke appears at Kat's feet. When it clears, there's a Katsune clone. She's on her knees.

The clone's blushing too and avoiding all eye contact. It's sentient after all. It has emotions and whatnot.

With eyes averted it reaches forwards to remove the second sake bottle. Both are placed on the floor.

Afterwords it reaches up towards Kat's bodysuit; towards the darker purple parts. Some quiet popping sounds are heard as buttons are undone.

Afterwords, the clone begins pulling.

Slowly, the lower parts of Kat's clothing begin sliding off -- very, very slowly. Her showgirl skirt remains, but everything hugging flesh from the waist down is removed. It's left against the floor.

"And that's. . ." she says, quietly, as her legs close more snuggly against Index's hand.

"How the rest of it...comes off."

Kat can tell. . .she's getting better at this whole, "sensei" thing.* - Thu Oct 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clone disipates afterwords in a puff of smoke of course.* - Thu Oct 29 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her hands then move. Carefully she grips Index's arm in two different places. Slowly, she begins pulling it to and fro. His hand is made a puppet once more, and she forces it to gently rub back and forth against her depths.

"M-mhmm. . ." she coos, still staring down at what's going on below.

Upon closer inspection one would find little button slots where the lower half of Kat's outfit fits into place, thus explaining a few things.* - Thu Oct 29 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly opens her legs up at this time, giving him more freedom to move his hand.

Carefully she manipulates it further, slowly sliding the hand along up her left inner thigh.

Gently he pushes the hand into her flesh as well, and rubs it back and forth against her flesh.* - Thu Oct 29 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, still surprised her clone didn't remove everything as intended. Once more her arm wraps around Index's arm to hug it close. The girl then summons another clone.

It fetches her a bottle of sake and hands it to her.

Lazily she begins drinking, and gulps several times once more.* - Thu Oct 29 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) carefully and gently removes Index's hand, then, and places it in his own lap.

"'Kay. . ." she says, with eyes averted. 

Kat's legs close and curl up towards her own form with legs facing the west, hiding mostly everything once more.

"No more lessons...today."* - Thu Oct 29 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, with eyes still averted.

"Good night." she says.* - Thu Oct 29 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Oh hey you... - Thu Oct 29 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Why did I say any of that out loud in public. - Thu Oct 29 03:43:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When I was given that technique, I was told that Kenshin would kill me if he found out I knew it. - Thu Oct 29 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's dead now though. - Thu Oct 29 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wouldn't talk about it but it's useless to me. - Thu Oct 29 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: That technique was it? - Thu Oct 29 03:46:08 2015
