<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to lead the way.* - Mon Oct 12 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Kilm. - Mon Oct 12 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why haven't you reminded me to teach you Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot yet? - Mon Oct 12 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I mastered it weeks ago. - Mon Oct 12 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Oh right. - Mon Oct 12 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I honestly forgot about it. - Mon Oct 12 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the tiger seal. A puff of smoke appears at her side with a loud poof. Out of it comes a clone, identical to Katsune. Eyes are locked onto Nozumi. Normally she'd avoid looking at him but this isn't a serious situation and she doubts her knows genjutsu anyway.

Kat's clone takes several steps towards the west. Once it's there, it slides a leg backwards through the dirt and lifts its arms. Both hands clench partially as if to mimic claws. The being stares at Nozumi blankly.

It can't talk presumably, so Kat talks for it.

"Attack the real me if you want." she says.

"But I'm only using clones for this. Gotta train the jutsu."* - Mon Oct 12 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The real Katsune's hands remain locked into the tiger seal. As such, she makes another earth clone. This one appears directly in front of her, next to the first. It too comes from a puff of smoke. With her clone made, Kat begins walking backwards. Senses focus on the boy.

The new clone remains where it is.

The second one at this time simply sprints towards Nozumi. It moves at a very fast pace -- a bit faster than the real girl normally does, even. Upon drawing near, it leaps up into the air by four feet or so. In the same motion it darts towards him with both legs outstretched.

She attempts to kick him in the face.

The use of a certain jutsu ends as the clone leaps, for many reasons. As such, it may be slowed down just a bit for the moment.* - Mon Oct 12 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Katsune's second clone forms the tiger handseal in response to the sight of Nozumi's shurikens. It makes use of the shunshin jutsu. It flickers out of sight and would reappear inbetween Kat and the projectiles.

The shuriken get stick in its gut. Presumably the clone remains? Or if not, it turns to mud. Either way, the shurikens are captured within its sticky, binding mud.

The other clone puts its hands together to form the tiger seal as well. A seal that's used maybe a bit 'too' often for Kat's jutsus. As a result, a river of mud rises up directly from beneath Nozumi's feet.

It'd hit him very hard and carry him accross the terrain, at its full strength.* - Mon Oct 12 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Kat's clone that had made the mud river makes use of the shunshin jutsu. She flickers out of sight. When the girl reappears, she's on the river of mud. Suimen is used to skate on it, though it still caries her. And specifically, she'd placed herself directly within Nozumi's path, just behind him. Quickly it kneels down and arims to grab him by the shirt.

With that done, it'd then turn on its heel with him in tow. If not stopped, it tosses him off to the side and back in Katsune's general direction.

He'd be sent skidding over the ground.

The real girl eyes him carefully to asses any damage, or potential damage to him.* - Mon Oct 12 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clones stop moving. The both turn to face Nozumi's general direction. At a lazy pace, the girl begins walking over to him.

"You alright?" she inquires.

"I'll admit; I got a little bit carried away."* - Mon Oct 12 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Taijutsu's not my strong suit so I thought it'd be okay to just do whatever. - Mon Oct 12 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I always hating sparring with Zetsumo because I wasn't a match. It wasn't fun." she says as she draws near.

She's coming to a stop when she says "The point of a sparring session really is just to train your creativity and help you figure out exactly what your jutsus are capable of. Every last thing they can be used for. If I'm too strong for you, it's hard for you to get much out of it, isn't it?"* - Mon Oct 12 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Expected you to be a bit strong if Kilm thought you'd get something out of it."

"You'll learn nothing like this."* - Mon Oct 12 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Does 'he' spar with you? - Mon Oct 12 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) places her hands together. Her clones in response turn into mud and splash against the ground, into nothing.* - Mon Oct 12 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: No. - Mon Oct 12 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: He hasn't done so yet. - Mon Oct 12 21:20:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: ... - Mon Oct 12 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) thinks: Did I just make a pun unintentionally? - Mon Oct 12 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see why he's teaching you. - Mon Oct 12 21:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No reason. - Mon Oct 12 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: Because I'm from Konoha, right? Well.. - Mon Oct 12 21:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's because you're weak. - Mon Oct 12 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nozumi(Dragonfile) says: ..... - Mon Oct 12 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit in response to his reaction. Sadism, maybe? Probably.

It's not an unfriendly smile, though.

"Anyway." she says.

"Back to the village?"* - Mon Oct 12 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hovers up into the air. Yep. It's canon.

She's three feet off of it and she flies as fast as Nozumi to make sure she can keep up with him without a struggle. Eyes wander off, and her smile fades away; into a bit of a frown.

"You didn't." she says on the way back.

Of course, Sunagakure's a long way from here. It'll take a while for them to get back, so she has time to talk to him while they move.* - Mon Oct 12 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. Eventually, she shrugs.

This is of course Katsune of all people. She comes to a stop. The girl decides to give him no more of her attention. Her expression becomes blank.

With that, she takes off further into the air. The girl moves as a blur, and makes her way back to Sunagakure.* - Mon Oct 12 21:40:54 2015

"Hey, Hassan." she says.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I won't use them. - Mon Oct 12 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I'd rather not get on your bad side. - Mon Oct 12 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Harsh... - Mon Oct 12 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns around and walks away without hearing anything else Susumu says.

"Anyway Index." she says.

"House is this way."* - Mon Oct 12 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: People keep annoying me within this village. - Mon Oct 12 22:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Buffy(BoyVaporeon) says: No, but you will accept my fist up your anus. - Mon Oct 12 22:13:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Oh Zenaki is back good. - Mon Oct 12 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop in the middle of the living room. Eyes wander. Eventually, her left hand finds her hip. With her right hand she rubs the back of her head.

"Yeah." she says.

"Little reason to be here but I did want to get away from that boy."* - Mon Oct 12 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Just so you know he can cast a jutsu that can't be blocked or dodged in any way. It can paralyze you. - Mon Oct 12 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: His jutsu is an abomination. - Mon Oct 12 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It takes an awful lot of willpower for me to not slaughter him. - Mon Oct 12 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It paralyzes you. - Mon Oct 12 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It follows you. - Mon Oct 12 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It can't be blocked. - Mon Oct 12 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tilts her head a bit, staring.

"Do I really need to say more?"* - Mon Oct 12 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. Won't kill him. - Mon Oct 12 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not a murderer anymore. - Mon Oct 12 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm? Is that so? - Mon Oct 12 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But isn't it more fun? - Mon Oct 12 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No it isn't. - Mon Oct 12 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Oct 12 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you mind if I take a seat? - Mon Oct 12 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't mind. . . - Mon Oct 12 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and sits too, with a silent sigh through the nose. Arms remain crossed, and one leg crosses over the other.* - Mon Oct 12 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That is a weird thing to do. - Mon Oct 12 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is it? - Mon Oct 12 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But that's what he told me. - Mon Oct 12 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He said we're not on high alert or whatever anymore. - Mon Oct 12 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Oct 12 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But. . . - Mon Oct 12 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances down at Index's headband.

"Why are you wearing a Konoha headband?" she says..* - Mon Oct 12 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Mon Oct 12 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you know anything of Edge's abilities? - Mon Oct 12 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yan's* - Mon Oct 12 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 12 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Clones. Earth walls. - Mon Oct 12 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Spikes out of the ground near a target. - Mon Oct 12 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sounds like an annoying skillset. - Mon Oct 12 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Mon Oct 12 22:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Knowing my enemy is the most surefire way to winning. - Mon Oct 12 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Any way you'd reccomend going about it? - Mon Oct 12 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fighting him that's. - Mon Oct 12 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not really. Got lightning release? - Mon Oct 12 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I do. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I only know a single technique. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then use it. From what I've seen pretty much all he uses is earth. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Which would be problematic if I used the same thing repeatedly. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- What's the technique though? - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Earth Flash. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Perfect. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was gonna teach it to you if you didn't know it. It's exactly what I had in mind. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Oct 12 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't know any other lightning jutsus that are worth anything. - Mon Oct 12 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Oct 12 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Remember our bet? - Mon Oct 12 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Oct 12 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Beat me in a spar and I. . . - Mon Oct 12 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Have to do something. Don't remember what. - Mon Oct 12 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Go on a date with me---Rather, U-Um...Go to dinner. - Mon Oct 12 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit. The girl scratches her cheek and averts her eyes, then.

"I see." she says.

"Well. Good thing you won't ever beat me, then."* - Mon Oct 12 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- You know. You'd think a desert would have hotsprings. - Mon Oct 12 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm sure they do. - Mon Oct 12 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you want to look that's. - Mon Oct 12 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We could. - Mon Oct 12 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: U-Uh, Sure. - Mon Oct 12 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "I'll be back, then." she says.

"Gonna change first."

The girl then wanders off into a bedroom.* - Mon Oct 12 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually comes back, wearing the same thing. She'd simply put a bathing suit on underneath her clothes. Afterwords she motions towards the door with her head and makes her way to it, leading the way out.* - Mon Oct 12 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods in response before walking through.

Afterwords she even goes so far as to turn around and look at him. A hand is held out.* - Mon Oct 12 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Take my hand. - Mon Oct 12 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll be flying. I'm too lazy to walk. Too lazy to hide my jutsu from you too. - Mon Oct 12 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) releases earth chakra. As a result, her weight and his both are instantly reduced to nothing. They begin hovering. Kat takes no time to explain, either. Without even warning him, she then takes off. Her grip on his hand remains. She's going at her max speed, so both move as a blur.

He may even get tunnel vision.

There's no other realistic way for them to find a hotspring any time soon.* - Mon Oct 12 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ascends to three hundred feet or so above the ground of course. Eyes scan the desert for signs of a village.

She never finds one. What she does find, though, is the edge of a mountain marking the entrance to Kumogakure territory. An eyebrow rises. She spots water.

A natural hotspring. A glance is directed over at Index as she comes to a stop.

"There?" she suggests.* - Mon Oct 12 23:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then descends. Many long minutes pass before their feet hit the ground. When they do, the two are standing on an onyx, rocky surface. She releases his hand then and lazily takes her arm back.

Blankly, the teen stares down at the near-boiling water below. Silent, she takes a deep breath through the nose.

Hands find her hips and her weight shifts a bit.

"Yeah." she says.

"Might be a bit. . .too hot."* - Mon Oct 12 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Very large amounts of steam even at this time are floating up into the air over the water. It's a bit thick.

"We could....test it out first." she suggests.

"I doubt we'll find another any time soon. Hotsprings don't grow on trees."* - Mon Oct 12 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, with another glance over at him. With that, she reaches over to her back with her right hand. She finds a zipper, and begins pulling it down. Minutes pass. Minutes involving Kat removing her gauntlets and boots, as well as other things. This body suit is a complicated piece.

Eventually, she's left in a dark green two-piece bikini. It fits well enough, and is decently modest. With that done she walks forwards, at a lazy pace. The girl plants her bare feet at the edge of the spring, just before the water. She stays there and only stares for now, first allowing herself to feel the heat of the steam.

If the steam itself is too hot then of course the water definitely will be. For now, she doesn't seem to be shying away.* - Mon Oct 12 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Her clothes are left piled up near where they'd landed of course.* - Mon Oct 12 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) only extends a leg forwards in response. Carefully she cranes her body over, adjusting her weight in the process with her earth jutsu to make sure she easily maintains her balance. A toe is dipped into the water, briefly. Afterwords, she dares to slowly stick the entire foot in.

Some seconds pass as she stirs it around.

Afterwords she gently pushes herself the rest of the way in, up to her thighs. She smiles a bit as eyes wander off, and nods.

Her hair hides said smile. "Doable." she says.

The girl pulls her other leg in. Carefully she then sits down. She's submerged up to the collar bone. Silently she sighs in response to the heat, through the nose.* - Mon Oct 12 23:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides forwards a bit, crossing one leg over the other. Palms rest at either side of her at the floor of the spring. She rests her back against the rocky border of it. She takes a moment to breathe and such as her body adjusts to the water.

Eventually though it does.

With that out of the way she says "I've decided to teach you at least a few jutsus."* - Mon Oct 12 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not today probably, but maybe soon. - Mon Oct 12 23:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll teach you enough to at least hold your own against most other genin. - Mon Oct 12 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's....That's still more than enough, Thank you.. - Mon Oct 12 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Mon Oct 12 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Mon Oct 12 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You said you wanted to make my goals your own. - Mon Oct 12 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What'd you mean by that? - Mon Oct 12 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I...I meant that, I wanted....to see you become the Hokage once again, to get as strong as you desire. I'd like to be there and help you is all.. - Mon Oct 12 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Teaching him. . .is extremely irresponsible. - Mon Oct 12 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Oct 12 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My goal isn't necessarily to become the Hokage. The village has a new kage now. It didn't when I told you that. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My goal is to make sure Konoha becomes what a friend of mine wanted. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If the Hokage is bad, I'll tell him to step down. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he doesn't, I'll kill 'im. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fair enough, My goal is to help you, and...As long as you're resolved, I won't question your actions. - Mon Oct 12 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hair is soaked from the shoulder blades down. It looks awkward and dumb. In response, Kat begins slowly pulling herself underneath the water. She closes her eyes, and then dips her head in. With that done, she then pulls herself back out. The girl turns her head to face the opposite direction then, and a hand reaches up to wipe at her now wet eyelids.

She nods in response to Index.* - Mon Oct 12 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, sneaking a questionable glance over at him.

"Should've said no. . ." she says.* - Mon Oct 12 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks away. She scratches a cheek then, with a shrug.

"A lot of reasons. For one, I should've known It'd not be okay for me to go to Kumogakure."* - Mon Oct 12 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Few of my friends, in the past, seemed to think the same thing." she says, without reacting to the hand on her shoulder.

"They're all dead. . .except for Kilm. Who's only alive because I made sure he stayed that way."* - Tue Oct 13 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Maybe. . ." she says, with eyes staying averted.

She's a bit stiff, not moving much.* - Tue Oct 13 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a silent, deep breath. She leans backwards against the border of the spring, attempting to relax.

She says nothing, for a few reasons.* - Tue Oct 13 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances up towards the hand in response. She allows him to do this, though.* - Tue Oct 13 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at him. "Yeah." she says.

"It's funny. I kick people in the nuts and say horrible things to them, and people only like me more."

She scoots a bit closer, wiggling by a small amount in the process. Her naked hip meets his, though the rest of her remains a very small distance away.* - Tue Oct 13 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leans closer, pressing her side to his. She says nothing.* - Tue Oct 13 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes further. "I should sleep." she eventually says. Hands meet the ground behind her. Using suimen and the lightweight rock technique, she's able to very easily and gently pick herself up. Her butt meets the rocks above. Feet are left hanging down below.* - Tue Oct 13 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then hovers up onto her feet. Water itself has its weight reduced and floats away from her body, leaving her perfectly dry. With that done, she then makes her way over to her clothes and gets dressed.* - Tue Oct 13 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her eyes suggest a good mood, though she's kept them hidden for most of this time. 

"Mhmm...." she says.

Her bodysuit's heard being zipped up. Her butt's planted on the ground while she pulls her boots on, and then finally her gauntlets.* - Tue Oct 13 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll teach you something tommorrow. I don't have any scrolls on me and I'd rather teach you in person anyway. - Tue Oct 13 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I...Appreciate it, Kat. - Tue Oct 13 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "Good night." she says.

The girl then turns on her heel and begins walking away. Eventually, she leans forwards and begins sprinting. Draining or not, she is a shinobi.

It's just more exercise for her or any other ninja.* - Tue Oct 13 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Tue Oct 13 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Katsune! - Tue Oct 13 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hi. - Tue Oct 13 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her arms up and slaps her hands together. The teen makes the tiger seal, and stares at the ground. A very faint frown is on her face. It's one that suggests boredom. She really, really hates training.

Even so, she has some goals to meet and enemies to slaughter. She can't afford to be lazy. A plume of smoke appears against the ground in front of her in a loud poof. It's as tall as Katsune herself is. Within the smoke, a clone very quickly rises up out of the ground.

Immediately the clone walks out of the smoke at a lazy pace. Said smoke disipates afterwords, having been conjured up only to hide from people that the clone is made of mud. Kat takes some time to assess the appearance of her clone while her chakra circuits stop going wild. The fact is, she's not capable of making another clone too quickly after the first. Transitioning from jutsu to jutsu just isn't possible for her.

Five or six full seconds pass. With that done, Kat conjures up another clone. Soon, there are two of them. The girl glances back and forth between them. Minutes pass. 

Within this time, Kat has produced as many as ten whole clones. All of them turn on their heels and take four or five steps away from the creator. After covering this distance they turn to face the chuunin. They stare ahead blankly as if they're very disciplined soldiers. They're mindless thralls after all, unlike true shadow clones.

Or at least, for now they are. One of the clones turns and walks up to another one, staring down at its chest. Abruptly, it then leans forwards and hugs the other, snuggly. It's legs rise up and wrap around her sister's waist. Its head rests on her shoulder.

Kat's hands part. Immediately afterwords they clap together once more. The seal of confrontation is formed. One of the clones falls appart. Mud splashes all over the place, with some of it getting on the other clones.

The one that gets the most muddy though, is the one that had been getting sexually molested in public. It's coated entirely from head to tow. A glance is sent towards Susumu at this time. Her expression's a bit blank. "Hey." she says.* - Tue Oct 13 02:12:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Kat's clone didn't hug the other in any sexual way whatsover.

She's a tsundere she isn't giving anyone a show in public.* - Tue Oct 13 02:14:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: What'cha been up to? - Tue Oct 13 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Training. - Tue Oct 13 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Neat, Neat. - Tue Oct 13 02:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clone that's covered in mud attempts to pull itself free. It does so in a seemingly lazy and uncaring manner. A robotic way. Its palms find some of the mud and tightly grip it. She then begins pulling.

The mud sticks like glue. She pulls several times. Eventually Kat's convinced that the clone is stuck. Of course, she's sure to not make her clone try 'too' hard. It has her face.

If it does anything too silly, it'll embarass the owner. One of her clones abruptly turns in place and sprints towards the other. It moves as a blur. Its palm finds the muddy one's face. A loud, gunshot-like bang is heard. The clone explodes.

It, too, becomes a blast of mud. This mud coats the other, trapping it much like the other had done too. Kat's other clones move as well. They all sprint towards each other and launch palms at their partners. Each time, the very loud bang is sounded off. 

A sensor would detect chakra coming from said palms, but the jutsu itself is never visible. It's hidden by the mud each time. Eventually Kat's absent-mindedly examing a very, very muddy clone of herself. With a shrug, Kat forms the tiger seal again. Her final clone turns to mud and said mud falls to the ground below with a loud splash.* - Tue Oct 13 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hmm...? - Tue Oct 13 02:21:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes more clones. This happens over a very lengthy span of time of course, because she still can't make more than one at a time. Ten more are produced. This time two lines are formed, each with five clones in them. Two of the clones at this time charge towards each other. 

Upon meeting its opposite each time, the clones launch palms at their partners. Legs follow in a wild, insanely fast flurry. Not half as fast as they run, but fast still. Slower than a taijutsu specialist would be, but respectable speed. Even so, eventually, one of the clones falls.

It turns to mud, once more coating its sparring partner. Immediately as one clone falls, another darts into the frey to replace the other. They throw palms or fists always, and never go for grabs. More often than not, the arms and hands are used. Kicks are used only rarely and usually they're kicks that aim to trip.* - Tue Oct 13 02:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes two more clones. The two stare over at each other blankly. Eventually, Kat has one of them kneel down. It does so at a lazy pace. Once its knee is planted, the clone's palms meet the earth.

Abruptly, four very large spikes rise up out of the ground. All four of them impale the opposing clone. Immediately the clone falls to pieces upon being struck. It turns to mud which splashes all over the place. The real Katsune releases a long and silent sigh through the nose.

It's confirmed. Her clones aren't very durable, regenerative capabilities or no.* - Tue Oct 13 02:42:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly declines onto her back. The girl silently sighs once more. Eyes go out of focus and she stares up at the sky.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet. Dirt from her body hovers up into the air before abruptly falling to the ground. She'd been lying down with arms and legs sprawled out. At this time she makes her way over to the Kazekage and stands at his side. Palms find her hips and her weight shifts her bit.

She questions him quietly, as it's obviously, probably, not okay to discuss mission details out loud in cases like this one.* - Tue Oct 13 04:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes some time to read the scroll, opening only enough to see the details. Senses pan the area to ensure no one's looking over her shoulder. Eventually though she nods. "Alright." she says.

"I'll be back."

The girl turns on her heel and begins making her way to the front gates.* - Tue Oct 13 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Reguel. - Tue Oct 13 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way over to the nearest restaraunt with her B ranked mission scroll in her hand. While there, she oders a bottle of sake. While she waits, the girl opens her scroll up fully to eye the contents within once more. She'd chosen a table in a dark corner of the establishment so she has no need to worry about prying eyes. Even so, her senses scan the area.

On her way here she'd stopped by her house to change clothes and put on a whig. She's Keiko once more. Her straw hat is with her, so when the waitress comes to give her her alchohol she places said hat over her scroll and thanks her. When she leaves, the teen takes the bottle and brings it straight to her mouth, ignoring the cups that had been prepared. Eyes are on her scroll while she drinks.

The first fifteen minutes or so of her stay are spent coming up with a plan. She learned a very long time ago to plan before you even leave the village. Not doing so on her second mission ever left her with scars and she nearly died. Even after those fifteen minutes, Kat's come up with little to nothing. Even so, she refuses to step foot outside the falls without the perfect strategy.

Katsune's luck is the worst in the world and she's very much aware of this fact. As such, she doesn't like to gamble. It's hard to make perfect plans for something you're doing without any squad at all, though. Hours pass. With a shrug, the teen eventually picks up her scroll and just leaves.

On her way out, the girl grabs a whig and some colored contacts. The ones she'd used for her "Keiko" alias. Her straw hat and Keiko clothes are collected as well. With that done and her face hidden, Kat steps out of the village. It's a long walk, and she refuses to fly as that consumes enormous amounts of chakra.

She'll need every single last drop if she's to be sure about her ability to complete this mission. More hours pass, and Kat's near the target outpost. With a silent sigh, she sits down and rests her back against a rock. Using the hiding mole jutsu, she even takes a nap inside of it. Once she's rested she wakes with a yawn and rises to her feet.

Hands meet to form the tiger seal. Much time passes, but eventually the girl's managed to create three whole earth clones. She's not capable of making them all at once, but she has the distinct and extremely beneficial advantage of being able to prepare her clones way before the fight begins. Kat's expected to do this mission alone and that is quite impossible. As such, she makes her own squad from her chakra.

The girl then orders one of her four clones to use henge to take on the shape of a headband. It becomes a completely black band, complete with the metal guard. The metal is unmarked, as if to suggest Kat doesn't belong to any faction at all. Kat ties the new accessorry to her leg, over her Sunagakure headband. The clone immediately begins using the Lightweight Rock Technique.

This removes any issue there would normally be with the clone being heavy. It uses only enough chakra to give Kat freedom to move. She doesn't fly yet. The point though is that the girl now 'can' fly when she wants to, and she can use jutsus in the air too since her clone's handling the flight jutsu for her. Its shape is changed to reduce any difficulty related to moving her body in just the right way for flight.

With this done, Kat turns and begins walking towards the outpost. All clones follow her. She has pretty much no plan. No plan could help her if she's alone. The girl comes to a stop some sixty feet away from the structure.

Eyes wander to thoroughly study her target; the outpost. Once more she sighs through the nose. A hand rises, and she waves one of the clones off with her hand. She directs it towards the village, even speaking to get her point perfectly clear. "Go make noise. Don't kill anyone that's not a mission target." she says.

The girl and her two other clones then slowly sink into the ground. By now they've possibly been spotted, but it doesn't matter. The three are hidden by the earth with holes closing up behind them. Kat moves forwards beneath the earth. From here she can sense what goes on above by way of magnetic senses.

She can also stay close to her clone, allowing her to manipulate it freely. In time, the clone is at the gate. Three guards are posted here; all C rank though Kat doesn't have the privelege of knowing this. One of them comes to meet the clone. It questions her.

In response, the fake Keiko smiles and nods as if to carry on conversation. She can't speak though. As a result, the guard is left a bit perplexed. The man produces an awkward smile and rubs the back of his head. A glance is sent backwards towards his companions.

It's at this time that the clone darts forwards. It's kneeling down as it moves, and a fist stretches out to aim for the dirt. The earth is struck. The ground shakes and trembles, and Katsune's jutsu roars loudly. A crackling, reverberating boom is the result.

The Landmine Fist had been triggered. A massive, dome-shaped explosion races forwards. Kat's enemy is consumed instantly. Few people can compare to this girl as far as C ranked enemies go. Normally the girl might consider this use of her jutsu to be a waste of chakra.

However, she needs a distraction. The girl needs to lure people out. As such, she'll make her clone look unstoppable -- which is quite easy when it's Katsune of all people. Compared to these amateurs, she is unstoppable. And so. . .the boss will be forced to come out in time.

And if not? She gets to pick off all of the weaklings without any opposition before facing the leader. The two other guards immediately turn to flee. They're not stupid. These are shinobi. 

They know a fight they can't win when they see one. It's unfortunate too, because if they'd charged the clone things would've been very easy. Kat and company race forwards from underground, and the surface clone moves forwards as a blur. It'd seem these guards are fast as well. It becomes clear why they were posted in the first place.

They're agile, so they can run for help quickly. Even so, few people are faster than Kat. The clone catches up to them soon enough, before they get too far. Hands meet to form seals, and it conjures up the earth flash jutsu. Lightning races forwards even as the clone sprints, making this unbelievably difficult to evade if not outright impossible.

It spreads to form a net, and as such both guards are incapacitated pretty much instantly. Both twitch and spasm on the ground. They're not dead, but it doesn't matter. More guards are coming. Abruptly, the clone darts up into the air. It flies.

With its speed combined with the ability to fly, the six enemies have no hope of hitting her. Even so, two of the less intelligent people throw kunai and jutsus. The very nimble girl simply twirls to and fro and evades them outright. In time, she drops down onto a house and kneels down. She needs time to rest, as the clone can't cast more jutsus immediately after flying.

While she does so, Kat bids all other clones except for the headband clone to rise to the surface. Now with two more Katsunes, the guards stand no chance. All clones now spread out, racing forwards and moving as a blur. Maybe one or two of the guards are as fast as Kat, but more than that? Absolutely downright impossible.

The two newly surfaced clones kneel down and slap palms against the ground. As a result, Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot is triggered twice. Two enemies drop like flies. A kunai strikes one clone on the shoulder. Said kunai is simply absorbed by the mud before falling out.

"Clones!!!!" the enemies shout. Immediately they begin looking for the real enemy, but it's useless. Kat's clones continue moving and picking them off. Kat had got the jump on them, so it's not until now that the leader shows up. With his presence detected, the real Katsune crawls up out of the ground, from beneath a house.

She can tell that this one is probably the boss. When she listens to him giving orders, she's pretty much confirmed it. The girl rolls up out of her hiding spot, having given her chakra circuits time to stop going wild and thus freeing herself up for more jutsu uses. In the mean time, Kat's clones play defense. They evade often, using shunshin which requires basically zero chakra for Kat due to Zetsumo's teaching, thank God.

Kat hovers up into the air, entering the area with style. As such, she immediately has most enemies attention. The clones take advantage. Twice more, they use the Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot. One guard dies. 

The last two enemies make their way over to the boss. Kat avoids looking at any of the enemies, and is forced to only have her senses on them. She's bad against genjutsu, so it can't be helped. The boss begins marking out orders. In response, Kat whistles and directs a clone to the crowd.

She'd rather not give him the luxury of time to plan. Both clones charge forwards. Enemies flee so it takes time for the agile clones to reach them. Even so, Kat has no difficulties. She charges forth, flying and aiming to cut them off. 
When she's three feet above the ground, she extends an arm. From her chakra flow gauntlet comes a massive explosion. The ground and all nearby houses shake and tremble. Dirt flies all over the place. Kat's hair and skirt are picked up and they fly all over the place. 

The explosion is reminiscent of a beam in shape and size. All but the boss drops instantly. They're charred and blood coats their features. Kat's expression remains a bit cold and serious. She takes a deep and fast breath, flying back up into the air even as the enemies die. 

She'd give the boss no time to catch her. He certain tries though. The man's hands meet to form the tiger seal. Her uses shunshin to leap. In response, Kat simply throws an arm forwards. 

She flies sideways as he leaps forwards, knowing he can turn in mid-air. She takes advantage, and aims a landmine fist blast once more from a safe distance. Even as explosive power pours forth, the girl flies towards him. This makes it quite, hilariously impossible to evade the blast. The man is knocked out of the air and sent flying.

Explosions pack concussive force as well as white-hot burning power. They knock back. He hits the ground, taking additional damage. It'd seem he's a bit of a tank. With a snap of her fingers, Kat signals two clones to charge him.

It takes time, but eventually they catch up to him. One of them launches a kick. He retaliates competently, and destroys one of his enemies outright. As a result, though, the girl's clone explodes. It turns to mud, and he's trapped in it. Stuck.

The last clone flies forwards, taking advantage of the situation. It hugs onto him nearly instantly, even as Kat darts forwards. When it reaches him it too explodes, turning to sticky mud. He's paralyzed entirely. And so, Kat's allowed to get close.

Her fist meets the enemy's very skill. Instantly, the explosion is detonated. He's a durable man, much like Kilm. Even so, he's taking his second Landmine Fist for the day and it's to the head no less. Immediately, he's sent flying. He hits a house, very hard, and is even sent flying through the wall.

Minutes pass as Kat approaches, at a lazy pace. By now most of the villagers have ran off, screaming for dear life as they flee. When Kat finally reaches her enemy, he's very dead. Eyes have been blown out of his skull, and blood pours out of both his mouth and eye sockets. His face is purple and bloodshot.

The concussive force of Kat's jutsu had been too great. He's done. The girl then moves and spends twenty minutes searching for corpses. She has to be sure she killed all of the guards. In time, she confirms that she has.

Some remaining villagers and shinobi stare at Katsune as her clones disipate, turning to mud. Only the headband clone remains. At least one of them is crying. A wife, perhaps? Tears stream down her face. "Hmmm...." the girl subtly coos, sounding almost amused. She does good work.

With a swagger, she walks out of the outpost. Her mission had been a success. She's also completely out of chakra.* - Tue Oct 13 18:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to Reguel with arms held behind her back. Specifically, the girl's holding one arm with the opposite palm. A very submissive gesture rather than its more authoritive counterpart.

"Hi." she says.* - Tue Oct 13 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) abruptly kicks Reguel in the nuts, hard, since he's sleeping in public. Afterwords she turns on her heel and walks away.* - Tue Oct 13 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to Saeza instead. Briefly she looks the girl up and down, taking note especially of her swords.

"Hi." she says when eye contact is made.* - Tue Oct 13 21:59:15 2015

"You any good with those swords?" she inquires.* - Tue Oct 13 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes several lazy steps backwards. Eventually she's covered ten feet or so, putting her fifteen feet away from Saeza.

"I'm busy, Trilliam." she says -- absent-mindedly and in a polite manner -- with eyes on her sparring partner. When she comes to the stop, Kat slides one foot backwards through the dirt and lifts both arms. Hands clench partially as if to mimic claws.

Chakra is then poured into Kat's gauntlets. Their color darkens significantly in response.* - Tue Oct 13 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: O shit. . . . I should move. - Tue Oct 13 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Scuse me? - Tue Oct 13 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares at the display for a very long while, blankly. "Mm..." she murmurs.

"Just a fair warning in advance. I'm not very durable." she says.

The girl's hands then meet. Her gauntlets return to normal. She forms the tiger handseal. A white, very large plume of smoke appears in front of her. When the smoke clears, a clone identical to Katsune appears.

The real girl backs out of her stands, standing straight up. Palms find her hips, and she then lazily walks off to the side.

Without any further pause or any verbal instructions from Katsune, the girl's clone then charges forwards. Its gauntlets, too, turn darker. They're hardened by the same chakra flow jutsu.

The clone moves as a blur presumably, inheriting Katsune's own speed.

Upon reaching Saeza it'd simply come skidding to a stop in the dirt. Mid-slide, it launches a fist forwards, aiming for its opponent's face.

Katsune watches the fighting very, very closely with her rather sharp eyes. Her senses are locked onto both the clone and especially Saeza.* - Tue Oct 13 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Trilliam, anything crazy going on? - Tue Oct 13 22:22:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Name is Hirsoshi. - Tue Oct 13 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: And you are? - Tue Oct 13 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Katsune's clone simply throws an arm upwards. The real girl's gauntlets are made specifically for chakra flow so the jutsu probably strengthens them way more than they normally would. However, the clone's own gauntlets probably do not inherit this property.

Even so, they're probably pretty hard. Earth release chakra allows you to create things that are harder than iron and maybe even steel if you're skilled enough. The clone attempts to take a step backwards as Saeza swings her sword, and throw an arm up with eyes locked onto the blade.

Should her gauntlet - which extends all the way up to the elbow -- make it to where it needs to be, then Saeza's sword would hit it and produce a rather loud, reverberating clang that echoes throughout the town square.

Either way, the clone is probably tripped successfully. It allows itself to fall, with a lifeless look in its eyes. Elemental clones after all aren't shadow clones. Supposedly they don't really have much of a consciousness.

It lies on the ground and stares up at the sky, blankly.* - Tue Oct 13 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yan. - Tue Oct 13 22:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the clone seal. The girl's clone abruptly falls apart with that done, turning to mud. Said mud forms a puddle, as Kat's presumably not capable of making it explode and spray mud all over the place at will.

She then nods and looks over at Saeza. "Would you like me to give you a challenge?" she inquires, having up until at least now only been sparring to train the Earth Chakra Flow technique.* - Tue Oct 13 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: The Triliam? - Tue Oct 13 22:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Tue Oct 13 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll try to hold back then. - Tue Oct 13 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: O so you are famous? - Tue Oct 13 22:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches up to form the tiger seal once more. A plume of smoke appears, and out of it comes yet another clone. It's unfortunate she got rid of her last clone, because this uses up precious chakra.

Kat's eying Saeza then with her hands still holding her handseal when she says "Alright. Come at me when you're ready."

Although of course, the truth is -- Kat can't use jutsus one after another in quick succession. She's not capable. As such, she's on cooldown more or less for this brief moment.* - Tue Oct 13 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is standing beside a clone. Both she and her clone are facing Saeza.

It'd be apparent that Kat is sparring.* - Tue Oct 13 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- No more games. I promise. - Tue Oct 13 22:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: So I get to spar too?  Sounds great. - Tue Oct 13 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is already holding the tiger seal. A seal used for almost all earth jutsus that don't involve slapping the ground -- and pretty much all of those too, even.

The girl's reaction speed is top notch, too. And so, even before Saeza gets within melee range, Kat summons up a river of mud. It rises up from beneath Saeza's feet and aims to sweep her up. The force of it is tremendously strong. 

The range usually is insanely great, but today Kat makes it no longer than fifteen feet. She needs to be sure that she doesn't get in trouble for flooding the village.

Saeza would be carried to only that distance.

Kat's eyes remain on the girl the entire time.* - Tue Oct 13 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) kneels down, planting one knee against the dirt. Hands then part, and both palms slap roughly against the dirt. They rest there as Kat's chakra travels forwards invisibly beneath the ground at a lightning-fast pace. Due to it being invisible, it'd seem that instantaneously, a large spike of earth darts up out of the ground.

It aims to strike Saeza in the gut. The tip is dulled entirely.

Normally this jutsu produces four spikes, but due to Kat having mastery over it she can presumably shorten the amount to just the one.

Should it hit the girl, it'll probably knock her breath out of her.* - Tue Oct 13 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || To be clear, it'd come from like, two feet away from Saeza, out of the ground.* - Tue Oct 13 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her spikes then withdraw into the ground. When they do, Kat rises up to her feet. She brushes her palms off against each other briefly as she looks her opponent up and down.

"Should've held back more. . ." she says.

"But I was still figuring out what your limits were."* - Tue Oct 13 22:58:08 2015
