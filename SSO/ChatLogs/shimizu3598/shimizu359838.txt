<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the masked person briefly. She's careful to only look at the mask, and not directly at the eyes. Said eyes are nothing more than a very distorted blur.

She's very careful not to look at the hands either.

Abruptly, the girl then turns around and walks away alongside her identical clone.

She says no words, and probably isn't responding to anything he says.* - Sat Oct 17 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks away even as she registers limb movement. It's still very blurry.

Even so, her clone places a hand on her shoulder as she moves. Without handseals, it uses the mastered kai jutsu.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Anyway, That's all I have to say. - Sat Oct 17 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I should kill Hideki for even suggesting this. - Sat Oct 17 19:40:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: If I get the right training then yeah . . . I'll stand a chance. I didn't say I'd attack them right now unprepared . . . Did I? Either way, I'm still going to train for that day. - Sat Oct 17 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Why? Why would you do this? - Sat Oct 17 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Does it make you feel useful? - Sat Oct 17 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Or admirabe? - Sat Oct 17 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is staring at him coldly.* - Sat Oct 17 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Because I'd rather die fighting their rule than die fighting shinobi who fear them. - Sat Oct 17 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: You'll be neither of these things if you do this stupid thing. - Sat Oct 17 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Good then, I don't need to be those things. - Sat Oct 17 19:46:08 2015

"You'd dare give me enemies for your self-righteous ego-stroking theatrics." she says.* - Sat Oct 17 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What enemies would they be if they're done for before they become yours? Like I said, I'm not going there unprepared. When i'm strong enough, I'll take them on . . . Even if it takes me 30 years of training to become strong enough. - Sat Oct 17 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I told you, I'm doing this if i know that I can finish the job. - Sat Oct 17 19:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel.

She walks over until she's directly in front of Kilm and stares up at him, maintaining eye contact.

"The Gezo aren't a problem." she says.

"They aren't our enemies. They aren't tyrants. They're just people. They don't exist for you to feel like a good person when you kill them."* - Sat Oct 17 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Then why do our leaders have to work under them to be 'legal'? - Sat Oct 17 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The strong typically do opress the weak. Get used to it. - Sat Oct 17 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In other words. . . - Sat Oct 17 19:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm following along with what I had told you. - Sat Oct 17 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Attack if or when you know without a doubt you can win. You gather information on your enemies -before- attacking! Something you never figured out. The reason I was hesitant to make you a chuunin in Konoha. - Sat Oct 17 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Every single enemy. All of the Gezo's strongest. Learn them inside and out first. - Sat Oct 17 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: See how impossible it is, and then give up. - Sat Oct 17 19:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: -- Without my advice you'd have charged in and died. You better take it. - Sat Oct 17 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm having to keep myself right now from killing you myself right this second. - Sat Oct 17 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fine. - Sat Oct 17 19:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross and her weight shifts a bit.

She sulks.* - Sat Oct 17 20:31:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Katsune, Like I asked earlier, You up to spar? It could help you cool off. - Sat Oct 17 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Sleeping. - Sat Oct 17 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erm. Sure. - Sat Oct 17 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to follow him.* - Sat Oct 17 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: First off. - Sat Oct 17 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Take a look at these buggers. - Sat Oct 17 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Right. - Sat Oct 17 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We can spar. - Sat Oct 17 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't even perk an eyebrow. The girl stares, for a very long while.

"I see. . ." she says.

Of course it wouldn't be like Katsune to call something cute, so she says nothing.

When Kilm mentions sparring she nods and turns to face him.* - Sat Oct 17 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You first. - Sat Oct 17 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you say so. - Sat Oct 17 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise and hands meet. The teen forms the clone seal. Her entire body is encased in smoke. When the smoke clears, Kat has a clone with legs wrapped around her waist, and arms around her neck. Its hands are on her shoulders.

It's prepared to use Kai or injure Kat immediately should the girl stop moving, or use the Lightweight Rock technique should she try to sprint or leap. The clone's too heavy for it to not do that after all.

Kat maintains eye contact. Kilm's hands are nothing more than a blur so...presumably, handseals will not work as a genjutsu trigger for her. Not unless she's looking directly at them which obviously she will never do in her entire lifetime.* - Sat Oct 17 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wasn't actually going to fly. With a shrug as Kat senses clones approaching, the girl simply walks off to the side. Her clone leaps off of her back and does the same. Both approach a different one of Kilm's clones and stare down at the ground where the clone is.

They know where it is.

Neither of them however do anything unless a clone actually gets within melee range. Presumably neither are within that range at the moment. If they are, they're already dead.* - Sat Oct 17 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Kilm isn't approaching. He's just hoveirng in the air it seems.

The teen directs a glance at his eyes to acknowledge this fact, but otherwise focuses on his clones.

Both Kat and her clone kneel down as the clones draw near. Said clones are in point blank range already when her fist meets the dirt if they haven't stopped moving.

If they do stop, Kat does nothing. If they keep coming though, she and her clone both simply pour explosion release chakra into their fists. From point blank range, an explosion is triggered using the dirt as fuel.

Landmine Fist is completely directional, so the dirt is immediately eaten by Kat's beam. It's consumed and disintigrated, for a range of fifteen whole feet or so and quite a bit of width in all directions as well.

As the clones are presumably disintigrated -- they can't be that durable right? They'e shadow clones -- Kat and her own clone begin falling. Soon, they're at the bottoms of the pits they created.

Kat's senses as well as the clones are still alert and still focuses towards the clones though. She needs to be sure they're dead.* - Sat Oct 17 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leaps up into the air as the clones approach. Her clone instead flies, using Lightweight Rock Tecnique. Moving as a blur in the same motion, it heads towards the real Katsune. Upon reaching her it lands on her back. Legs wrap around her waist, and its arms wrap around her neck.

Kat's eyes lock onto Kilm's.

With Kat's clone still using the Lightweight Rock Technique now on itself and her at the same time, Kat flies even higher.

She intends to get as far away from Kilm's clones as possible.

She doesn't stop moving until she's at least one-hundred feet above the ground or so.* - Sat Oct 17 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops in place, hovering in the air. The teen simply waits, hovering in place.

She doesn't move at all.* - Sat Oct 17 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know. . . - Sat Oct 17 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm starting to realize. - Sat Oct 17 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This jutsu makes over half of our earth techniques useless. - Sat Oct 17 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That much more reason to never teach it to anyone. - Sat Oct 17 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's our bane as much as it is our best technique. - Sat Oct 17 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct 17 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: All our techniques. - Sat Oct 17 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Are on the earth. - Sat Oct 17 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not in the sky. - Sat Oct 17 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So yeah. - Sat Oct 17 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Sat Oct 17 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're still sparring. - Sat Oct 17 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's keep this going? - Sat Oct 17 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct 17 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. - Sat Oct 17 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: His chakra is one-third what it normally is. That means he may have even less chakra than I do right now. - Sat Oct 17 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the tiger seal. Kat waits until the clones draw very close. She waits 'that' long.

And then?

She uses the shunshin jutsu.

Abruptly Kat disappears, moving as a blur. She moves at her max speed until her shunshin jutsu wears off.

The girl stops that much higher in the air, two-hundred feet above where she was.

Why? Because Kilm's using three times as much chakra as she is right now.

Kat smirks, and stares down at the three men.* - Sat Oct 17 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply waits.

She continues flying away, aiming to drag this fight out. The longer Kilm flies, the more chakra she wastes.

Kat's completely comfortable with using this annoying tactic.

For the most part, she ignores the real Kilm and his clone below.* - Sat Oct 17 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is actually still so high up in the air that it'll take three or four turns for Kilm to reach her.

She simply waits, staring down at him.

It's a cheap tactic, but the point of a spar is to teach yourself and your sparring partner how to get the most out of every single move they make, and every single jutsu they use.

As such, she doesn't hold back. She uses her advantage against him, and simply waits for him to catch up. The best way for him to learn, is for Kat to go all out.

Kilm's so far away that for Kat to dodge his technique, all she has to do is very lazily and slowly fly off to the side.

She does so. Eventually the water flies right past her presumably, had he still decided to fire it. Kat's twelve full feet away from it by that time, and her senses are locked onto the water.* - Sat Oct 17 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

The girl makes use of shunshin and appears at his side.

She's within eight feet of him then as she too flies towards the ground.

On the way down she says "That means I win. I want you to know that so you can improve." she says.* - Sat Oct 17 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In a real fight, you'd be dead now. - Sat Oct 17 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If...you'd chosen the same moves. - Sat Oct 17 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do you have a win more now or . . . We equal? - Sat Oct 17 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lemme think. . . - Sat Oct 17 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You won the last one too. - Sat Oct 17 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I believe. - Sat Oct 17 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I won the one before that. - Sat Oct 17 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd say even, sure. But -- that doesn't matter. What matters is, you should learn from this fight. - Sat Oct 17 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Sat Oct 17 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You are stronger than me. - Sat Oct 17 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But not smarter. - Sat Oct 17 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We just need to make sure you learn how to use that strength. - Sat Oct 17 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway if you're going to sleep. Lemme go ahead and say. . . - Sat Oct 17 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Also, No harsh feelings from what happened earlier? - Sat Oct 17 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm sorry for saying stuff I did. I'm not sorry for being extremely angry at you. - Sat Oct 17 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I understand. - Sat Oct 17 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But choosing to put you down to show that anger wasn't cool. - Sat Oct 17 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that what I thought I want to do wasn't cool and smart. - Sat Oct 17 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And that it's far fetched and it'll stay that way for a long while. - Sat Oct 17 21:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was just offended that you'd put other peoples' lives in danger for the sake of glory and fullfillment. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't want to argue about it right now so I won't comment on that. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nor will i attempt to argue about it later. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But I understand. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm sorry. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords her clone steps off of her back. It takes a few steps off to the side before turning to mud and falling to the ground, as a puddle.

Kat then turns on her heel and begins walking away, towards the village.* - Sat Oct 17 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway goodnight. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm not going to sleep yet. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm staying for a bit. - Sat Oct 17 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sat Oct 17 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am sleepy though yeah. - Sat Oct 17 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As for glory and fulfillment. - Sat Oct 17 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wasn't seeking that. - Sat Oct 17 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop, then, near Kilm. With a shrug she sets herself at his side.

She faces the south.

"I'm rude enough to call you a liar." she says.

"You are lying. Fighting the Gezo serves no purpose. You're not just putting your own life in danger but the lives of uninvolved people too. So, I can't respect what you're doing. Can't be nice about it either."* - Sat Oct 17 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're right. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If the gezo attacks us first. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm going to fight them. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since they'll be starting the fight. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not me. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm still going to train hard. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: For if that scenario actually happens. - Sat Oct 17 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What makes you think they will? - Sat Oct 17 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Is there something Hideki knows that I don't? - Sat Oct 17 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something about them planning an attack? - Sat Oct 17 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am not sure if Hideki knows. But that's always a possibility. - Sat Oct 17 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Remember Seisuke? - Sat Oct 17 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The Gezo prince? - Sat Oct 17 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Shinobi were the ones who killed him. - Sat Oct 17 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Seisuke secretly wanted to kill off the Gezo. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They might not have known that then. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And still believed him to be nobility. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He told me that. Put a seal on me so I wouldn't tell anyone. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way....you have a point. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If they come attacking. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who was stupid enough to kill him I wonder? - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cause shinobi killed a prince. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Then I wouldn't be amazed and will be someone who will defend the villages. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Who killed him? I'm not sure either. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Doubt the Gezo's so stupid. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Our jounin are privates. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Our kages are sergeants. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To blame all shinobi for one shinobi's action. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anything above is out of our imagination. - Sat Oct 17 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They could honestly put a bounty. - Sat Oct 17 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But if they think that this was a coordinated attack on Seisuke by a group then they'll be putting the blame on either a group of suspected people or maybe a village . . . Maybe even all the villages if they think that all the kages were in on that. - Sat Oct 17 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just don't attack the Gezo. - Sat Oct 17 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not willing to discuss impossible hypotheticals. - Sat Oct 17 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll tell Hideki. - Sat Oct 17 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's a child. Now that I know his plans I'll never let him be Hokage. - Sat Oct 17 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He will probably listen to me . . . Maybe he'll realize that we're putting shinobi in danger. - Sat Oct 17 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To be so wreckless. He's not mentally fit. - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He told me who is hokage. - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who? - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He is a good lightning user. - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He said very damn good lightning user. - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I could imagine him being fast cause of that . . . Lightning used to be utilized by Kumogakure nin for Nintaijutsu. - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He could be good at both nin and taijutsu. - Sat Oct 17 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that since I was a kumogakure nin once after all. - Sat Oct 17 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Besides the lightning . . . Dunno. - Sat Oct 17 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He used to have a friend named Ambrocio. - Sat Oct 17 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Who thought Hideki betrayed Konohagakure after leaving. - Sat Oct 17 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He told me Ambrocio is strong. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds like Hideki did betray it. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway . . . That's some useful info on Konohagakure . . . Or atleast some ninja . . . It's not a lot but it's atleast a little. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Leaving without a good reason. He's a rogue. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He got framed. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They kicked him out. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Someone spread lies about him. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What lies? - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Made it seem like all the money went to his pocket. - Sat Oct 17 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And that he was using Konohagakure for his own gain. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That he's tried to murder people? Because those aren't lies. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: When Hideki actually used his own money to rebuild the mansion. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I feel like Hideki is manipulating you. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Going to a deficit instead of a profit. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why would you trust this child? - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Because I'm always willing to give people a second chance. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fighting the Gezo? He can't be that stupid. He's up to something. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's probably trying to get jutsus out of you for fighting the Gezo. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But, You do have a point. - Sat Oct 17 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I bet that's exactly what he's doing. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You do have a point . . . Yes. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then he'll turn around and reveal he was never that stupid. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He's asked me for the genjutsu I used on him. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And isn't fighting them. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am not sure anymore. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's a monster. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A very evil, disgusting person. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be careful of him. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can't just betray him. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes, Kilm....you can. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that when he said he lost a lot of people that atleast that was the truth. - Sat Oct 17 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since I actually know that he actually did lose family members and such. - Sat Oct 17 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want you to stop talking to him. Even now I'm tempted to kill him to keep you safe. - Sat Oct 17 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll tell him that I can't carry out the mission to attack the gezo after all. - Sat Oct 17 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And will stop talking to him. - Sat Oct 17 22:03:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If I wanted to. - Sat Oct 17 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Allow me to be nearby -- even if Hideki's not aware I'm there -- when you talk to him. - Sat Oct 17 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 17 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he tries to kill you, I'll kill him first. - Sat Oct 17 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Also, The possibility of the gezo attacking us . . . I'll use that to motivate my training. - Sat Oct 17 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It'll maybe fasten my progress. - Sat Oct 17 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- You 'didn't' teach him that genjutsu did you? - Sat Oct 17 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No I didn't. - Sat Oct 17 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good. He's in Sunagakure for jutsus I'm betting. - Sat Oct 17 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anything he says about it is a lie for cover. - Sat Oct 17 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fighting the Gezo? Even thight might be a lie. - Sat Oct 17 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A cover up. - Sat Oct 17 22:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and wanders off.* - Sun Oct 18 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) produces a clone of earth. Afterwords she rises to her feet and lazily walks off, headed towards the desert. The clone follows her. When the two are in an appropriate place, Kat has the clone stand several feet away from her. Once there, Kat and her clone both slowly draw a right foot backwards.

Arms rise and hands clench partially, as if to mimic claws. Both Kat 'and' the clone then make use of the earth chakra flow jutsu. It's the reason Katsune is out here. To master this jutsu. Abruptly the two then charge at each other, sprinting.

Both teens move as a blur. Both are slow when it comes to punching but both are very fast. The result is Katsune hitting her clone much more often than it hits her. The clone after all isn't sentient. It can't fight as competently as a result without Katsune's instructions and she can't do that while engaging it in close range.

Whenever it does punch her, more often than not, Kat tosses an arm up. Her gauntlet meets her clone's with a very loud metallic clang. Kat's gauntlet being reinforced by doton chakra is pretty much invincible. It's durable so that's a start but when you consider this along with the fact that it's a chakra flow weapon, the end result is quite good. Kat and her clone spar for hours. Eventually  though she gets rid of it and goes to rest.

After a good night's sleep, the teen returns to her training grounds. With her are two wheel barrows of equipment. She pulls one and her clone pulls the other. In each wheel barrow are weapons. Wooden spears, steel spears, iron spears, and more. 

It's mostly all spears, though with dulled tips. Almost every single piece of equipment is of a different material. With this in mind, Kat and her clone both pick up a different weapon. They take one of the exact same type for one reason. If one uses a sharper weapon, they'll kill the other.

After pouring chakra into her wooden weapon, Kat flourishes it. It spins to and fro, being twirled in every direction she can manage. She's eying it for the moment. Each time she spins it, her hands are moving relatively slowly. Kat's testing it.

She has no skill with spears though. As a result, she suffers a loss to speed with it. The only other possible consequence would be hurting herself but no; if she's careful, that isn't gonna happen. Not unless she's stupid and tries to use it as quickly as her arms and hands can move. With this in mind, Kat then charges at her clone.

She moves as a blur. Mostly she simply holds the spear towards the clone while sprinting. As a result, running speed plays an enormous roll in whether or not she'll hit it. That being said, this is a clone so it's as fast as Kat. As a result, it very easily evades her.

Kat comes to a stop. Her clone retaliates so she's forced to lift her spear. Swiftly she bats her sparring partner's spear to and fro. Each time, a very loud and nice metallic clang is sounded off. Hours pass.* - Sun Oct 18 00:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to a different part of the desert, on a different day. The teen is tired of training her chakra flow technique. More importantly, she needs to train her ability to transition from jutsu to jutsu. That's probably more important than anything else for her at the moment. Kat's eventually planted her feet in an area chock full of cacti.

The closest thing to a tree you'll usually find in a desert. This is of course a place she's used for training before. She's using it for training again too. One of her feet slides backwards through the desert and Katsune takes her usual stance. Slowly she draws in a deep, silent breath.

Once she's done, she forms the tiger seal. The girl flickers out of sight entirely. When she reappears, she's in point blank range of a cacti. Already one of her hands is clenched into a fist and her arm is drawn backwards. The girl then has to wait for five or six entire seconds.

When time time finally passes, Kat sharply and quickly pours earth release chakra into her gauntlet. The weapon becomes twice as hard as it already was. With that done, Kat shoves her fist forwards. It rams into the cactus in front of her with a loud crunch. Immediately afterwords, Katsune takes a few slow steps backwards.

The few turns into an awful lot, and she ends up twleve full feet away once more. Time passes. Eventually she's comfortable performing the shunshin jutsu again. Once more, she races forwards as a blur. Once more, she rams a hardened gauntlet into her target. This training goes on for several hours, and Katsune is soaked in sweat by the time she's done.* - Sun Oct 18 02:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins turning around upon entering the area. Mid-turn, though, she stops. Eyes fall on Bryson.

She nods in response to his whispering. It's why she stopped.* - Sun Oct 18 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah. - Sun Oct 18 02:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Are you? - Sun Oct 18 02:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Alright." Katsune says as she comes to a stop, facing Bryson.

"Remember. You can't teach this to absolutely anyone without my explicite permission. If I die, I ask you to never teach it to -anyone."

Kat says with a very stern expression on her face.

"It -really- would be -extremely- dangerous to do that, even if you don't understand why. Take my word for it. It would be a horrible mistake."* - Sun Oct 18 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Katsune's arms then rise and her hands meet to form the tiger seal. Abruptly, she then flickers out of sight.

When she reappears, she's ten feet to the west. "The shunshin jutsu." she says, deadly serious about this D rank technique. No jokes.

Katsune herself is planning on taking this jutsu even further. Eventually she'll be using the technique ten times per second if all goes well. As such, if anyone 'else' were to try and mimic that with the same technique, obviously it could be very useful.

As opposed to using a third or even half of a chuunin's chakra pool when they use it ten times in a row, the person would be able to use this technique for basically no chakra at all -- much like Katsune. As such, it's pretty important she gets her point accross. It legitimately would be dangerous to spread Katsune's knowledge of Shunshin.

"You want to pour chakra into all of the nerves in your body to stimulate them. They'll grow stronger as a result, and allow you to move faster." Katsune performs the jutsu yet again after a mere five seconds or so. She appears ten feet to the east instead.

"It's pretty simple honestly. It's a D ranked technique. Learning it will be extremely easy. Getting as little chakra as possible out of it might take a bit of time, but I'll make sure you get there."

And of course, Kat would spend as long as it takes teaching him. Considering he's a priest and thus struggles immensely with chakra, it'll probably take ten days or so.

It races forwards, capable of ramming into and carrying away pretty much anyone in the right hands. This mud streams forwards for several long seconds. Eventually Kat has a nice, long river. Once she's done setting the field, her hands part.

The girl waits. Eventually her chakra in her chakra circuits has stopped going wild, so she weaves three more handseals. When those are complete, Kat summons the usual dragon head of mud. Its eyes leer ahead and its muddy fangs drip constantly. Its eyes and throat glow white.

After a brief moment, a stream of mud balls begins coming out. They all race forwards in the form of a barrage. It's reminiscent of bullets flying out of a machine gun, complete with the very loud and rattling bang accompnying every single ball. Eventually Kat's dragon runs out of ammo. Hands part and meet again to repeat this effect, and this goes on for hours.* - Sun Oct 18 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to a known bandit encampment. With this in mind, Kat erects an earthen corridor around the camp. Immediately, the camp goes nuts. Shouting and cursing is heard. They're almost half as crass as Katsune.

Already, Kat's preparing her mud sillhouette. It follows, and reaches the entrance of her earthen corridor by the time the first bandit comes walking through. He's hit hard and sent flying through the gates. As such, the others hesitate to come out. This is good, because Kat needs time to prepare her jutsu.

Three more handseals are weaved. Kat holds them, and chooses not to attack just yet. Shouting is heard as the bandits' leader begins rounding the others up. She commands them to grow a pair and get going. One such bandit is kicked butt-first into the entrance. He stumbles.

Hesitation is apparent. Eventually though more bandits follow. They glance to and fro at each other in confusion and fear. Eventually though they all summon up enough bravado to attack. All of them shout at the top of their lungs and begin racing forwards, just as Katsune planned.

With a nod, the girl waits until they get close. They're only twelve feet away when Kat shoves chakra into the mud below. Immediately the dragon's head she loves so much rises up out of her mud. Eyes leer ahead with a smug look in them. Its smile is a smug one too.

Before Kat's target practice dummies even have time to react, the dragon's unleashing another barrage of mud bullets for the day. All of said bullets charge forwards relentlessly. Each time an enemy is hit, it's sent flying. Bandits are heard grunting non-stop each time one is hit. There are hundreds of bullets and hundreds of bandits, so it's perfect.

Kat's lips twitch and she smiles a bit. There are few things she enjoys more than beating the fuck out of people. More handseals are formed as bandits continue rushing out. This time, three or four times as many come racing forwards. The earth shakes a little, even, due to the stampede.

Kat's hands move once more for more handseals. Another dragon's head and more bullets come forwards. Yet again, Kat's enemies are pelted. This time, some bandits are clever enough to take hold of their allies. With them in hand, they use them as human shields.

The chuunin's laughter is muffled to complete silence by the barrage of her mud, but she chuckles a bit with sadistic amusement at the sight. Her dragon fades away, and Kat's left open for a few seconds. Bandits draw near, only to be knocked back by yet another Mud Sillhouette. Another Earth Dragon Bomb follows. That is after all why Kat's here.

She's simply training her jutsu. Nothing else. She could easily kill all of these people, but she's choosing to keep them alive. If they stay alive it'll be that much easier to practice this over the coming months. Many long hours pass.

Occasionally Kat's toys seem to be getting tired. Their resolve weakens. When they realize that they aren't dying, they seem to choose to stay hidden within Kat's earthen corridor. In response, Kat sends in a clone to harrass them. It chases them around with Raiton Flash.

Some even go so far as to cry. They're bandits after all, so they're on average not very intelligent. Brutes come stumbling out, holding their sides or other sore, bruised areas. Unrelenting, Katsune fires more mud balls with her technique. Kat's karma steadily drops even lower.* - Sun Oct 18 09:50:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Her palms find her hips and her weight shifts a bit. "You've seen me do this jutsu a thousand times." she says. "So no displays, but I'll help you figure it out as you go."

Kat passes him a scroll.

"Made this for you a few days ago." she says.* - Sun Oct 18 10:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then kneels down. Palms meet the earth. "No handseals needed." she says, as she can't be sure he's aware of this fact.

"You pour pure, unadulterated chakra into the ground. It'll be invisible. You send it to the enemies feet then. The fun part...." she says as she pours it forwards.

"Is that you can easily change the destination if your enemy moves before your chakra reaches them. And then when it reaches their feet, you convert it all to earth chakra and create spikes from the earth already present in the ground. When you've done that. . ."

Four earth spikes of rather large size abruptly dart forwards from the ground, only ten feet away. The sound is loud and reminiscent of a sword being ripped from its sheathe.

"You force the spikes to come racing out as quickly as possible. All four at once."* - Sun Oct 18 10:14:49 2015
