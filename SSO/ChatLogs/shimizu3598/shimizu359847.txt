<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sat Oct 24 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the trio. Afterwords her hands meet to form the tiger seal. Eyes wander over the three in turn as she says "This is the tiger seal."

Kat's hands move a bit to show them the seal, carefully, to make sure they're following.

"You'll need it until you've mastered this jutsu. When you've mastered it you won't need any seals at all and I highly reccomend you do master it. Some people have genjutsu that paralyze you completely so the only way to get out of it is with kai completely mastered. Some people are petty and won't hesitate to kill you in this disgusting way for -no- reason at all. They did that to me once and I would've died but my gauntlets saved me."

Kat's palms find her hips now since the jutsu itself isn't something she can actually physically show them.

"Now, with your hands in the tiger seal, stop the flow of every single last bit of chakra within your body. Once you're positve you've stopped it completely, take control over it and very roughly shove it throughout. When you've become very good at this -- when you're near mastery -- you might want to focus only on the chakra in your brain instead."* - Sat Oct 24 20:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: What a suspicious name for a scroll. . . - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She then rises to her feet and turns to follow him.* - Sat Oct 24 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: . - Sat Oct 24 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sets her open shadowclone scroll down on the coffee table. Her butt rests on her living room couch with one leg crossed over the other. Kat's hands meet to form the clone seal. For the first time, she attempts to perform this jutsu. Chakra is poured out to her side to attempt to form a single shadowclone.* - Sat Oct 24 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) manages to form a clone. It has a shadow but no physical form. It's as if she used the bunshin jutsu and only succeeded to a small extent in the "shadow" part. With a silent sigh Kat parts her hands and then forms the clone seal once more. Once more, she attempts the new jutsu.* - Sat Oct 24 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sucessfully makes an identical clone on her second attempt. With a good-humored scoff that suggests laughter, Kat then hands the scroll back to Index.

"Thanks." she says.

"This'll help a lot I'm sure. Now my clones can use lightning and explosion release. I'm excited."* - Sat Oct 24 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sat Oct 24 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gonna spend the day mastering this. - Sat Oct 24 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might be the best technique I have now. - Sat Oct 24 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: According to this scroll, my clones can travel very long distances once I've mastered it. - Sat Oct 24 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could leave a clone doing paper work in the Hokage mansion while I do missions. - Sat Oct 24 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That'd be nice. - Sat Oct 24 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "I'll be outside." Kat says. The teen then wanders outside, to train by the door. She intends to spar with her clones to train the jutsu and doing that indoors could harm furniture. When the door is shut behind her, Kat forms the clone seal and conjures up a shadow clone. Immediately her clone wanders off at a lazy pace to the south.

So now with that done, Kat turns to face the entity and takes her usual stance. In consists of her sliding her right foot backwards in the dirt and then lifting her arms. When they're lifted, she clenches her hands partially as if to mimic claws. Katsune's clone mimics her entirely. For many long seconds, they only stare at each other.

Afterwords both sprint. Both clones move as a blur. Upon meeting each other, they begin throwing punches and kicks. Each time of course the attacks are evaded. Kat's reflexes are fantastic but her attacking speed is terrible, as you might expect of the average ninjutsu specialist.* - Sat Oct 24 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes back in and sits down a few hours later, with a silent sigh.

Arms cross and one leg crosses over the other.

By now she is of course very tired from training.* - Sat Oct 24 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) removes her gauntlets. Afterwords Katsune pulls out a scroll and unrolls it. It's left on the table for her to see and read through. With gauntlets removed, the teen then forms the snake seal. The one used most often for doton release.

According to the scroll, it's also the one used for Domu. Now, Kat keeps in mind the process needed to use the earth chakra flow technique. The process used for Domu is likely very similar. After all one is channeling doton chakra just as they do for chakra flow. The only difference is, it's being used on one's own body rather than a weapon.

Of course, as Kat expected, her scroll confirms that there are some very obvious differences. If there weren't any, then one could use normal chakra flow to strengthen their body. However with the scroll's guidance, this is presumably very easy. In time, Kat notices her skin turning a bit gray in color. Blankly she stares down at the scene.

That is of course why she'd removed her gauntlets. To watch the process as it happens. She needs to be sure she's doing this correctly. With a hardened fingernail, Kat extends a hand. Gently she prods at her opposite hand with the fingernal, testing her skin's new strength. She needs to be sure that more than just color is being changed.* - Sat Oct 24 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Good." Kat says after observing her failure. Color and nothing else is right! That's all that Kat managed. Her skin's as soft as ever. If she's to pass the Private Exams, she'll want this jutsu mastered completely. 

"Not as easy as elemental jutsus but I'll master it eventually. I'll be using that jutsu often so I'm sure I won't have to train it by myself often." With that said, Kat stands back up. She's forming the snake seal and attempting her Domu technique once more already. "I'm going back outside though." Kat says.

"I need to master this jutsu. It's way more important that I do."
And so, as stated, Kat exits the building. This time, she parks herself next to a large boulder with gauntlets still removed. Even with her skin still hardened, Kat takes her stance.

Slowly and silently, the teen takes in a deep breath. This jutsu isn't that difficult to do without handseals if one's only using it on the hands. As such, she's able to maintain it without the seals. She's also able to practice it in that manner. So, abruptly, Kat launches a fist forwards.

When her fist touches the stone, she flinches and winces. Eyes are closed for the brief moment, and a sharp breath is taken through the nose. That hurt, a -lot-. Even so, Kat takes her fist back. Rather than giving up, she concentrates harder. 

More chakra is poured into her fist. Abruptly, Kat launches another punch. Once more it stings. Even so, hours pass. Punch after punch is thrown, and not in rapid succession by any means. 

The pain seems to motivate her body too. It responds accordingly and the chakra flows more easily. In time, Kat's fists are quite hard indeed. Harder maybe even than the stone she punches. That, or the pain has numbed her so much that she's stopped feeling it.

The chakra cost remains an issue though so Kat's training continues. Now she's able to punch way more quickly and so she does so. A barrage is launched, with the rock releasing a loud thump each time it's hit. Occasionally Kat even launches kicks at it, as hard as she can manage. Despite her effort, her toes aren't stubbed.

In time, Kat gains a deeper understanding of her new jutsu. The chakra cost steadily gets lower and lower. She also begins wondering how in the world Zetsumo is dead if he mastered 'this' jutsu. She can barely feel a thing. In fact, it's as if someone's gently touching her toes, or fists.

The private exams as she's heard usually consist of the participant being forced to fight hordes and hordes of people. If that's true, then surely there can be no greater asset than durability. Numbers overwhelm but if none of your enemies can harm you, the numbers hardly matter. She'll need only to focus on enemies that use the raiton element. In time, Kat's managed to put a few scratches on her target.* - Sat Oct 24 23:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) summons up a clone. A shadow clone. The girl then forms the snake seal. Abruptly her skin turns a very dark gray in color. Arms then cross, and she simply stares at it. 

It already knows what it was summoned for, so the clone wastes no time. Abruptly it sprints towards its mistress, moving as a blur. When it reaches her, Kat's clone launches a punch at her face. Naturally the girl doesn't even budge. Her skin's harder and more importantly, her clone has no physical strength whatsoever just like the original.

More punches are thrown. Kicks, too, follow. In time, Kat's feeling confident. For this reason she asks her clone to try some jutsus. It complies of course. Without hesitation it nods and places a palm against Kat's cheek. 

Abruptly, a loud gunshot-like bang is heard. Explosion-natured chakra had been released. The real Katsune falls over, and is even launched into the nearby rock with a loud thump. As she picks herself up from the ground she silently sighs, with a weak smile on her face. She'd been knocked aside.

Even so, there's no pain. "Good." she says as she rises to her feet and brushes herself off. "Again." The clone immediately launches another exploding palm. In time, Kat decides to simply stop getting up. Eyes close, and she allows herself to be thrown to and fro like a rag doll.* - Sat Oct 24 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders back into the house and takes a seat. It's at this time that she picks her plate up and begins eating. Cold stake. Delicious.

The girl should've ate it before she went to go train for hours on end, but she was motivated.

"Thanks." she says.* - Sat Oct 24 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sat Oct 24 23:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and extends her arm.

Beneath the clothing she secretly reinforces her skin and flesh with doton release chakra.

Hue.* - Sat Oct 24 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Wait. - Sat Oct 24 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) removes her gauntlets and sets them aside.

"Okay." she says, extending her arm once more. This time her skin is visible, blackened color and all.

"Now I'm ready."* - Sat Oct 24 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Didn't want my gauntlets damaged. - Sat Oct 24 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Na." she says as her sleeve is burned to ash.

The girl retrieves her arm and examines the damage done as her skin turns caucasion once more.

"That's the penalty. Only fair since I didn't let you burn me."

She shrugs.

Afterwords she takes the dice and rolls them.* - Sun Oct 25 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lick leg. . . . - Sun Oct 25 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls her dice again to decide on a penalty, since she refuses to lick his leg.* - Sun Oct 25 00:02:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Worst-case-scenario. - Sun Oct 25 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's true. - Sun Oct 25 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and passes the dice.* - Sun Oct 25 00:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "There are wose rolls." she says.

The girl then turns to face Index. Palms rest on the couch at either side of her as her arms hold her up, and she rests her legs in his lap. Her chest is left accessible.

In the mean time she kicks off her boots.* - Sun Oct 25 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes a bit, having not expected him to choose that place in specific to cut.

"....Touche'." she says, staring down at the scene with a faint frown on her face.

Her bra is cut in half, and her assets bounce a bit as their restraints are cut loose.

Even so, nothing is revealed of course other than chest skin.

The girl reaches for a pillow from the back of the couch and rests it over her chest from this point onward.* - Sun Oct 25 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls dice afterwords.* - Sun Oct 25 00:18:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes him a hundred thousand yen.* - Sun Oct 25 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) summons a clone and sends it to fetch a lighter.

It's back shortly afterwords, and Kat motions with her head to Index's leg.

Without any hesitation the clone smiles a bit, kneels down, and lights his leg up.

It holds it there for five entire seconds, only letting the tip of the flame touch his flesh.

Will it actually damage him? Who knows.

It won't be permanent damage at any rate. At worse, his leg will sting for two entire weeks.* - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: worst* - Sun Oct 25 00:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Go for it though. - Sun Oct 25 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wipes her lips.

Gross.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thought it was lips for a second. - Sun Oct 25 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Whatever. - Sun Oct 25 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sets her pillow aside for the moment. Palms rest on the couch and she awaits her torture.* - Sun Oct 25 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't harmed since Index is holding back. Her resistance to ninjutsu is quite good.

The girl also loses much of her bodysuit, over the stomach. With a shrug, she brushes the fire off -- literally speaking, with a Domu-clad hand.

Afterwords she picks her pillow up and covers herself up once more.

Kat then rolls her dice.* - Sun Oct 25 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . - Sun Oct 25 00:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A hundred thousand is a lot. - Sun Oct 25 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) waits for Index to offer up his arm.

Her eyes are averted in the mean time.* - Sun Oct 25 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sticks her tongue out and licks his arm.

It's gross, but better than paying a hundred thousand yen.

Afterwords she picks up a bottle of sake and pours an awful lot of it down her throat, wincing a bit in the process.

Gotta wash the taste of arm out of her mouth.

Kat then passes the dice.* - Sun Oct 25 00:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Back* - Sun Oct 25 00:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns around. Kat's left lying on her belly with elbows on the couch, and palms on her face. Her back is left visible for Index to cut.* - Sun Oct 25 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns back over, wincing only a bit in response to the cutting.

She rolls her dice.* - Sun Oct 25 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---- - Sun Oct 25 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Going to be painful...But I'll survive. - Sun Oct 25 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles at this and hovers up into the air.

Kat's arms meet behind her back, and she stares down at Index.

Her foot turns pitch black, and both feet are level with his stomach.* - Sun Oct 25 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls her leg back as far as she can.

Afterwords Katsune launches her foot forwards, aiming to kick Index in the gut as hard as she possibly can with her domu-enforced foot.* - Sun Oct 25 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits back down.* - Sun Oct 25 00:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Lips.. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hey, I'd like to reccomend a rule. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd like to reroll. - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is that fair? - Sun Oct 25 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fair enough. - Sun Oct 25 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you want to re-roll when that happens, you can. - Sun Oct 25 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Thanks. - Sun Oct 25 00:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this with eyes averted, and a blush on her cheeks.* - Sun Oct 25 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't meet him half way at all. She makes him climb up onto her and such.

When their lips meet, as per the Random Number God's command relayed to these humble mortals through dice, Kat feeds him her tongue and such, while suckling on his own.

Her lips turn far more red.

She allows this to go on until he pulls away, in the name of fairness.* - Sun Oct 25 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I'm going to pray...To the dice god more often. - Sun Oct 25 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the dice and stares at them for a moment. Eventually though she shrugs and tosses them aside, without any excess amount of force.

"'Kay." she says.

"No more dice."

Eye contact is made, with her blush still very much in place.

"Training time?"* - Sun Oct 25 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

The girl then hovers up into the air without taking his hand.

Her feet soon meet the floor east of the couch. Without pausing Kat turns on her heel and begins walking away to the east, to the door.* - Sun Oct 25 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Gotta change clothes first. - Sun Oct 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go grab new clothes. One of her many spare body suits, because anime logic.

Afterwords she leaves the house, leading the way to wherever.* - Sun Oct 25 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Sun Oct 25 01:18:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Shunshin? - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your choice. - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: S-Shunshin is the high speed movement technique right..? - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aye. You'd be learning from a scroll. - Sun Oct 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's fine.. - Sun Oct 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That the one you want? - Sun Oct 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Sun Oct 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and passes him the scroll she's prepared. She'd made this one days ago with him in mind.

"I'll need it back when you're done." she says.

"I'd like you to never share it with anyone either."* - Sun Oct 25 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 25 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In the mean time I'll just. . . - Sun Oct 25 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Practice one I got from Seisuke. - Sun Oct 25 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Huh? - Sun Oct 25 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she conjures up an earth shadow clone. Abrupty she then attacks it, using only her legs. "This technique." she says, even as she fails to trip her clone. Often she leaps up into the air by about one foot and launches both feet at it, as if to use a bycicle kick.

"Taijutsu." she says while practicing.* - Sun Oct 25 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) continues practicing. Presumably even an hour passes while Index slaves away at the shunshin technique. Katsune trains for the entire time, trying to grasp this technique. It's sure to prove useful at some point, so she trains hard. At some point she swaps her clone out for the non-elemental varient.

This way, she can learn from the clone's experiences too. Naturally her clone begins kicking at her as well. They both dance, with legs flying all over the place. Due to the nature of this technique, in time, their legs move as a blur for every kick. This is a technique that uses running speed to determine the speed of attacks.

An incredibly deadly taijutsu technique.* - Sun Oct 25 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the scroll back with a nod. In the mean time Index probably needs rest so Kat keeps practicing. "I'll tell you a secret." she says while kicking at her clone. Occasionally the clone, with a grunt, is hit and it fades away. In response, Kat creates another one.

"It's possible to master that jutsu to an extent to where it barely phases you. Takes enormous amounts of time, though."* - Sun Oct 25 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clone occasionally manages to successfully kick the real Katsune. The girl doubles over a bit and stumbles even as her clone's barrage persists. In the mean time she forms the snake seal to protect herself, being covered in Domu.

Even so, she's tossed to and fro like a ragdoll until the series of seven kicks is over with. In time, she picks herself back up. Moving as a blur, Kat launches herself at her clone. With gusto, more kicks are launched in its direction. "Heh." she says.

"That was dirty!"

The girl taunts.....herself.* - Sun Oct 25 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. Tired now. - Sun Oct 25 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see.. - Sun Oct 25 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What now? - Sun Oct 25 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wanna train. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do you mind? - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Got exams to prepare for after all. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mind training with me I mean. Or watching, or whatever. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Either is fine.. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know other stuff probably seems more fun but that's ninja life for you. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Training or watching, whichever is better for you. - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. . . - Sun Oct 25 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Whichever is fine. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have clones to spar with after all, if you don't feel like helping. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: No, It's fine, I'll spar with you. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Speaking of clones. . . - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Probably what I should train first. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Sun Oct 25 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and conjures up a shadow clone. The clone then makes its way over to Index.

"I'll spar with you." the clone says, eying him. "That way I can train this jutsu." The real Kat nods, looking the clone up and down.

She's not used to it being able to speak for her. The clone takes a stance.* - Sun Oct 25 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "No need to hold back." The clone says.

"Not like you can kill a clone."

The teen then sprints forwards. It moves as a blur. Upon drawing close to him it comes skidding to a stop. Abruptly it launches a kick towards Index. Her foot beneath her boot turns black for the brief moment, making use of the domu technique to strengthen her strike.

Should Kat's clone's foot reach Index, it'd pick up the other leg in the same motion. Abruptly a series of kicks would be launched at him. Seven kicks, in all.* - Sun Oct 25 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the incoming flames.

Abruptly it'd simply lean backwards and throw itself in that direction, into a somersault. Its hands and feet would meet the ground several times.

By the end of the clone's display, she'd be a good distance away from him. Her palms would still be on the ground, too, with her on all fours. Abruptly, doton chakra is sent forwards through the ground. It'd stop only at Index's feet. Four very dulled spikes come out of the dirt.

All four of them would aim to ram into the clone's opponent. All are aimed at his mid-section.* - Sun Oct 25 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Huh. - Sun Oct 25 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know I just realized! - Sun Oct 25 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I master this jutsu my clones can go with you whenever you leave the village. - Sun Oct 25 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This jutsu should be forbidden. It's too good and too dangerous. - Sun Oct 25 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clone simply directs its senses at him to determine his location. Since he can't see her at this time, she simply pours chakra into the ground. This chakra goes straight for Index's feet. Should it meet him, the clone would be pulled under.

When it reaches Index, it'd reach out with both arms. An attempt is made to pull him under the earth, to leave him stuck. Afterwords the clone would pull itself out of the ground nearby and launch itself into another backwards somersault. Eyes are locked onto the now presumably prone Index, to see how he reacts.* - Sun Oct 25 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Huh." the clone scoffs, in a good-humored manner. She can sense the chakra coming after her in the ground, so she can't be sure what it did. She can be sure, however, that Index somehow sensed her. She can probably infer as to what just happened. Even so, she'd still pulled herself out of the ground.

At this time, Kat's hands meet as it rises into a straight-up, standing position. Five full handseals are weaved through. With that done, it sprints forwards, moving as a blur. Abruptly, the clone's right arm lights up in a neon blue display of color and power. The reverating, crackling roar of electricity warns of lightning.

Kat's arm flies forwards. From the clone's hand comes a powerful stream of lightning. For the sake of Index's safety it's cast out as a net, meaning it's way easier to hit him and also weaker too. At best, it'll stun and hurt like hell. It won't kill him though.

The clone also does its best to hold back on the power in general, only feeding the jutsu half of its chakra or so. Hopefully, he'll be fine.* - Sun Oct 25 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands part, to end the jutsu rather than continue torturing Index. Afterwords its hands meet to form the tiger seal. Abruptly a river of mud would form in front of the clone. 

It'd then come racing forwards, with force. Should the river not be stopped or evaded in some way it'd hit Index hard, in the face, and send him rolling. The jutsu would also carry him a great distance away. Eight full feet or so, even. The range is tremendous as always.

The real Katsune seeps into the dirt and follows after Index, moving very quickly as she does so. Magnetic senses and other senses are all locked onto him, to determine whether or not he's okay. The girl's clone had held back, too, so he wasn't hit with the full force at least for the initial impact. The clone sends a glance towards the plume of dust from before, only to be sure Index isn't hiding a clone or something inside.* - Sun Oct 25 02:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Probably a good time to end this. . . - Sun Oct 25 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Starting about thirty seconds ago. . . - Sun Oct 25 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clone disappears in a plume of smoke. Not shunshin, though. Kat made it disappear. At a lazy pace she now comes crawling out of the earth at Index's side. Her hands move to brush herself off, and she stares down at him from above.

"Well." she says.
"Yeah. You could've probably done without the mud silhouette."* - Sun Oct 25 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Afterwords she kneels down to pick him up. During the process she pours earth release chakra into his body to turn his weight to absolutely nothing. With a shrug, she places him on her shoulder. Katsune then hovers up into the air and flies back to her house with him in tow.* - Sun Oct 25 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sets Index down when they get to the house, carelessly leaving him to fall over should he do so. Afterwords she goes to the couch and sits down.* - Sun Oct 25 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ...Bored. We should go to the town square. - Sun Oct 25 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: --- - Sun Oct 25 02:40:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But if I asked you to hold my hand while we went there would you? - Sun Oct 25 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Naw...She won't. - Sun Oct 25 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. . . - Sun Oct 25 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Leaning towards no though. - Sun Oct 25 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Sun Oct 25 02:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the tiger seal. Abruptly Kat disappears. When she reappears she's at the door. She opens it, leaving Index hanging, and walks away.

Of course, he has plenty of time to catch up to her. She's not exactly running.* - Sun Oct 25 02:46:24 2015
