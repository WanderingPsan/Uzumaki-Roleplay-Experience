<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I'm speaking so openly with all of you. - Wed Sep 23 12:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: He says he and flexus are looking for work - Wed Sep 23 12:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- As for my kage position, it's complicated. - Wed Sep 23 12:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I am assuming they are mercenaries? - Wed Sep 23 12:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And one more thing - Wed Sep 23 12:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What of Zenaki and Suitengu? - Wed Sep 23 12:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Have they made their way here yet? - Wed Sep 23 12:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: For the record, Kilm, I've realized Erebus is trying to be your friend. Just make sure you don't open yourself up to him completely. He's trying to steal you from me. - Wed Sep 23 12:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know . . . I won't let him play me. - Wed Sep 23 12:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had whispered something.* - Wed Sep 23 12:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Should we have killed them then? - Wed Sep 23 12:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Judging by their behavior I've decided that one of two things must be true. - Wed Sep 23 12:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either A., they're wanting to stay and are afraid to tell me that -- which would be fine if they were open with me. - Wed Sep 23 12:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or...... - Wed Sep 23 12:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They're being manipulated into staying, somehow. - Wed Sep 23 12:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Intimidated. - Wed Sep 23 12:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Actually I'd like to find out which. - Wed Sep 23 12:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Where are they? - Wed Sep 23 12:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 12:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Well. - Wed Sep 23 12:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is eying Beth, waiting for her to speak.* - Wed Sep 23 12:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I guess I should look into that. - Wed Sep 23 12:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances between the two of them.* - Wed Sep 23 12:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I would hate to lose Zenaki to kirigakure. As well as Zetusmos child that wont happen. - Wed Sep 23 12:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Then perhaps we should go gather them - Wed Sep 23 12:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 23 12:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Indeed. - Wed Sep 23 12:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Shin, you were already seen stirring up trouble in the town square. You'd draw attention. - Wed Sep 23 12:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They know you're with Konoha. - Wed Sep 23 12:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 12:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But...Beth. I think that'd work. - Wed Sep 23 12:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do you want this mission? - Wed Sep 23 12:19:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Sure I'll take care of it. - Wed Sep 23 12:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. The mission is. . . - Wed Sep 23 12:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To find out for sure...beyond any shadow of any doubt....whether or not they really are there of their own will. - Wed Sep 23 12:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: s-should i...g-go as well.. - Wed Sep 23 12:21:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure. - Wed Sep 23 12:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hypothetically speaking, would you be okay having Paine and Shin along, Beth? It's your mission, so it's your choice. - Wed Sep 23 12:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't know which conditions you'd prefer. - Wed Sep 23 12:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 23 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Take this bird - Wed Sep 23 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: They know of me - Wed Sep 23 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: So i'll await outside - Wed Sep 23 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't let them know you're on a mission, please. For Konoha's sake. - Wed Sep 23 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: All you have to do is signal the bird if you need support - Wed Sep 23 12:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We don't want to annoy the most powerful village on the planet. - Wed Sep 23 12:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Other than that, I shall wait quietl;y - Wed Sep 23 12:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. This mission is....probably A rank. - Wed Sep 23 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I should probably change my look. - Wed Sep 23 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should all be very careful. - Wed Sep 23 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: As should I - Wed Sep 23 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hope you plan before even leaving the village. Every single detail, charted out. - Wed Sep 23 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you don't, I expect you'll all die. - Wed Sep 23 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hope you take it seriously. - Wed Sep 23 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: MHm. - Wed Sep 23 12:27:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh I got one in mind. - Wed Sep 23 12:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Subtle as in not likely to make it obvious you're not supposed to be there. - Wed Sep 23 12:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -smiles- - Wed Sep 23 12:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 12:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- We're doing well, Taiga. - Wed Sep 23 12:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Alrighty then. - Wed Sep 23 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I take it those are off doing something important. - Wed Sep 23 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Wed Sep 23 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. I suspect they're never coming home. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I should've gave it to someone else. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Probably the worst decision I ever made. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have hopes that they'll return. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: They just left. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: You can still stop them. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I would've went if I wasn't so tired from the S rank. - Wed Sep 23 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: 'Hmph'? What is she? A Tsundere? - Wed Sep 23 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Have more faith, Katsune. - Wed Sep 23 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: So missions have arrived huh? - Wed Sep 23 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Wed Sep 23 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. This wasn't that sort of mission. - Wed Sep 23 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Unfortunately. - Wed Sep 23 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We weren't hired. - Wed Sep 23 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just personal matters. - Wed Sep 23 12:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I see. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did I make sure to tell them this was an A rank mission? - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They didn't seem to take it seriously. That's what worries me. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They'll die if they're not careful. Or worse. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure will be irritated with us. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Ya know. I shouldn't have said Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That shouldn't leave this room. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Isn't there anyone else who could've done it? - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wanted it to be Beth only. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: One person alone wouldn't draw much attention. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then why did it end up being three people? - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Paine and Shin were eying me with puppy dog eyes for a mission though. - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 12:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't change my mind now. If I irritate those two they'll find another village to stay at. - Wed Sep 23 12:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need them. - Wed Sep 23 12:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Katsune, you have to remember that you're the Hokage. Just because two of your shinobi are giving you the puppy dog eyes doesn't mean you should send them on a mission like that if you don't think they'll survive. - Wed Sep 23 12:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know. - Wed Sep 23 12:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This was a mistake. - Wed Sep 23 12:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can still stop them. - Wed Sep 23 12:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I should be fast enough. - Wed Sep 23 12:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Slightly tired but good enough. - Wed Sep 23 12:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hope they haven't left the village yet. - Wed Sep 23 12:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Wed Sep 23 12:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be back. - Wed Sep 23 12:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 12:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I did not give him that order. - Wed Sep 23 12:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: No you did not. - Wed Sep 23 12:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But I take it that you actually want him to stop them, right? - Wed Sep 23 12:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They've already left. - Wed Sep 23 12:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: This is the problem with the hokage being weak. - Wed Sep 23 12:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then you can only hope for the best. - Wed Sep 23 12:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll have faith in Beth. - Wed Sep 23 12:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If she lets me down, then I'll probably be the only one in trouble anyway. - Wed Sep 23 12:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I should leave the country. . . - Wed Sep 23 12:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: For a while. . . - Wed Sep 23 12:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be there to protect you if you get in trouble. - Wed Sep 23 12:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Maybe you should shift your focus to something else for now. Stressing over it won't do anything. - Wed Sep 23 12:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't believe that. Not stressing over anything is why Orakuru's dead. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It started a war. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why Kitora's dead. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo too. - Wed Sep 23 12:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I honestly have no comeback for that. - Wed Sep 23 12:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't let the stress affect your mental state too much. - Wed Sep 23 12:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How about. . . - Wed Sep 23 12:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I judge my own behavior, and you judge yours? - Wed Sep 23 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm just saying . . .  - Wed Sep 23 12:48:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The village has gotten way better though. - Wed Sep 23 12:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. Eyes wander.* - Wed Sep 23 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll be handing over the portion of Konohagakure I have control soon. - Wed Sep 23 12:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I've done my part, and I'm willing to entrust you with what's left to be done. - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see... - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You, Katsune, are not a dunce; you can handle things. - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I, however, will be at your disposal should you need me. - Wed Sep 23 12:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I will be around the village, but I won't be doing as much as I am already. - Wed Sep 23 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: After I get in contact with Kirigakure officials and see where Koeki stands in my plan, the rest is on you when it comes to this village. - Wed Sep 23 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ya know... - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've never been with Beth on a mission. - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aside from the scouting one, way back then. - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm... - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I almost killed her in Amegakure.. - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Recently? - Wed Sep 23 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Recently as in after Zetsumo's death, yes. - Wed Sep 23 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She came here, and I've told her she can stay. She's a bit...sadistic. Bloodthirsty. But she's very skilled. - Wed Sep 23 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Request her appearance once again. - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's on a mission. - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'd like a second conversation- - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Right. - Wed Sep 23 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I should privately ask Paine and Shin for reports when they get back. I'd like to know how she leads. - Wed Sep 23 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If she's good at it, I could use more chuunin. - Wed Sep 23 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: This was the first serious mission I've ever given out. I'm definitely going to learn fast from this mistake. - Wed Sep 23 13:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: At the end of the day, it's just a rank and vest. - Wed Sep 23 13:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course. I'm only letting competent people wear it. - Wed Sep 23 13:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I was put on the spot with Kilm. . . - Wed Sep 23 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What is the need of asking them privately? Was the mission that important..? - Wed Sep 23 13:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 13:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sips at her coffee. Eyes wander, slowly.* - Wed Sep 23 13:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- They're in Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..There's no time for jokes, Katsune. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She's serious. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What mission did you gi- - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And that was logical how..? - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It....was supposed to be only Beth. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This was a terrible mistake. I realize. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I -just- praised you of how competent you seemed.. - Wed Sep 23 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Literally.. -just-.. - Wed Sep 23 13:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For the record. If 'I' was responsible for this mission. - Wed Sep 23 13:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd be done quickly and I'd be done perfectly fine. - Wed Sep 23 13:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Maybe that seat has gotten to her head already.. - Wed Sep 23 13:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Right, right. - Wed Sep 23 13:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm starting to realize just how bad this is. - Wed Sep 23 13:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Starting..? - Wed Sep 23 13:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Beth will likely kidnap Zenaki. - Wed Sep 23 13:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's....impulsive. - Wed Sep 23 13:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I expected subtly but I don't know if she realized that. - Wed Sep 23 13:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe I should call them back. - Wed Sep 23 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Send me to Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm guessing the specific details I gave you of what I needed to get done just magically slipped your mind..? - Wed Sep 23 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I will recall them and do it myself. - Wed Sep 23 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's true a bird would have trouble finding them depending on how they took my "disguises" comment. However. - Wed Sep 23 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sending you to Kirigakure would be making the same stupid decision twice. - Wed Sep 23 13:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: There was a reason why I wanted- needed.. to do this mission myself.. - Wed Sep 23 13:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You asked for this mission? For Zenaki? - Wed Sep 23 13:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't remember that. - Wed Sep 23 13:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs. She pulls out a scroll and begins writing a letter.* - Wed Sep 23 13:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ....... - Wed Sep 23 13:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: This is your problem to fix. - Wed Sep 23 13:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I specifically told you that I will retrieve them from Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 23 13:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If Shin and Beth dies, it's on your head. - Wed Sep 23 13:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Go a head and send a bird to two people in a foreign land that no body knows who they are.. - Wed Sep 23 13:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: .... - Wed Sep 23 13:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're right. - Wed Sep 23 13:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I should go in person. - Wed Sep 23 13:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll accompany you. - Wed Sep 23 13:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) disappears, in a blur. She races out the door at her best speed.

The teen ignores Kilm entirely.

Her robe is removed along the way, long after she's gone.* - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you not thinking, or is this all a joke? - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: She ain't leaving without an escort. - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I'll wait by the gates if I need to. - Wed Sep 23 13:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sprints along, resting as little as possible. The teen knows she won't need her strength in Kirigakure, as her strength is meager anyway. The only thing she needs is lost time. Due to just how fast she is, the horribly under-aged kage leaves a trail of dust in her wake. She stops to speak to absolutely no one.

At only one point in time, Kat needs a break. She stops next to a tree, and takes some time to catch her breath. Legs are a bit sore. They tremble. Kat downs a bottle of water.

Afterwords, she stands up and resumes sprinting.* - Wed Sep 23 13:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs. Eventually she opts to instead stop in a different village and just send a damned bird. Once done, she turns on her heel and begins walking back to Konoha. If these three ignore her orders to return, then they deserve to die from this suicide mission in her opinion. That's one way to punish them without looking uncharismatic.

Along the way, Kat sleeps at an inn. During her stay she downs an entire bottle or two of sake, making it take that much longer for her to get home. It's not until after she's sobered up that she resumes walking. Along the way, she practices some jutsus. It was a very long walk.* - Wed Sep 23 13:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ignores Kilm, walking right past him.* - Wed Sep 23 13:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Wed Sep 23 13:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Not sure if to give her room for now. - Wed Sep 23 13:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: She probably needs it. - Wed Sep 23 13:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I'd like to be alone right now, Kilm. - Wed Sep 23 13:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay, I understand - Wed Sep 23 13:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits, bringing a bottle of sake with her. Eyes are averted and she sips at it at this time.* - Wed Sep 23 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: -- Didn't even recognize Beth. They would've been perfectly fine. - Wed Sep 23 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks: Who's makin Goo Goo Eyes at Erebus? - Wed Sep 23 14:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins preparing three big stacks of money and setting it on the desk in front of her, side-by-side. Eyes are averted when she taps the wooden structure afterwords, audibly.

"Your rewards." she says.

This money comes from her own, personal savings only.

What better way to ensure that any and all embarassment stays her's and no one else's?* - Wed Sep 23 14:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I'm not even going to ask. Everything was probably fine. - Wed Sep 23 14:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Probably. - Wed Sep 23 14:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Keep it - Wed Sep 23 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It is my contribution to the village - Wed Sep 23 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Is Beth here....? - Wed Sep 23 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: She was - Wed Sep 23 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I am unsure where she went - Wed Sep 23 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So she did return to the village. - Wed Sep 23 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hope she remembers to ask me for her pay. - Wed Sep 23 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Yes - Wed Sep 23 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes Shin's stack of money. She'd insist, but she's aware that the man has already been pouring his entire pay check into the village's funds, so she can't press it.* - Wed Sep 23 14:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . New people. - Wed Sep 23 14:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Konohagakure is almost restored . . . We'lll need to make squads soon. - Wed Sep 23 14:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Sure got crowded in here. - Wed Sep 23 14:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and turns to walk away, at a lazy pace. "I'll be training." she says.

"Being weak will only make my job an awful lot harder."* - Wed Sep 23 14:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 14:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Should start forming squads soon. - Wed Sep 23 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: S..Scuse me miss? - Wed Sep 23 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm...? - Wed Sep 23 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face Marissa, eying her with an eyebrow lifted.* - Wed Sep 23 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am Marissa, Formerly of the Sand. . I came here with Erebus as his travleing companion. I wish to apply for both citizenship and a postion among your Shinobi military force. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You'll get a headband. - Wed Sep 23 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) retrieves a headband from her desk and offers it to her.* - Wed Sep 23 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and wanders off.* - Wed Sep 23 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) returns to the same forest she'd trained in a day before. Hands are on Kat's hips while she wanders through the woods. Dead leaves are crushed beneath her boots with every step, and robes drag along. Slowly and silently, she draws in a breath. Being weak means she has to be extremely charismatic to compensate.

She after all needs all the help she can get. Even if punishments and such seem appropriate, she can't afford to do so for a very long while. The village needs to make a full recovery. For that to happen, she needs people to be happy for an extremely long time. She can't have people running off, because she has no way to discourage them from doing so.

And "charismatic" means submissive and very giving. Being everyone's favorite person is absolutely essential at the moment. Eventually, the inexperienced kage finds an appropriate setting. Trees are spread out similarly to how they'd been for Kat's last make-shift obstacle course. There are some differences, however. 

This time, some rough and somewhat large stones protrude out of the ground. A stump or two is scattered around as well, and a few bushes are visible. As part of her training with the body flicker technique, the teen intends to do her best to evade them while using shunshin. She'll be gaining control over the technique, chakra control in general, and resistances to the side-effects all at the same time.

Kat's arms rise and hands form the tiger handseal. Roughly and quickly, Kat shoves chakra to where it needs to be. All of her nerves and muscles twitch quite hard, very strongly compelling her to sprint. And she does so, as hard as she can. Naturally the kage moves as a blur. 

On the first attempt, Kat trips over a stone, barely, having been grazed by it on a boot. Abruptly she falls over, slamming face-first into the moist, soft ground. The teen trembles. An eyebrow twitches, and a scowl is on her burries face. Palms find the grass, though she takes several very long minutes to seeth in anger before slowly pushing herself up.* - Wed Sep 23 14:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually, slowly, picks herself up. The teen is left sitting on her butt with legs sprawled out underneath her form. She does her best to not sway to and fro, but even so, it's apparent that she's very dizzy. Deep, slow breaths are taken and her left sleeve finds her mouth to cover it. All of Kat's willpower is directed at not throwing up.

Slowly, the teen is able to eventually rise back up to her feet. Briefly, she brushes herself off, having gotten dirt on her robes. Once she's done, she turns on her heel and goes back to where she'd been before facing her obstacle course once more. Once positioned properly, Kat's arms rise again, and hands meet. The tiger seal is formed.

Chakra is smoothly sent to where it's supposed to be, very strongly stimulating Katsune's nerves. Just as before, when compelled, Kat sprints forwards. Rather than going around anything, Kat simply steps onto and over any and all obstacles along the way, while side-stepping away from trees. Slamming herself face-first into a tree would no doubt be unbelievably painful. This time, she's eventually skidding to a stop.

At the end of the motion, Kat's legs and arms tremble. Eyes close, and she focuses on breathing. Her face turns green. Lips tremble. The former Kenryoku member's stomach churns.

The dizzyness, though, eventually wears off. This is no harder than she expected it to be, though. Kat already knew this was going to be torture. She turns around at this time. Time to try the obstacle course in reverse.* - Wed Sep 23 15:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise and hands meet yet again. Yet again, she forms the tiger handseal. A glance is directed up at Kilm. By now, Katsune is actually eighty feet or so east of where he is, amonsgt trees. With his eyes, though, there's little doubt that he can spot her -- and has. The woman braces herself.

Abruptly, chakra is shoved throughout her system once more. Every nerve in her body is set on fire. Naturally, the kage sprints forwards as quickly as she can. Once more, she opts to simply walk over all obstacles in her way. These include stones, bushes, and tree stumps.

There's also the fact that trees are in her way. As such, she has to very rapidly step from side to side while moving to evade them. It's a very difficult thing to do. Not only are Katsune's reflexes less than god-like, but she has to do it while using shunshin as well. Eventually, Kat's feet come skidding to a stop.

A sharp breath is taken, and she sways to and fro. Eyes close, and her face is white. Katsune's breaths are fast, and there are many of them. Her chest rises and falls repeatedly, very quickly. The teen's head swims.* - Wed Sep 23 16:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Is this a good time to talk about something? - Wed Sep 23 16:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Konoha related. - Wed Sep 23 16:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I-I.... - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I assume not. - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: If she attacks, I'm booking it. - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs. Her eyes open once she's calmed her body down, and she turns to face Kilm. Arms eventually part, and hands find her hips. The teen's weight shifts a bit.

"I guess so." she says.* - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 23 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . Now that the village has been rebuilt . . . We have a lot of shinobi now and we need to form squads. - Wed Sep 23 16:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes slowly wander off. The woman's weight shifts uncomfortable, to the opposite side. Arms rise, and cross.* - Wed Sep 23 16:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . And that's my cue to leave. - Wed Sep 23 16:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll be in the mansion. - Wed Sep 23 16:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the east, to prepare for more training. Eyes wander, as if to study the environment.

She'll need to find more ideal places for her training.

Or at least, that's what she'd want people to think.* - Wed Sep 23 16:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) kneels down. Both palms touch the earth. Slowly, Kat draws in a very deep breath. Once she's braced herself adequately, Kat then shoves chakra into the ground. Instantly, it turns to brown liquid. The consistency is very much like water -- only even easier to maneuver through.

Instantly, Kat's shoved herself down into the liquid earth. She swims so fast, it's as if she's a blur. The kage goes down, rather than to the east. Kat's soon twenty feet below the surface. Once there, she swims to the east. 

Carefully, she weaves and turns to and fro th avoid any tree roots or stones that are burried in her path. This is so she doesn't have to waste precious time turning them to liquid, as it takes much longer than shaping the earth -- even if it's only by fractions of seconds. Every milisecond counts when you're fighting shinobi. More than anything else, though....Kat tests and trains something else. The technique's associated magnetic sensing.

Kat does her best to watch everything on the ground above. Trees, stones -- she takes note of it all, in as vivid detail as she can manage. She trains the ability as best she can, as it'll surely save her life some day. She needs to learn how to sense things that are in the air while she's using this jutsu. The girl also needs to become better at how she uses her chakra with this technique.* - Wed Sep 23 16:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually decides she needs to push herself harder, after hours of training. With a shrug, the teen turns and directs herself towards the depths below. Rapidly, she begins swimming in that direction. Mud-like water is thrown to and fro in her path, violently splashing against the subterrain. Within only seconds, Kat is one-hundred feet beneath the surface.

Naturally, from this depth, it's difficult for her to sense things above. That's exactly what she wants anyway. To strengthen her magnetic sensing that she has access to while submerged, she'll need to stress it. At the same speed, she turns and swims off to the side again. At the best speed she can manage, the hokage attempts to circle the entire forest.

While doing so, Kat focuses all of her attention on the surface. Each tree she passes, and each stone, she senses. It's all vague images for now. Not only is she very deep underground, but she's moving extremely fast too. The teen can barely make out anything at all.

Of course, she also passes by living things as well. Animals. There are stationary frogs, squirels, and other things. Among these stationary animals, though, are animals that aren't staying still. Bunnies that are terrified for no reason, deer(presumably), and more.

These things prove even more challenging to make out since they're moving. With Kat moving at the same time, it's as if they're moving twice as fast. Just to test an idea, the kage begins pouring out more chakra. As much as she can. She sends it as far as she can manage, just to see if it helps her get a clearer image.* - Wed Sep 23 16:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the tiger seal. Roughly, Katsune shoves chakra into the ground. It's led into a square expanse twenty feet long and four feet wide, and it gets there nearly instantly. Once there, Kat begins moulding the earth with her chakra. Very suddenly, said earth begins churning at a pace most eyes can't keep up with.

It begins forming mud. Once this mud is made, Kat wills it to stream forwards at  a rapid pace. Naturally, it does exactly what she wants. It rolls and shifts, ramming into itself as it goes. Of course, this is only mud. The earth does not shake, and there are no gunshot-like sounds.

The mud is merely heard splashing and slapping against itself. Eventually, Kat's looking at a very big streak of mud. Big, and wide. It's deep as well. By now, it's stopped flowing. It sits there, waiting for Kat to use it for her earth dragon bomb.* - Wed Sep 23 18:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to the north and kneels down. Palms find the ground. Roughly, Kat shoves chakra into the earth. It travels quickly, soon finding subterrain twenty feet away from her. Once there, it begins shaping the earth.

Four large spikes are formed. At a super-human pace, Kat works her chakra to make them as hard as possible. Once she's done, she wills the spikes to move forwards. They come racing outwards, producing a sound reminiscent of a sword being ripped hard from its sheathe. As Katsune wishes, all four spikes ram into each other with their full force.

All of them lose their heads, with the spikes flying in all directions. The kage is forced to casually tilt her head to the side as one flies towards her face.* - Wed Sep 23 18:07:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls her eyes. The girl then places her palms on the ground and carefully picks herself up. Once she's done, she brushes herself off and turns to face Hanabi. Arms cross, and her weight shifts a bit. Eyes are locked onto the woman and with her head she motions for her to come closer.

"Come here." she says, in a gentle tone.* - Wed Sep 23 22:48:32 2015

"Don't look at me like that." she says, in a nasally tone. The teen removes her fingers at this time to test the scent on the air.

"I meant that she might be valuable to us alive. Me...and you."* - Wed Sep 23 23:30:20 2015

"Anything you want to add to the conversation before I start doing something about it?" she inquires.* - Wed Sep 23 23:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you have no opinion. . .I'd send a letter to Zenaki and ask her if Beth has visited her. - Wed Sep 23 23:57:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Thu Sep 24 00:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, briefly looking the man up and down. She's pretty sure she 'has' seen him before, too.

"Alright." she says.

Without any hesitation she then turns on her heel to lead the way to the mansion.

"This way."* - Thu Sep 24 00:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Lady Hokage? - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sorry Marissa. Speaking to someone from Kirigakure. - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . . .  - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's important. - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Very well - Thu Sep 24 00:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I can wait. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am sorry to keep you - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Although it is important, it's not something I will stop you from tending to your ninja for. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll get back to you. I don't have time to pick a great mission for you and the last time I rushed that, I regretted it. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: thank you, but you go ahead. I am sorry to have interupted. - Thu Sep 24 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) motions towards the mansion with her head, with eyes on Yan,  and resumes walking.* - Thu Sep 24 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So...Thank you for seeing me. - Thu Sep 24 00:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I noticed you were around the ninja named Erebus. Is he on your payroll? - Thu Sep 24 00:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down. Arms cross, and one leg crosses over the other. Kat's eyes find Yan's feet, and they stay there.....exclusively.

"Why are you asking?" she inquires.* - Thu Sep 24 00:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am interested in those who are interested in his well-being. - Thu Sep 24 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's discuss why you're here first. - Thu Sep 24 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If you tell me otherwise, I will back off. As I am here to gain permission for this task. I would like to kill Erebus. He is not a moral man and he cannot continue to get stronger and kill more people as he does. - Thu Sep 24 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It would be against why I train as a ninja to allow him to continue. - Thu Sep 24 00:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Slowly, Kat's eyes wander off.

Always, they stay at or near Yan's feet. They never examine any other part of his body for any reason.

"He gets stronger by killing?" she inquires.* - Thu Sep 24 00:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: No, but I have seen the man...I understand his nature. He killed mist-nin, which their origin is irrelevant to me, and I do not wish to stand by with the knowledge this man stands among honorable ninja. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. I was aware he was..."killy." It'd been brought to my attention very recently.... - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't know the details. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I would like to try and rid you of your problem, then. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wear no headband as of right now, so it's not going to be affiliated with any of the villages. - Thu Sep 24 00:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's killed no one here. . . - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then would you have me wait until he does...and then kill him? - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'd prefer not to, but if that's the measure I have to take then I will. - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's simply a matter of time. - Thu Sep 24 00:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll have to find out more about this. As you may realize I was once Zetsumo's slave. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I myself was forced to do quite a bit of unsavory things. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Things I wish I hadn't had to do. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't judge this man without knowing the full story. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I have not heard of this, but you don't seem to be anything like the man. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: That's an honorable decision and I will respect that. - Thu Sep 24 00:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If he attempts to attack one of your ninja, I will intervene. - Thu Sep 24 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: This man is dangerous, so be careful around him at all times. - Thu Sep 24 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suggest you don't for only your own sake. I'm under the impression he's very capable. - Thu Sep 24 00:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wouldn't lift a finger and I suspect I wouldn't need to. - Thu Sep 24 00:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It's not out of confidence I do this, it's out of necessity. - Thu Sep 24 00:58:14 2015
