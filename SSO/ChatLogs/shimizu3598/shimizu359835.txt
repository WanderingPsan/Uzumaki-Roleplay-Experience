<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dare you....to not move a muscle. - Wed Oct 14 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands meet to form the tiger seal, lazily.

The girl then turns her head to stare up at him.

Her smile suggests evil things.* - Wed Oct 14 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) decides to be nice.

Abruptly, the sand beneath Index turns to mud. As it's picking him up, more comes from the south to ram into his face -- very, very roughly.

He'd be washed up to twenty feet north of where he currently is.

Kat then averts her eyes and waits for him to return.* - Wed Oct 14 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is wearing a smug smile despite his words.

"Truth." she says.* - Wed Oct 14 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm...If you could have any one thing in the world, what would it be? - Wed Oct 14 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Oct 14 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Define "thing." - Wed Oct 14 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Nevermind. Gimme a dare. - Wed Oct 14 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes, knowing full well what he meant.* - Wed Oct 14 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct 14 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Eventually she hovers up into a sitting position. Once there, she moves herself to where she's behind Index.

Her butt meets the sand, and she wraps both legs around his waist, snuggly.

Arms wrap around his neck if allowed. Her face rests against his back.

A second or so passes.* - Wed Oct 14 22:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander, in a shady manner.

Eventually she decides she's not entirely sure whether or not choking him halfway to death counts as a hug, so she doesn't do it.

Arms and legs unwrap from around him, and she slides backwards through the sand. She's sitting seven feet away from him, to the north, and facing the west when she says "Um. . ."* - Wed Oct 14 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What'd you eat for breakfast thirty six days ago? - Wed Oct 14 22:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. A weak smile is on her face. She seems disappointed.

"Alright. Truth."* - Wed Oct 14 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Easy. No genjutsu ever anywhere. - Wed Oct 14 22:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a cheap way to fight. - Wed Oct 14 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Fair enough. - Wed Oct 14 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm... - Wed Oct 14 22:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Scream "Fuck the Gezo!" at the top of your lungs. As long as you can. - Wed Oct 14 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Embarassing and dangerous at the same time. Good. - Wed Oct 14 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: loud* - Wed Oct 14 22:23:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. - Wed Oct 14 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and rises to her feet. With that, she then reaches over to tap him on the shoulder.

Both his weight and her's turn to nothing.

She'd then fly away, leading the way to her place.* - Wed Oct 14 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) crawls onto the couch once they're in the living room. She plants her legs in his lap, then, and lies down with her elbows on the cushions. Her face rests in her hands. Legs pick up and swing back and forth. She's taken her boots off at the door.

The teen would've suggested they go to her bedroom, but that'd also send the wrong message.* - Wed Oct 14 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Kay. - Wed Oct 14 22:31:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) does all that stuff.

She then picks up her bottle of sake, removes the lid, and says "Truth. . ."

She then starts pouring sake into her mouth.* - Wed Oct 14 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, deciding still to say nothing. She turns in place and rests her legs on his lap once more, this time with her knees up. The teen rests her head against the couch's arm rest and drinks more sake with eyes averted.

She looks fairly comfortable.* - Wed Oct 14 23:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) carefully scots closer, making use of her lightweight rock technique in the process. Her butt is planted squarely in his lap. One leg crosses over the other and she averts her eyes. The girl sips more at her alchohol, though it's just about gone by now.* - Wed Oct 14 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns in place and rises to her feet. "Gonna go take a nap." she says.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: At least everything is better now. - Thu Oct 15 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: I'm kinda shock of how fast the village develop'd..Struggle for several years only to return to it's glory once we regain our important figures and control over the land...Kinda sad I wasn't around to see all of it happening. - Thu Oct 15 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's funny. Entire village suffered because one man decided not to hand over a missing nin. - Thu Oct 15 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this with a perfectly blank expression on her face.

She doesn't seem to be amused by her own words.* - Thu Oct 15 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Who was this missing ninja? - Thu Oct 15 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: My closest friend. Orokuru. - Thu Oct 15 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Oh, I see--They're dead now or..? - Thu Oct 15 04:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yes. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. - Thu Oct 15 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm not a fan of Kirigakure. Kumogakure I'm not sure of. Konoha's dead. - Thu Oct 15 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: And Suna? - Thu Oct 15 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hassan let me take a headband despite my past. That's apparently normal here. Most of the village is made up of former bandits. I have no issues with this village. - Thu Oct 15 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Lovely.~ - Thu Oct 15 05:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Thu Oct 15 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) whispers: Alright--Just in case, I rather not confuse ya but I'm a guy. - Thu Oct 15 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Oct 15 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: I dont think I will ever get trained again - Thu Oct 15 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink. She stares into space.

The girl's arms then rise and her hands meet to form the tiger seal.

Instantly in a plume of smoke, she's gone.* - Thu Oct 15 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Damn it... I wanted to ask her a question - Thu Oct 15 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Oh well I guess I will ask her later then... - Thu Oct 15 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly draws her right foot backwards through the dirt. Eyes lock onto the tree in front of her, and Kat lifts both arms. Her hands clench partially as if to mimic claws. Slowly, Kat draws in a deep breath. With that done, she abruptly turns in place to lauch a kick at the tree in front of her.

As she'd consider it to be cheating, she makes no use of the lightweight rock technique to make this easier. Immediately upon making contact with the tree, Kat attempts to ride the impact of her kick to throw herself to the opposite side of it. Presumably that -is- how this taijutsu technique is performed. Kat succeeds in that she presumably is of course easily capable of this feat. She fails, however, in that she isn't at her max speed during the motion.

Without any pause, however, she immediately launches another kick at her target with the opposite leg. The teen tries to ride this kick as well, turning upwards in the same motion to launch yet another kick. Many more follow. For every single attack launched, Kat is fairly slow, smooth, and careful. She first intends to make sure she knows all of the motions needed before she worries about speed.* - Thu Oct 15 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || After hours of training, Kat opens up her scroll with a sigh. Carefully she studies it. It's a very complicated technique, developed by a very powerful indivudal. Of course it'll be difficult for one so much slower than the creator to use it. Even so, she's motivated -- mostly because this is exercise and studying at the same time.

As such, it can't possibly be a waste of her time to learn it. This time, Kat's hands meet to form the tiger seal. With that done, she charges at the tree, flickering out of sight. The second she comes out of shunshin, Kat launches her leg at the tree to kick it. Yet again she rides her kick, being thrown to the opposide side.

This time she allows herself to be carried not only over to the opposite side, but upwards at the same time. With gusto, she lauches kick after kick. Of course, the plant doesn't even budge. It has no leaves so none fall. Kat's very weak physically.

Even so, it often loses much of its dead bark. Flakes slowly fall down to the ground, teetering to and fro for every inch of the way. In time, Kat is actually moving as a blur. A barrage of very loud pecking noises sound off and echo throughout the neighborhood. More than one person passing by sees Kat performing this technique.

Even so, Kat doesn't care. Kenshin is dead supposedly, so he can't come and kill her for using the technique of his that she is not supposed to have. Occasionally Kat makes use of suimen to try and make the learning process easier. Often she rides the heels of her boots against the tree to try and get some momentum out of them. In time, the lower part of this tree has absolutely no bark left.* - Thu Oct 15 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: Hi Katsune was it? - Thu Oct 15 05:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: So pure ninjutsu? - Thu Oct 15 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Basically nintai but pretty much just ninjutsu yes. - Thu Oct 15 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Not so good at the "tai" part right now. . . - Thu Oct 15 05:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Earth and lightning. - Thu Oct 15 05:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) whispers: I see and you can convert your chakra to make that element from your body? - Thu Oct 15 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yes. - Thu Oct 15 05:49:52 2015

With a nod, she then turns and walks away.* - Thu Oct 15 06:26:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stands in the middle of the open desert, far away from town. Hands meet to form the snake seal. Abruptly, the girl then stops the flow of all of the flow of chakra within her body. When this is done, Kat shoves it throughout once more. Immediately, Kat then tries to gain control over her chakra.

Already, she's trying to pour said chakra into her hands. She kneels down even as she does this. A sharp, very quiet breath is taken through the nose. Many seconds pass before she's finally able to succeed. Palms meet the dirt below.

The second they do, the ground begins shaking. Abruptly, a dome of earth begins rising up. It moves so fast that it's a blur. Before long, the structure is complete. It's ten feet high and equally wide in any direction. With a sigh, Kat rises back up.

Once more, she makes use of the kai jutsu. Immediately afterwords she once more tries to make use of the earthen corridor technique. Hours of this training pass. It's not an easy thing to learn to do by any means. Eventually the girl switches it up.

Immediately after making an earthen corridor, Kat springs forwards. She moves as a blur. Upon reaching the corridor she just created, she comes skidding to a stop. An entire second passes, in addition to the time it'd taken to get here. When this time is gone, Kat's gauntlet turns a darker shade as she's pouring earth release chakra into it.

When her chakra flow technique is prepared, Kat shoves her arm forwards. Her fist hits the wall with a very loud, metalic clang. She sighs. The corridor is probably harder than her gauntlet even. Kat takes a moment to breathe and stretch before she resumes training.* - Thu Oct 15 19:54:40 2015

A good mood is apparent, if subtle.* - Thu Oct 15 20:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: How's sunagakure?~ - Thu Oct 15 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out of Sunagakure's gates and to the north. Eventually, she leans forwards and begins sprinting. As with most missions, this one probably does have a time limit. More importantly, the faster she can complete missions, the faster she can make money and grow in power and skill. She's very much aware she'll never be ready to fix Konoha until she has very large amounts of experience. 

Eventually she's within the walls of the land of Stone; Iwagakure presumably. Slowly she wanders the village. Irresponsible as it may be, Kat's curious about this place. This is, after all. . .where she was born. This is also the first time in living memory she's ever actually been here.

When Kat's done giving herself a tour, she makes her way over to the kage. The girl informs him that she'll need rest before their encounter with her mission target, and he seems to approve. She'll be weak otherwise of course. After a night at the inn, Kat's refreshed. She rises with a yawn and grabs a bottle of sake.

She'll be going to battle under the influence and she's completely okay with that. Even so, she of course doesn't get drunk or even tipsy. The chuunin then heads off to meet the kage. Naturally, the first thing she asks about is her prey's abilities. Considering that the village asked for Sunagakure's help due to the enemy's strength, it's reasonable to infer that they know some things about him.

Katsune thus learns easily that the enemy seems to favor the earth element above all else. In fact, according to these people, they haven't seen him use anything else. Kat's eyes wander off and she nods. With that, she requests a squad of at least three capable ninja that are great with the raiton element. Naturally a squad has already been prepared for her.

It consists of one single shinobi that's of adequate skill in the raiton element, and a couple of fairly skilled ninja that are mostly only skilled with generic shinobi things. With a shrug, Kat takes what she's dealt and heads out. Her target isn't in Iwagakure or in the wild. He's simply taken over control of one of Iwagakure's own smaller villages. He's not alone, either, which is why the kage of Iwagakure sent three other squads to accompany her.

Kat and company stare ahead at the walls of their target destination. The girl's hands meet to form the snake seal and with that, she's covered in a plume of smoke. When it clears, a clone of mud has come out of Kat's back and used henge while clenging to her. It shifts into the appearance of a purple chuunin vest to hide its presence and more importantly, its nature. With a clone on her back to reduce her weight to nothing for flight, Kat's now capable of flying while using jutsus.

It's fortunate that as usual with missions, Kat has time to prepare in advance. As always, that means she has more than one incredibly significant advantage against her enemies. The girl opts not to make more clones, as that would mean dividing her power even further. Kat's arms are resting at her sides when she discusses her plan with her comrades. She'd already thought one up before arriving.

First, one squad of her comrades disperses. They make their way to three different parts of the village and once there, they set three different massive trees ablaze while they wait for the rest of the squads to join them as back-up. As a result, the civilians of the town panic while the shinobi stay. As planned, the villagers grab their children and flee. Their tyranical owners make no attempt to stop them.

Several minutes pass. Once it's apparent that most if not all innocents are gone, Kat's comrades put out the fires and charge forwards as planned. Already some have encountered enemy shinobi and the others seek out prey of their own. Kat hovers up into the air and grants her squad mates the same ability so that they can have an advantage. As long as they stay close to her, they can fly.

Kat and company's eyes wander as they move. The girl is looking for the most confident man in the village. The one that carries his head held high and is currently barking out orders. It's not hard to find him. A rather bulky man in a straw hat. 

That's her guy, and she's sure of it. As such, she and her comrades charge down towards him. They're soon twenty feet above him, and she only stares at him blankly. She more or less ignores the chaos around her, because her own allies -- the other squads -- have his covered. They have competent leaders, so she has no need to hold their hands. It's nice being a leader when you're actually competent like Kat is and thus don't stress out about what your allies are doing.

With Kat hovering over him, her prey turns his head to stare up at her coldly, with mouth held very slightly agape. They stare at each other for a very long while, with neither of them moving. Both of them wait for the other to make the first move. When you're on the defensive you always have a ginormous advantage. The girl notes that had she not come and got his attention with her phenominal ability -- flight -- he probably would be very easily wrecking her squads.

That's why Iwagakure asked for help. Without any further pause, Kat gives her squad instructions. The raiton specialist already knows to stick with Kat, so she doesn't speak to him. Her two other comrades race forwards to deal with the target's own squad. Without any pause, Kat holds both arms forwards.
 
Both chakra flow gauntlets meet at the heels of their palms. Out of them comes an enormous ball of lightning. It crackles and roars loudly. Sparks are thrown all over the place. Shortly afterwords the ball races forwards, aimed at her target's head.

In response, he stomps the ground. No handseals are used. The second his foot meets the ground, a wall of earth rises up out of the ground. The earth shakes as it rises. It's very thick, very wide, and very strong. The wall eats Kat's lightning ball easily.

From this display Kat can infer many things. First of all this guy's jutsus are tremendously powerful if he can block Kat's jutsu of an opposing element so easily. Secondly, if he's choosing to block rather than dodge, he probably does not have fantastic speed. If he did have speed he'd likely dodge instead to save chakra and keep from showing Kat his hand. Kat now knows all she needs to know.

 She chooses to stay above the ground, knowing that a master of the earth element would love nothing more than to have someone on the ground. If their enemies are on the ground, they have an advantage. Even so, she does descend to at least some extent. She hovers only ten feet above the ground. She has to get close to her enemy if she's to stand any chance landing a successful hit against him.

With this in mind she races forwards, moving as a blur. Often her prey attacks her. At one point, he tests the Earthen Corridor jutsu against her. In response, she's forced to put her hands together and form the tiger seal. The shunshin jutsu is used mid-flight, and she's thrown through the air. She reappears outside of his construct and she keeps flying.

Immediately the enemy guesses that that jutsu will be useless, so he makes no more use of it as far as trapping her goes. Instead, he summons clones. Two earth clones in specific, and both at the same time. Kat whistles to her raiton bodyguard and sends him towards one of the clones. She flies to the other while forming handseals. Out of her hands shortly afterwords comes a stream of lightning.

It screeches loudly as it races forwards. Even as the lightning goes, Kat's flying in a circular motion around the prey. He summons up an earth wall but Kat isn't taking the bait. She flies around it while her own jutsu pours forwards. To her dismay, the clone erects yet another wall. The girl takes a breath and cracks her neck. 

She waits for her chakra circuits to stop going wild. Kat can't transition from jutsu to jutsu. She flies to the side while waiting. Eventually she's between him and a wall once more. An arm flies forwards, and her fist meets the wall with a very loud clump. 

This clump is muffled out entirely though, by the impending explosion. The world shakes and trembles in fear. The sound produced is an absurdly loud, reverberating bang. It's reminiscent of thunder and it rips through the air violently and repeatedly. Kat uses her opponent's wall itself as the fuel for her Landmine Fist.

It's the fuel she uses to ignite it. Just as she uses an enemy's body to trigger the jutsu, she can use his wall too. The explosive beam of energy strikes her enemy in full. Kat'd kept her senses locked onto them to make sure this is what happens. Immediately, it's disintigrated; so much so that it can not recover.

The real enemy simply watches with a cool and calculating gaze. By making use of his clones, he's learned much about Kat's abilities. He can tell that she's the leader, so she's the one he focuses on. With this in mind, he sinks into the ground. In response, one of her comrades shouts even as his sword clashes with another shinobi's with a very loud clang.

Said comrade informs her of his position underground. Kat nods but ignores this for now. Instead she races over to her other enemy. Combined with her raiton specialist ally, she's easily able to get rid of him in a mere small moment. Between the two of them, their jutsus tear through its mud and leave it as little more than dust.

Both Kat and her ally then charge forwards to aid the rest of the squad. Even as they move, the main enemy pops up out of the ground. He pulls squad member number three underground with the headhunter jutsu. He's left defenseless, and one of his own allies chops off the poor Iwagakure shinobi's head instantly. Kat's forced to pay this little mind as she plants a fist to her last distraction.

Her fist meets his head, and the explosion follows. The world shakes and trembles once more, and her prey is disintigrated down to the thighs. Only charred blood and flesh remain where the legs used to be connected to his body. Now that Kat's more or less alone with her enemy and has the advantage in numbers, she charges towards him. Her attempts to go underground. Kat can sense him, though.

He's also slow. Immediately Kat puts herself against the ground. A fist races forwards and hits the dirt itself. The last explosion she can manage without her clone's chakra streams forwards. The world shakes, and a crater is made. Landmine Fist's explosion streams forwards, entirely unphased by the earth in its path. 

This is because Kat used that earth itself to fuel her jutsu in the first place. And so her enemy is turned to dust. Without any pause as Kat senses his life go out, she rises up and leads the charge against the remaining enemies. She has to make sure the rest of her allies are fine after all, as most of them are still fighting.
In time, the village is cleaned up of all missing-nin scum. 

They fly back to Iwagakure to inform the kage there of everything that transpired, including the Iwagakure deaths. With that done, Kat flies out of the village as a blur and begins making her way back to Sunagakure. It's time to collect her reward.* - Thu Oct 15 22:42:46 2015

The girl needs rest from flying. She's not talking to random evil ninja in the middle of the desert.

The girl does note Baen's presence though. She can presumably make out that it's probably him from this height. Her eyesight is pretty phenominal.* - Thu Oct 15 22:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Same three as last time unless you wanna add more. Two numbers can represent each penalty. - Fri Oct 16 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Hm...I do have suggestions. - Fri Oct 16 01:36:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: I agree, Shall we go? - Fri Oct 16 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns to lead the way.* - Fri Oct 16 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to get the dice once they get to her house. Shortly afterwords she's walking in with those in-hand, as well as a few bottles of sake. She sets said bottles on the table and then seats herself on the couch. One leg crosses over the other and she passes Index the dice.

"You roll first." she says.

In the mean time she begins taking her gauntlets off.* - Fri Oct 16 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Mind posting them on skype? - Fri Oct 16 01:41:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and lifts her arm up, putting it in front of him absent-mindedly.

It's pretty much covered up down to the wrist by her clothes.

"Okay." she says in response to his suggestion.* - Fri Oct 16 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't react much to the kiss, since she has a sleeve and all.

The girl tosses the dice up into the air when she gets them.* - Fri Oct 16 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit and reaches over to "fondle" Index's hand, since that's what the dice said to do.

She does so absent-mindedly and with eyes averted.* - Fri Oct 16 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes the dice in the mean time, too.* - Fri Oct 16 01:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's impossible to roll 1. Ever. - Fri Oct 16 01:50:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yeah sure. Hand becomes chest. - Fri Oct 16 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And poke becomes pinch? - Fri Oct 16 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sure. - Fri Oct 16 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, not reacting much even though this is weird as fuck.

Afterwords she rolls the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Foot.. - Fri Oct 16 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts her gauntlets back on.

Afterwords she reaches over to pinch his foot, hard.

The girl does so with a vice grip, and holds it for many long seconds.

She intends for it to hurt.* - Fri Oct 16 01:58:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander for a bit. Eventually though, with a silent breath taken, she turns on her heel. Legs are planted in his lap and she's leaning backwards. Basically, her stomach is left easy to get to.

Eyes are averted.* - Fri Oct 16 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn only a bit pink, but for the most part she seems unphased. The girl rolls her dice.* - Fri Oct 16 02:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and passes the dice.

Her answer was pretty generic but she's not some derpy hipster that changes it to sound unique at least.* - Fri Oct 16 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, even as his face is presumably sandwhiched.

Her cheeks are pink for the moment.

Afterwords she rolls the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 02:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. A weak smile is on her face when she hovers up into a sitting position and leans towards him. A smile, because the dice keep having her specifically lick his neck.

With eyes averted, she licks.* - Fri Oct 16 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes the dice afterwords, throwing them hard at his nuts.* - Fri Oct 16 02:20:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Seeing as it's not too deep of a cut, Kat doesn't react much. She's used to pain of course, being a shinobi. Her sleeve is torn now though of course.

With a nod, Kat then takes the dice and rolls them.* - Fri Oct 16 02:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She leans forwards and, with her gauntlet-covered hand, rubs at the top of his foot awkwardly.

Afterwords she reaches up and smushes the dice into his face.* - Fri Oct 16 02:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She reaches over to "fondle" his lips with her cold, hard, metal gauntlets.

She's smiling fairly brightly in the mean time, in a cheeky manner.* - Fri Oct 16 02:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's smile becomes an awkward one.

Licking her blood was definitely not necessary but she decides not to comment, as she's not a bad sport. Afterwords she takes the dice and wanders off to get a bandage before coming back.

When she has come back, she rolls the dice once more.* - Fri Oct 16 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leans forwards and plants a peck on his arm. Afterwords the passes the dice.* - Fri Oct 16 02:44:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. Without much hesitation -- as she's getting used to this -- she rolls over onto her belly. Legs rest in his lap, and her elbows find the arm rest. Kat's hands rest on her cheeks. She's lying perfectly flat and her eyes wander.* - Fri Oct 16 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits back up, leaving her legs sprawled out underneath her form as she takes the dice. Kat keeps herself facing the opposite direction when she rolls them.* - Fri Oct 16 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and turns to face Index, hovering a bit in the process. Once she is facing him she leand forwards and reaches out to pinch his lips; a bit hard, too.

The teen pulls them to and fro as well. It's likely more painful than when she "fondled" them. A faint, cheeky smile is on her face for the moment.* - Fri Oct 16 02:54:30 2015
