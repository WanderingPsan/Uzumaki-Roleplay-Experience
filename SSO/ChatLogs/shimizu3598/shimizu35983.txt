<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What's the best part of killing someone to you? - Sat Sep 12 04:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Haven't I already explained that? - Sat Sep 12 04:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Explain more. - Sat Sep 12 04:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I guess I did leave out details before. - Sat Sep 12 04:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's when I've evaded every hilariously un-clever attempt the enemy's made at actually hitting me....and then.... - Sat Sep 12 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm about to hit them. I'm looking into their eyes and at that time.... - Sat Sep 12 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They realize. I'm just better than they are. - Sat Sep 12 04:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And that's right before they die. - Sat Sep 12 04:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't like fighting the weak ones. - Sat Sep 12 04:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I like to see the surprise in their eyes and that surprise isn't there in the weak ones. - Sat Sep 12 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The weak ones know from the start they had no chance, so there's no point. - Sat Sep 12 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No satisfaction in it. - Sat Sep 12 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 12 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: You still haven't killed anyone . . . Have you? - . . . I haven't. - Sat Sep 12 04:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . - Sat Sep 12 04:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What now? - Sat Sep 12 04:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. . . - Sat Sep 12 04:52:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's gonna end up like last time. - Sat Sep 12 04:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't have any new tricks to test out. - Sat Sep 12 04:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So there's no point, yeah. - Sat Sep 12 04:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You outrun everything I have. - Sat Sep 12 04:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And everything you throw at me does nothing. - Sat Sep 12 04:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It was still a fun experiment, before. - Sat Sep 12 04:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: By the way . . . You sure I should get rid of my other personality? - Sat Sep 12 04:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think you'd beat me in a real fight if I was daring enough to be on the offensive. I never would be, though. So in a real fight...honestly? I'd just run away and not waste my time. - Sat Sep 12 04:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then again, I've never actually tried that. - Sat Sep 12 04:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And yeah I dunno...your split personality. That can't be healthy. - Sat Sep 12 04:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kinda like having voices in your head ya know. - Sat Sep 12 04:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Honestly. - Sat Sep 12 04:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He thinks he served his purpose . . . And that was to make choices for me when I was little so I wouldn't get into too much trouble. - Sat Sep 12 04:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But . . . Getting rid of him . . . I don't think I will get any better if I do that. - Sat Sep 12 04:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I might just get worse actually. - Sat Sep 12 04:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's true you make bad choices. - Sat Sep 12 04:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I still say get rid of it. - Sat Sep 12 04:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Doesn't matter. - Sat Sep 12 04:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I'll ask Zenaki or Maya. - Sat Sep 12 04:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Also . . . I don't think I make that bad choices . . . Well not anymore. - Sat Sep 12 04:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You also could've been less blunt about it. - Sat Sep 12 04:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could've. - Sat Sep 12 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Unfortunately you force me to be blunt. - Sat Sep 12 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: How come? - Sat Sep 12 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 12 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Never mind. - Sat Sep 12 05:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't want to force you to be blunt about anything. - Sat Sep 12 05:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet, shaking her head. "Gonna go train." she says. Her expression is blank, suggesting she's not bothered.

The girl turns and walks away, at a lazy pace.* - Sat Sep 12 05:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I hate this. Really. - Sat Sep 12 05:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Well . . . Okay. - Sat Sep 12 05:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ain't got anything to do. . . I'll watch. - Sat Sep 12 05:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is currently lying on her back with arms and legs spread out a bit. With a glance over at Kilm, and a shrug, she says "I was gonna train..."* - Sat Sep 12 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Decided I didn't feel like it after all, though. - Sat Sep 12 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Gonna? - Sat Sep 12 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Oh right. - Sat Sep 12 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You already trained. - Sat Sep 12 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Considering you had to walk to this area. - Sat Sep 12 05:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Sat Sep 12 05:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're way too lazy to do anything these days. - Sat Sep 12 05:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not my fault. - Sat Sep 12 05:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: All work and no play makes someone dull. - Sat Sep 12 05:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Then what would you like to play then? - Sat Sep 12 05:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "Murder"? - Sat Sep 12 05:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Okay . . . Something else? We'll get to play that during missions anyway. - Sat Sep 12 05:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There is nothing else for me. - Sat Sep 12 05:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No games or anything? Don't want to give anything a try? - Sat Sep 12 05:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Forcing myself to like something is just more "work" anyway. - Sat Sep 12 05:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're way too much into killing. - Sat Sep 12 05:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No...I'm not. - Sat Sep 12 05:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want work so I don't have to think about other things. - Sat Sep 12 05:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You sure? - Sat Sep 12 05:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes. Her expression remains blank, simply because she doesn't have the energy to get worked up right now. Her tone when she speaks reflects this. It's not overly hostile.

"Know what? Forget I said that." she says.* - Sat Sep 12 05:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Sat Sep 12 05:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I thought another village would accept me after seeing me work with Zetsumo.... - Sat Sep 12 05:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd leave. - Sat Sep 12 05:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Would have a while ago. - Sat Sep 12 05:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I dunno. - Sat Sep 12 05:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's not because of boredom, either. - Sat Sep 12 05:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't like it here lately. - Sat Sep 12 05:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Way too boring . . . - Sat Sep 12 05:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wouldn't want to get left behind though. - Sat Sep 12 05:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No other village would let me stay though, I'd bet. - Sat Sep 12 05:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I killed Orakuru, so...Kirigakure? - Sat Sep 12 05:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Doubting they'd be okay with that. - Sat Sep 12 05:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They'd kill me. - Sat Sep 12 05:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sunagakure too. - Sat Sep 12 05:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Tethys saved my life once . . . I could probably get into Kirigakure. - Sat Sep 12 05:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Think so? - Sat Sep 12 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd rather be sure. - Sat Sep 12 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Completely sure. . . - Sat Sep 12 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd ask if they could let you in. - Sat Sep 12 05:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd like that. - Sat Sep 12 05:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Best to send a bird asking though. - Sat Sep 12 05:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You want me to send a bird to Tethys? - Sat Sep 12 05:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Leaving this village for even a day would make Zetsumo suspicious. - Sat Sep 12 05:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm..... - Sat Sep 12 05:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let me think about it...for a bit. - Sat Sep 12 05:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If we leave there's no coming back. - Sat Sep 12 05:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I left once . . . I was already very close to dying to Zetsumo. - Sat Sep 12 05:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Leaving for the second time ensures I have no chance of living anymore if I get recaptured. - Sat Sep 12 05:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When Orakuru left, Zetsumo decided he had to die. It made no sense at all. He wasn't rational. - Sat Sep 12 05:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He didn't need to kill him. Kuro was incompetent. - Sat Sep 12 05:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though . . . This is your choice. - Sat Sep 12 05:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No threat. - Sat Sep 12 05:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I will do it if you want to do it. - Sat Sep 12 05:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Eh. What if we get to another village and it turns out to be just as bad? - Sat Sep 12 05:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or worse. - Sat Sep 12 05:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can't come back here. - Sat Sep 12 05:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . We stay rogues? I'm not sure. - Sat Sep 12 05:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where would we go? - Sat Sep 12 05:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As rogues. - Sat Sep 12 05:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What would we even do? - Sat Sep 12 05:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Niza is the new raikage . . . I know him. - Sat Sep 12 05:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But . . . I think after Niklaus's reign. - Sat Sep 12 05:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The village is just as bad. - Sat Sep 12 05:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even though Niza is a knight of the gezo. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And we both know. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What's Niza like? - Sat Sep 12 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That he isn't that strong. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He was very loyal to Niklaus. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: His loyalty came before his friends and now that Niklaus is no more . . . I'm not sure what his priorities are . . . - Sat Sep 12 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Is it his friends or the village? - Sat Sep 12 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd assume the village. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though . . . If Kumogakure hasn't changed. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's more boring than here. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I heard a lot about Niklaus. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Trust me. - Sat Sep 12 05:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It was VERY boring for me there. - Sat Sep 12 05:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sat Sep 12 05:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Boredom...is -not- the issue. - Sat Sep 12 05:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But I think we could make do . . . Still gotta look at the other options. - Sat Sep 12 05:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sunagakure is probably not ideal. - Sat Sep 12 05:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You fought against them after all. - Sat Sep 12 05:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even if you sent that bird and Kirigakure said yes.... - Sat Sep 12 05:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Sat Sep 12 05:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It could be a lie. And why not? We'd be valuable for information. - Sat Sep 12 05:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What if it would be a trap. - Sat Sep 12 05:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah . . . - Sat Sep 12 05:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: To be honest. - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is war and these people are as apathetic as us. - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd willingly give information if we could stay there. - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me too. But, they still might lie just to get us there. - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And they 'still' might want to kill. - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When they're done with us. - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Indeed. - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Staying rogue is probably safer than being in a village at all . . . - Sat Sep 12 05:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'd be alone. Just the two of us. Doesn't sound like much fun. - Sat Sep 12 05:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We wouldn't be able to trust anyone because anyone we meet could be working for Zetsumo. - Sat Sep 12 05:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: No idea. - Sat Sep 12 11:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I'm sure of it. It's better than staying here alone. - Sat Sep 12 11:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: What makes you think I won't ditch you when you get there? I can't promise I won't. I don't let anyone tie me down when I have a choice. - Sat Sep 12 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: you...dont k-know? - Sat Sep 12 11:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I've only had regular old ink. - Sat Sep 12 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: n-no red ink? - Sat Sep 12 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's something you should think about. Carefully. - Sat Sep 12 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Because that's why my heart tells me. - Sat Sep 12 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: No really. I 'might' ditch you. - Sat Sep 12 11:06:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Alright. Yeah. - Sat Sep 12 11:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Can't spend any more time thinking about it. - Sat Sep 12 11:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Gotta make a decision, so.... - Sat Sep 12 11:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'll meet you um.... - Sat Sep 12 11:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: At the edge of the forest, east of here? - Sat Sep 12 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: No. My house. - Sat Sep 12 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Sat Sep 12 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: We'll leave together. Underground. - Sat Sep 12 11:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she rises to her feet and turns to wander off, to the west, alone.* - Sat Sep 12 11:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . - Sat Sep 12 11:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stands with her arms crossed, and weight shifted a bit. Her eyes are on the ground.

"Huh." she says.
"We're really doing this?"* - Sat Sep 12 11:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'll send people after us. - Sat Sep 12 11:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Eventually. - Sat Sep 12 11:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe Beth, and a partner for her. - Sat Sep 12 11:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Misa? - Sat Sep 12 11:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We'll fight them off. - Sat Sep 12 11:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No matter how hard it'll be. - Sat Sep 12 11:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over it but otherwise shows no reaction.* - Sat Sep 12 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Okay. - Sat Sep 12 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is just standing here for the record. She got quiet when Hanabi showed up.

A glance is sent her way, but she says nothing.* - Sat Sep 12 11:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches up with her right hand. The girl extends only two fingers, and turns the hand at the wrist. Quickly and without warning, she attempts to poke Kilm in both eyes.

Her own eyes are averted at the time.* - Sat Sep 12 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Stop that. - Sat Sep 12 11:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Okay. - Sat Sep 12 11:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Hanabi as she says "'Morning."* - Sat Sep 12 11:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hi. - Sat Sep 12 11:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Should we go? - Sat Sep 12 11:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hello. - Sat Sep 12 11:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: No. Be cool, damn it. - Sat Sep 12 11:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (tho i should omit that since this isn't Kumogakure, lol) - Sat Sep 12 11:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: (did she DC or leave?) - Sat Sep 12 11:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. We do have friends here. Even if we don't talk much...or do anything. - Sat Sep 12 11:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You beginning to reconsider? - Sat Sep 12 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah... - Sat Sep 12 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Are you sure? - Sat Sep 12 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Maybe I should give Kenryoku more of a chance. - Sat Sep 12 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Before I decide for sure. - Sat Sep 12 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Okay. - Sat Sep 12 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: So, We going back to where everyone was? - Sat Sep 12 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Okay. Three, or four more days. I'll give it that much time. - Sat Sep 12 11:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (1 OOC day) - Sat Sep 12 11:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: We shouldn't ditch this girl though. That'd be rude. - Sat Sep 12 11:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You want to come with us to where everyone else is? - Sat Sep 12 11:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Sure. - Sat Sep 12 11:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I have not interacted with anyon for a long time. - Sat Sep 12 11:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: You two are probably the first people I have seen in a while. - Sat Sep 12 11:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 12 11:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she pulls herself off of the wall and turns to lead the way back to town.

Before taking more than a step or two though she comes to a stop. Her weight shifts a bit and she glances back over at Hanabi. For a brief moment she scratches her cheek.

"Actually I dunno. You're new here. Maybe we can all go do something? I'm sure if we go to the town square we'd all just end up sitting there and not doing anything."* - Sat Sep 12 11:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . The spa again? Something like that. I am sure we could find some activities. - Sat Sep 12 11:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 12 11:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No. Only weirdos like Maya.... - Sat Sep 12 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I am free to do whatever you guys want. - Sat Sep 12 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Would ask a stranger to the spa.... - Sat Sep 12 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I mean, right? - Sat Sep 12 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Define wierdos. - Sat Sep 12 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nng..... - Sat Sep 12 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Should' we go to the spa? - Sat Sep 12 11:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's relaxing isn't it? - Sat Sep 12 11:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I did like it the last time.... - Sat Sep 12 11:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: There is a spa here? - Sat Sep 12 11:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you liked it last time . . . You'll like it again. - Sat Sep 12 11:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Pervert.... - Sat Sep 12 11:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sat Sep 12 11:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was there the other day. - Sat Sep 12 11:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Interesting. - Sat Sep 12 11:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright...spa, then? - Sat Sep 12 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I don't see much fun in sitting in a hot spring though.... - Sat Sep 12 11:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Wearing a bikini. - Sat Sep 12 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Sure why not. - Sat Sep 12 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Lead the way though. - Sat Sep 12 11:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to lead the way to the facility.* - Sat Sep 12 11:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) approaches the front desk with hands on her hips and weight shifted a bit. She eyes the greeter blankly. Once more she's greeted with a smile and the trio is told that they're welcome to three or so different activities.

Hot springs, massages, or a mud bath.

Kat shrugs and turns to face the others. With a glance at each of them she suggests "Hot springs...?"* - Sat Sep 12 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Sure. - Sat Sep 12 11:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow, eyeing Kilm.* - Sat Sep 12 12:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah.... - Sat Sep 12 12:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He just has this...... - Sat Sep 12 12:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thing. - Sat Sep 12 12:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Passion . . . - Sat Sep 12 12:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: For . . . Something. - Sat Sep 12 12:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Every one has their quirks I guess - Sat Sep 12 12:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, knowing full well of Kilm's basketball addiction. With that, she pays the receptionist. They trio are given locker keys and directed to the hot sprints. Of course, Kilm's changing room is seperate for obvious reasons.

This being a fairly high-end facility, it's all very clean and such. They're given brand new bathing suits to choose from, as Kat had paid quite a bit to get in. Nine-thousand or so, enough for each person to do whatever they want here, and as much as they want. That's half as much as it costs to buy a house.

When in the locker rooms, Kat opens her own locker and begins dressing. Eyes wander, and she does this all very casually. Eyes are kept to herself, though, as far as Hanabi goes.* - Sat Sep 12 12:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) casually wiggles out of her panties, having removed everything else. A glance is sent over her shoulder at the woman in the mean time. "Well...." she says, carefully storing the garment in her locker. Her hands move to her bra afterwords.

"They give massages...and food...and sake....it's a spa." Her bra is removed in full. The girl then reaches up into the locker to begin sorting through bikinis. She takes her time, looking for something relatively humble but also not un-fun.* - Sat Sep 12 12:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes in response to the eyes on her. Eyes wander and, subtly, her legs meet. They cross a bit, and thighs rub back and forth against each other as if due to anxiety.

"Um..." she says with a quiet and subtle breath.

"Mice?" She glances over her shoulder at her, not willing to face her at the moment.

"Why mice?"

The girl takes a moment to fit on a top piece. It's a bit small, at least as far as covering her up goes. The colors consist of dark red and dark purple, similar to the one she'd wore before, because why not.

The bottom piece follows, and she's turning to face the side as she lifts a leg up. Carefully, and with eyes averted, she wiggles her way into it.

Afterwords, arms would meet behind her back. She turns to face the kunoichi, still not quite looking at her.* - Sat Sep 12 12:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the woman...for a bit longer than intended, even. Unintentionally, she eyes the chest. When one's being so showy, it's impossible not to look.

"Um..." she says, a faint blush remaining. A lot of questions were asked in a short span of time, so she chooses to focus on the most important one for now.

"Well..." she says. Eyes find her, and she takes a moment to examine her clothing. "You'll want a bikini..." she says.

"Unless you're okay getting those wet."* - Sat Sep 12 12:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can ask about the mouse after that, I guess. - Sat Sep 12 12:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll be in a tub. - Sat Sep 12 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A hot one. - Sat Sep 12 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With Kilm, since we're being nice. - Sat Sep 12 12:41:23 2015
