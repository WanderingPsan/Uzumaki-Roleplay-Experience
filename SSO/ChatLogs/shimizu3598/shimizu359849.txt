<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) spends about an hour in bed considering sneaking out the window.

Afterwords she gets dressed and makes her way to the living room. Her bedroom door is shut behind her and arms remain behind her back.

"'Morning. . ." she says to the two boys there.

Katsune then hovers up into the air, and over to the couch. A bit carelessly she drops herself inbetween them.* - Mon Oct 26 20:38:36 2015

Not because of it being spicy but rather, a lack of hunger.* - Mon Oct 26 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns in place on the couch. She's soon lying down. Both legs rest in Index's lap, and she brings her soup spoon to her mouth. When her soup meets her tongue, Kat seems to pause for a moment.

Eyes wander, and grow a bit watery.

Eventually though she swallows, gulping it down.

Kat clears her throat for a moment before reaching for her glass of water. Eyes are wandering awkwardly as she drinks, fairly quickly.* - Mon Oct 26 21:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I ...*snicker* Heard spicy food helps you live longer. - Mon Oct 26 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eats more soup, with a faint frown on her face.* - Mon Oct 26 21:15:18 2015

She sips at her soup in the mean time. . .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually decides not to kick Index in the nuts.

Eyes wander off as she finishes her soup.* - Mon Oct 26 21:23:50 2015

Making a clone get the door would take chakra anyway.* - Mon Oct 26 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts her legs back in Index's lap.

The last of her soup is poured down her throat.* - Mon Oct 26 21:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: After the four months of training . . . I'll be gathering info on Konohagakure and maybe Kumogakure as well. - Mon Oct 26 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And see what I can do inside. - Mon Oct 26 21:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Find out what 'Zeus' is like and more about his abilities in Konohagakure . . . Perhaps even what the abilities of all other shinobi are as well. - Mon Oct 26 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Depending on what I find out . . . I'll either let him be for now or attack him. - Mon Oct 26 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "All other shinobi." I see you dream big. - Mon Oct 26 21:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: After Zeus, what then? - Mon Oct 26 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . If you're ready, You're free to take the position. If not, I'll just move on towards Kumogakure. - Mon Oct 26 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Mon Oct 26 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And then? - Mon Oct 26 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Most likely will keep low to gain extra training for futher plans. - Mon Oct 26 22:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Mon Oct 26 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna know why I was asking him questions? - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm, Sure if you're willing to tell. - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wanted to see whether or not he was hiding things. Judging by his answers he obviously was. - Mon Oct 26 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wasn't hoping for answers. Wasn't expecting them. Just wanted to see if he'd be open. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wasn't. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Finally after years he's been blatantly cut off from any chance of ever being with me. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure how he'll act now. - Mon Oct 26 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Always suspected his loyalty was due to loneliness. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That it was completely selfish. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If that's true, he could be a very different person now. Someone I've never known before. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I see. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's never beat me in a fight aside from a few times when I let him. - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's always been either a stalemate or his loss. One time I let him put me in genjutsu and one time he beat a shadow clone that wasn't anywhere near as strong as me -- had half of my chakra. - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But he's never won. - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I want to kill him it'll be very easy. - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The best part of all is he doesn't realize that. - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The question is, though...should I? - Mon Oct 26 22:37:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Will you miss him if he's dead? - Mon Oct 26 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If the only danger was him maybe attacking me in the future I'd not even consider it. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'll never beat me, even if he copies my fighting style out of desperation which I suspect he will. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The problem is, he might train other people. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Teach them how to fly. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If he's that stupid. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then it's for the better. - Mon Oct 26 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm having trouble figuring him out. - Mon Oct 26 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't know, I'm finding him fairly easy to read. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think I know what I'll do. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm's always handed me techniques back to back like it's candy. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he stops, I'll know he's planning on betraying me. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll watch him and see. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The second I see him being stupid, I'll put my fist to his head...and end it. - Mon Oct 26 22:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this. Her expression remains pretty blank though. Even with a massage, she's having trouble relaxing.

"Just thinking about this makes me literally sick to my stomach." Kat says, with eyes averted.

"Kilm's almost like a brother to me."* - Mon Oct 26 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just worried he might try to take Konoha from me. - Mon Oct 26 22:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even if his friendship is a lie, and always has been a lie. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure I'd be okay with him being dead. - Mon Oct 26 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You don't have to kill him, You could imprison him. - Mon Oct 26 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The truth is, without me watching over his shoulder, he "will" die. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If he's ambitious. - Mon Oct 26 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder if he's realized that. - Mon Oct 26 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might be why he teaches me things. - Mon Oct 26 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway no. I'd never imprison him. - Mon Oct 26 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Killing would be nicer. - Mon Oct 26 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then you don't have many options. - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Though, this could all end up being useless speculation and he's going through a 'phase'. - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- If he 'has' realized that. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He might be trying to replace me. - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might be why Ikaro's around now. - Mon Oct 26 22:53:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wouldn't assume anything. - Mon Oct 26 22:56:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Mon Oct 26 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Or somehow prevent them from using it let alone teaching. - Mon Oct 26 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When. . .he found out we were dating, he talked to me. Looked like he felt betrayed. He decided then and there to run off and do radical things. Train for months without getting permission from Hassan to leave. - Mon Oct 26 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then he said that passive aggressive nonsense...."It might get you in trouble Kat, but I'm sure you'll handle it." - Mon Oct 26 22:58:33 2015
