<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Especially after I promised you I was done with the business. - Fri Oct 30 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Explosive tags? - Fri Oct 30 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you have a dirty way to kill her I suggest doing it. That's my judgement whenever someone makes theatrical, pretentious, passive-aggressive threats. - Fri Oct 30 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You see. . . - Fri Oct 30 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Not quite. - Fri Oct 30 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Killing? Combat? It's all a game. - Fri Oct 30 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "If someone threatens you, they've started the battle." - Fri Oct 30 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "From then on, any means of killing them is fair game." - Fri Oct 30 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So if you have....a way. - Fri Oct 30 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd do it. - Fri Oct 30 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You know. - Fri Oct 30 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hearing you talk about killing as you cuddle a pillow in the bed. - Fri Oct 30 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Is oddly attractive. - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Talking about it. . . - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Makes me 'want' to cuddle this pillow. - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I'm always wanting to cuddle with you. You make me wanna murder. - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'd be more than happy to replace the pillow. - Fri Oct 30 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Fri Oct 30 02:19:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. It's best I relax when I'm like this. - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because I have to think before I speak or act. - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So I like to be alone and safe while I think. - Fri Oct 30 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's part of the game. - Fri Oct 30 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes a bit. Eyes wander off in response to the sight, unfortunately.

Unfortunately because Kat really needs to see that fuuinjutsu tattoo. Even so, she can't look.

Kat hides her face even more thoroughly in her pillow.

Of course, this is all very subtle. Kat's not putting on a show. Index probably won't see the blush.* - Fri Oct 30 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sticks to her pillow as far as cuddling goes, despite what she's said.

"I see. . ." she says, quietly.* - Fri Oct 30 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head.

"Don't." she says. Her voice is still muffled by her pillow.* - Fri Oct 30 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tell me about this failsafe though. - Fri Oct 30 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What is it exactly? - Fri Oct 30 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls over to face the opposite direction in the mean time. Her face remains burried.* - Fri Oct 30 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds. . . . - Fri Oct 30 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Impossible. - Fri Oct 30 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are you playing me? - Fri Oct 30 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not. - Fri Oct 30 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's pretty cool to be honest. - Fri Oct 30 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Fri Oct 30 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If you're lucky. - Fri Oct 30 02:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And I'm completely unlucky. - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Maybe we'll get to see someone try and stab me. - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure. . . - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What're they playing at? - Fri Oct 30 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wea-- - Fri Oct 30 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wait. - Fri Oct 30 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls her pillow away after saying that. Slowly Kat sits up and turns around as she does so. Her legs are left sprawled out underneath her form, and she faces the north. Kat's palms rest on the matress inbetween her legs. Briefly the teen glances over at Index.

A faint frown is on her face.

"You said you bought 'a' person a weapon. Not the entire army."

It becomes apparent at this time that Kat's wearing nothing but a T-shirt. She'd been in bed sulking for the past few hours after all.* - Fri Oct 30 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I picked selectively. - Fri Oct 30 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Her must trusted shinobi. - Fri Oct 30 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander, slowly.

"Didn't tell me any of this." she says.

"But you....thought it was important. You tried to imply...Kirigakure was a problem. I shrugeed it off, but you didn't tell me everything."* - Fri Oct 30 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thought.... - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This entire time.... - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That you were probably hiding a whole lot from me. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Never minded though. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Well, not the whole time. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I started trusting you at one point. - Fri Oct 30 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: .... - Fri Oct 30 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Are you saying you don't trust me, Kat? - Fri Oct 30 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. As she does so, Kat turns and crawls over onto his lap. Eyes are averted as she does so. Her half-naked butt is placed in his lap, and her hands find his shoulders.

Kat's expression despite these things is very blank, and almost cold when she pushes down on him. Secures him to the bed.

"I'm saying. . ." she says.

"That I like not trusting you."* - Fri Oct 30 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares back, maintaining eye contact.

"But it is true, right?" she inquires.

"You hid things from me?"* - Fri Oct 30 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Fri Oct 30 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But like before...I'll tell you whatever you want to know. - Fri Oct 30 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Dead. - Fri Oct 30 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: -omit-0 - Fri Oct 30 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) presses down harder on his shoulder. Her legs close a bit, hugging his form.

"Lying to me. . ." she says.

"Again."* - Fri Oct 30 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Now that I know about the lying. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder where Saeza comes into all of this. - Fri Oct 30 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) closes her right hand, into a fist. The fist is placed on Index's chest, where his heart might be. It remains there. Kat puts weight into it as she stares.* - Fri Oct 30 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Fri Oct 30 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's left palm finds the back of her fist.

"Tell me those things." she says, not breaking eye contact for even a moment.* - Fri Oct 30 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander until they find the tattoo on Index's chest, in response to him looking at it while saying Fujitora's name. She stares.

Her exceptional eyes wander more closely, carefully studying the intricate details. In time, it becomes very obvious, with these eyes that easily find any and all traps in existance.

This is fuuinjutsu.

"I see." she says.* - Fri Oct 30 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anything else? - Fri Oct 30 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah, I just want to say this if you really are going to blow a hole in my chest. - Fri Oct 30 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah....? - Fri Oct 30 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: These last....Three months, have been the best of my life. I don't regret a single moment of the time I've spent with you. - Fri Oct 30 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's fist unclenches. Her left palm finds Index's shoulder. Afterwords, both hands slowly slide upwards, towards the mattress at either side of his head.

She shrugs.

"Keep your secrets." she says.

"Wasn't gonna kill you. Just scared you so I could learn how you think. I don't care about Fujitora, or the silly Mizukage, or Saeza at all."

* - Fri Oct 30 03:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I want to be Hokage. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's the reason I'm not with Edge, slaughtering tons of people for no reason other than a rush. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's the -only-. . .reason. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And our goals probably don't mix well. - Fri Oct 30 03:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Doesn't bother me. - Fri Oct 30 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Even if you're killing thousands. - Fri Oct 30 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just. . . - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tell me things in detail in the future. - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If my life is in danger, let me know. - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My life, or my claim on Konoha. - Fri Oct 30 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With Kirigakure, you didn't let me know at all. - Fri Oct 30 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You gave me vague information I couldn't act on. - Fri Oct 30 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm sorry Kat, It wasn't my goal to be so vague..But In the future, I'll be sure to tell you everything if it endangers you or Konoha. - Fri Oct 30 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances down towards where his hands are. Silently she draws in a breath through the nose.

"Okay." she says, looking at him again.* - Fri Oct 30 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her hands then move, sliding accross the matress and only rising up when she's forced to by his arms being in the way. Her hands eventually find the underside of his own arms and she slides them under.

The girl leans forwards and hugs him around the chest and arms. Her own face finds his chest and she nods, looking towards the east.

"Interrogating you made me really sleepy." she says. She wiggles a bit, into a comfortable position.

"I think I made myself bored."* - Fri Oct 30 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Fri Oct 30 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's boring because now I know everything. - Fri Oct 30 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not much to worry about anymore. - Fri Oct 30 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But....hmmmm. - Fri Oct 30 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What do I tell Hassan, about Saeza? - Fri Oct 30 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That she wanted to use you to kill the Mizukage? Seems like that might have him asking questions we don't wanna answer. - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That she attacked you, and what happened was in self-defense. - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He'll wanna know why. He can't believe she attacked me in the first place if he doesn't know why she did it. - Fri Oct 30 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm.. - Fri Oct 30 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You know, I think I'd think better, If I had some motivation~. - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What kind've motivation? - Fri Oct 30 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Maybe a kiss...Or something special~? - Fri Oct 30 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmm. - Fri Oct 30 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Fri Oct 30 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Close your eyes. - Fri Oct 30 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks herself up off of Index's chest. Eyes are locked onto him to make sure his eyes stay close. Some sounds reminiscent of buttons being undone are made. Snapping noises.

They're quiet. Kat's weight shifts a bit, and the bed shakes in response. Kat's shirt is then felt being lifted off of Index's flesh. Eyes wander off, and she produces a faint and cheeky smile despite herself. Her cheeks turn a bit pink.

Kat slowly leans forwards. Soon, he can smell her.

Something warm and soft sandwhiches his face. Kat's shirt is felt against his hair. Her arms wrap around his head.

"There." she says.

"You can open them."

He's in her chest, of course.* - Fri Oct 30 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's breasts are quite large and there's little room inbetween them. When she was younger and in Amegakure, they were large. Now she's matured quite a bit and got taller. They're bigger.

The girl's right, hardened nipple is moved and positioned against Index's lips.

Slowly Kat begins grinding back and forth. Her breast is rubbed back and forth against his mouth, and Kat's lower regions are rubbed against his crotch.

"So. . ." she says.

"Any ideas yet? For Hassan?"* - Fri Oct 30 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. In the mean time, Kat reaches down under the covers with her right hand. Her thumb slips into her panties from the right side. When she pulls, they snap.

"Take your time. . ." Kat says.

Her left hand finds the other side of the mentioned cloth and she breaks it there too. There's still clothes inbetween herself and Index's crotch, but it'd definitely be a lot easier than it was before. She doesn't move the ripped clothing to any other place.

"Not too much though. . ." she says, grinding a bit more agressively now and with her breathing a tiny bit labored because of it.

"Or he'll come slaughter us."* - Fri Oct 30 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's grinding slowly comes to a stop, though her breathing does become even more labored. Her chin rests against his head.

She stays where she is though so that he can keep suckling.

"It's pretty irresponsible. . ." she says, not quite panting but during a breath.

"To not be talking to Hassan right now, and telling him about Kirigakure."

Kat's right hand finds her panties below that she'd ripped. Gently she pulls them away. They're set aside soon afterwords.

With the same hand she finds Index's left wrist. Carefully she guides the hand to her butt and holds it there for a moment.* - Fri Oct 30 04:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arm moves up to where it'd been before, hugging him.

"People could die." she says, with a smile on her face as her nipple is suckled on.* - Fri Oct 30 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply remains as she is until further notice. Offended as one may be, Kat's simply "paying for information" right now. She's too tired to play.

The teen nuzzles her face into his hair, but otherwise does nothing.* - Fri Oct 30 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Okay." she says inbetween breaths.

A glance is sent his way, though she doesn't move or anything.

"What idea?"* - Fri Oct 30 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Fri Oct 30 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can't go with an idea that's "pretty good, and maybe passable," Index. - Fri Oct 30 05:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes slowly wander off, back to the sky above. Silently and subtly she takes a deep breath through the nose.

Her expression relaxes.

It remains a bit cold. Relaxed, but cold.* - Fri Oct 30 07:33:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and rises to her feet with a silent sigh. As Kat rises up, all dirt on her form hovers up into the air before falling to the ground.

She turns to follow Kilm.* - Fri Oct 30 11:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls one of the couch pillows close and curls up into a little ball against the nearest armrest. The pillow is hugged closely, though her expression remains blank.

She'd lie down if she could, but of course, that'd look really bad considering she's dating someone and all.

Kat shakes her head in response to Kilm's question.* - Fri Oct 30 11:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns in place and does lie down, on her belly. Silently she sighs as she stretches out, lying flat.

And then immediately afterwords she lazily curls up into a ball once more, facing the south.

"Yeah." she says with eyes averted. Her expression remains pretty blank. It suggests few specific things, but she does look sleepy.

"I killed Saeza. Self-defense but it might look like murder. I may be executed."* - Fri Oct 30 11:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to lie on her belly. She burries her face into her pillow for a moment. Eventually she turns her head to face the north, hiding her face.

"Honestly...?" she repeats.

"I'm getting really tired of fighting for my life every....single.....day."* - Fri Oct 30 11:15:24 2015
