<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes. The teen remains silent for many very long seconds. Eventually though, with a silent sigh, she walks over. Her butt is soon planted next to him in the sand, and she sits. One leg crosses over the other, and palms rest at either side of her.

"Fine." she says, having only been speaking to herself. The only way for a disguised person to vent....is to be cryptic, and speak to themselves. Unless they want to die that is.

"Talk."

Keiko's eyes remain focused on the south.* - Fri Oct  2 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's eyes are out of focus. She stares off to the south the entire time, like a mad woman. She's finally lost it. Snapped.

She can't do this anymore.

A hand reaches into her kunai holster. From it she pulls a kunai. Briefly the teen twirls it around her index finger.

With that, she then rams it very hard into her right thigh, no doubt leaving a scar.

Immediately, Keiko's face releases a puff of white smile. Said smoke slowly hovers up into the air and scatters before eventually disipating.

Keiko's facial features change, and her voice does too. Nothing else does though. This is a very intelligent person. Not intelligence as in wisdom as retarded people think, but intelligence as in IQ. She knows better than to henge her entire body, for so many reasons.

"Am the former Hokage." she says, still staring southwards.
"Katsune."* - Fri Oct  2 21:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. With her left hand she reaches up to place her hat snuggly on her head. Beads from all directions hide her features from anyone not very close; not to mention the shade from the accessory.

"You didn't do anything." she says, glaring into space.
"I just decided....that from now on, I kiss no one's ass. No more choosing my words. No more niceties unless I feel like being nice."

"I'm turning this into a world where no one has to do that just to stay alive. So I'll start with liberating myself."* - Fri Oct  2 21:33:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) makes no moves to hold the cloth over her wound. She doesn't care. The teen has the constitution of a monster. An abomination. She can afford to lose some blood.

"I need to relax for a bit, even if I can't afford to. So I will."* - Fri Oct  2 21:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: If you really are a man that does things...as you implied in Konoha.... - Sat Oct  3 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah. Traveling with you 'could' be fun. - Sat Oct  3 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm not talking about wanton slaughter. - Sat Oct  3 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm talking about any excuse at all. - Sat Oct  3 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Not 'necessarily' wanton slaughter anyway. - Sat Oct  3 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I want....to be a shinobi again. - Sat Oct  3 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Right now....taking a headband means I have to show someone who I am. That I'm Katsune. - Sat Oct  3 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: They'd want to henge check me or something I'm sure. - Sat Oct  3 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: That's why I'm looking for other means of putting my skills to use. - Sat Oct  3 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: Not for money. For peace of mind. - Sat Oct  3 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Sounds fun. - Sat Oct  3 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: But in my world. - Sat Oct  3 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: There are only secrets. - Sat Oct  3 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Will you accept this? - Sat Oct  3 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm not sure what you mean by that but I guess I'm not supposed to. If you're saying you'll hide things from me....that's perfectly fine. I have no problem being obedient. Never have had a problem being...obedient. - Sat Oct  3 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I respect the traditional practices of shinobi and I understand the value of hiding things from subordinates. - Sat Oct  3 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: I'm not saying that i'll only hide from you, But, If you reveal anything it's punishable. - Sat Oct  3 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hello everyone. - Sat Oct  3 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: That's perfectly fine. I won't reveal anything. - Sat Oct  3 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) whispers: Come with me. - Sat Oct  3 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hello. - Sat Oct  3 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to follow.* - Sat Oct  3 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances up at him after he opens the door, as if considering things before she walks in. Hesitating. Eventually though she wanders in.

Of course, she keeps walking as she does so, and wanders the room for a bit, maybe looking for a comfortable place to sit down.* - Sat Oct  3 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) sits down on the mentioned couch. Arms cross, and one leg crosses over the other. She shakes her head in response to his offer.

"I'm fine, thank you." she says.

Eyes study the room and everything in it.* - Sat Oct  3 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. Eyes rest on the floor, or coffee table, or whatever. Either way, she's not paying attention to whatever she's looking at. She's only thinking.

"Yes. I used to ask Zetsumo to put me to work, after the war. Couldn't get the bloodlust out of me. Wanted to keep myself busy. He saw it as too much work and instead beat me until I stopped asking. The only time I'm really comfortable at times like this...is when I'm killing, or chasing, or otherwise ruining someone's day."* - Sat Oct  3 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances over at him, indeed making eye contact and potentially being caught in genjutsu. Her guard's not exactly up at the moment.

"Are you testing me?" she asks.
"Testing my integrity? Because I'm 'not' manipulating you."* - Sat Oct  3 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fine. - Sat Oct  3 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: ...... - Sat Oct  3 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Something wrong? - Sat Oct  3 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. Eyes wander.

The girl opts to simply pretend she isn't aware she's supposed to be sticking out her tongue right now.

Logically, it is possible she'd make that mistake. She doesn't object outright though as this could potentially be something unrelated to kissing or anything equally unacceptable.

"No." she says.* - Sat Oct  3 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) reaches up to scratch her cheek. The teen's nose wiggles a bit.

"...Fine." she says.

Her mouth opens, and her tongue slowly reaches out, resting on her bottom row of teeth. Eyes wander to peer over at Seisuke as she does so.

She needs to at least be sure he's not planning on cutting her tongue off or punching her chin or anything -- either of which would kill her pretty much instantly.* - Sat Oct  3 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) withdraws her tongue as Seisuke's fingers draw near, and closes her mouth. The girl leans backwards and stares down at his hands.

A sour and faint frown is on her face.* - Sat Oct  3 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That's because you know...I have nothing to gain killing you. - Sat Oct  3 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances over at him, her expression remaining sour. Eventually though, her eyes slowly wander off. With a silent sigh through the nose, she opens her mouth and once more sticks her tongue out.* - Sat Oct  3 18:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) is successfully sealed of course, which was gonna be the case no matter what. The only question is whether or not she knows about it so she can actually ask him about it and discuss why this is a bad idea, and was a terrible idea with Noriko did it.

Her mouth closes, and she frowns. A glance is sent Seisuke's way. She says nothing.* - Sat Oct  3 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) literally focuses her senses on her mouth, eager to find out if any funny business is at work here.

Another glance is sent his way. Can she sense it?

"Okay. . ." she says.* - Sat Oct  3 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Sat Oct  3 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We will both make Four Rules, which we have to abide by when using this space. - Sat Oct  3 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Sat Oct  3 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Our rules apply to both of us, and we can't make a rule that overwrites a rule of the other person. - Sat Oct  3 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Is that fine? - Sat Oct  3 18:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll give you the first rule then. - Sat Oct  3 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Sat Oct  3 18:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: The first rule on my side would be. - Sat Oct  3 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We must both meet here at least once a week at the same time. - Sat Oct  3 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: As long as it's not necessarily the same time every single week..... - Sat Oct  3 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I can agree to that. - Sat Oct  3 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Mind elaborating? - Sat Oct  3 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Long way to travel....but..... - Sat Oct  3 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I just mean, what if I'm busy? - Sat Oct  3 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Or...something. I dunno. - Sat Oct  3 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It doesn't have to be the exact same time. - Sat Oct  3 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But. - Sat Oct  3 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: At least once a week, doesn't matter when exactly. - Sat Oct  3 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Your rules can be absolutely anything as well. - Sat Oct  3 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Like for example "When we meet you must wear underwear on your head". Something crazy like that is valid. - Sat Oct  3 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What will be your first rule then Katsune? - Sat Oct  3 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Sat Oct  3 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: If...I need to be here every week. - Sat Oct  3 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I want it to be stocked with sake at all times. - Sat Oct  3 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm~? Consider it done. - Sat Oct  3 18:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's expression is still pretty blank, if one that may even suggest slight discomfort. Eyes wander, and she nods.* - Sat Oct  3 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Well then. - Sat Oct  3 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Neither of us is allowed to bring anyone into this specific place, only me and you will be permitted to stay here. - Sat Oct  3 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That works. Am I allowed a new rule if that ever changes? - Sat Oct  3 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What do you mean? - Sat Oct  3 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Only that I be told in advance if someone else is gonna be here. Their name. For reasons related to....not dying. - Sat Oct  3 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I suppose, I won't count that as a rule, but that's a given. - Sat Oct  3 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sat Oct  3 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What's your second rule? - Sat Oct  3 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I don't think I need anymore, aside from the obvious. - Sat Oct  3 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Don't spike my drinks. - Sat Oct  3 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That's fine. - Sat Oct  3 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then I'm going to add a fun rule. - Sat Oct  3 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then again it's more for security. - Sat Oct  3 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: All clothes, and weapons will be deposited into a box located at a designated area upon entry. - Sat Oct  3 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) scratches her cheek with her right hand. A faint, cheeky smile is produced, and her cheeks turn a bit pink.

She's assuming he's joking.

"Details." she says.

"'All' clothes? And for how long?"* - Sat Oct  3 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's eyes stay averted, of course.

"You're joking." she says.

"Either way, don't like that rule."* - Sat Oct  3 19:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: First of all. . . - Sat Oct  3 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'm going to want a drink after all. - Sat Oct  3 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Secondly.... - Sat Oct  3 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "I have no interest in seeing you completely naked while we discuss plans." she says, her blush a bit more colored by now.

"Can't let you have this rule."* - Sat Oct  3 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Alrighty then, What if I modify it? To only underclothes. That should be fine correct? - Sat Oct  3 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) takes the glass. "If...you get this rule." she says.

"Then I'm getting a rule that I don't have to be here every week."

She reaches up to steadily pour much of the liquid into her mouth.* - Sat Oct  3 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) clears her throat. She expected to be done drinking after the last gulp. Instead, she lifts the glass further up and pours the rest of it down with Seisuke's last comment.

Her empty glass is kept in hand. Of course, that's an awful lot of alchohol since sake's not meant to be served in glasses, but she's not exactly drunk or remotely tipsy either.

Eventually she shakes her head, with eyes of course still wandering. You can't look someone in the eye when they're saying these sorts of things.

"Na." she says.
"Can't do this rule."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) || "Mm..." Katsune murmurs, extending her glass towards him.

"More sake."* - Sat Oct  3 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Also no, I don't think I'm biting for that one either. - Sat Oct  3 19:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) sips. She needs to, for her nerves. Her response takes a while for that reason.

"How about...." she says.
"If you tell me I have to sit in your lap, I have to sit in your lap. That rule sounds more fair."* - Sat Oct  3 20:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods, keeping her glass away from her mouth now. She's had quite enough alchohol for a day, monstrous constitution or no.

"'Kay." she says, eyeing the contents of said glass.
"No weapons still sounds fair. Let's keep that part of your other rule."* - Sat Oct  3 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head in response to his offer, seeing as she still has plenty.

In response to his questions she says "I think I might like to go. If I were a knight of the round, then....well. What perks does that come with?"* - Sat Oct  3 20:31:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Nope. - Sat Oct  3 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno if I'm going though. - Sat Oct  3 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Didn't think so. - Sat Oct  3 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: It's to the death. - Sat Oct  3 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Is it? - Sat Oct  3 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Probably won't go. - Sat Oct  3 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Sat Oct  3 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh. - Sat Oct  3 20:45:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That's fair. - Sat Oct  3 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances up towards the arm in consideration of it. Her senses stay focused. A way to be paranoid without Seisuke noticing.

"I guess so." she says.* - Sat Oct  3 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So tell me, Is Kilm your Spouse? - Sat Oct  3 20:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Can you cook? - Sat Oct  3 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Not really. - Sat Oct  3 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I mean, maybe a bit. - Sat Oct  3 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Is it edible? - Sat Oct  3 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Edible....yes. - Sat Oct  3 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Could I try it? - Sat Oct  3 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mmmmm.... - Sat Oct  3 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Something wrong? - Sat Oct  3 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: IIIII....can make, like, Miso. That's about as far as my talents with cooking go. - Sat Oct  3 20:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Make sure you cook it with a lot of love. - Sat Oct  3 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: *snicker* - Sat Oct  3 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. A tongue presses against her cheek, and eyes wander. Strongly, the girl considers blowing him up with her jutsus.

"I...just want to keep an ally." she says.
"Don't let it get to your head."

Of course, that could obviously be a lie. Why everyone never suspects as much in a shinobi world is way beyond her.

Afterwords she leans forwards to place her glass down on the table. With that, she then stands up and begins making her way to the kitchen.* - Sat Oct  3 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eventually finishes cooking. She then prepares two bowls, each with chop sticks or whatever inside them. Afterwords she makes her way back to Seisuke and offers his bowl to him as she waits for him to move his legs.

"Careful..." she says, basically with her tongue in her cheek and with eyes averted.

"You have no way of knowing I didn't spit in that."* - Sat Oct  3 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) sits, once more crossing one leg over the other.

Keiko doesn't give much of a response to his teasing. Hands find her chop sticks and the teen begins lazily stirring and picking at her food.* - Sat Oct  3 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Don't think so... - Sat Oct  3 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: No, it doesn't. - Sat Oct  3 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) did eventually respond though, when she spoke.

Either way, she takes some time to eat. The girl leans back enough against the couch to suggest relaxation.* - Sat Oct  3 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Taught myself. - Sat Oct  3 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Can't always get good miso. - Sat Oct  3 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So you had to learn to make your own? - Sat Oct  3 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Haha. - Sat Oct  3 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: No really. I've been to some nasty villages. - Sat Oct  3 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: And yes, I did. - Sat Oct  3 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: But yeah. Decided. Not going to the tournament. - Sat Oct  3 21:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Right now....I'm chuunin leveled at best. Not exactly kage-tier. Never was. - Sat Oct  3 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Why not go ? - Sat Oct  3 21:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Realized that the second you said it. - Sat Oct  3 21:38:46 2015
