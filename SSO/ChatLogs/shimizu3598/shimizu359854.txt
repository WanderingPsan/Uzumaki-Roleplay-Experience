<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns around and wanders off.

Hassan isn't the only person she needs to talk to today.* - Sat Oct 31 11:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to an abrupt stop at the sight of seeing Index enter the area.

Eyes wander off towards his feet. After a long pause, she slowly begins turning to face him.

Eyes lock onto his and Kat's expression is blank. Relaxed.

"'Morning. . . ." she says.* - Sat Oct 31 11:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Nice day to be a neighbor... - Sat Oct 31 11:39:44 2015

Afterwords she turns on her heel and begins walking away.* - Sat Oct 31 11:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....No. - Sat Oct 31 11:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Marissa, I appreciate it. But we know everything we need to know, We'll reap the benefits or consequences for out actions. - Sat Oct 31 11:43:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) silently draws in a breath through the nose.

"Somehow....I think I can control myself." Kat slowly shakes her head without breaking eye contact.

"I'll just start walking. It'll feel....really good. Almost orgasmic." she says, emphasizing that last word. Cooing.

"And then....you'll try to stop me. That....." she says before drawing in a silent breath.

"That's when I kill you. When you're stupid enough to try and lay a hand on me. That is when I will fucking end you."* - Sat Oct 31 11:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: That's where you are wrong. I won't stop you. That's not my job, not unless ordered to do so.  - Sat Oct 31 11:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm....glad. - Sat Oct 31 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and begins walking away, with a bit of a swagger.

She goes right past Marrissa, though she does keep eight feet of distance between them as she does so.* - Sat Oct 31 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: She's on her period. - Sat Oct 31 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Eh...Village once at a peak..But shall it say such an early farewell and tumble down?.. Hmm.. - Sat Oct 31 11:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I'm scared. - Sat Oct 31 11:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leads Index way the fuck out unless he stops her.

If not, she now stares over at him from twenty full feet away. Arms are at her sides, and Kat's weight shifts a bit.

She stares, very blankly. Despite her outrage just now she's incredibly calm. An unbelievable situation but it's the truth.

It shows, too.* - Sat Oct 31 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression hasn't changed a bit despite the words she begins speaking. When she speaks, her tone is very polite and calm.

"Guess why I'm upset." Kat says.

"Guess why I ranted and almost killed Marrissa in front of the whole village."* - Sat Oct 31 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly draws in a silent deep breath.

Slowly, eyes wander off. Having calmed down a bit, she actually wonders now if this is the right place for this discussion.

Kat doesn't speak for thirty full seconds. Thirty. Full. Seconds.

Eventually though, she does.

"Did Saeza....attack me because she was jealous?" she inquires.* - Sat Oct 31 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly and silently draws in another breath, through the nose. Kat's weight is reduced to nothing, by way of a certain jutsu. Slowly, Kat descends to the sand below.

Kat's left with legs sprawled out underneath her form. Her palms rest in said sand inbetween her legs.

Eventually she goes even further.

Kat declines onto her back. Arms and legs are sprawled out at either side of her.

Very blankly, Kat stares up at the sky above.

"Did. . ." she begins, before a long pause.

"You make me into a murderer?"* - Sat Oct 31 12:02:46 2015

Kat pauses.

"Was she...jealous of Kirie too? Is that the...-real-, reason...she asked you to kill Kirie? Was Saeza wanting to rule Kirigakure a lie?"* - Sat Oct 31 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly rolls over onto her side, facing the west. Once more Kat silently draws in a breath. Slowly she rolls up into a ball.

Palms rest sandwhiched inbetween her legs.

"Not...what I'm asking." she says with eyes on the ground.

"Were you doing things with Kirie? Flirting or...anything?"* - Sat Oct 31 12:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes. Her cheeks turn a dark shade of pink.

She says nothing.* - Sat Oct 31 12:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) seems to not really register Index's word.

"I was only considering killing you because I thought, maybe, you and you alone made me murder someone. No other reason." she says.* - Sat Oct 31 12:20:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I had a plan for the day before we came out here. - Sat Oct 31 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

With a silent sigh she stands up, swaying to and fro a bit as she does so.

Eyes fall on Index. She follows him if he begins moving.* - Sat Oct 31 13:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the hand and follows.* - Sat Oct 31 13:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't say anything either.* - Sat Oct 31 13:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and plants her butt on the couch cushions. For a moment she eyes the box, though her eyes wander off afterwords.

Kat's expression remains blank. The teen pushes all distractive thoughts out of her head so she can plan like a proper, god damned ninja. A 'real' ninja.

As such, she's calm. She has to be, because of how horrifying most of her thoughts have been. She can only be calm, or insane. One of the two, and she's choosing the safe one.

Kat's legs are sprawled out underneath her form and her palms rest on the cushions.

She says nothing.* - Sat Oct 31 13:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances down at it.

"I should probably wait." she says.

"Until I can be happy when I open it, or whatever."* - Sat Oct 31 13:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I do. - Sat Oct 31 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't have a good....'foresight', So I have no clue what his reaction would be. - Sat Oct 31 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And I don't know him as well as you do. - Sat Oct 31 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I don't see why he'd come after me. - Sat Oct 31 13:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Hm...? - Sat Oct 31 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Katsune's probably in the other room listening to all of this. - Sat Oct 31 13:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not her clone. - Sat Oct 31 13:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) abruptly disipates in a puff of smoke.* - Sat Oct 31 13:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is lying in bed since it was her clone talking to Index this entire time, and confronting her.

At this time she gains all of the clone's memories. As such, it takes her many very long minutes to process all of the information. Especially the emotions.

Fifteen full minutes pass. If Index speaks to her in that time, she doesn't even speak. She simply stares into space.

Kat's under the covers and holding a pillow. She's hugging it close with both arms and legs. Her mouth is pressed to it, but her face is mostly visible.* - Sat Oct 31 13:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sat Oct 31 13:42:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's why.... - Sat Oct 31 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I came here asking for a place to live. - Sat Oct 31 14:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't respond.

She keeps talking.

"It would be easy for you...." she says.

"Because she trusts you. So."* - Sat Oct 31 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. Hmmm. - Sat Oct 31 14:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because "I knew Kirie in the past" doesn't explain why Saeza specifically wanted -you-. - Sat Oct 31 14:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She knew Kirie -trusted- you. - Sat Oct 31 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hassan will wonder why Kirie trusted you. He may ask. He may not. But he 'will' wonder. - Sat Oct 31 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah, she "knew" you. But the big deal is, she "trusted" you. - Sat Oct 31 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So we have to tell Hassan why she trusted you. - Sat Oct 31 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then. - Sat Oct 31 14:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's because I donated to help Kirigakure's repairs. - Sat Oct 31 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I offered Hassan the same. - Sat Oct 31 14:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wonder... - Sat Oct 31 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Before. - Sat Oct 31 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I was an ally. - Sat Oct 31 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Will that bother him, or not? - Sat Oct 31 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's definitely...shady of you. - Sat Oct 31 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Part of why I like you. You're shady. - Sat Oct 31 14:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hugs her pillow more tightly. Her expression is pretty blank. Almost cold.

Her mouth opens, and she takes some of the pillow in -- bites down on it.

Kat stares over at Index.* - Sat Oct 31 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) removes her mouth from her pillow, still staring.

"Wanting to kill you is good, when it's me." she says.

"But we're talking about Hassan. If it makes -me- want to kill you...then it might make -him- want to too."* - Sat Oct 31 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And I doubt.... - Sat Oct 31 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'll make him feel the same things I do. - Sat Oct 31 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds too...elaborate. When you elaborate too much in a story, people begin to wonder why. - Sat Oct 31 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Too much details, and you're lying. - Sat Oct 31 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's how they know. - Sat Oct 31 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's when 'I' know, or suspect. - Sat Oct 31 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What if it's simply because, I took out someone in her bingo book? - Sat Oct 31 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I mean we all know she isn't the smartest. - Sat Oct 31 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So she'd probably trust people easier. - Sat Oct 31 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly? I was attracted to her. Not in the sex kind've way. Not into girls. Not weak enough. - Sat Oct 31 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I.... - Sat Oct 31 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thought she was intelligent. - Sat Oct 31 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was wrong. - Sat Oct 31 14:32:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Meaning, your idea doesn't seem great, to me. - Sat Oct 31 14:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink.

Her eyes remain cold though. They remain focused, too.* - Sat Oct 31 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I said sex, didn't I? - Sat Oct 31 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . . . - Sat Oct 31 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: U-um. . . . - Sat Oct 31 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I would reccomend. . . . - Sat Oct 31 14:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs, silently.

"Honestly?" she says.

"I'd reccomend going back in time and never doing these things to begin with. From the beginning it was suicidal. That's....why I was interested in you. You're suicidal. -Very- suicidal."* - Sat Oct 31 14:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off.

"Maybe....I shouldn't be making the plans." she says.

"My plans involve 'not' being in danger in the first place. 'Your' plans are suicide. So...unless I'm telling you to not be you....it seems best that you make the plans and I just go with whatever."* - Sat Oct 31 14:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes the hand and stares down at it. Gently she squeezes. Slowly, eventually, she even begins kneading.

In a predatorial sort of way.

A murdery way.

She says nothing.* - Sat Oct 31 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops kneading in response to his words. A glance is sent his way. Eventually she takes her hand back. Kat's palms meet inbetween her legs.

She's in a ball, and her eyes are averted, when she says "Alright. What is it?"* - Sat Oct 31 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. . . - Sat Oct 31 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So I was thinking... - Sat Oct 31 15:00:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But, I can't. - Sat Oct 31 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I owe Sunagakure. I -can't-....just let any of these people die. - Sat Oct 31 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I -like-...these people. - Sat Oct 31 15:01:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But there's just. - Sat Oct 31 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: One more fight we have to endure. - Sat Oct 31 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: For the people you care about. - Sat Oct 31 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's weird. Never felt like this before. - Sat Oct 31 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I usually run from fights. - Sat Oct 31 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But this village. . . - Sat Oct 31 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't -want- it to be taken off of the map. - Sat Oct 31 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sounds to me like, you have something you love Kat. - Sat Oct 31 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: All the more reason to fight for it. - Sat Oct 31 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Oct 31 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually nods.* - Sat Oct 31 15:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sunagakure. . . - Sat Oct 31 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's....-mine-. - Sat Oct 31 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think that's why....I want to keep it safe. - Sat Oct 31 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It belongs....to -me-. - Sat Oct 31 15:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And someone's...trying to take it from me. - Sat Oct 31 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Never felt that way about Konoha. - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The people, yeah, but not the village. - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So... - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then this is my question. - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you -really- want to take over Konoha? - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Knowing how you feel about Sunagakure? - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You may never be able to come here for leisure after you do that. - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was never gonna do it in the first place until it felt right. - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno if I will. - Sat Oct 31 15:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If it'll ever feel right. - Sat Oct 31 15:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You have time though. - Sat Oct 31 15:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 31 15:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink once more. Silently Kat takes a deep breath.

"I dunno." she claims.

Kat's right leg rises, and she gently places it over Index's hip. In the same motion she slowly pushes herself onto him, aiming to carefully force him onto his back.

Should he allow her to do so, she'd then place both palms on his gut, side-by-side.

Eyes find his. They're the same blank -- or rather, guarded -- eyes.

"Not just our fists either." she says, almost cooing the words.

"Our minds. Our survival instinct. I'm gonna fuck Edge up, mentally before I do physically.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hips are naked, of course. She's in a T-shirt again. Wearing her bodysuit which is basically armor would, after all, rip the sheets.

Her butt in his lap is more or less bare.

The girl nods in response to his words.

Slowly she glances down towards his hands.

"I'll admit though..." she says, before looking down at his chest absent-mindedly and keeping her eyes there.

"I might be being a bit....aggressive. Now that I know the whole story, Marrissa doesn't have to die. I can just tell her what happened."

Eye contact is made to assess Index's body language when he gives his opinion.* - Sat Oct 31 15:45:29 2015

Eyes are wandering off as she does so.

"Marrissa's being trained. Last I checked she wasn't strong enough as far as jutsus and such go to beat me. Not combined with her weaker mind. But now Hassan is training her.
