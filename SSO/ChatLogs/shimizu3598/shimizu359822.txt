<br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) is eventually forced to lazily pull herself out of the mud. Having swam at such depths, no nose in the world can track her. Any nose trying would be fooled into thinking she's still in Sungakure. With a sigh, Keiko lazily sets up a cave for the two of them, using the hidden mole jutsu. As an extra precaution, an Earthen Corridor serves as an extra barrier for entry, with a sun-roof left open.

The two are then allowed to sleep. She offers to share a sleeping mat with Durn, and does so. She makes no skin contact and faces the opposite direction. Even so, she wants her useful and loyal comrade very close. Eventually they wake, and resume traveling underground with chakra restrored entirely.* - Thu Oct  1 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) the two keep swimming, for ages and ages. It's a good thing this jutsu allows them a supply of oxygen. Or at least, it must. There is oxygen underground after all, especially if there's liquid.  Occasionally they rest.

Often, Keiko suggests they spar. Presumably they do so. They practice jutsus and scheme; discuss things along the way. "When we get there, I suggest we avoid Niza for a while." she says. "I need time to think it over. We need a plan B, C, and D just in case he's not our friend."

They're hours closer to Kumogakure.* - Thu Oct  1 20:33:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) pulls herself out of yet another cave. While waiting for Kilm to wake up, Kat takes some time to train one of her favorite jutsus. Earth and stone bamboo shoot. She plants her butt on the ground, and her palms find the ground as well afterwords. Chakra is sent racing at a lightning-fast pace.

Eventually it finds the earth under a target practice tree. The ground is shifted and turned, manipulted. Four large spikes are formed. All are harder than iron, and close to steel in terms of strength. All crash into the tree very hard, shaking and rattling it to its core.

They resume traveling underground afterwords. Many hours pass, and they come closer to Kumogakure.* - Thu Oct  1 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) || During their travels, Keiko takes some time to train a different jutsu. Hands meet to form a certain handseal. With that done, the teen roughly shoves chakra into her hands. It forms to the raiton element, and travels rapidly all over her body before expanding. Due to the short range that is her body's surface, it's covering her nearly instantly.

The chakra expands to a full eight feet or so in all directions, as if to numb anyone there. This training persists for hours. Once Keiko's done, she and Durn are allowed to travel once more. They both once more submerge themselves deep underground and swim. It's exhausting, but it's good training.

More importantly, they have no choice.* - Thu Oct  1 20:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) slips out of the house she'd been squating in. Eyes dart to and fro to make sure no one's outside. With that, the girl sinks into the ground using the hidden mole jutsu, closing up her hole behind her as she always does when using it for stealth. With that covered, Keiko submerges herself to one-hundred feet beneath the surface of the earth.

Naturally, Durn is following her.

The two of them then make their way out of the village, avoiding any suspicious objects. Anything like a rock, anything square, anything solid that isn't pure unadulterated earth, Keiko avoids it and instructs Durn to as well.

They use the hiding like a mole jutsu's magnetic sensing to accomplish this feat. Keiko knew before they even got here that sneaking in may be a bad idea when they have travel papers. She'd only made the quick decision to sneak because Durn needed sleep. She'd had to think fast.

Now, though, her intentions are this. To simply leave...and come back through the front gates like she's never been here before. She'll show the guards her papers and get in the right way. If they decide she's dangerous, she'll just out-run them. Now that she's told Seisuke in a letter that they're here, she doesn't need to worry about being tracked due to a paper trail.* - Thu Oct  1 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eventually decides to simply leave Kumogakure for a number of reasons. First of all, Seisuke now thinks she's there so she can safely be in Sunagakure. Secondly...traveling is good training. It's exercise. It's not like she isn't doing these things on a daily basis anyway. 

Every single day she's sprinting up and down mountain walls. None of this is anything she isn't used to. None of this is much of a chore. Hands meet to form the tiger seal occasionally, and on those occasions Keiko uses the shunshin jutsu. She has to wait several seconds to use it again afterwords, but she uses it very often.

The girl needs her body to get even more used to this jutsu.* - Fri Oct  2 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop at some time during her traveling. At this time she sits down on the ground with legs sprawled out underneath her form and scoops up some dirt. Chakra is run through the substance, and she works on making it shift into a bandage with her Gantai Jutsu. She needs to master this technique at some point. She may one day be bleeding and need a cast.

Naturally she successfully makes several bandages before an hour is up. She's learned the jutsu, she just lacks mastery. It'll take time before she uses minimal chakra for it. Eventually she finishes her training. With that done, she uses the Subterannean Voyage jutsu to once more travel underground.* - Fri Oct  2 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eventually opts to just sprint for the rest of the way to Sunagakure. The girl knew from the beginning that Erebus is probably just trying to use her caution against her. To make her paranoid. He probably thinks she was manipulating her when she in fact wasn't. The very thought just makes her that much more motivated to fuck him over in every single way she can think of.

If he wants to wipe his ass he better check the toilet paper for explosive tag seals first. To dare and try to tell her tons of people want her dead when it's probably not even true...she'll make him pay for that. The truth is, he's unbelievably paranoid. Keiko let him know she likes lying to the public and misleading them so that she can get favorable responses from them.

How in the fuck he decided that meant she was manipulating him is anyone's guess. Anything she does to screw him over, he deserves for incompetence alone.* - Fri Oct  2 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop at some point in her travels. Keiko's butt is planted in the ground once more. Palms follow, and she chooses a boulder as her target. Chakra is sent racing through the ground, and it makes its way to the ground underneath said boulder. Once there, it begins manipulating the earth there.

She makes it rock-hard, and very strong. Once the density is satisfying, Keiko shoves the weapons into her target. Naturally, it's chipped and cracked in many places. This exercise is repeated over and over again for hours. Eventually, the girl rises to her feet with a sigh and brushes herself off.

With that done, she resumes traveling to Sunagakure.* - Fri Oct  2 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) plants her feet next to the kage statue. Arms cross and her weight shifts a bit. She keeps her eyes to herself.* - Fri Oct  2 00:57:36 2015

Maybe well over ten thousand if you could shopkeepers and such. It'd be silly if anyone thought she was suspicious just because they don't know her.

"...Ko." she says.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) lazily takes a seat, averting her eyes as she does so. The girl's left with her legs lying off to the side, and her butt planted on the cloth. Of course, she's not putting on a show. She's attempting to take a posture that can allow her to easily run away should she need to.

The girl takes a moment to dig through the presented basket and she takes two or three sandwhiches for herself. The truth is, she's done quite a bit of running on her way here and, as a matter of fact, she hasn't ate yet. She's been too tense to feel like eating.

The teen is staring down at the piled sandwhiches afterwords. Her expression is fairly blank. Her palm rests next to the collection. As if in consideration, she taps at the ground a few times with her index finger, lazily. Of course, that suggests little other than her maybe having something on her mind.* - Fri Oct  2 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: So. - Fri Oct  2 02:38:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. She lazily glances up at him, maintaining eye contact for a full second or so. Her expression 'is' blank, yes. That does of course suggest 'something'. However, it's important to note that her expression isn't -cold-. It's neutral.

A relatively friendly expression.

 "I'll admit I'm tense." she says, careful to tell as much truth as possible as always. "Truth is, I've been fighting for days and I've been traveling for a lot longer than that. Being around people again is still a bit weird for me."

Lazily, Keiko takes one of the wrapped sandwhiches and begins pulling the wrapping way. She attempts to make it look like she's not unbelievably hungry. Like she's relaxed. She inspects the bread for anything out of the ordinary, with her exceptional eyes. Any unexpected moisture...any odd colors. Anything of that general nature.* - Fri Oct  2 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That happens...when you've been away from people for a while. - Fri Oct  2 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eventually averts her eyes casually and pulls the sandwhich up to her nose. She sniffs at it, taking a subtle and long, slow breath. A silent one, through the nose. She attempts to find any suspicious or unusual scents. Eyes are on Tetsu again afterwords. With that, she takes a small bite of the sandwhich.

She begins chewing, allowing the food to stay in her mouth for a long while. On her tongue. She makes sure it tastes perfectly fine. It takes a while for her to swallow for this reason. Eventually, though, she does. A tiny lump slides down the surface of her throat.

She takes and releases another another subtle breath, this time almost a sigh. One that might even suggests she's legitimately relaxing. "That'd be nice." she says, staring.* - Fri Oct  2 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) || "Company is always welcome." she says, eyeing her sandwhich once more. There's a bit of hesitation, though she hides the fact exceptionally well. She has an awful lot of experience when it comes to putting on shows. Years of it.

The teen takes a few more bites. Eyes wander in the mean time. She gulps once more.

The girl says nothing.* - Fri Oct  2 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Konoha. - Fri Oct  2 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Taiga. - Fri Oct  2 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I wonder if she is even enjoying this. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I hope so. . .she is a bit attractive, and keeps on making me wonder everytime she speaks up. She is interesting to me I guess? - Fri Oct  2 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) looks up at Tetsu's headband. She examines it throughly, noting the color and symbol. Of course, to Tetsu, it'd seem like lazy and absent-minded curiousity -- unless he has some fantastic reason to be suspicious of her which seems very unlikely.

The teen makes no comments yet though. Eyes wander off.

"I was once a shinobi for a village in the land of Iron." she says.

"My village has long since been destroyed."* - Fri Oct  2 03:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Sometimes. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eyes her sandwhich again for a very long while. The pause after her uttered word is a very long one, as if to suggest hesitation. Lips tremble very subtly and briefly.

"Well." she says. "Things just happen."

She resumes eating. The teen stares up at his lips in the mean time, eyeing his frown. Studying it. Wondering why. A glance is sent up towards his eyes to further note the specifics of his facial expression before averting her eyes.* - Fri Oct  2 03:16:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Should really train my nose some day. Poison would be a really shitty way to die. - Fri Oct  2 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'm not sure what to say . . - Fri Oct  2 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I think I am starting to care more about this girl. . .is it because the concern I have over what happened to her? Or is it just what happens from being a teen? I need to just keep my head clear. . .I'll zone out again. - Fri Oct  2 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Either this is a very unusual boy. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Or he needs practice. - Fri Oct  2 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) finishes her sandwhich off.

The teen's palm rests on the blanket afterwords. Eyes stare down at the sandwhich there, and lazily she taps her finger against the ground often once more.

Eventually Keiko shakes her head. "I rarely need to talk about things. This topic is something I've talked about an awful lot already. I'm fine, but thanks for asking."* - Fri Oct  2 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: O-Oh. . .I see. - Fri Oct  2 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Alright then. - Fri Oct  2 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Definitely needs practice. - Fri Oct  2 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Some day, I should take a student. - Fri Oct  2 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) is fairly relaxed by now. Already she's decided that this boy legitimately could not hurt her if he wanted to, in any way. If he's watching her or feeding anyone information, she can already tell that he'll be no challenge, even as far as trickery goes.

"Your friend's from Konoha." she says, using only information he gave her today.

Eyes wander, lazily. "Sounds like he's a missing-nin."

She is, after all....according to herself, a former shinobi. It's not an unusual thing to wonder about. And of course...it's reasonable for small talk.* - Fri Oct  2 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? A three-million yen bounty was apparently put on him for having odd eyes apparently. - Fri Oct  2 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Odd eyes, huh? - Fri Oct  2 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mhm. - Fri Oct  2 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Seen a lot of odd eyes in my life. - Fri Oct  2 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: If your friend has a bounty, should you be telling a stranger that? - Fri Oct  2 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: And After the Kokage was overthrown. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Don't get me wrong I don't mean to offend you. I'm only concerned for yoru friend. - Fri Oct  2 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Fri Oct  2 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well ah. - Fri Oct  2 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I dunno. . .I don't mind telling you things. - Fri Oct  2 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Telling a stranger such a thing. Either foolish...or poor ability to lie. - Fri Oct  2 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I mean. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I've been in your company for a little while here, not long, and I know your name. If anything you're more than a stranger, and for some odd reason, I really don't mind telling you things. - Fri Oct  2 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow, staring up at him for the moment. Something about her eyes suggests a good mood, but it's very subtle.

Eyes wander off after she takes the time needed to study his body language. "I see." she says.* - Fri Oct  2 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: What if I were a bounty hunter though? - Fri Oct  2 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I can't tell anything she is thinking. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Weak friend. Special eyes. Easy money. - Fri Oct  2 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. - Fri Oct  2 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'd feel obligated to try and stop you. . .likely die doing so. - Fri Oct  2 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) || Subtle, but noticable. It's just not theatrical or anything.

In other words, no one in the world would guess that it's fake or forced, because it's neither.* - Fri Oct  2 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Sometimes...the best way to help your friend isn't by fighting, you know? - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: True. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: But, I don't have many friends. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Sure, I talk to people. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: But even Taiga isn't but so much of a friend. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: He is probably the closest thing I have right now. - Fri Oct  2 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: But even he isn't someone I would consider a full on friend. - Fri Oct  2 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Though, I'd still make up for my screw up if you were a bounty hunter. - Fri Oct  2 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit, it's nice to just talk to someone again, like this. - Fri Oct  2 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Really? - Fri Oct  2 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. In the wild, you can never let your guard down. - Fri Oct  2 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see . . - Fri Oct  2 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You have to watch everyone very closely. People want to steal your money...your food.... - Fri Oct  2 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I don't have much of any of that anyway. - Fri Oct  2 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Bandits, missing-nin. Anyone you meet could be wanting to attack you. - Fri Oct  2 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'd feel sorry for them if they attacked me. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: That's crazy! - Fri Oct  2 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. - Fri Oct  2 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Is there anything you want to do at all? - Fri Oct  2 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just name it! - Fri Oct  2 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'm fine just talking. - Fri Oct  2 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'm curious about your friend's eyes though, if you don't mind. - Fri Oct  2 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: What are they like? - Fri Oct  2 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Like I said I've seen a lot of unique eyes in my life. - Fri Oct  2 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? Purple, a single black ring on them. - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Interesting. And someone wants them? - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: The Hokage was overthrown.  - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: And for basically no reason the person who had taken over apparently put it on him. - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct  2 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus. Heard about 'him'. - Fri Oct  2 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Fri Oct  2 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I was considering going to Konoha. 'Heard' they had a new kage. A nice one. - Fri Oct  2 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Then I heard new rumors. - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Murderous man. Killing for no reason. - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Decided to steer clear of that place. - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: That's horrible. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . .you should join here. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct  2 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's nice having you around. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eyes the boy once more. Her expression once more suggests a wonderful mood. The look is in her eyes. Mostly just her eyes.

And eyes don't ever lie.

Her lips have moved only a bit. Her smile is so, so faint, but not forced or pretentious in any way.

"Would you like to spar?" she inquires.* - Fri Oct  2 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shrugs, rising to her feet. Briefly the teen brushes herself off. "Just want to." she says.

Eyes are averted when she says that, but she looks back up at him at this time. Both hands find her hips, and her weight is shifted just a tiny bit.

"Not here of course. We can't spar in the middle of the village. That's illegal."* - Fri Oct  2 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. The teen then turns on her heel and begins walking away. Eyes casually and lazily wander along the way, and arms cross for some brief amount of time even as she walks.

This weather will take some getting used to.* - Fri Oct  2 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) stops in the middle of the road. Arms cross, and weight shifts a bit. She takes a moment to examine the people here, lazily.* - Fri Oct  2 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well? - Fri Oct  2 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ... - Fri Oct  2 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *squints* - Fri Oct  2 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shrugs and turns to continue leading the way off. She wanted to see what was going on here but oh well.* - Fri Oct  2 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) goes through the motions on the way out, showing guards her travel papers and such without hesitation.* - Fri Oct  2 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) leads the boy way off. Some guards from the walls could easily see them from here, but may not be able to make out details.

Of course, if someone, ya know....-died-, then guards would definitely notice. At the very least, they'd notice shortly after Keiko left the scene. Of that, there is no doubt.

Slowly Keiko draws her right foot backwards through the dirt. Arms rise and hands clench partially, as if to mimic bared claws. "I'm looking forward to this." she says.* - Fri Oct  2 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I hope she doesn't think differently when she beats me. . . - Fri Oct  2 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances off to the side. In the same motion, quickly, she shifts her attention to Tetsu's feet. The experienced teen is very careful to not look at the boy's handseals. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

Never. Again.

Arms then rise and hands quickly form the tiger seal. As they do so, Keiko is crouching downwards and leaning backwards. Roughly, with incredibly strength but more importantly -speed-, Keiko launches herself backwards by no less than twenty full feet. She's turning ever so subtly in place during this entire trek.

At the end of her flight, Keiko flips backwards and allows her hands to part from holding their seal. Palms meet the ground, and Keiko's feet follow shortly afterwords. She's left on all fours.

Chakra is sent flying forwards invisibly within the ground. It moves at a lightning-fast pace. And with that, a very ginormous dome of rocky earth, hard as steel or even harder, is forming around Tetsu. It rises up out of the ground, even making said ground shake as it moves. No exit is provided.

The one exception is the ground. Keiko leaves that perfectly bare.

This corridor is twelve full feet high -- which is like, as tall as a two-story house -- and it's roughly fifty feet wide in any direction.* - Fri Oct  2 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) smirks, waiting a while to make sure her target is as weak as she thinks. It's a foxy sort of smirk. No really, this is fun for her. The girl stays crouched down on the ground, with palms there.

Abruptly, after waiting for the needed about of time, Keiko is sucked into the ground as if by some sort of supernatural force. That force being her chakra of course.

At a lightning-fast pace she travels forwards. And within a single second....Keiko would be at Tetsu's feet, under him. Abruptly, her arms come out of earth that is now softer than balls in a ball pin. She's able to easily pull Tetsu underground, his physical strength not mattering at all basically.

Once Tetsu is burried up to the neck, the earth seals itself up like cement oh-so-quickly. The binds that now hold him are harder than steel, as dictated by this kunoichi's excellent ninjutsu prowess.

And with that, Keiko's palms dig their way out of the ground six feet west of Tetsu. She pulls herself out, doing a brief backflip in the process and landing firmly on her feet. The teen then stands straight, and peers down at him. A faint smile is on her face. A genuine and friendly one.* - Fri Oct  2 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) slowly walks forwards, with a swagger. Arms rise and hands meet to form a certain handseal. And then, once Keiko is in point blank range, only three feet or so away, she lazily crouches down.

Chakra is channeled into her hands. "Open your eyes." she says.

She wants him to see the handseals.

Presumably though this jutsu doesn't require one to see the handseals. Presumably she can just pour her chakra into him directly? That's gotta be how it works.

Even so...should she succeed....Tetsu will begin feeling....afraid. Only a bit afraid. More than anything else he'd find himself feeling....very submissive. Very obedient. Very willing to help people -- or, in this case, Keiko in specific.

Keiko has some very important and urgent questions to ask this boy. She has to, to make sure she's safe.* - Fri Oct  2 04:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) reaches forwards to place her right palm on Tetsu's forehead. Her left arm rests on her left knee, just hanging down. Her chakra is then poured into the boy's brain directly. She has to be sure this is working.

This is how she remembers Beth using the jutsu back when she was interrogated by the week. That and well...she has been taught this jutsu. At any rate she totally knows how it's performed ICly. She's using it right regardless, ICly.

Keiko then makes eye contact and asks a subtle question. A harmless one. She needs to be sure that, in the event that this isn't an enemy, she has absolutely no need to kill him.

Keiko has every intention to let him live.

"So, Tetsu...." she says.

"How do you feel about me? What are your thoughts?"

Of course, due to the nature of this jutsu.....Tetsu will be compelled to tell her everything. Everything she asked and much, much more. He'd know to interpret it any way he wants and then some. Due to it speciifcally -breaking his will-, he'll be compelled even to tell her things pretty unreleated to her question.

In short, if Tetsu is watching her for Erebus or planning to inform her about her...Keiko -will- find out, right here and right now.* - Fri Oct  2 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Tell me....everything. - Fri Oct  2 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Never realized. . . this jutsu would be so helpful. - Fri Oct  2 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) tilts her head a bit, pouring even more chakra into Tetsu's head just to be...completely, 100% sure she's safe.

"Anything else....?" she inquires, her smile pretty much gone now. It's there and she's still clearly in a good mood, but it's faint.

Her eyes are the eyes of a snake.* - Fri Oct  2 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) shrugs, pulling her palms away. The girl then stands up and takes a few steps backwards. Once there, she lazily kneels down on her right knee. Both palms find the ground, and chakra is sent forwards within the ground. The earth trapping Tetsu's body softens up, and the aquantance from Konoha is released.

He's able to very easily pull himself out of the ground, as if he's resting in dry pudding or something.

"Wanted to practice my genjutsu on you." she says, the boy having been free ever since she removed her palm from his forehead of course.

"You don't mind, do you?" she inquires.

And of course, Keiko is completely 100% convinced that she gave Tetsu zero reason to suspect she is who she is. Zero reason to suspect she's a criminal or anything of that nature.

In other words, she's completely positive she has no need to kill or harm this boy in any way.* - Fri Oct  2 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fair price to pay for losing the spar, right? - Fri Oct  2 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) || "Sorry." she says, her smile an apologetic one now. "I shouldn't have done that. But...."

The teen reaches back towards the back of her right hip. She pulls her coin purse out of place, and brings it to her chest. Keiko then takes some time to rummage through it and look for the paper money that is "yen." Eventually she's pulled out an amount equal to one-hundred thousand.

An enormous sum.

She then hands it over to him.

"Here. How about some money for being my test subject?"* - Fri Oct  2 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow. Eventually she glances down at the money. With a shrug, she then puts it away. "Fair enough." she says.

"A date instead."

Eyes then find Tetsu again and she stares. "But...my jutsu did work on you right? I can't be sure. I have to know before I use it on someone for real. I need to be sure it's perfected."

She stands up straight as she puts her coin purse back where it belongs. Eye contact is maintained.* - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You'd be surprised how hard it is to find willing people. - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Even if I pay them. - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Do you seriously think I would tell you my feelings willingly? - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. I believe you. - Fri Oct  2 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Just wanted to hear you say it. - Fri Oct  2 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Anyway, this isn't going to be a normal date. - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm going to make sure you enjoy it, and thus, as a bit of payback, -you- have to take me on one, and actually -enjoy- it. - Fri Oct  2 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Fri Oct  2 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fair enough. - Fri Oct  2 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll try. - Fri Oct  2 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you say so. - Fri Oct  2 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct  2 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That almost happened to me once. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I was mad even though it never actually happened. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I was lucky. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Exactly. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: So yeah....I guess that was pretty rude. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Well, fuck. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: 'Course, the person I liked is dead. . . - Fri Oct  2 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Horribly dead. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Now I feel even worse. - Fri Oct  2 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) doesn't look disturbed at all despite having said that. She looks quite comfortable.* - Fri Oct  2 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Let's just say. . . - Fri Oct  2 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I didn't like them 'that' much. - Fri Oct  2 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: At all. - Fri Oct  2 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Fri Oct  2 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Especially in the end. - Fri Oct  2 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. Palms find her hips and her weight shifts a bit. Said eyes keep wandering.

"He had his moments. . ." she says.

"But...it's better for me that he's dead."* - Fri Oct  2 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) glances over at him.

"You sure?" she inquires.* - Fri Oct  2 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. - Fri Oct  2 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I want to, yet, just. . . - Fri Oct  2 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: No reason to go with me if it's just something to do. - Fri Oct  2 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Well. . . - Fri Oct  2 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: If that's what you're looking for. . . - Fri Oct  2 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You'll just have to get to know me better first. - Fri Oct  2 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Then when we finally go on a date, it might mean something. - Fri Oct  2 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? You mean the right way? By talking and not using Genjutsu, I'll do my best. - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. The right way. - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Stuff you said under genjutsu doesn't matter to me. - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I've already forgot about it. - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: We just met. - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Feelings change. - Fri Oct  2 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: So, the truth is.... - Fri Oct  2 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: A week from now? - Fri Oct  2 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Your thoughts are still private. - Fri Oct  2 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I have no idea what they are then...if that makes you feel better. - Fri Oct  2 05:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well, whatever, I think I'm going back to eatting at out pic-nic, you can join me, or not. - Fri Oct  2 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I don't care. - Fri Oct  2 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) makes eye contact. Her expression is still one that suggests a good mood, though mostly it's neutral.

"Want to know what my own thoughts are?" she inquires.* - Fri Oct  2 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: But. . .I have an awful lot of work to do. Not much time for dates/ - Fri Oct  2 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's expression turns cold instantly at the sight of that infamous mask.

She stares, her mouth falling very slightly agape. It stays agape for a long moment, as if she wants to speak but isn't sure what exactly to say.

An ANBU mask. It closely resembles the one of someone who once placed her under powerful genjutsu and nearly killed her.

She eventually closes her mouth, saying nothing. She isn't quite sure -what- to say exactly.* - Fri Oct  2 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's expression relaxes. Briefly she looks him up and down.

"You...are not off to a good start, with the emotions." she says, smiling weakly.

"Try to play me and I'll do something painful to you."* - Fri Oct  2 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Play you? - Fri Oct  2 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You really are this upset? - Fri Oct  2 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: If that's true I've already said I'm sorry. - Fri Oct  2 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not saying it again. - Fri Oct  2 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Let's be friends. - Fri Oct  2 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 06:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's not that I'm upset. - Fri Oct  2 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's simply. - Fri Oct  2 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You're looking at someone...who..... - Fri Oct  2 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Has been to war. Killed a lot of people. Watched close friends and loved ones die. - Fri Oct  2 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Is it surprising that. . . - Fri Oct  2 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: A idea of a date doesn't give me butterflies? - Fri Oct  2 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well, I didn't expect it to. - Fri Oct  2 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I was being somewhat selfish, being that. - Fri Oct  2 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I was using it to make myself happier, just because you bitch and whine about things you've been through, while I do feel bad, you do release you aren't the only one to have things happen to them? - Fri Oct  2 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: So in turn, it was for my selfishness, so in fact, I am sorry, while you should not be. - Fri Oct  2 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: So, if you could perhaps drop these walls. - Fri Oct  2 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll be on my way. - Fri Oct  2 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: So be it. - Fri Oct  2 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) reaches up to form the tiger seal. With that, she kneels down and places her palms on the ground. The earthen corridor begins slowly descending.

"Don't come close to me when you come by, or I'll kill you on a whim." she says, quite simply.* - Fri Oct  2 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I need....space. - Fri Oct  2 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers "space" a bit, in a theatrical manner. A taunting manner.* - Fri Oct  2 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: If you change your mind though and decide you'd like someone to talk to. . . - Fri Oct  2 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: A friend. - Fri Oct  2 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I could use one. - Fri Oct  2 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Don't...have a lot of them right now. - Fri Oct  2 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) stares at the blood. Her expression turns blank. She's seen blood drawn for jutsu use before. She has to know what he's doing.

Immediately she reminds herself of genjutsu. She's prepared already to make sure that whatever she sees, if anything, isn't an illusion.

Naturally as someone who's came close to dying to genjutsu many times, it's always the first thing that comes to mind.* - Fri Oct  2 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eyes the hand absent-mindedly. Still though she's watching for genjutsu. Any strange movements involving handseals or weapons....Keiko's always prepared, like any war veteran shinobi.* - Fri Oct  2 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I need better control of myself. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I've had "strange" friends before. - Fri Oct  2 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: All of my friends ever have been "strange." - Fri Oct  2 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Most of them are dead now. - Fri Oct  2 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Fri Oct  2 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Is that meant to drive me away or? - Fri Oct  2 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: It's meant to be encouraging. - Fri Oct  2 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: While you...sulk. I don't "whine," you silly little boy. . . - Fri Oct  2 06:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) studies his facial expression, and pays attention to his tone.

Did he sound sincere? Or passive-aggressive?* - Fri Oct  2 06:34:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) absent-mindedly glances over at Zenaki as she enters the area. Absent-mindedly as in, it's an easy thing to very quickly forget about.

Once her feet are planted in the dirty, Keiko turns to face the south once more. Her straw hat is removed and kept in-hand. Arms cross and weight shifts a bit.* - Fri Oct  2 14:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: But....well. He claims he doesn't mind us feeding everyone information on Erebus and starting a damned war -- which I started yesterday even before I asked Seisuke his opinion on it. - Fri Oct  2 15:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Durn(Vysasi) whispers: We're going to destroy him politically . . . Only to take over and rise Konohagakure once again from the ashes due to what position we will put it in to get rid of Erebus . . . Right? - Fri Oct  2 15:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) whispers: I dunno what I'll do. Be hokage? Maybe. I'll make sure Konoha is a nice place to live though. - Fri Oct  2 15:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander for four or five long seconds. For that amount of time, she's not following. Eventually though she turns to lazily follow after him.

Lazily and inconspicuously, she puts her hat on her head as she moves.* - Fri Oct  2 15:25:26 2015
