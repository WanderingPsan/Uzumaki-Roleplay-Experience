<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And he made it seem so cool. - Tue Oct 27 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: His fighting moves, the way he talked, I always thought 'Man, I want to be him'. - Tue Oct 27 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Do you know how this play ended? - Tue Oct 27 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With his death? - Tue Oct 27 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Actually, that's exactly how it ended up. - Tue Oct 27 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: You may be thinking. - Tue Oct 27 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: .."Why did he want to become a spy and a Shinobi and follow in the foot steps of someone who died?" - Tue Oct 27 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That's quite simple. - Tue Oct 27 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I was a stupid kid, and I believed I couldn't die. - Tue Oct 27 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It didn't really help with all the propaganda, Where I grew up...Being part of the 'Twenty percent' ,Made you an elite. - Tue Oct 27 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: In my Village there was only about Eight people who could even use chakra---Before me of course. - Tue Oct 27 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So being a stupid kid, I fed into it. - Tue Oct 27 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The reason I became a Shinobi, was based off childish ideals. - Tue Oct 27 21:28:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why? - Tue Oct 27 21:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should probably stop calling yourself a spy. - Tue Oct 27 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you're not spying for someone else I'm not sure you're a spy. - Tue Oct 27 21:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is smiling a bit when she says this.* - Tue Oct 27 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're gonna stop though, right? - Tue Oct 27 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being a "spy"? - Tue Oct 27 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah. - Tue Oct 27 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good. . . - Tue Oct 27 21:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Eh...It's kind of stupid. - Tue Oct 27 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What...? - Tue Oct 27 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: The only time, we've....actually kissed was through the game. - Tue Oct 27 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns in place, carefully. Afterwords the teen attempts to wrap her arms around Index, and then her legs. Her butt would be planted in his lap.

Carefully, Katsune would then attempt to push him onto his back so that she can lie on top.

"Don't feel like kissing." she says, with her face hidden due to her head's position on his chest.

"But I'll give you one of the hugs I owe you."* - Tue Oct 27 21:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So um. . . - Tue Oct 27 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're 'sure' about the situation with Shin? - Tue Oct 27 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits up as she says this, so she can look Index in the eyes. Her gauntlet-covered palms rest on his belly in the mean time.

Her expression's pretty blank.

"Because -I- am pretty....sure. . .that there's a lynch mob out to get you. A -mob-."* - Tue Oct 27 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . .? - Tue Oct 27 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares for a long moment. Confusion is apparent.

"Not talking about the ambassador." she says.* - Tue Oct 27 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Shin was in town, asking about Hideki's death. - Tue Oct 27 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I just might kill you while you're stuck in a hole in the ground. - Tue Oct 27 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Then...What would you do if I was already dead? - Tue Oct 27 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You really wanna give up your name? - Tue Oct 27 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I thought about doing that before. - Tue Oct 27 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: If it's what it takes to keep this away from home. - Tue Oct 27 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That was how I could escape Zetsumo or Erebus. - Tue Oct 27 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wasn't even an option for me. - Tue Oct 27 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You'd be living a lie from then on. - Tue Oct 27 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't care, If I have to live a lie for the world, As long as I can express my truth when I'm with you Kat. - Tue Oct 27 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I only wonder. . . - Tue Oct 27 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If that's true. - Tue Oct 27 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because if you do this. . . - Tue Oct 27 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And then decide you don't like it. . . - Tue Oct 27 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We might have a bigger problem. - Tue Oct 27 22:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: There's no reset, I know if I go through with this. - Tue Oct 27 22:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How did anyone find out about this? - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's important. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a big part of making sure everything goes well. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I don't know. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then we figure out how they figured it out. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Makes it a lot easier to find out who to slaughter. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How did you kill him? - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And where? - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: A Mountain, in the land of water. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You lied to me about that. There's no way you fought him off openly. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmm. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And No, I did kill him, His blood is on my hands. - Tue Oct 27 22:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: He ran into the blade he had given me moments before. - Tue Oct 27 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmmm. - Tue Oct 27 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "The rumors is....that Index killed him." - Tue Oct 27 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "The rumor. . ." - Tue Oct 27 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That means no one gave Ortho proof. - Tue Oct 27 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one convinced him. - Tue Oct 27 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They might be inferring that it happened. - Tue Oct 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Can't be sure, but they suspect it. - Tue Oct 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did anyone see you and Hideki leave together? - Tue Oct 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Not to my knowledge. - Tue Oct 27 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why. . . - Tue Oct 27 22:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: .... - Tue Oct 27 22:29:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -I-...would want to slaughter -everyone- stupid enough to cross me. - Tue Oct 27 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But. . . - Tue Oct 27 22:30:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why....? - Tue Oct 27 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: ---I'm not sure if I'm submissive...It has a negative conotation. - Tue Oct 27 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But. - Tue Oct 27 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'm not strong enough. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I have connections yes, I could have them all slaughtered without, leaving this couch. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I'd prefer to face my accusers directly. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If we found out exactly what was going on, I might kill every single one of your enemies myself. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd -kill- to have an excuse. - Tue Oct 27 22:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I appreciate it Kat, But I don't see us finding out their names not anytime soon. - Tue Oct 27 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: And on a side note--. - Tue Oct 27 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: At the risk of making this situation....Incredibly awkward, with you...Sitting on my lap and all...I'd like to avoid...A problem... - Tue Oct 27 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's expression remains pretty serious. It's an expression that suggests business. It's almost cold.

Gently, Kat begins swaying back and forth in place. She does so very slowly, forwards and then backwards, over and over again.

"What kind of awkward problem?" she inquires, maintaining eye contact.* - Tue Oct 27 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink despite herself.

A glance is sent down towards said lap.

Despite her blush, though, Kat's expression remains very stern and serious. Murdery.

Kat pauses for only a moment. Afterwords, she slowly leans forwards. Palms find Index's chest.

Once there, she resumes grinding, very slowly.

"We're not done talking though." she says.* - Tue Oct 27 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off, a bit awkwardly. Her blush remains. Silently the teen takes a deep breath. Her grinding remains slow, and carefully -- subtly -- she begins wiggling to and fro. Back and forth, during her grinding.

Senses lock onto the business below. Using every sense she has -- mostly the feeling on her skin -- she attempts to "size him up" so to speak.

To this end, the girl is very slow and careful. Her butt is pressed very firmly to him.

Kat says nothing at all for the moment.* - Tue Oct 27 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches over to pick up the pillow she'd been cuddling before. Gently, she places it over his face. Hands meet at either side of this pillow and she keeps it there.

Eyebrows are furrowed just a bit. A scowl. "No weird noises. . ." she commands, having stopped grinding for only a moment.

Kat resumes moving.* - Tue Oct 27 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head to stare down below during her exploring, due to the pulsing and whatnot. Her grinding comes to a stop while she focuses on that.

In the mean time her left palm explores the pillow. Carefully she looks for his mouth. When she finds it, she pushes it down a bit more gently to better muffle him.

"Quiet. . ." she says, very quietly.

Slowly, the teen then lies herself back down. She places her head on his chest and then reaches down to wrap her arms around him once more. Eyes remain averted and only very briefly she wiggles to get into a more comfortable position.

Katsune stops moving.
* - Tue Oct 27 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You can move the pillow....if you want. - Tue Oct 27 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is very quiet and still for the forseeable future.

She says nothing, and doesn't move.* - Tue Oct 27 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Tue Oct 27 23:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I... - Tue Oct 27 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: D...Do you think, we can stay like....This for a bit longer...? - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I....Didn't know what to say...And didn't want it to end up...In awkward silence... - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: I probably....Shouldn't have said anything to begin with... - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) thinks: Why am I so stupid? - Tue Oct 27 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: T-That was weird...wasn't it? - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm....? - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me raping you? - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: omit - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: M-Me asking i-if we can stay l-like this for a while longer... - Wed Oct 28 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hadn't responded for like, ten minutes or longer.

She remains quiet now too.* - Wed Oct 28 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows this, sitting up too.

An eyebrow rises and she stares up at him.

Aside from the lifted eyebrow her expression's pretty blank.

It's apparent that she's perfectly calm and relaxed at the moment.* - Wed Oct 28 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows the forehead-to-forehead contact, but only for a small moment. After only a brief pause she leans backwards a bit, staring down at him.

With a shrug she eventually says "Good."* - Wed Oct 28 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. . . - Wed Oct 28 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) carefully pulls herself out of his lap, leaving her legs carelessly sprawled out in his direction for the moment, due to laziness.* - Wed Oct 28 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Wed Oct 28 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not gonna go get sake? - Wed Oct 28 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Yeah, One second. - Wed Oct 28 00:49:55 2015
