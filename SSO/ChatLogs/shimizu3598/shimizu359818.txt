<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's voice is very cold. Her eyes are too, and she's staring.* - Sun Sep 27 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes . . . The others left with his corpse. - Sun Sep 27 13:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Poor guy. .  - Sun Sep 27 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is the -last- time that god damned man undermines my authority. - Sun Sep 27 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either he gives me the job or keeps it I will not be his figurehead. - Sun Sep 27 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And . . . Sabo and Baen referred to Erebus as the hokage. - Sun Sep 27 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have other places I could be. - Sun Sep 27 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: While insulting you. - Sun Sep 27 13:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Insulting me how? - Sun Sep 27 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sabo called you a bitch while Baen said fuck her. - Sun Sep 27 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Irrevlevent then. - Sun Sep 27 13:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be back. - Sun Sep 27 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Sun Sep 27 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and turns to wander off.* - Sun Sep 27 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 27 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You called? - Sun Sep 27 14:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: so now its either u get the pussy or potentially get 90% of ur organization killed - Sun Sep 27 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is resting her chin on two hands and her elbows on the desk. She eyes Erebus blankly, looking him up and down. As she does so she's slowly drawing in a deep breath.

"We should probably go somewhere private." she says.* - Sun Sep 27 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright then.. - Sun Sep 27 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Lead the way.. - Sun Sep 27 14:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She then turns and leads the way to the east wing.* - Sun Sep 27 14:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross when she sits down. One leg crosses over the other.

"Feel free to grab a chair if you want." she says, with a very slightly cold look in her eyes.

"You know you can."* - Sun Sep 27 14:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her chair to face him. She watches him as she speaks.

"I want to talk about what happened at the gate for starters." she says.* - Sun Sep 27 14:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Flexus was a very important man. - Sun Sep 27 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To 'us'. - Sun Sep 27 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You killed him. - Sun Sep 27 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was there some brilliance to that idea that I'm not aware of? - Sun Sep 27 14:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Walked up, saw a group of people, thought Kilm and Baen were being attacked, took one of the people hostage, found out what was going on, released the hostage, heard the stories being told, found out Flexus was dealing with people from both Kirigakure and Konohagakure, told Baen to dispose of him. - Sun Sep 27 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm aware he was dealing with Kirigakure too. - Sun Sep 27 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What makes that bad? - Sun Sep 27 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Kirigakure long since placed my name on their hitlist. - Sun Sep 27 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Naturally if I'm on it, so are anyone I'm affiliated with. - Sun Sep 27 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wasn't a Kirigakure ninja. He was unafilliated. - Sun Sep 27 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was using him. - Sun Sep 27 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Manipulating. - Sun Sep 27 14:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He had ties to Fujitora and a lot of other people. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I never let him learn anything confidential, unless my bonehead subordinates were. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: When I showed up, he was speaking information that only us, as a Konohagakure unit, knew. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I fail to see where I went wrong in having him killed. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What was he saying. . ? - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You may not have. - Sun Sep 27 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I just want to know how things are. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: He spoke of information pertaining to our plans of revolution. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Our plans to politically take over Kirigakure. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Not to mention the Sergeant of Kirigakure, Hassan, was present.. - Sun Sep 27 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Revolution? - Sun Sep 27 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How did Flexus know about that and not me? - Sun Sep 27 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You do know about it. The whole "destroy the Shinobi-system" thing is what he called "revolution". - Sun Sep 27 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I asked the same question, how do he know about any 'revolution' and I didn't..? - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then he explained.. - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Guess it's for the best you killed him. - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Not to mention he'll do anything his friend says.. - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What was that kids' name..? - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yen? - Sun Sep 27 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yin..? - Sun Sep 27 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Yan? - Sun Sep 27 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yan. - Sun Sep 27 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Lemme go ahead and say I'm not judging you. If I look tense it's because this job has been a lot more stressful than it could be. - Sun Sep 27 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It seems to me that I'm still a figurehead. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hypothetically speaking -- let's say that's the case -- then.... - Sun Sep 27 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's fine. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: However.... - Sun Sep 27 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I'm not aware of that, then it means I'll be embarassing myself an awful lot. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because we're trying to go in two different directions at once. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And obviously you have a lot more leverage. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Immortality and awesome power, and all. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My plans have been put on hold to assure that yours progress without fault. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's a sacrifice I made to assure your happiness. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't know how well that's going, but it's an attempt nonetheless. - Sun Sep 27 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Sun Sep 27 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then the problem is that we don't communicate enough. That's all. - Sun Sep 27 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I suppose so. - Sun Sep 27 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I meant to start sending you letters daily to keep you up to date privately. I forgot to do that. - Sun Sep 27 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit to you I like to lie. It's very useful. - Sun Sep 27 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..I see. - Sun Sep 27 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That means I can't tell anyone my plans in public. - Sun Sep 27 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I suppose privately talking isn't as bad as I thought. - Sun Sep 27 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: From this point, keep things between you and I. - Sun Sep 27 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Not saying I don't trust Kilm, but just for security purposes. - Sun Sep 27 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Of course. - Sun Sep 27 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I have a question for you, however. - Sun Sep 27 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 27 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You revoked your decision to have Kilm as your Chuunin? - Sun Sep 27 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm still not sure whether or not that was a good idea, but yes. - Sun Sep 27 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Elaborate. - Sun Sep 27 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off.

"I'll admit some bias was involved." she says.

"He was giving me ridiculous reports that were out of context and had so little detail it was like I was speaking to a five-year-old."

She makes eye contact again.

"A chuunin should be able to give me complete, detailed reports. Good reports are the difference between life and...genocide."* - Sun Sep 27 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted to tell me..... - Sun Sep 27 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That Misa came by and asked "if we were rebuilding Konoha as an illegal village." - Sun Sep 27 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: His words were instead.... - Sun Sep 27 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: "Are you guys rebuilding the illegal village Konoha?" - Sun Sep 27 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Right.. - Sun Sep 27 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Good move on revoking his spot.. - Sun Sep 27 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It took an awful lot of effort to not ram my very hard, very cold gauntlet into my own face. - Sun Sep 27 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But yes, he'll have a chance to get it back. Truth is I want him as happy as possible. - Sun Sep 27 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need quality shinobi. We won't get them if the ones we do die off before they mature completely. - Sun Sep 27 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I shouldn't have given him the position in the first place but. . .I'm new to this job. Some mistakes have to be made before I can learn from them. - Sun Sep 27 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm giving you as much room as you need, Katsune.. - Sun Sep 27 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: You're not in this alone, you're just being supervised. - Sun Sep 27 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 27 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Remember that. - Sun Sep 27 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I appreciate the supervision. - Sun Sep 27 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Wonderful. Is that all..? - Sun Sep 27 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Not to be rude. - Sun Sep 27 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. - Sun Sep 27 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright. Keep me updated. - Sun Sep 27 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hi again. - Sun Sep 27 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hi. - Sun Sep 27 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Did everything work out? - Sun Sep 27 14:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't even want to talk about it. - Sun Sep 27 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 27 14:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . Did anything happened when I went to rest? - Sun Sep 27 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.* - Sun Sep 27 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Sun Sep 27 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Something wrong definitely happened. - Sun Sep 27 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I have a really bad feeling. - Sun Sep 27 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: . . . Really bad feeling in my heart . . . - Sun Sep 27 14:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: She's got me real paranoid now. - Sun Sep 27 15:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This man..... - Sun Sep 27 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Keeps ruining everything. - Sun Sep 27 15:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm gonna go train though. - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Once I've finally mastered my jutsu. . . - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll make sure people respect me or die. - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Sep 27 15:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: The mansion is boring. - Sun Sep 27 15:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to her usual training area again. She walks here, lazily. Once at the base of the mountain, she places both hands together to form the tiger seal. With her eyes, she takes a moment to chart a path. The bars she'd left here for training prior to this are still there.

Though they weren't meant to be a part of today's training, she'll still want to avoid them. Abruptly, the girl shoves chakra into every part of her body. Nerves twitch. In response, Kat sprints forwards as quickly as she can. Feet find the wall nearly instantly.

The girl sprints upwards towards the tip of the mountain with that, having not stopped. She's using Suimen...though even if she wasn't, her speed would undoubtedly let her scale it. You can see even high school boys scale walls. It's been done by very normal people. For even the base speed of someone like Katsune, it's extremely easy.

Naturally, Katsune's forced to step from side to side to evade every obstacle along the way. She has a bit of tunnel vision right now so it's extremely difficult. Even so, she manages. The truth is, you 'can' step from side to side while using shunshin. It's a very common practice.

You see it when you watch a shinobi sprint from the ground to a rooftop with shunshin. They turn corners, left and right or up and down. It's very easily done. The only potential obstacle is the tunnel vision. As such, it should be no surprise that having trained this jutsu so much, Kat manages to do this very easily.

Eventually she comes skidding to a stop at the end of her march. She's two-hundred feet or so off of the ground by now. Naturally gravity pulls at her, so she's forced to briefly fall backwards. The girl tumbles a bit. Eventually though her feet catch the side of the mountain once more. 

It's difficult due to the shunshin-induced naseua, but she manages. With Suimen, she catches herself. The girl's in a crouching position for the moment, and her face is a bit damp from anxiety alone. This is a dangerous activity after all. Kat takes a moment to compose herself and wait for her head to stop swimming.* - Sun Sep 27 16:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I wish I could do missions right about now . . . - Sun Sep 27 16:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way down to Kilm's side, having trained for over nine hours by now. She carries a layer of sweat. Gently she's landing at his side in the grass with a soft thump, having jumped from a safe height from the mountain wall. She releases a sigh, since she's been training. The girl forms the tiger seal.

Abruptly she stops all chakra flow within her body. Immediately afterwords she forces it to ram throughout. The girl will need to train this damned jutsu throughout her daily life if she ever wants to master it. During meals, during conversations...everything. She can't just keep running every time she hears that a genjutsu user is in town.

This has to be mastered no matter what. Katsune's the hokage. That means she has to appear competent. If she flees and people see it, they'll stop supporting her. Maybe conspire. People are stupid like that.

"How are your arms?" she asks, stopping her chakra once more even as she stops. Once more she shoves it throughout. Another bead of sweat slides down the side of her face just from the effort alone. She probably smells, but she gives no fucks.* - Sun Sep 27 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They're getting better. - Sun Sep 27 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I still cannot use jutsu yet though . . . Atleast the pain is not that bad when I try to move them. - Sun Sep 27 16:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: How's your training going? - Sun Sep 27 16:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a pain. I'm getting used to it though. - Sun Sep 27 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's starting to become natural for me. - Sun Sep 27 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I still get a bit disoriented whenever I use it. - Sun Sep 27 16:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm hoping my natural, monstrous constitution will help me use this technique more effectively than most. - Sun Sep 27 16:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Doubt it'll be too useful but. . . - Sun Sep 27 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have special, unconventional plans for it. - Sun Sep 27 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Maybe I should start getting more genjutsu . . . I've noticed i'm real good at it. - Sun Sep 27 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs. The girl's response takes a long while. This is because she's absolutely forced to concentrate. The jutsu she wants to master is very, very difficult for her right now. Stopping her chakra flow is like trying to look left and right at the same time to begin with. 

It's not meant to be stopped. Eventually though, Kat succeeds. It stops. Roughly, the girl then immediately shoves it throughout her body once more. The teen feels dizzyness insue.

In an apparently lazy manner, she tilts her neck to the left, slowly. The joints crack. Afterwords she does the same in the opposite direction and rolls her neck around a bit. Nothing more than body language. She'd felt herself swaying, and cracks her neck to hide that fact. 

To distract. "There's nothing I hate more." she says. "Not being able to look people in the eyes. Not being able to watch their hands. Not being able to trust people to not fight dirty....having to be careful even on dates with strangers. If I could, I'd wipe genjutsu off of the face of the planet."* - Sun Sep 27 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If anything . . . It just spites the enemy . . . - Sun Sep 27 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway . . . I feel like i'm making bad progress. - Sun Sep 27 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're hoping for more work I take it? - Sun Sep 27 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I would ask for more work if I could use my arms right now. - Sun Sep 27 16:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Unless you've got something for me that I can do without my arms. - Sun Sep 27 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't. - Sun Sep 27 16:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright . . . Well i've tried my hardest anyway. - Sun Sep 27 16:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) once more takes a while to respond. All chakra in her body comes to a stop. Eyes are on the ground and they're out of focus. It takes four or five whole seconds before she's managed to stop it completely. One Kat's done, she shoves it throughout once again.

This time, the girl risks something a little different. She attempts to force her chakra to spiral as it travels, like a drill. It takes enormous amounts of focus to even attempt to do so, so her response to Kilm takes a very long while. A silent breath is taken.

Eventually though she says "So. Flexus told Hassan....that we were staging a "revolution"? That right?"* - Sun Sep 27 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I didn't hear anything about a revolution there . . . - Sun Sep 27 16:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sun Sep 27 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't even respond, for a while. Her eyes become a bit cold. She needs to master this jutsu faster than she thought. Said eyes wander as she considers Kilm's statement. "You must not have been there for the entire thing then." she says.

While she's talking, chakra is of course stopped again. She keeps her tenketsu in mind. Might there be a way to use them to improve her use of this jutsu? She has no idea. The girl's regretting, now, that she gave the scroll she'd used to learn this technique to Hanabi.

She could have checked it for more advice. Smoothly, and gently, Kat begins running chakra throughout her body again. Smoothly, because maybe shoving it to and fro isn't the best way to go about things. The teen will need to experiment. "It does sound like something he'd say. . ."* - Sun Sep 27 16:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wasn't . . . For when I had come, Zenaki was talking to Baen about getting in . . . - Sun Sep 27 16:48:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cause the males weren't allowed in. - Sun Sep 27 16:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Actually . . . Had Hassan not been there . . . Erebus would've taken an arm from Fujitora. - Sun Sep 27 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though Hassan was against it. - Sun Sep 27 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And because Erebus respected Hassan . . . He didn't take an arm. - Sun Sep 27 16:55:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus, or that man? - Sun Sep 27 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Erebus. - Sun Sep 27 16:56:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can infer....unless Fujitora and friends had some sort of leverage.... - Sun Sep 27 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus wasn't the "master" she talked about. - Sun Sep 27 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: She went to Fujitora's side and followed when she could've stayed with us since we're her friends. - Sun Sep 27 17:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Oh, no arms guy. - Sun Sep 27 17:06:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What are your names again? - Sun Sep 27 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Kilm. - Sun Sep 27 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, eyeing Ossa Baen blankly. The girl's hands remain in formation of the tiger seal, as they had been when he walked up. She's covered in sweat.

"Katsune." she says, knowing full well she's probably being insulted right now. She doesn't look bothered though.

Even so, even now, the girl is concentrating on stopping the flow of her chakra. She's a bit tense due to the needed concentration alone. Once she's finally managed to stop it, she roughly shoves it throughout yet again. The teen remains composed in the mean time. She'd rather not let people know about the resulting naseua she has from not having mastered this technique.

The sooner she masters this, the sooner she can stop avoiding a certain cloaked genjutsu asshole.* - Sun Sep 27 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Are you constipated? - Sun Sep 27 17:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Trying to make you angry? Why would I do that?~ - Sun Sep 27 17:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What's your job though? - Sun Sep 27 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes. The girl resumes this extremely annoying training. The flow of chakra throughout her body is stopped. Once she's done, she abruptly shoves it throughout again. The only way to properly train this jutsu is to use it throughout her daily life. It's way, way too time-consuming for it to be any other way.

As hokage, she doesn't have time to meditate for literally twelve hours a day for an entire month. It's impossible. Even with her phenominal chakra control, this jutsu tests her. She was once paralyzed though. She nearly died. 

If her opponent hadn't been literally retarded, she probably would've. Several more times even during this conversation she repeats the jutsu. Her responses are slow for that reason. "I don't need to tell you anything." she says.

"All I need to do is act. I'm not here to entertain you."* - Sun Sep 27 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Kilm. - Sun Sep 27 17:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches into her satchel. The girl pulls out a scroll. She passes it to him, absent-mindedly.

"Gate guard duty. Get to it."* - Sun Sep 27 17:25:20 2015

Roughly, once Kat's chakra has stopped flowing, she once more shoves it throughout her chakra network. This happens many more times while they're here.* - Sun Sep 27 18:43:50 2015

Taiga is close, so she says -- in an inside volume that probably won't be heard from across the yard -- "What's the situation, Taiga?"* - Sun Sep 27 21:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) briefly glances up at Niza, acknowledging his presence. With her sight, she's probably capable of making out his features even from here and knowing who he is.

Eyes lock onto Suitengo afterwords. She watches him closely -- especially his hands.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes. A nod follows, and Kat's eyes become just a bit moist. "Goodbye Raikage." she says, turning on her heel as she speaks.

Without another word she'd open the door to the mansion and go inside. Said door is closed behind her fairly gently.* - Sun Sep 27 22:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: You disrespected me first! - Sun Sep 27 22:35:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Annoying woman. - Sun Sep 27 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way down the halls of the hokage mansion's secret exit. She walks for what must be half an hour or more before finally finding the way out. A trap door leading up to what appears to be an abandoned shrine. Moments later, she's leaving through another door and stepping into a clearing. An island, covered in trees and only the one single building.

The girl had arranged for trapeze lines to be set up all over the place, and she's been training here for the past week or two. Not to suggest she's simply training "hard." She's here for something specific. To master the shunshin jutsu. Lazily, Kat plants her right foot at the base of a tree and begins walking up to the top of it by way of Suimen.

Once she's there, she finds a comfortable place at the top and takes a moment to search for the nearest trapeze. Moments later, she's planting a foot on top of it. Carefully she walks forwards, one foot in front of the other. Naturally the line shakes up and down. It only does so a bit, though. 

As a shinobi Kat's balance is good enough that she can at least barely manage just walking. With Suimen added into the mix, it's not so difficult at all. It's at this time though that Kat lifts her arms up and forms the tiger seal. She pauses for a long moment, and draws in a deep breath. Once she's confident, Kat shoves chakra throughout her body, to where it needs to be.

All of her muscles and nerves. They all twitch accordingly, compelling her to sprint forwards. When she does so, she moves instantaneously to most eyes. At the end of her path is another tree, and she's left standing on top of it. Only the smallest amounts of dizzyness and naseua remain today.

Acknowledging this, Kat then turns to face another line. Carefully she wanders over onto it, still holding the tiger seal in preparation for her next use of this jutsu.* - Mon Sep 28 12:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Mon Sep 28 13:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits with one leg crossed over the other. Both hands are joined together in formation of the tiger seal. One may assume she's putting on a show, but she's very serious. The girl intends to be using kai for pretty much the entire day. She doesn't have time to not do so.

And as hokage, she can't afford to not master it. She has to meet people alone, often, and she's expected to look them in the eyes. That means she can't afford to slack in this area. While she speaks, she concentrates on stopping the flow of her chakra. It takes time, and she's not talking during that time.

Eventually though, when she's managed to stop it, she roughly shoves chakra throughout her chakra network. "Has anyone seen Zenaki today?" the girl asks with eyes averted. Of course, she chose that specific combination of words for a reason. While she waits for a response, the girl focuses once more on stopping the flow of her chakra.

It's going to be a long day.* - Mon Sep 28 13:37:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ignores the glare. Her hands meet, and she forms the tiger seal. Once more she focuses on stopping the flow of her chakra. In the mean time her eyes are averted, and she's not talking. Eventually though she says "I believe you."

Her chakra is stopped entirely. Smoothly, she then sends it spiraling along throughout her body. Spiraling as best she can, anyway. It's an experiment, mostly to see if it helps. Once she's practiced this enough and perfected the spiraling, she'll have to test it against genjutsu.

"Intelligence wasn't Hanabi's strongsuit. I wasn't sure what to think about the Beth comment until I heard your explanation of Hanabi's death. The snake girl was always way too confident. Something tells me she thought she was stronger than me. She never was."* - Mon Sep 28 14:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I collect an awful lot of information. I consider every single bit of it very valuable. That makes it hard to keep you informed. - Mon Sep 28 15:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's funny how much people tell you when you're the hokage. - Mon Sep 28 15:10:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You've probably heard me tell people that I'm a con artist. Sort of my catch phrase. I don't actually lie though. - Mon Sep 28 15:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because then they'd know to be careful. - Mon Sep 28 15:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Only Flexus and Hanabi come to mind. And the person in Kirigakure. I've seen and done an awful lot of things. If the people you kill aren't either my friends or my tools, it doesn't concern me enough to take note of them. - Mon Sep 28 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: In a general basis, what do Flexus and Hanabi have in common? As far as why I killed them. - Mon Sep 28 15:39:05 2015
