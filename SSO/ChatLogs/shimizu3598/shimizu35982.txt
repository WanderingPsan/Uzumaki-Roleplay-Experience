<br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) whispers: Where?..My sensing is not as great.. - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kitora(Orchinallum Fox) whispers: East by the trees. - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: (need to wait for kuro to reply to Kat's test lightning ball) - Mon Sep 07 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still in her tree, having never left it. When Kuro approaches, Katsune wastes no time. The teen launches both kunai forwards, one after another. During the same motion she kneels down quite a bit and leaps, at her full speed, to the southwest -- with kunai having been thrown from the tree, aiming for the center of mass.
 
The girl had aimed herself specifically so that she's close to the ground the entire time, with legs tucked in and ready to move if needed.

Feet skid through the grass shortly afterwords and she begins forming handseals. Three are weaved at this time, but she hasn't stopped. She's facing Orakuru.* - Mon Sep 07 00:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's stream of five handseals total is complete, with three having been done prior to this time. Only two were needed, and she's sprinting backwards even as Kuro approaches...thus buying more time. She has no trouble whatsoever tracking his movement and reacting well in advance.

Her eyes are very sharp. She has no trouble seeing him at all -- the shadows, the very thin mist. Irrelevant. A small slash of fire wouldn't create much mist especially when pit against Zetsumo's water jutsus -- the power of this water is vastly superior.

With that done, Katsune shoves her right arm forwards, even as it explodes with very loud, crackling lightning that paints the area a bright, brilliant blue. The earth flash jutsu, capable of splitting boulders with ease and cutting through like butter. It spreads forth in the form of a small net, covering eight feet of width easily and darting forwards -- more than enough range.

The teen studies Kuro's every moment. With his speed, by the time her jutsu is released, he's surely within range. Should he change his trajectory at the last moment, she simply begins sprinting forwards, aiming to not let him escape no matter what for the crime he's committing right now -- daring to attack her even after she made efforts to save his life. 'Asking' for a war he literally did not have to fight.

A simple side-step won't suffice to dodge this jutsu. It's a stream -- not a brief attack like a lightning ball. If he wants to dodge he'll have to stay on the move constantly. Presumably, Kat's able to maintain a distance of twelve feet or so while her jutsu is within range.

Meanwhile, the water and wind mask's shadows loom over the teen. Presumably they're aware of the situation.* - Mon Sep 07 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is very briefly stunned. She releases a bit of a scoff, with a scowl on her face. Just moment's ago her eyes suggested nothing more than resolution. They now tremble as she takes a brief breath. Something about Kuro's action strikes her as unexpected. She realized that deep down well before she has time to connect the dots consciously.

The teen's eyes are a bit moist when she notes the forces surrounding her -- and oh my goodness are they very far away obviously. It's at this time that she suddenly squats down, having pauses for no more than a second. Palms touch the earth and in a blur, she lifts herself up into a handstand. The earth turns to liquid and sucks her underneath. She then begins swimming.

This is at roughly the same time that shinobi are pouring tags into the ground, but she's logically already there. She was ready to flee the moment she noticed they were surrounded in the first place. She begins swimming, at her full speed. From underground she can sense the incoming explosive projectiles. She simply digs dig enough to evade them all. She's more than fast enough, especially with all of this range.* - Mon Sep 07 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) seems to not have been hit at all during the entire battle. (@ Yumiko)* - Mon Sep 07 02:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Kitora, witnessing what it is that Kuro did. The girl still appears quite uncomfortable after watching Kuro die -- having clearly misunderstood that he was almost definitely trying to snatch her rather than harm her.

She turns to face the west. A subtle scowl is on her face and eyes are watery. Arms are of course crossed, as they have been for a while. Weight is shifting a bit.

Her conscious is pretty clear though. Kitora and Kronos both died because of Orakuru. Thus, Kuro deserved his death.* - Mon Sep 07 02:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and makes her way to the bird. She keeps her eyes averted and remains standing once on it, as if guarded. Naturally she's using suimen, so there's no need to sit anyway.* - Mon Sep 07 03:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't look at Orakuru's corpse. She knows it's there but she keeps her back turned.* - Mon Sep 07 04:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go rest and stuff.* - Mon Sep 07 04:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "You're wrong, again." she says.

"He was there for me."* - Mon Sep 07 05:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is of course intentionally holding back certain information.* - Mon Sep 07 05:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had simply said "Alright" in a breath, as if she's having trouble maintaining her composure.

When the teen turns to face him, though, with eyes averted she does seem pretty calm. Of course, that's just what she wants people to see.* - Mon Sep 07 05:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) follows, saying nothing.* - Mon Sep 07 05:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and kneels down. Both of the girl's palms find the earth, and she begins kneading her chakra through it. The earth of course begins stirring; or at least earth that you can't see does. It's molded like clay, very easily. She has experience with other earth jutsus that require you to only touch the ground, after all, so that much is to be expected.

"I'm surprised you think I can even learn this." she says. "Honestly I'd just never have expected something so useful to be easy." As she speaks, dirt is kicked up some twenty feet or so away from her. It's just a small amount, as if a dog had kicked it up into the air. The teen shakes her head, and the dirt stops moving.

She directs her efforts elsewhere, further to the north and closer to the tree she's aiming for. Eyes lock into it. Shortly afterwords, the same affect as before is achieved over there. Her face turns a bit moist. A nearly silent breath is taken through the nose.

Naturally attempting a technique she has no practice with is very hard on her chakra -- especially considering how poor her chakra control is. More breaths follow, and she takes a moment to crack her neck; first to the right and then to the left. A stone is then flung forwards from the earth, while the dirt underneath is continues turning and churning. It hits the tree with a loud "clunk," but not loud enough to suggest any useful amount of damage.

Katsune pulls her palms away and then turns to actually face the tree. She sits with legs sprawled out underneath her form and takes a deep breath, calming herself before she can get frustrated -- which never helps. Once more she works the earth, this time spending large amounts of time on preparing a projectile well in advance 'before' even trying to fire anything off.

Finally, it happens. A rather thin, long, and sharp spike comes forth from the ground. It's roughly as thin as Katsune's body is. Roughly and suddenly, it rams into the mentioned tree. The tree creaks and shakes to and fro. It's also now found itself with a hole in the center. Creaking continues as it begins splitting in half -- though it comes to a stop before the tree loses anymore dignity. The plant stays whole.

Katsune smirks a bit, with a glance over at Zetsumo.* - Mon Sep 07 06:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs and continues her efforts. Now would come the hard part. Multiple spikes all at once. An hour or more passes as she labors, over all. More sweat is produced.

More spikes are produced. She does so fairly easily it seems now that she's figured this much out. The teen focuses on forming spikes in rapid succession, from different angles and areas. It takes time, but eventually she shows a lot of success with this. Two or three are darting out, one after another.

At that point, she concentrates. Chakra is sent to four different areas. One after another, spikes are formed. Finally she launches them forwards with devestating levels of strength, and pins a tree in place. More time passes, and Katsune practices forming all four spikes at once.

Naturally, having this capability would increase her chances of hitting an enemy. After considerable effort, she succeeds. By now she's ruined three or four trees, so she focuses on the fifth. All four spikes are formed at once, and all four impale it at the same time. It slowly falls to the side, creaking and screaming all the way down.

Katsune then rises to her feet with a shrug. Palms find her hips, and she turns to face the boss. Her weight shifts a bit.* - Mon Sep 07 07:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Mon Sep 07 09:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't even bat an eyelash, though, in response to Zenaki's vibes.* - Mon Sep 07 13:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. Not really in a disrespectful manner but rather...just in a way that suggests she's considering the idea.* - Mon Sep 07 13:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Guess I don't care anyway." she says. "She 'was' helping those people."

"And I haven't seen Yumiko today. She's alive though."* - Mon Sep 07 13:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the north and sets her back to the wall. She keeps her eyes averted and arms crossed. Her right leg crosses over the left.* - Mon Sep 07 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Oh my God. - Mon Sep 07 14:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, looking away in a condescending manner with eyebrows lifted a bit. She turns to follow as she does so.* - Mon Sep 07 14:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had also whispered a second ago.* - Mon Sep 07 14:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Right,This is getting way too bad. Let's just leave. - Mon Sep 07 14:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks up and lifts an eyebrow at him.* - Mon Sep 07 21:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) just watches.* - Mon Sep 07 22:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. She's calm, though.

"He's dead." she eventually says.* - Mon Sep 07 22:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Mon Sep 07 22:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Mon Sep 07 22:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had been sitting. At this time she just....lies down. Arms and legs spread, and everything about her composure assures you that she gives no fucks whatsoever.

With boredom obvious in her eyes she stares up at the sky. Her head's facing the east, and feet face the west.* - Tue Sep 08 00:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Tue Sep 08 00:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stays where she is, still shamelessly lying in the dirt. Too lazy to train.* - Tue Sep 08 01:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Haven't done anything at all." she says.* - Tue Sep 08 01:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) may or may not be implying she was out at midnight.* - Tue Sep 08 01:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Tue Sep 08 01:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, rising to her feet. Dirt in her hair and such slides off like water on a window as she rises, by way of the hidden mole jutsu -- or at least, something similar. She takes a moment to manually brush herself off as well, and turns to face Zetsumo.

Arms cross afterwords and her weight shifts a bit as she waits for instructions.* - Tue Sep 08 01:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) follows, at what's for her a casual jog. Palms find the back of her head as she makes her way to the prisoners, with a swagger. At the sight of the prisoners she remains calm, just staring blankly at them.

And then Zetsumo orders her to kill them. The girl frowns, her eyes immediately showing the same subtle signs of disapproval. An eyebrow rises, and she looks up at the man.

"What...while they're tied up?" she inquires.

The same hesitation she used to show when he first tried "training her mental fortitude," by making her torture people.* - Tue Sep 08 02:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross.* - Tue Sep 08 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 'is' a teenager. So of course, as one might guess, she probably doesn't know herself as well as her vocabulary might suggest.* - Tue Sep 08 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the two, even as they presumably either glare at her in disgust or tremble in fear -- most likely the former.

She eyes the woman first. Slowly she looks her up and down...maybe a bit too closely, studying her curves.

"...Her." she says, not even taking long to come to the decision.* - Tue Sep 08 02:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this with a shrug. She's pretty calm by now.* - Tue Sep 08 02:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly slides her right foot backwards over the cement. Her arms rise and hands clench partially, as if to form claws -- her usual stance. A very practical one considering her particular talents and preferences. Slowly, the girl takes a moment to crack her neck, first tilting it to the right and then to the left.

She clears her mind, not even needing to make the effort to do so. She may not have explained herself but the point is of course...distraction. That means it's her brain she's challenging; not her body. Rushing in stupidly won't do anything to challenge that.

Kat takes a moment to once more look the jounin up and down, looking for weapons or hints at what she may be capable of. Briefly she then glances to and fro, studying her surroundings more carefully. She makes no actual moves just yet.* - Tue Sep 08 02:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right arm darts into her kunai holster. The weapon is briefly flourished, and Katsune's left arm remains as it had been -- ready to deliver an exploding palm if needed. In this situation, being in a prison cell...Kat's actually at a tremendous disadvantage. Cement at her feet when her current speciality more than anything else really is...doton.

Raiton can't even be considered when the enemy's using wind jutsus.

The girl darts off to the side even as she's doing these things, though. Presumably it'd be little to no challenge to evade any and all of these blasts of wind, with her reflexes.

She then darts forwards. Exceptional eyes study the opponents hands very carefully, to see how quickly she's forming seals. If the speed is deemed too great, of if she notes a sudden stop in weaving, she knows to take evasive maneuvers.

If not, however, the girl is soon swinging a kunai at her and aiming to take a finger. That should slow down the handseal weaving.
* - Tue Sep 08 03:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) presumably Kat 'is' fast enough to evade her gale palm, and naturally with her reflexes and eyes...she's definitely nowhere near point blank range. She'd stopped well before then, having been studying the jounin's hands for a reason. From ten feet away or so, she smoothly steps to the side, evading the blast. Her kunai is tossed forwards, having never been caught most likely.

It's aimed for the throat.

In the same motion, Kat throws both arms forwards. The heels of her palms meet, and she sprints. Even as she does so, lightning-natured chakra is abruptly darting out of her palms. It crackles wildly and immeditely flies forwards, aiming for the head.

Kat's feet come skidding to a stop even as her blast is finally propelled, having taken the briefest amounts of time. She'd at this point be only just out of arm's reach, making it difficult to evade the blast. Even so, one can't evade it from this range without...stepping away.

Which, consequently, would simply give Kat plenty of breathing room for further evasive maneuvers.* - Tue Sep 08 03:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) continues testing her opponent like a cat with a mouse. She picks and prods, teases and annoys, waiting for the woman to get frustrated -- something that rarely if ever happens to Kat in the middle of a battle, unless dealing with an opponent that has superior speed. Zetsumo's jutsus are way too fast for her, and sparring sessions aren't serious business anyway, so she loses her cool with him, but for most people....she's calm.

It's easy to be calm when the entire world appears to move slowly around you.

When it eventually happens -- or when she's otherwise given an opporitunity, Kat takes advantage. She lures the opponent into coming in close and when that happens, the air around her explodes violently with a crackling scream. Lightning nature chakra is released in a raiton flash to stun her.

And with that done, Kat removes a hand. The other follows some time afterwords, with the jounin no longer being capable of jutsus. From there, Kat teases further, knowing she has no need to. She kicks and cuts, not even going for lethal blows. Eyes wander and study her, but she especially pays careful attention to the enemy's facial expression, taking in all evidence of her emotions.

All things that do nothing but strengthen the budding sociopath's ego and make her feel good about what she does. This person deserves to die in her eyes.

Why? 

Survival of the fittest. That and she was asking for it all along, by willingly fighting for Sunagakure and not begging to join up with Zetsumo. At times she's even made attempts to humilate her, toying with the fact that she's so curvy -- though she shows no indignant interest. Only sociopathic desire to make her regret having them.

Presumably, she's killing off the male chuunin some time afterwords. Katsune would stand over both corpses with blood and sweat covering her own form. Her kunai is sheathed and she stands straight. Arms cross and weight shifts a bit. Eyes wander off.

* - Tue Sep 08 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles in a slightly sheepish, slightly smug manner as she turns to face the south. Her right hand reaches up to scratch her cheek, and she shrugs.* - Tue Sep 08 04:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She turns to follow. "Yeah. That works."* - Tue Sep 08 04:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and begins looking through the menu. It's after some lengthy amount of time but eventually she chooses a bowl of ramen. Ramen with actual shrimp in it, as well as a lot of vegetables and such. Her right leg then crosses over the left and she closes her menu.

When a waitress or waiter presumably comes by she orders this.* - Tue Sep 08 05:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Figured she'd be more valuable with a mind of her own...and it seems like Zenaki may not let her keep that. But what do I know?"

Her eyes are averted as she speaks.

"And yeah she's been well-behaved as far as I know. Didn't see anyone beating her or anything."* - Tue Sep 08 05:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) picks up her chop sticks and goes to her ramen first, with only a glance at her alchohol. The girl takes a moment to turn her utensils to and fro, scooping and raveling the noodles up. Afterwords she lazily stuffs her face. Eyes wander.

With a shrug she says "Define 'underground.'"* - Tue Sep 08 05:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks away, saying nothing. She stuffs her face.* - Tue Sep 08 05:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, saying nothing.* - Tue Sep 08 05:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. Her eyebrows furrow slightly. She says nothing. An eyebrow twitches.* - Tue Sep 08 05:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes further. Her cup of sake is brought to her mouth and smoothly, she pours most of it down her throat.* - Tue Sep 08 06:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) squirms only briefly as she's lifted up. She looks down at her form, briefly making sure those threads aren't touching anywhere she'd be uncomfortable with. Afterwords she makes eye contact. Her expression relaxes a bit, though her blush remains and she still looks a bit sour.

A silent, deep breath is taken through the nose. She then shakes her head. Eye contact is maintained.

She's confident that he won't do anything to her, after all.* - Tue Sep 08 06:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches at the sight of the thread coming forward, but not that hard. She has very good reflexes after all. She's still convinced her won't harm her in any way, though.

And then....she's proven wrong. Very wrong. Presumably the entirety of her chest is revealed, her overly large assets bouncing about for the first time in front of someone else.

Immediately Kat's cheeks turn a bright red. She squirms violently, probably only making the situation worse, as she attempts to pull herself away. A gasp is released as her mouth falls open, though she has little she can say on the matter at first. She's completely speechless.

"Z-zetsumo!" she shouts past breaths.
"G-god damn it!" Her squirming is directed to covering herself up. Her legs pull as close as she can manage, as well as her arms. Eyes are averted.* - Tue Sep 08 06:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) groans quite uncomfortable at the sight of more threads. The rare awkward, embarassed glance is sent to the gawkers. She's aware her squirming is only making things worse, but she can't stop. It's a reflex.

"Z-Zetsumo stop!" she cries out.

"T-this...is stupid! A-and petty!"

She groans more. Her limbs tremble. She's mortified.

"You -ass-!!"* - Tue Sep 08 06:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes close. "N-no!!" she shouts out.

"I don't want to tell you a-anything right now!"

The bulk of her efforts go to closing her legs. "Let me go!" she says with a shakey breath. "This isn't fun! Other Kenryoku are gonna walk in! Your sister will! You ass!"* - Tue Sep 08 06:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops squirming, due to how sore her limbs now are from the continued efforts. Her breathing's a bit labored for the same reason. Eyes are open and stay on the ground, trembling. Her limbs tremble as well, from her anxiety.

"I-I...was gonna say..." she says past breaths.

"That I don't like people. N-Now let me go!" she says, still scowling. Presumably she is wearing underwear still, unless he'd ripped them from the front -- in which case they're falling down. They're normal panties; she has a skirt to hide any outlines. They're also dark purple in color.

Eyes find the tendrils below, briefly.* - Tue Sep 08 06:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, having calmed down a little bit due to her exhaustion alone from attempting to get free. "T-that...was -all-!" she says, no longer shouting though she still sounds nervous.

Eyes find the threads below. She does her best to tilt her body to and fro, as if to pull away from them. Breasts and bum jiggle fairly wildly as a result, due to the sizes.* - Tue Sep 08 07:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, gulping. More glances are sent to onwatchers. She takes in a shakey breath. The girl does her best to pull her butt away from his lap, though ultimately this likely accomplishes little more than to rub herself against him unintentionally.

"T-this..." she says, immediately stopping her attempts to pull away once she realizes what she's doing.

"I-isn't Konoha." An eyebrow twitches.
"There are rules!!" she says.

"You'll be in trouble!"* - Tue Sep 08 07:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) briefly glances to the side, in his direction. "-Yes- I decline!" she says, awkwardly wiggling, rarely.* - Tue Sep 08 07:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, eyebrows twitching often. "W-we're in public..." she says.
"Cover me up! And -stop-!"* - Tue Sep 08 07:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing, for a while. "Cover me up...please..." she eventually says, very quietly.* - Tue Sep 08 07:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is presumably facing the south, missing his look.* - Tue Sep 08 07:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) awkwardly glances around the room, eying absolutely everyone present. Eventually she gathers that being quiet is in her favor.

An eyebrow twitches.

"Anything!" she says, still quietly. "Threads, stupid."* - Tue Sep 08 07:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyebrow twitches. She stares down at the spoon. A glance is sent Zetsumo's way.

"Not going down there, pervert." she nearly whispers.* - Tue Sep 08 07:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over her shoulder at him. Presumably she's being held so that she faces the floor? She says nothing, not wanting to irritate him.* - Tue Sep 08 07:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares ahead. She's not quite scowling. Eyebrows are shifted in a way that suggests she's disturbed. Eyes wander off afterwords. She allows him to pull her forwards though, no longer resisting physically. What could she do to escape him anyway?

"You need a bath..." she says, whether it's true or not.* - Tue Sep 08 07:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's nose twitches. "It smells." she says, scowling.* - Tue Sep 08 07:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. Her legs are sprawled out underneath her form with her butt firmly planted to the floor. Palms rest on the ground inbetween her legs. Said legs close at this time and rub back and forth against each other, as if due to anxiety.

A brief glance is sent Zetsumo's way. She says and does nothing.* - Tue Sep 08 07:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks away. A length amount of time is spent considering her position. Kilm would be awake soon, and this is the restaraunt they usually eat at. A shakey breath is taken, and another glance is sent Zetsumo's way.

"You must have a -hundred- slaves that could do this instead!" she says.

Her blush remains. Each time she's smacked accross the face she turns her head to and fro, allowing the motions with no resistance.* - Tue Sep 08 08:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) winces, her eyes closing briefly, as meat is shoved into her mouth. She gags a bit, her throat grabbing at the organ. Eyes open shortly afterwords. Her deep, stressed breathing can be felt from her throat.

A groan is released. Eyes remain averted, and a bit watery.

The girl wastes no more time. She begins suckling. The occasional glance is sent Zetsumo's way still, and her scowl remains. The least she can do is try and make this end before anyone she knows walks in.* - Tue Sep 08 08:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls her mouth away from the organ, slobber remaining on it. She gulps, and takes a breath. Her scowl suggests she's briefly consdiering insulting him, and she glances up at him once more.

Rather than doing so, she simply sticks her tongue out and begins licking. Lips meet Zetsumo's manhood and she suckles along, occasionally looking over the table to assure herself no one's coming. It matters little though. Everyone in the building knows what's going on.

She fits more of it in shortly afterwords, not having the will to annoy him any longer.* - Tue Sep 08 08:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes close. She groans more. Lips tremble and she stops sucking, though he's presumably pulling her to and fro anyway. She gulps, and takes a breath.* - Tue Sep 08 08:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls away and turns her head as best she can. The girl then coughs a bit, choking. Seed is left on the floor. This is well before he's finished, too.* - Tue Sep 08 08:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) proceeds to spit some out intentionally as well. She averts her eyes, not even trying to avoid conflict anymore.* - Tue Sep 08 08:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is covered in the substance, of course.

"...Can I leave now...?" she asks, quietly.* - Tue Sep 08 08:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's blush returns in response to the ridicule. She takes a breath.* - Tue Sep 08 08:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right hand moves to cover herself up at the crotch, and her left arm covers her breasts as best she can manage. They're quite big though, so it's not much. She's in the bath tub shortly afterwords and gets on her knees. Her scowl remains.

The girl takes a moment to turn the water on, eager to get cleaned up. She makes no eye contact with the boss, and says nothing.* - Tue Sep 08 08:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes further. The teen turns the shower head on, wincing at the cold water. It takes a moment for it to get warm. She rises to her feet then and returns her hand and arm to where they were. Some time is allowed for the water to wash her off by itself, for now.* - Tue Sep 08 08:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing.* - Tue Sep 08 08:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to face the opposite direction, not much caring that her butt is shown. A hand reaches for shampoo as her hair becomes soaked. Shortly afterwords she's putting it in her hair. She continues to say nothing.* - Tue Sep 08 08:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) closes her legs together and takes a step forwards. Her hands stop massaging shampoo into her air. She flinches a bit at the squeezing her her rear, and her blush returns.

Eyes tremble, and she turns her head to look away afterwords.

"You already punished me..." she says, scowling a bit.
"Let me take my bath."

She resumes washing her hair.* - Tue Sep 08 08:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) grows noticably tense in response to the tighter squeezing of her rear. The girl's legs rub against each other and awkwardly she steps to and fro. With eyes wandering back to the scene, she attempts to pull away.

"I-I'll listen..." she says.

"When you're not naked."* - Tue Sep 08 09:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head, walking further away from the man with shampoo covering her hair all over still. She'd have rinsed it out by now, but Zetsumo's still in the way.

"...I need to wash my hair." she says, with head turned and eyes averted. She hides her face.* - Tue Sep 08 09:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a shakey breath, her hands in her hair no longer moving. She stirs a bit as she's rubbed, stepping away once more to try and get him to stop. She's tense for the moment, with toes having curled.

A glance is sent his way, with scowl remaining. Afterwords, her hands move her head, and arms find her sides. The girl turns to face him and carefully lowers herself onto her knees. Her butt finds the bottom of the tub, and palms rest inbetween her legs.

"...Please, go away." she says.* - Tue Sep 08 09:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself up to her feet. Arms rest at her sides, and she sends Zetsumo a glance. With that she then turns on her heel to walk around him, planting herself under the water. She'd then hold her head under it, rinsing shampoo away if allowed to do so.

"Then please, go get fucked by Kirigakure." she says.* - Tue Sep 08 09:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over her shoulder as she's penetrated. She frowns, her lips trembling. When picked up, Kat doesn't bother resisting.

She keeps her hands in her hair and keeps rinsing said hair off, as if nothing is happening. Eyes stare ahead, and her scowl remains. Her legs lie open, because she doesn't plan to try and stop him.* - Tue Sep 08 10:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had indeed been a virgin. When she's penetrated her hymen breaks, and blood coats her boss's manhood. Thankfully, water washes this away, alongside shampoo, pretty much immediately since they're in the shower. Zetsumo would have felt it breaking, though.

Groans and wimpers follow as the girl tries desperately to maintain her composure. At some point there are signs of pleasure, including doe eyes. She continues to appear humiliated for the entire endeavor.

She is indeed left in a whimpering mess.
* - Tue Sep 08 10:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head to look away. The girl sits awkwardly within the tub, planting her butt to it and simply remaining there.

She intends to wait for him to leave before she cleans up.

Awkwardly, Katsune occasionally stirs and turns, to better position herself. Legs cross and uncross, as if she's desperately trying to find a comfortable position.* - Tue Sep 08 10:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually lies on her side, though, facing the east -- away from Zetsumo. She curls up into a little ball, still blushing.* - Tue Sep 08 10:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) appears more physically uncomfortable than traumatized for the record, when it comes to her awkward movements.* - Tue Sep 08 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off. She nods afterwords.

As if she would dream of ever letting anyone find out this even 'might' have happened.* - Tue Sep 08 10:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over her shoulder in his direction, with an eyebrow twitching. She sits up, a bit quickly, and stares daggers down at the bottom of the tub. She says nothing, though, giving him no real reason to pay much mind to her behavior.* - Tue Sep 08 10:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes. Said eyes wander, and she says nothing.* - Tue Sep 08 10:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had actually spent at least a few hours at the house, though.* - Tue Sep 08 10:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at him in a shady manner. Eyes wander afterwords.* - Tue Sep 08 11:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shifts around a bit. Legs stretch out in front of her and she crosses one over the other. Palms rest at either side of her.* - Tue Sep 08 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) said that after like, minutes.* - Tue Sep 08 11:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Tue Sep 08 11:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to rub at her right eye with her fist. Her other eye wanders off for the moment. "U-uhm...what?" she inquires, glancing over at him.

"Oh." Her cheeks turn a bit pink. Eyes find the sky.

"....Na." she says.

"I mean....we should get a house. Or something."* - Tue Sep 08 11:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. "Yeah. That'd be good." she says.* - Tue Sep 08 11:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, rising to her feet shortly afterwords. 

"Right."

She turns to follow Beth with eyes averted and begins making her way to the woman.

"Who's leading this?" she inquires.

It's always best to get that out of the way sooner rather than later, after all.* - Tue Sep 08 12:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the woman with a shrug.

Ever since the torture incident she's been wary of the idea of Beth leading her to anything, but she complies anyway and sprints off after her.* - Tue Sep 08 12:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) often darts on ahead of Beth by fourty feet or so, with eyes scanning the area very carefully. Whenever the group goes through woods, she scans the ground and trees, with eyes darting to and fro. She's not being overly careful in all honesty but she also...doesn't need to be. Her eyes are just that good. They're presumably looking for absolutely anything notable. 

Anything suspicious or otherwise just something they can use. Any enemy camps, or empty camps....anything at all. "If we 'do' get into a fight...." Katsune eventually begins. "Kilm's body is as hard as a rock. He should probably lead the assault." 

"Then I could back him up, and Beth could support us 'both' with genjutsu?"* - Tue Sep 08 12:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The group presumably at some point turns and heads north. They're to scan the entire forest after all. The whole thing. Kat sprints up the length of a tree, making use of Suimen. Soon her feet find one of its thick branches and she continues darting along, from tree to tree.

From there she can see even more area at once, and probably get through the forest more quickly too. Not to mention, she's more easily capable of checking the tree tops themselves for traps. "I mean, no one's getting behind his back with me helping him, as fast as I am...and he'd be a really good meat shield." Kat says oh-so-casually.

"Plus, with his jutsus, he'd be the center of attention. Why come after the annoyingly fast girl who can avoid you forever when you can go after the slow guy who's doing the most damage anyway?" she says. The girl then comes to a slow stop. An eyebrow rises, and she takes a moment to carefully examine something suspicious she's noticed. Upon closer inspection she notes something.

A confirmed trap. With a shrug she kneels down, pulling out a scroll. As Beth suggested she begins carefully noting the location. Like Kilm she's not an artist. For this reason she simply chooses to write a description of the trap, in words.

With that done, Katsune rises to her feet and sprints back off after her companions. It's surprisingly easy to keep up with them. They're both far slower than she is. That, and with her eyes, it's quite, quite easy to track them. She simply follows any trals of broken limbs, and any other signs of disturbed terrain.* - Tue Sep 08 12:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her best effort to stay relatively close to her companions. After all, they're together for a reason. If enemies are encountered, they're to fight together. "Come to think of it..." she says. "If we were captured right now, the enemy could get information out of us."

"They'd want that, too, after the battle in Konoha." A yawn is released as she comes to a stop. Another trap is spotted, in the grass far below. Briefly, she releases a groan. The girl's ink pin is retrieved once more, alongside her scroll.

Once more, she writes down the location of it as well as its apparent function. As detailed a description as she can manage. It's tempting to simply disarm them, but they could be rigged to alert Kirigakure, so she avoids it. Either way, the location alone is enough. Why? Because it allows them to chart a safe path through the forest, free of traps in the first place.

Easy.* - Tue Sep 08 13:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Honestly I hope someone attacks us." she says. "We could get information out of them and I 'really' want to beat up on someone I'm allowed to make bleed." Eventually the group is at the outskirts of the forest, no doubt. They 'had' been instructed to scout the outskirts as well. Kat continues running along tree branches.

Her eyes are good enough that she can see for an enormous distance anyway -- not that she can see traps from so far away. Ultimately relatively few traps are likely found. She has little concern about looking for actual troops or camps, since the birds can cover that. Even so, eventually Kat and co presumably do spread further out. They'd been advised for good reason to not get too close to Kirigakure so they wouldn't be scouting the waters.

The outskirts of Kirigakure's outer villages are examined from very far away. The girl crouches down, hiding in the forest, to take notes: how many shinobi appeared to be on the walls; what the walls seemed to be made of; how many entrances the village actually has. Things of that nature.

Eventually, the task is done. Kat shrugs and turns to follow her companions home. Presumably they stop to camp somewhere. Scouting the entire forest takes time. The girl is actually fairly quiet during said camping, and sleeps about as soon as they set said camp up.

On the way back she keeps an eye out for troops and traps for entirely different reasons. The scouting is done. Now it's only about getting home in one place. Carefully she studies tree branches as well as the rest of the grass as she goes. No reason not to make sure no one followed them.

* - Tue Sep 08 13:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up. The girl pulls a scroll out of her pack as she does so and takes a moment to wave it around, to get Zetsumo's attention. Her left hand rests on her hip for the moment, and her weight shifts a bit. "Mission's done." she says.

With that, she'd then toss the scroll over to him. Inside are notes related to the mission.* - Tue Sep 08 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods with a glance over at Kilm and turns to wander off. She assumes he'll follow.* - Tue Sep 08 13:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) blushes a bit, planting her butt on the bed. Eyes wander. Her expression's mostly pretty blank. It suggests boredom if anything.* - Tue Sep 08 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she turns to wander off. "This way..." she says.* - Wed Sep 09 00:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles somewhat with a shrug, turning to face Paine. "Heh. Why can't any of my actual fights be in places like this." she says. Her right foot is sliding backwards as she speaks, and her arms rise. Fingers clench partially as if to form claws. Her usual stance.* - Wed Sep 09 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, taking a moment to look her opponent up and down. "Yep." she says. "You ready?"* - Wed Sep 09 00:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then reaches into a pocket and pulls out a kunai. Without pause she begins sprinting forwards. The kunai is thrown mid-stride, level with her left shoulder. Katasune runs alongside it, and as it so happens, she moves faster than the kunai.

Within just a moment, Katsune would be just outside the reach of Paine's legs. She comes to the briefest of stops there, studying the girl's movements and ready to immediately step away to evade her if she even flinches.

And shortly afterwords....should Paine not move, Kat's kunai would meet her neck.* - Wed Sep 09 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't have tunnel vision.* - Wed Sep 09 01:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had put herself just outside of the reach of Paine's leg for a reason. It's the longest part of her body. Lips twitch at the sight of Paine's arm flying forwards. Smoothly, Kat steps off to the side to evade it. She doesn't have to due to the distance, but she does so anyway.

It's also worth noting that Kat's arms are actually at her sides.

With her eyes and reflex combined, Paine's incredibly fast punch moves in relatively slow motion to her. It's a tiny bit more than managable, even. The girl sprints into close range during this brief moment, with a hand reaching for a kunai in the process. She puts herself just within arm's reach, while still moving in an arch around her opponent.

Abruptly, Kat's body would release an aura of lightning. It comes with a loud, crackling bang. Paine's entire body would be coated in it. She'd be stunned. During this brief moment of opporitunity, Kat would swipe at her left upper arm with the kunai she'd retrieved before now.

Due to being stunned, it's possible Paine might be slower to react -- though by how much remains to be seen.

And finally, during the same motion, Kat would then pull herself away, aiming to give her opponent as few opporitunities to strike back as possible.* - Wed Sep 09 01:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's jutsu apparently hadn't stunned Paine enough to allow for an attack. It makes sense; Kat's arm can't move too quickly. It's immediately apparent, though, that Paine's not overly affected. The girl begins bending her legs at the knees and leaning backwards, for the brief amount of time that she 'is' stunned. As Paine begins winding up her kick, Kat's launching herself into a very fast backwards somersault.

It's a ground-based somersault, leaving her in the air for no remotely noteworthy amount of time at all. Presumably, Paine has to pause for at least a small moment to stop performing her combo. This'd give Kat some breathing room.

Kat's cartwheeling comes to a stop fourty feet away, on the sand. Water occasionally laps at her feet due to how close she is to it. Hands meet, and she begins forming handseals. She's managed to form three in little time at all.* - Wed Sep 09 02:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hands stop moving. Wasting chakra would be a bad idea with Paine not coming towards her directly, and her jutsus being so slow. Hands part, and arms find her sides. The girl's weight shifts a bit, and she carefully studies her opponent, maintaining eye contact as Paine moves.

The girl then kneels down on a knee. Palms meet the earth, and chakra travels. Technically, compared to Paine, her chakra moves unbelievably slow. The beauty of this, however, is that Paine doesn't know she's being attacked. This chakra is moving at one-hundred-thirty miles per hour. Unless she has eyes on it, she's not going to know to move yet no matter what.

It'd then be in the ground beneath the tree Paine's in. It spreads out. Spikes are formed beneath the earth. Four of them, and they're all quite massive. They all come from opposing directions, to meet at the epicenter. It's aimed at her lower legs, because Kat doesn't want to do serious harm.

Logically, unless Paine has advanced sensory abilities, she won't know to begin moving until she spikes are already moving. After all, she was chilling in a tree rather than actually moving. In other words, this technique was essentially fired at nearly point-blank range!* - Wed Sep 09 02:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leans forwards and begins sprinting. The girl's feet come skidding to a stop once she's behind the nearest tree. She then begins making her way around it, walking. Eyes lock onto Paine, calmly, and she simply stands there, studying her.

She'd attack from a distance if only her jutsus were fast enough but...as a person who focuses entirely on evasion, Katsune's very much aware she'd miss her mark.* - Wed Sep 09 03:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, looking her up and down. "Yeah." she says, smiling a bit. "Thanks for the spar."* - Wed Sep 09 03:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "That's why sparring's a good thing." she says.
"You learn how to move and when to do it too. It's not about getting faster, or stronger, or better reflexes. It's about knowing how to use what you already do have."* - Wed Sep 09 03:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to wander back to the village.* - Wed Sep 09 04:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head, and her eyes wander. She shrugs shortly afterwords. 

"I-I mean.....yeah." she says. A hand reaches up to scratch at her own ear.* - Wed Sep 09 04:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing, for too many reasons. She shifts a bit on the ground, uncomfortably. Eyes wander.* - Wed Sep 09 04:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to lead the way.* - Wed Sep 09 09:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides her right foot backwards through the grass with eyes on Kilm. Arms rise and her hands clench partially, as if to bare claws. "I'm ready whenever." she says.* - Wed Sep 09 09:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tenses up a bit. Eyes dart to and fro. A small, silent huff is released through the nose, and she smiles a bit. This was new -- at least for Kilm. She'd seen it before.

Without more pause than this the girl turns on her heel and begins sprinting. Feet meet the side of one of the walls, and she begins forming handseals -- just in case.

She runs just the smallest bit faster than Kilm's jutsus travel, but she'd been surprised for a moment so she may not make it in time. By the time she has reached the top, five handseals are done. If she'd been forced to run on the cieling, she does so. Either way, the plan was to blast through if she happens to not make it.

And as she climbs, something occurs to her. The wall's likely weakest at the newest parts of it, which she's presumably standing on by now due to having been trying to escape. Should Kat not escape in time, her right arm lights up, with a loud and crackling, reverberating bang. Lightning races forwards, and it screams for the entire duration. She'd aim it at his jutsu's walls, attempting to break through.

Kilm's jutsus are stronger but this jutsu is first of all extremely powerful for what it is -- due to the short range -- and capable of breaking through boulders like a knife on butter. Secondly, she has an elemental advantage. Should this succeed, the girl would then dart through the opening. The lightning would still be streaming down from her arm, though she releases the jutsu afterwords as she darts off to the nearby beach.

Feet would come skidding to a stop as eyes lock onto Kilm again.* - Wed Sep 09 10:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply stares at Kilm. She smirks, and slowly walks backwards. She takes only three steps. His jutsu falls short, unable to reach her. It has maybe twenty-one feet(2 tiles) of range at most. This jutsu shines in the tremendous, absurd amount of damage it does -- enough to kill someone that could easily resist a lightning ball fired by the same person.

The short range, however, is the downside. To fire it from so far away is simply a bad idea.

Kat could fight back or move, but instead she remains where she is -- just to tease him.* - Wed Sep 09 10:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the gas; the distortion in the air. The blurring of it. Eyes wander, and only ver briefly. Her eyes 'are' very sharp, so it's definitely not invisible. The girl begins walking backwards, and then sprinting in said direction. She doesn't go far. Kilm's still far away for some reason.

The girl remains on the beach, knowing better than to dare standing on that water.

Her feet come skidding to a stop shortly afterwords, and arms dart forwards. The heels of her palms meet. Lightning crackles loudly as it seeps out of her palms and forms a ball. With that, the jutsu flies forwards. It'd hit the gas and hopefully send the explosion Kilm's way.

Either way, she surely is well out of range of it at this moment.* - Wed Sep 09 10:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) kneels down, quickly. Palms meet the earth. Chakra travels underground at one-hundred thirty miles per hour. Of course, were Kilm able to see this chakra, he may easily be able to dodge. However, since he can't...and it 'is' moving so fast, it may as well travel instantaneously as far as he's concerned, logically -- unless he has advanced sensory abilities.

Either way, even if he moves, the chakra follows him. When and only when it's underneath him, four massive earth-and-stone spikes are formed from chakra. Abruptly they'd then dart forwards.....from a very close range. A terrifyingly close range.

All four spikes are sent towards his legs. Unfortunately should he try to evade by going to the left...or the right, or even backwards, he'd be stabbed violently. Would he even know of the three spikes that aren't right in front of him?* - Wed Sep 09 10:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms move. They dart out in front of her and once more the heels of her palms meet. Lightning roars as it comes out of her palms, and forms a sphere once more. Once more, it races forwards. This time it'd meet Kilm's raging waves jutsu.

She's quite curious as to what'll happen as a result. Will it shock Kilm to his core, damaging even him due to getting inside his mouth? If so, it'd hurt  alot even despite how unbelivably resiliant he is.

If not, then getting hit by this now-electric Mizurappa would be a horrible idea. Kat rises to her feet while it travels -- now probably halfway to her -- and sprints backwards. She travels as quickly as it does and maybe just a tiny bit faster even.

Kat makes no effort to go to the side. She's aware Kilm can change his jutsu's direction by simply turning his head. Running to the side may do nothing but slow her down.* - Wed Sep 09 10:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is simply out of range. She takes a single step backwards. Kilm's jutsu falls just short of hitting her, by roughly eight whole feet. The girl turns to face the south. Both palms find her hips and she leans forwards, peering over at Kilm from there. A smile is on her face, as if to tease.* - Wed Sep 09 10:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She then wanders over, intending to follow him into the village.* - Wed Sep 09 10:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits herself down at a table, wiggling her butt a bit to get comfortable. Arms cross, and legs swing back and forth beneath her form.* - Wed Sep 09 10:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander.* - Wed Sep 09 11:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink, for whatever possible reasons. The girl scratches her right cheek with her hand. A shrug follows, as well as a silent breath through the nose. A glance is sent Kilm's way.

"I dunno." she says.* - Wed Sep 09 11:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. The girl gently pushes herself off of her chair, turning to face the west, and wanders over to a nearby kitchen cubbard. She opens it up, then, with a shrug. "Na." she says.

"Not interested."

She pulls a bottle of sake off of the shelf and pulls the cap off. "Too beta."

She then reaches upwards to pour the liquid into her mouth, with eyes closed. Eyebrows are shifted in a matter that suggest concete. Her cheeks remain a bit pink.

Of course, sake is usually served in very tiny cups....for a reason. She's drinking quite an enormous amount. Kat's known to be extremely resiliant to poisons, alchohol, etc but still.* - Wed Sep 09 11:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes open. She keeps drinking, gulping the substance down. Eyes are averted and she shrugs once more. Her blush dies down. Soon, the entire bottle's gone. Kat tosses it to the side.

It hits the floor with a loud clunk and then rolls along. The girl then reaches for another, and turns to face the south. With her left hand she pulls herself up onto the counter, planting her butt on top of it. Legs swing back and forth beneath her and eyes remain averted.

She shakes her head.

"Not interested." she says, opening up the new bottle. She wiggles her hand to and fro, stirring the liquid inside of it.* - Wed Sep 09 11:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Sucks for you." she says with a glance over at him.

Her bottle finds her mouth once more and once more, she pours sake down her throat.* - Wed Sep 09 11:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) didn't drink much at all this time. She has the buzz she was after. Eye contact is made and she shakes her head, eyeing him calmly.

"Now I'm even less interested." she says.
"You're neurotic."* - Wed Sep 09 11:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) drinks more, pretty much sipping.* - Wed Sep 09 11:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "He's lonely and wants someone to help his self-esteem. That won't be me. Orakuru was never like that."

She briefly looks him up and down.

"He was better."* - Wed Sep 09 11:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares coldly, for a brief moment. Eyes wander off afterwords, though. Carefully, Katsune begins pulling herself to the side, sliding along atop the counter. Once her path is clear, she then gently pushes herself off.

Feet touch the floor, and she then begins walking off at a lazy pace, with a bit of a swagger. 

"I need more training." she says.

If not stopped she's soon opening the door, and leaving.* - Wed Sep 09 11:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head as she leaves. "Nope." she says, still walking.* - Wed Sep 09 11:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still walking.* - Wed Sep 09 11:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits.* - Wed Sep 09 12:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes, having felt Kilm's on her.* - Wed Sep 09 12:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Various NPCs pass through.* - Wed Sep 09 12:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I don't have scruples." she says.

"The people we're fighting are as bad as Zetsumo anyway. Only thing that seperates them is....well. They're barbaric."* - Wed Sep 09 12:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I'm sorry. . . I ruined your mood and my own. - Wed Sep 09 12:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: I went too far. . . - Wed Sep 09 12:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is whispering of course.* - Wed Sep 09 12:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's fine. - Wed Sep 09 12:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: We good? - Wed Sep 09 12:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah. - Wed Sep 09 12:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: To be honest, I don't know what I can say to you or ask you anymore. Everything seems . . . bad . . . when it comes to how you take those questions and statements. - Wed Sep 09 12:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'd rather us stay friends. - Wed Sep 09 12:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . But there's something I want to ask . . . I know you might take this personal but . . . Why? I don't believe what you said was the real reason. You know me more. - Wed Sep 09 12:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: . . . - Wed Sep 09 12:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . I'm sorry again. I just . . . wanted to know. - Wed Sep 09 12:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Doesn't matter. - Wed Sep 09 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You won't give me an answer? - Wed Sep 09 12:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Nope. - Wed Sep 09 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . Okay. - Wed Sep 09 13:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "'Kay." she says.* - Wed Sep 09 13:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this in a sincere manner with eyes averted, and with a shrug. Her right hand's scratching at her cheek shortly afterwords.* - Wed Sep 09 13:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Nothing really."* - Wed Sep 09 13:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Wed Sep 09 13:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: So . . . - Wed Sep 09 13:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You'd rather stay friends forever . . . Or? - Wed Sep 09 13:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I think so. Yeah. - Wed Sep 09 13:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . You sure you don't need time? - Wed Sep 09 13:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It'd be....a lot of time. - Wed Sep 09 13:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: . . . Okay . . . But . . . I'm willing to wait . . . I guess . . . But we'll stay friends then. - Wed Sep 09 13:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is whispering back and forth with Kilm right now, for the record.* - Wed Sep 09 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Wed Sep 09 13:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Okay . . . I'm better now . . . We never ate by the way. All you did is drink sake . . . You could share you know. - Wed Sep 09 13:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Mm.... - Wed Sep 09 14:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Maybe next time. No getting drunk in my house though. - Wed Sep 09 14:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. - Wed Sep 09 14:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: So what about that earth test Zetsumo was on about? I think we will have to show off our earth jutsu. - Wed Sep 09 14:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yeah. - Wed Sep 09 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I don't plan on practicing though. - Wed Sep 09 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Alright. By the way,I've gotten real good at Storm release recently and I have a lot of ideas for it. - Wed Sep 09 14:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Have you been practicing explosion release? - Wed Sep 09 14:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: *Sighs* - Wed Sep 09 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: No. Not really. I've been distracted...and explosions are hard. You'd be surprised. - Wed Sep 09 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm not an indecisive person. I can tell when something's not worth training yet. - Wed Sep 09 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Priorities first. - Wed Sep 09 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: And what are your priorities? - Wed Sep 09 14:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Not sure right now. - Wed Sep 09 14:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'm wondering, though.... - Wed Sep 09 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hm? - Wed Sep 09 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Did you train your body to be as hard as it is? I can't even cut you. - Wed Sep 09 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Yes. - Wed Sep 09 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I see. . . - Wed Sep 09 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You planning to train it as well? - Wed Sep 09 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Maybe. Just depends on how hard it is to do that. Probably a chore. - Wed Sep 09 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Hm . . . Soft . . . You do kinda need it I think. - Wed Sep 09 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Wed Sep 09 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I'll probably work on chakra control next. People dodge my jutsus too easily for one and....secondly. . . . - Wed Sep 09 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: My priority is being able to make and use storm release jutsu. That's it. I found out the two varieties of jutsu I can make for it and afterwards,because of what i've come up with . . . I might need to train sight and marksmanship further. - Wed Sep 09 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I want my jutsus to be strong enough to counter other jutsus. Sometimes you -really- can't just...dodge. - Wed Sep 09 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Something tells me my explosion release'll be a lot easier to use with better chakra control, too. - Wed Sep 09 14:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Right now I can barely manage to combine my elements. - Wed Sep 09 14:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Wed Sep 09 14:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: The reason I need marksmanship and more sight . . . I plan my storm release jutsu to be very long range. - Wed Sep 09 14:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is a shinobi, so she of course knows what the average range for hearing is. The girl picks up a brown stone from the road. With that, she then lazily chunks it over at Beth's butt.

Not enough to hurt, but enough to possibly embarass her and especially get her to take a hint.

Mostly, she'd rather not have just anyone hear her talking about her talents. What kind of ninja would she be if she didn't hide anything?* - Wed Sep 09 14:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Wed Sep 09 14:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "I imagine people prefer to train in private." she says.

"I know I do."* - Wed Sep 09 15:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Wouldn't bother me. I'm sure I'll have stuff to test by then too."* - Wed Sep 09 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit in response. It's a weak smile. The kind that suggests annoyance.* - Wed Sep 09 15:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "We're too old for that." she says.* - Wed Sep 09 15:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: (Just stat set. it'll fix ur thing - Wed Sep 09 21:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and turns to follow.* - Thu Sep 10 10:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down. She stares in space to the south for a long moment. Minutes pass.

Eventually she roughly sets herself down in the dirt. Arms and legs spread, and she stares blankly up at the sky.

This is training.* - Thu Sep 10 10:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't exactly "studious" in any way, shape, or form.

Her vocabulary is from weird fan fic --

books.* - Thu Sep 10 10:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I'm already more than a grunt." she says.

"I killed Orakuru."* - Thu Sep 10 10:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is naturally...."resiliant." It makes sense she'd be able to train physically for hours and hours without really hating it.* - Thu Sep 10 10:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Thu Sep 10 10:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still staring into space with eyes facing the sky, actually.* - Thu Sep 10 10:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off.* - Thu Sep 10 10:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Thu Sep 10 10:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls herself up to her feet, having been lying down up until now. "We're going to my house, new girl." she says to Maya.

"You can come if you want." It'd be rude not to walk away without saying so after all, and she's not exactly looking for alone time with bath-water-soaked-Kilm either.

She then begins walking away, over the water.* - Thu Sep 10 11:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) brushes dirt off of herself along the way. Much of it drips off of her like water from a window, too, due to her skill with earth ninjutsu and certain very closely related jutsus. It's slow, but it happens.

When at the house, Kat plants her back to a wall. Arms cross, and she flexes her right hand at the wrist. Briefly lightning crackles and stirs in her palm.

Something tells her Kilm's exagerating his nudity even if she can't see him.* - Thu Sep 10 11:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders over to a nearby table -- one that's clearly used for her meals -- and sets herself down in one of the four or so chairs. The girl's right leg crosses over her left once there, and eyes wander.* - Thu Sep 10 11:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander in response to the girl's first words.

A silent breath is released in response to her assumptions and she shakes her head. "Na." she says.
"Friend."* - Thu Sep 10 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this fairly casual. One could infer by her body language that she is guarding herself, but even so, she still appears unphased.* - Thu Sep 10 12:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander.

"Honestly..." she says, in an intentionally polite -- but not weak -- tone.

"I'd rather not talk about it."* - Thu Sep 10 12:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) casually glances up at Kilm, saying nothing.* - Thu Sep 10 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, eventually, with a silent breath -- not a deep one.

"We could." she says.* - Thu Sep 10 13:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, with a glance over at her. "Never tried it before, but I'm not new to swimming in mud."

The girl rises to her feet and turns to follow.* - Thu Sep 10 13:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) referred to Subterannean Voyage. She's not a weirdo.* - Thu Sep 10 13:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rest behind her back when they're at the desk, and eyes remain averted. When questioned she glances over at the woman.

"Not like I have any boundaries if that's what you're getting at." she says. Of course, she's careful to avoid saying "within reason"...though it's implied just by her obvious disposition alone. And of course, it's also very possible that some bravado is at work here.

That all being said, she does run around in a body suit that leaves very little to the imagination.

"But...if I had a choice....." The girl's eyes wander. Cheeks turn just a bit pink.

"A bath sounds best."

As little touching as possible.* - Thu Sep 10 13:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Maya with a shrug in response to her first question. She didn't even know what basketball was until recently. When prompted to follow, she does so.

No reaction is shown at first to the sight of bikinis. When she eventually picks her own up to examine it, though, she smiles a bit. The teen then turns to face the opposite direction to begin changing.

Gauntlets, boots, and other equipment are all stored in her locker. No glances, even, are spared to Maya. She'd rather not unintentionally give her the impression that she's peeking.

Once done, she wanders over to the nearest mirror. Palms rest on her hips and she faces her back to it. Briefly she examines her reflection, making sure it fits in a modest fashion. It pretty much doesn't by her standards, but she shrugs. Close enough.

She then wanders up to Maya with eyes averted. Arms rest behind her back once more. Naturally she plans to follow her.* - Thu Sep 10 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is in something red & purple, specifically. It's also relatively humble. Nothing overly showy.* - Thu Sep 10 14:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs in response to Maya's comment, briefly making eye contact. The girl's relaxed at this point, though. Honestly, the blush from before was at the thought of people giving her a massage -- or Kilm being in the room.

Briefly she peeks at the medic, but only to compare.

Katsune's own outfit isn't so snug, but it matters little. She intentionally places herself behind Maya -- naturally with eyes still averted.

"Who knows." she says.
"Maybe this is a henge jutsu."* - Thu Sep 10 14:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods in response to the gesture, with another glance at the woman. Of course, the comment on henge was nothing more than a show of humility. It's true that it'd be impossible for Kat to keep that up for long.

Carefully she dips a foot into the mud. Said foot is stirred around for a moment to test the warmth and consistency. She also takes a moment to sense the depths out by way of earth-based magnetic sensing -- something she's adept at. She just needs to see how deep this is. She's by far not a tall girl.

Afterwords, the girl slowly descends. Her butt is planted two feet away from Maya, and both palms would rest a the floor of the tub at either side of her. Legs are arranged to a comfortable extent.

Kat doesn't respond to the comment on her henge capabilities.* - Thu Sep 10 14:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the woman once more in response to the comment on genes. "We can't talk about anything too sensitive with our guests in the room." she says, hinting at discussing Kenryoku business. The more secretive kind.

"And....as far that..." she shrugs.

"I just had to deal with some stuff, a while ago. Those sorts of things usually aren't uncomfortable for me."* - Thu Sep 10 14:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, even as a drop of mud from Maya's antics hits her cheek. She'd turned her head lazily in response, as if to evade it, but doesn't manage to do so -- mostly because no fucks are given.

"I won't say I'm not. Either way, the idea of getting a massage with Kilm in the room..." she begins. A weak smile is produced and eyes wander off. Cheeks turn just a tiny bit pink.

"Yeah. That'd be awkward to say the least."* - Thu Sep 10 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) displays no noteworthy body language. Eyes remain averted, for of course obvious reasons. Looking someone in the eyes means you're okay with them knowing what's on your mind. Nothing more and nothing less, excluding intentional, forced eye contact.

"I'm a bit stressed...but it's nothing I won't get over. Work would help, but I'm not falling apart."* - Thu Sep 10 15:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stopped smiling a while ago, for the record. Her expression's pretty neutral.* - Thu Sep 10 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls am arm out of the mud. With her left hand, she carefully wipes away some mud. The palm is turned to face Maya, and a fuuinjutsu seal is revealed. She may have noticed one on the girl's left hand earlier too, though it's unlikely she got a good look at it.

There's one on her tongue too, which also has probably been noticed by now.

"But I'll get her."* - Thu Sep 10 15:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross.

"And by here I assume you mean Amegakure?" she says.* - Thu Sep 10 16:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the finger blankly, as if unphased. The teen is in a bath full of mud for the record, covered up to the chest. Due to her height it may be up to the neck, even.

". . .So you've been with Zetsumo for how long?" she inquires before looking away.* - Thu Sep 10 16:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) isn't doing anything notable of course.

Considering her disposition she's not overly interested in exploring the facility's services.* - Thu Sep 10 16:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is adamant on her position for only one reason, of course.

She doesn't have the luxury of having watched ninja anime that show Rock Lee wrecking everyone.* - Thu Sep 10 16:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "We'll see." she says.

"Of course, she could just as likely end up dead."* - Thu Sep 10 16:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at her, briefly examining the woman's own face mask. A shrug follows. Naturally she's more comfortable now, having bragged for so long.

The girl eyes the mud in front of her for a long while, with eyes wandering. Does she 'want' her skin the look better? Her lips then stretch into a frown. Eyes become a tad bit cold. That was an insult, wasn't it?

"I..." she murmurs. Eyes wander further off.

"My skin looks fine."* - Thu Sep 10 16:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this in a very unoffensive manner, despite her body language.* - Thu Sep 10 16:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Maya. Little to nothing about her tone suggest her ego's taken a blow. Even so, she appears to consider the idea.

Eyes wander further off. Eventually she shakes her head. Legs rub back and forth against each other in the mud below.

Her expression shifts to one of conceit. "Don't need it." she says.

"Don't want it."* - Thu Sep 10 17:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says these things in a lazy manner. She gives no fucks. If anything, she seems to be recalling something.

Of course, her skin is actually exceptionally healthy. It's in her genes. She has little reason to feel any insecurity.* - Thu Sep 10 17:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't respond to Maya's last comment.

"..Why would I get scars?" she inquires, for whatever reasons.* - Thu Sep 10 17:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "We should get cleaned up." she says.* - Thu Sep 10 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, with her palms finding the surface behind her. Carefully she pulls herself out. Her feet find the floor rather than her butt; she's not without flexibility. Lazily she then rises into a standing position.

Eyes wander as she swipes some mud off, though of course this makes little progress so she soon stops. She turns to follow the medic.* - Thu Sep 10 17:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, having turned on the water for her own shower head as well of course. "Yeah." she says. A lazy glance is sent Maya's way. The girl's right hand finds the center of her own bikini's top. Lazily, she pulls at it. Breasts are left bare while water washes away mud there as well.

The girl turns to and fro briefly, and subtly, causing a scene. . .

Just to inspire envy.

The associated quiet slap is heard when the piece returns to where it belongs. She then turns to face the opposite direction, resuming her clean up as if she hadn't done anything at all just now. Her expression remains the same throughout.* - Thu Sep 10 18:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || It's a cold expression, specifically.* - Thu Sep 10 18:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyebrow twitches at the sound of water splashing around. She suspects it, but isn't sure. Eventually though she takes the bait, blankly examining the woman, and briefly. A blush follows, and she then averts her eyes. The girl turns to face the completely opposite direction, her eyebrows now furrowed a bit. A very subtle scowl.

"Yeah." she says, casually.* - Thu Sep 10 18:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns the water off on her end as well with an inaudible sigh. Eyes wander for a bit while she reclaims her composure. She gulps, and takes a moment to quietly clear her throat.

With that she then turns around, picking up her own towel. Eyes remain averted. With a shrug she says "Yeah. It does."

Time is spent drying off. She's careful to spend no more time than Maya. That'd look like she's intimidated, after all.* - Thu Sep 10 18:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at her, eventually finishing with her own labor. With that done she sets the towel aside and begins stripping, in a careless but slow manner, tossing the pieces on the floor -- again, just to show that she's definitely, absolutely not intimidated. Because she isn't.

"Yeah." she says. "I mean, I was going to before. . ."* - Thu Sep 10 18:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head to look over her shoulder at the woman as she pulls out her body suit. Her expression's blank, and she briefly makes eye contact. Her cheeks are just a tiny bit pink. She's facing the opposite direction once more though when she begins dressing. Some wiggling is necessary due to the tight fit.

"U-um..." she says, past a brief breath.

"I don't remember."

She's eventually dressed, after some amount of time due to the nature of her outfit. The girl is putting on her gaunlets afterwords, and eventually boots.* - Thu Sep 10 18:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scratches her cheek, with her left hand. She turns to follow, saying nothing else. She's shamed herself enough for one day.* - Thu Sep 10 18:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms meet behind her back, and she puts herself at Maya's side. To not do so would be shameful.* - Thu Sep 10 18:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right eyebrow twitches.* - Thu Sep 10 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop with a brief, quiet breath. A glance is sent Maya's way, with the same subtle, sour expression on her face.

"...Don't you have, like, a job or something?" she inquires.* - Thu Sep 10 19:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gulps a bit, her expression becoming a much more humble one. Her right foot is picked up to scratch at the back of her left foot. Another glance is sent Maya's way, and she shakes her head. "...No." she says.

"Not really."* - Thu Sep 10 19:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares up at her for a moment, before looking away. A breath is taken and she shrugs, eager to make herself as composed as this woman.

"It's fine." she says.

"Today was good."* - Thu Sep 10 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't even nod. With eyes averted, she turns to follow.* - Thu Sep 10 19:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) remains standing. Her weight shifts a bit, and arms remain crossed.* - Thu Sep 10 19:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Thu Sep 10 19:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes, convincing herself she didn't see that.* - Thu Sep 10 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) awkwardly scratches her right cheek and averts her eyes.* - Thu Sep 10 19:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) abruptly turns to walk away. Eyes remain averted and they're also a tiny bit cold.* - Thu Sep 10 19:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hey. - Fri Sep 11 07:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Morning. - Fri Sep 11 07:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is unenthusiastically lying in the dirt.* - Fri Sep 11 07:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Did you have fun in the spa? - Fri Sep 11 07:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Sep 11 07:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Fri Sep 11 07:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off as she says that.* - Fri Sep 11 07:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sorry for kinda . . . running off to play my favourite sport. - Fri Sep 11 07:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's fine. - Fri Sep 11 07:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It was relaxing to be in the mud bath though . . . Despite everyone there being men . . .  - Fri Sep 11 07:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Fri Sep 11 07:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . Did you have a nice talk with Maya? - Fri Sep 11 07:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ..Yeah. - Fri Sep 11 07:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You up to go train? - Fri Sep 11 07:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 11 07:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) ignores Zetsumo. Palms rest on her hips for the brief moment that she's come to a stop, and eyes are averted. Not in a showy way but rather, in a way that suggests no fucks given. She resumes moving when Kilm does.* - Fri Sep 11 07:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Na. I was willing to spar if you really wanted to. . .but, training sounds boring. - Fri Sep 11 08:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits.* - Fri Sep 11 08:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And tease me? - Fri Sep 11 08:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You make it so easy, though. - Fri Sep 11 08:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) smiles a bit.* - Fri Sep 11 08:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I should run around more. Either way,I still want to be done with two things for the day. - Fri Sep 11 08:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || it's a smug smile.* - Fri Sep 11 08:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . What to do? - Fri Sep 11 09:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.* - Fri Sep 11 09:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You up for a spar, Katsune? - Fri Sep 11 09:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Guess we could do that. - Fri Sep 11 09:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Here or somewhere else? - Fri Sep 11 09:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anywhere. - Fri Sep 11 09:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay then. - Fri Sep 11 09:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's do it here. - Fri Sep 11 09:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. "We should go off to the side though." she says.

"Or we'll hit Paine."* - Fri Sep 11 09:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You first. - Fri Sep 11 09:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes her usual stance. She shrugs.

"In a real fight you can't expect the enemy to always be on the offensive." she says.* - Fri Sep 11 09:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should know I never take chances. - Fri Sep 11 09:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I do . . . Sometimes. - Fri Sep 11 09:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 'is' quite tempted to sprint backwards when Kilm begins moving. After all, he doesn't use taijutsu even for supplementary purposes. The girl decides to humor him though -- mostly just to show off.

The moment she sees him taking in his breath for the goukyaku, she turns on her heel, spinning like a top for one-hundred-eighty degrees. Mid-spin, she begins sprinting.

Naturally, she out-runs the jutsu. She's a tiny bit faster than Kilm's chakra. The moment she's out of range by ten feet, she comes skidding to a stop, spinning to face Kilm again in the same motion. In the same motion, she's crouching down.

Palms meet the earth. Abruptly, shortly afterwords, spikes are formed beneath Kilm's body. They'd come racing out of the ground and aim to impale him in the torso from four sides -- front, back, and sides.

Of course, that's if Kilm just stands there. She can feel the heat at her back, and is very capable of changing plans should Kilm try anything devious.* - Fri Sep 11 09:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) hadn't really been capable of responding to Maya. As fast as Kilm's jutsus are, she has to focus.* - Fri Sep 11 09:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes dart off after Kilm as he moves. Despite the intended purpose of that jutsu, she's very capable of following his every step, even when he's using shunshin. He strains her eyes just a bit...almost moving as a blur, but she can track him.

As such, she simply stops pouring chakra into the ground and turns to face him, still close to the dirt. The earth and stone bamboo shoot is never fired off. Palms meet the ground again, and once more she does the exact same jutsu.

This time she'd be aiming from a much closer range, and from the moment he comes to a stop. Would he be able to pull the same stunt again in such rapid succession? She's guessing the answer is no.

Either way, she'd no doubt be giving him a hard time.* - Fri Sep 11 09:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't spend any time recovering from earth and stone bamboo shoot. One of the perks of having trained extensively in the use of the earth element -- far moreso than Kilm, definitely.

That, and she's taking advantage of Kilm's briefest moment of downtime from being knocked around from her spikes.

The girl leans backwards and kicks off of the earth, leading into a backwards somersault. She'd had no intention of dodging, actually -- just putting distance between herself and kilm. By the time she even notices his jutsu, she's already moving by coincidence alone.

Of course, even if she had been caught off-guard, she'd still have been able to evade. One of many reasons to not slack on taijutsu training.

Arms meet as she comes to a stop some fourty feet away, and the heels of her palms do too. Both palms light up with lightning-natured chakra, crackling loudly and violently. Out of them come a sphere of the substance, and it's immediately launched off with no need for hand seals -- due to Kat's chakra flow gauntlets.

She aims for his mouth, hoping to get it conducted by his water jutsu on the way. Of course, this is unlikely. Either way, he'd probably want to move. Being hit in the face would hurt even him.* - Fri Sep 11 09:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Seems you're still as fast as ever. - Fri Sep 11 10:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Looks like training - Fri Sep 11 10:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Fun fun - Fri Sep 11 10:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't wait for Kilm to get close. Naturally she knows better. She never lets anyone get that close.

The girl begins crouching down as Kilm draws near. Palms meet the earth. Abruptly, once he's twelve feet or so away and before he's launched off his jutsu, Kat's sucked into the earth.

The girl travels eight feet under and then darts towards him, moving much faster than he's capable of. Upon reaching his feet, her arms would abruptly dart out of the ground. The earth is softened due to the nature of this jutsu, so strength would do little to help him escape. He'd need to evade as the earth parts.

Either way, should she actually manage to grab him, her right arm flies forwards. With her knuckles aimed at his lower back -- an area as sensitive as testicles -- she'd punch him. Hard. For the first time ever, her specialized gauntlets come into play for a punch's impact.* - Fri Sep 11 10:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's palms find the ground as Kilm moves. She's so, so much faster but unfortunately when it comes to actually 'attacking'....her arms are slow. Either way, she pauses for not even a moment. She hadn't expected to actually find his ankles.

No, she wanted something else. Without any pause, she's pulling herself out of the ground and sprinting in the process. Naturally she's in point blank range for this entire direction, and she leaps when he does. While moving, Kat launches an arm forwards. She aims for the upper back. Should she hit him -- and she will since he can't fly or otherwise redirect his movement in mid-air -- he's hit with an exploding palm.

The force his absolutely massive, and concussive like a punch -- due to the nature of explosions. It comes with a loud and crackling bang.
* - Fri Sep 11 10:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Naturally, Kilm would be sent into the dirt. He'd be completely unharmed due to his trained endurance, but that wouldn't stop him from being knocked back. He'd have to be clever to avoid that, and even then it seems unlikely.

With that done, as Kat falls to the ground, she'd launch herself backwards into another ground-based somersault once more, wanting to put distance between the two.

Feet would come skidding to a stop once she's really, really far away. She'd stare from there, blankly. Blankly, because she's figured out what this spar is about.* - Fri Sep 11 10:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods, standing straight. Arms cross and her weight shifts a bit. "Honestly..." she says, looking him up and down blankly.

"Starting to wonder if this spar is about you actually managing to hit me for once."* - Fri Sep 11 10:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hope you realize I'm not capable of damaging you either. - Fri Sep 11 10:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or even hitting you half the time. - Fri Sep 11 10:29:32 2015
