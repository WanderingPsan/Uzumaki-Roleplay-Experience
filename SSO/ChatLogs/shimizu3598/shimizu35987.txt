<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, with eyes averted.

"How do I practice if I can't make mud?" she says.* - Wed Sep 16 19:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: .. - Wed Sep 16 19:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mariana(BoyFlareon) says: See you guys later. - Wed Sep 16 19:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow in response to Zetsumo's lecture. She's surprised, because honestly, she'd only said what she did so she could get away with being lazy. After a brief moment though, with a glance off to the side, she nods and rises to her feet. Arms cross and her weight shifts a bit.

The girl studies the mud closely. When mud is fired at her, the girl's legs bend at the knees. Her expression remains blank. Abruptly she leaps, quite quickly. The girl is leaning forwards during the motion, and her foot ram into the wall behind her shortly afterwords. Still moving a as a blur, the teen would then be sent flying over Zetsumo's mud, by about six feet in height.

Her eyes are averted in the mean time, and a faint frown is on her face. One that suggests annoyance.

Feet touch the ground somewhere north of the tentacle zombie and she comes skidding to a stop. She's turning to face the mudwave to the southeast in the process, had she been successful.* - Wed Sep 16 19:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is abruptly struck by the mud, so suddenly. The girl flinches hard, and releases a loud grunt as mud washes over her. Some of it gets in her mouth. Nearly instantly she's rammed, hard, into the nearest house's door. She's squirming for a long moment.

It's not until the mud falls away that she roughly drops to the ground, onto her face. Flinching the moment she hits the ground, she'd lift herself up on trembling arms and legs. Roughly, she coughs more than once, having choked a bit.

A scowl is on her face. Her blush is hidden by mud. "A-ass!" she shouts inbetween coughs.* - Wed Sep 16 19:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is covered in mud of course.* - Wed Sep 16 19:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to examine the boiling mud. An eyebrow twitches. Eyes wander off afterwords and she rises to her feet, swaying to and fro a bit in the process. The girl turns to face the southeast. Arms rise to form the tiger seal as she takes a moment to seethe.

The girl doesn't even bother channeling her chakra at first, as she's too busy mentally cursing Zetsumo. Eventually though her eyes move forwards, and she conjures up some chakra. Invisibly, it coats her body. Slowly, it then seeps into the earth at her feet. Kat could manipulate it much more quickly if she 'really' wanted to, but there's no need at the moment.

The chakra is made to swim and dig through the dirt at her feet. Lazily, she uses chakra to pull and knead at the substance. It doesn't take long before she's managed some success. Dirt turns to a liquid-like substance. Kat's nearly mastered Subterannean Voyage after all.

She has experience with this sort of earth manipulation. It's only a small amount of dirt she's managed to change, however. Enough to fit in the palm of one's hand. Slowly, she then works on making it shift into a tougher consistency. Mud, instead of this very thin liquid.

While doing this, Kat bids her mud to shift and grab at other nearby dirt. It would take hold of it and knead at it; crush and pull, to help turn it into mud. And in the process, Kat's still pouring chakra into the new earth. Eventually, she has a nice little puddle. It stirs and shifts visibly, but it's not much.

Kat sends it rolling forwards. Just enough mud to fill up a small bucket. Eyes trail after it as it goes, fairly slowly. More chakra is sent into the ground. This time, the girl keeps her chakra at the surface, pulling and kneading at only the top-most layer of dirt. It's scooped up and pushed to and fro as it turns to liquid.

Kat takes a moment to crack her neck, lazily. First to the right, and then to the left. Silently she takes a breath through the nose. Soon, she has a long, then river. Without much effort she sends it rolling forwards. 

It moves slowly and there's not much of it, but it's something. It eventually meets the last mud she'd conjured up. The mud scoops it up along the way, and both crash into the wall Kat had been resting against before. The girl's efforts are increased. Very large amounts of chakra are sent forwards.

It's probably way more chakra than needed, but Kat has chakra to spare. Large amounts of eath are kneaded at. It rolls to and fro, shifting in a very thick consistency. Large amounts of time are spent on this task, with earth being pushed upwards constantly. It bubbles. 

The bubbles are thick. Minutes pass. Eventually though, with a sigh, Kat's managed to summon an entire river. More chakra is kneaded into it, consuming more of her time. She's not gonna risk sending this one forwards and wasting all the effort she's poured into it thus far.

Eventually though, she's satisfied and confident that the wave will have power, and speed. Flexing her chakra, Kat then sends the wave racing forwards at the speed one might've come to expect from her jutsus. A speed that's nearly as quickly as she can run. At ninety miles per hour or so it rams into the wall accross the yard, and Kat watches it do so.

Once she's done she produces a shrug. Arms cross and she turns to stare up at Zetsumo. Her eyes are a bit cold. She says nothing, expecting him to read her mind.* - Wed Sep 16 20:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Her eyes wander off. "'Kay." she says. "Gonna go sleep." The girl then turns to wander off.* - Wed Sep 16 21:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Besides, I don't have much reason to hate her, do I? - Thu Sep 17 05:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're not . . . I meant that you looked very serious. - Thu Sep 17 05:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: In the dangerous serious kind of way. - Thu Sep 17 05:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I wasn't gonna throw punches...that's true. - Thu Sep 17 05:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Either way . . . She's still useful to Zetsumo. - Thu Sep 17 05:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm. - Thu Sep 17 05:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm still confused as to what happened between Beth and Zenaki . . . Though that's none of my business. - Thu Sep 17 05:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Who cares. - Thu Sep 17 05:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're right though. It is none of your business. - Thu Sep 17 05:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why get involved or stare at them if you had no idea what was even going on? - Thu Sep 17 05:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Either way, I was going to tag in if you would've yelled for help. - Thu Sep 17 05:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even if I didn't know why I was going to fight beth. - Thu Sep 17 05:22:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Well, besides Ration if any. - Thu Sep 17 13:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Just Raiton. - Thu Sep 17 13:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Nigga, you're also Katon by default since you uchiha - Thu Sep 17 13:10:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Stupid question. - Thu Sep 17 13:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No. - Thu Sep 17 13:13:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hello. - Thu Sep 17 14:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Felt lazy. - Thu Sep 17 14:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's feet are drawn close to her form, with her knees near her chest. Elbows rest on her legs, and her face is on her palms. The girl's eyes are averted and they wander in response to Zetsumo's question. She says nothing.

Lounging about is right.* - Thu Sep 17 14:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: It seems I have arrived during some sort of chastising. - Thu Sep 17 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, glancing over at Zetsumo. "I spar Kilm every other day and he's only beat me once. I've only beat him once. We usually tie. He works hard and I still keep up with him. I'd say I'm doing fine."* - Thu Sep 17 14:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Shin. I want you to continue working on your Katon release. I'll be showing you a new technique later. - Thu Sep 17 15:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rolls her eyes. The girl then rises to her feet and turns to wander off. Palms rest on the back of her head, and eyes wander.

Honestly? She just might end up not going to the field.* - Thu Sep 17 15:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . We train hard enough already. - Thu Sep 17 15:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: A light novel. - Thu Sep 17 15:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm pretty sure he was only talking to me. - Thu Sep 17 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He did say to make mud. - Thu Sep 17 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm very sure, even. - Thu Sep 17 15:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Need some help with that? I know he didn't tell me to do anything but . . . Whatever. - Thu Sep 17 15:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I could've been scolded more . . . Would've just shrugged it off. Hm. - Thu Sep 17 15:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Thu Sep 17 15:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly making mud isn't hard for me. Zetsumo doesn't give me enough credit. - Thu Sep 17 15:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I could bathe half the village in mud before passing out. - Thu Sep 17 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He taught me the jutsu for it. - Thu Sep 17 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should aim for the whole village. - Thu Sep 17 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, I said half of the village because.... - Thu Sep 17 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Would be interesting to see everyone's reactions. - Thu Sep 17 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I haven't mastered the jutsu yet. - Thu Sep 17 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Still should aim for whole. - Thu Sep 17 15:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, and gently pulls herself off of the wall. With that, the tiger seal is formed. Abruptly, the ground in front of her turns into mud. It's an enormous amount, spanning twelve feet or so before racing forwards. Nearly instantly, "twelve feet" turns into twenty or thirty.

Once done, Kat takes some time to let her tenketsu relax. She doesn't have the ability to spam jutsu back to back like Zetsumo does. Katsune turns and lazily walks off to the side. Once next to her mudslide, she repeats the jutsu.

This is repeated until the entire field is 100% coated.* - Thu Sep 17 15:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nice. - Thu Sep 17 15:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs.She then goes to plant herself on the wall again and gives her chakra time to recover.* - Thu Sep 17 15:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Wondering what I could train, Not jutsu . . . But generally what attribute . . . - Thu Sep 17 15:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I reeeeally.... - Thu Sep 17 15:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't feel like training. - Thu Sep 17 15:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might go take a nap. - Thu Sep 17 15:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And send Zetsumo a letter telling him to bite me. - Thu Sep 17 15:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll forward it to him. - Thu Sep 17 15:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll stick my tongue out too . . . I don't feel like training either. - Thu Sep 17 15:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Thu Sep 17 15:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be back later. - Thu Sep 17 15:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Thu Sep 17 15:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She then turns to wander off.* - Thu Sep 17 15:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What happened to napping? Not gonna risk angering Zetsumo? - Thu Sep 17 15:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Thu Sep 17 15:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I assume you've found some motivation to keep training then. - Thu Sep 17 16:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not really. - Thu Sep 17 16:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Guess I was mistaken. - Thu Sep 17 16:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I should get rid of the storm someday. - Thu Sep 17 16:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Or try to. - Thu Sep 17 16:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What...? - Thu Sep 17 16:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The constant rain of Amegakure. - Thu Sep 17 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Eh, good luck. - Thu Sep 17 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Getting rid of it for eight whole minutes...maybe. When you're on Zetsumo's level. - Thu Sep 17 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's definitely persistent. - Thu Sep 17 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Aside from that...yeah. Good luck. - Thu Sep 17 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Heh. It'll be fun to try. - Thu Sep 17 16:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Did I get ditched....? - Thu Sep 17 16:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . What else is new? - Thu Sep 17 16:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, allowing herself to slowly slide down into a sitting position. Her butt meets mud, because she gives no fucks.

"Is anything ever new around here...?" she inquires with eyes averted and staring into space -- in a subtle way of course. Her expression's pretty blank and suggests little more than boredom.* - Thu Sep 17 16:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sometimes. Only news from elsewhere. Doesn't seem like people here can make anything new themselves. - Thu Sep 17 16:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's a pretty hypocritical thing to say. - Thu Sep 17 16:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Petty, too. - Thu Sep 17 16:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I speak from what i've experienced here. - Thu Sep 17 16:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Oh. I see. - Thu Sep 17 16:47:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I mean . . . There could be something i've not seen . . . It's not like I wander around the village everyday to search for that little something that is new. - Thu Sep 17 16:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The problem isn't a lack of creativity. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's because of the atmosphere. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The weekly genjutsu interrogations...Zetsumo's paranoia. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He should really work harder to get my fuuinjutsu seals removed. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd save him a lot of stress. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's already cost him Kitora. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I mean . . . I could mention something that is in Kirigakure. - Thu Sep 17 16:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Sep 17 16:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: To Zetsumo? - Thu Sep 17 16:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Thu Sep 17 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If that's true, why haven't you? - Thu Sep 17 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: End this war as fast as possible. - Thu Sep 17 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Tethys literally told us there is someone who can unseal you. - Thu Sep 17 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's what I meant just now. - Thu Sep 17 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ..... - Thu Sep 17 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Us? He talked to more than just you? - Thu Sep 17 16:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes eye contact. Her head tilts a bit. There's a certain look in her eyes. An eyebrow rises.* - Thu Sep 17 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You overheard everything so you were included. - Thu Sep 17 16:53:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And here I was telling myself you weren't an idiot. - Thu Sep 17 16:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did I miss something? Were you being passive aggressive this whole time? - Thu Sep 17 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm not passive aggressive towards you. - Thu Sep 17 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Have you not noticed Suitengo? - Thu Sep 17 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I did notice him. - Thu Sep 17 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So you're just stupid. - Thu Sep 17 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm not. - Thu Sep 17 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Maybe stupid isn't the word. You're just an asshole. - Thu Sep 17 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hey, I'm not trying to be unfriendly. - Thu Sep 17 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I am. - Thu Sep 17 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Thu Sep 17 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You shouldn't be. - Thu Sep 17 16:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander off, and she shrugs. "Na." she says. "I should've started being unfriendly a long time ago."* - Thu Sep 17 17:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. - Thu Sep 17 17:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You. . . - Thu Sep 17 17:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ... Mm. - Thu Sep 17 17:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go take a nap since Zetsumo ditched her.* - Thu Sep 17 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs, with eyes still averted. She's careleslly sitting in the mud at the moment with legs stretched out in front of her.

This hadn't been a difficult task. Her chakra is pretty savage, considering she's never done any sort of training to increase her reserves at all.* - Thu Sep 17 18:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at Zetsumo. A slow, deep, and silent breath is drawn in through the nose. After a long moment to consider this, she shrugs. Naturally she's already aware that he's probably gonna be disappointed. It's for this reason that her eyes are locked onto his when she forms the tiger seal.

Chakra seeps out of her body, at a lazy pace since Kat's not in a hurry, and makes its way down to the mud at her side. Once there, a dragon head abruptly rises out of it. It happens quickly, as per her capabilities with chakra control. Its mouth is open, and directed at Zetsumo. Its throat glows a bright white.

Abruptly, enormous amounts of rock-hard mudballs begin flying out like bullets from a machine gun. All are aimed for Zetsumo's nuts. Kat's expression is blank.* - Thu Sep 17 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes find the ground, a bit sheepishly, as Zetsumo approaches. Judging by his speed, she can't be sure whether he's taking her joke well or not. Either way, she's not sure she should run. Either way, Zetsumo gives her little time to think the decision through, due to how fast he runs.

She flinches at the sight of his hand darting forwards, and eyes find it pretty much instantly. She chooses not to move, though. The girl's aware he has threads. Running would do nothing but shame her. Briefly she squirms as she's picked up, and frowns. Lips tremble, but her eyes are cold. Eyebrows are furrowed a bit, leaving her with a scowl.

Kat's eyes are directed at her mentor's arm, rather than eyes, for obvious reasons. Very quiet gagging sounds are produced and exit through her nose, though they're a bit muffled. It's shortly after this...that Kat fully acknowledges that she can't breathe. Her face turns a bit white, and her expression relaxes some.

Trembling arms slowly make their way up to Zetsumo's, mostly my reflex. She doesn't squeeze much, though judging by the trembling of her arms, it's clear she's strongly considering doing so. She's not stupid, though. The man is a lot stronger. She continues squirming every so often, for brief amounts of time.* - Thu Sep 17 19:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: .... - Thu Sep 17 19:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches wildly as she hits the ground, releasing a loud, wet grunt. Hands squeeze hard on Zetsumo's arm -- and they're assisted by her rather durable chakra flow gauntlets too. Eyes tremble, and eyebrows remain a bit furrowed.

And then she's turned over.

Abruptly, lightning leaves her body. Lightning -- something that doton chakra is weak too. It'd release a loud, crackling roar and aim to consume Zetsumo entirely -- hopefully numbing him enough to loosen his grip.

Should she succeed -- as unlikely as that is -- Kat's feet would find the ground. Abruptly, the girl would then lean forwards and begin sprinting away, to the north.* - Thu Sep 17 19:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ..Mm. - Thu Sep 17 19:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is rammed into the ground. Immediately palms find said ground, and arms tremble. Abruptly, the ground turns to earth-based liquid, even thinner than water. Abruptly, Kat would attempt to swim away, pulling herself out of Zetsumo's hand in the process.

But how strong is his grip? Is that even possible?* - Thu Sep 17 20:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: >Still nub - Thu Sep 17 20:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Yes, I've heard of it - Thu Sep 17 20:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Hrm. . . <*Speaks casually while tormenting Katsune*>Hrm. . . And you know Housenka. I have other techniques,  but I fear they may be beyond your skill level. - Thu Sep 17 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I've taught you the Exploding Flame Shot? Or my Fire Pistol? - Thu Sep 17 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) squirms, very briefly. The girl is lying limp afterwords She glances over her shoulder at the threads, with a frown on her face. A frown and not a scowl, because she's pretty much given up.

And then her arms rise. Hands meet, and she forms the tiger seal. She flinches, tensing up. For a moment, it looks like she's about to cast a jutsu. Eyebrows furrow a bit. She pauses, though. Briefly, Kat glances over at the man.

It's unbelievably tempting, but she does nothing for now anyway.* - Thu Sep 17 20:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: No . . . uhm, Kilm and I discussed this  technique of yours. - Thu Sep 17 20:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't resist. Her arms go easily. Unfortunately her jutsu would have required too many seals anyway. She lies limp again. Briefly she wiggles to and fro, getting comfortable. Eyes remain averted.* - Thu Sep 17 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: He reffered to them - Thu Sep 17 20:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: That we hadn't learned on our own - Thu Sep 17 20:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . .It was a joke, Zetsumo. - Thu Sep 17 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The point was to make you move. Not actually hit you. - Thu Sep 17 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) probably isn't loud enough to be heard all the way across the field, though.* - Thu Sep 17 20:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her hands and knees in the mud when set down. Lazily she then pushes herself over to the wall, onto her butt. Legs end up sprawled out underneath her form. Palms rest at her sides for some brief amount of time. Arms cross, and legs then stretch out. One crosses over the other.* - Thu Sep 17 20:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Thu Sep 17 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had for the record said that in a calm tone, though. She'd already figured out she wasn't gonna be harmed.* - Thu Sep 17 21:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I would grant you some ink. But I have my doubts. - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: That Katsune could stop you should you try to escape. - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: ALthough, I see little reason for you to attempt such. Kumogakure wants you dead. - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: And Kirigakure is. . . Well. - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Huh? - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Kirigakure. - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: They do? - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: The fuck? - Thu Sep 17 21:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: What did I do? - Thu Sep 17 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I mean, what am I gonna do with ink. - Thu Sep 17 21:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I mean sure, I could secretly create ten-thousand explosive tags and strategically place them around the whole village. - Thu Sep 17 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Then create a bird, fly into the sky, you come after me. - Thu Sep 17 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I blow the whole village up. - Thu Sep 17 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't let Zetsumo's verbal abuse fool you. If you try to escape, I won't throw punches so I can't promise you won't die. - Thu Sep 17 21:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Although I do wish to use her talents.. - Thu Sep 17 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: I'll give it a efw more days. - Thu Sep 17 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Then I'll test her. - Thu Sep 17 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Do I really need her as my guard? - Thu Sep 17 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: ..If I didn't deem it necessary. - Thu Sep 17 21:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Why wou-- Don't question me. - Thu Sep 17 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Understood? - Thu Sep 17 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Understood. - Thu Sep 17 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Not. - Thu Sep 17 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: So, I got one question for you. - Thu Sep 17 21:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Sooo, uh..Who's this girl anyways? - Thu Sep 17 21:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't think I know her name. - Thu Sep 17 21:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Cheeky. . . - Thu Sep 17 21:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Give 'er the ink. I could use the excuse to beat her. - Thu Sep 17 22:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Ohhh. - Thu Sep 17 22:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Thanks~ - Thu Sep 17 22:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the girl closely, paying attention to 'exactly' which pocket the ink is placed in. She also notes with her exceptional eyes whether or not Amai is wearing any sort of cloak or jacket. Anything flowing and long. Anything that can otherwise hide weapons effectively.

Is she?* - Thu Sep 17 22:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Wonder how long it takes her to draw something. I bet it takes ages. - Thu Sep 17 22:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) knows very well that Amai can fly and such, and it takes her about two seconds to figure out that ink and drawing are involved. She'd seen her during the war, when she was watching Zetsumo. At this time the girl rises up to her feet. Mud covering her body -- which she'd given zero fucks about up until now -- slides off fairly smoothly and quickly, as if it's water.

She's left clean. At a lazy pace, she makes her way over to her.

Should she not move, Kat would soon be standing at her side with her arms crossed and weight shifted a bit. She'd be facing the south, having planted herself there only so that she could talk without raising her voice.* - Thu Sep 17 22:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: You know zetsumo. - Thu Sep 17 22:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I thought you'd be using my talents much more. - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I was a prisoner when I first got here. - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Were you now? - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Yes. I had a guard. - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Fun. - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: The man I killed. He was a little boy back then. - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Uh-huh. - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I've never killed anyone. - Thu Sep 17 22:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Just precautions. - Thu Sep 17 22:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Offer to perform more serrvices. - Thu Sep 17 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's left arm rises, lazily. Just to test her. At a snail's pace, the girl would place her gauntlet-covered palm close to Amai's ear, as if ready to punch.

Eyes then wander off, though, and she takes a silent, brief breath. Her arm returns to its former position.

For now, Kat calms herself.* - Thu Sep 17 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Thu Sep 17 22:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Don't give me a hard time. I'm explaining this to you because you should know, I don't intend to beat you silly every single day. - Thu Sep 17 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: -- Unless, you give me a hard time. - Thu Sep 17 22:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I came over here to discuss rules. - Thu Sep 17 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: You're giving me rules? - Thu Sep 17 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Ay, zetsumo. - Thu Sep 17 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has been speaking quietly to Amai this entire time, for the record.

(crappy whisper code)* - Thu Sep 17 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: You should let me go back to my house in kumogakure. - Thu Sep 17 22:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I could totally give you ten-thousand explosive tags. - Thu Sep 17 22:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: . . . - Thu Sep 17 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I'll decline. - Thu Sep 17 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her left arm again. Abruptly, she'd take hold of Amai's right ear and pinch, with her gauntlet-covered hand. She pinches very, very hard if not evaded.

Abruptly, Kat would yank Amai over to her own chest, hard. From there, she'd wave her to and fro like she's a rag. A cold expression is on her face at the moment, and her eyes are on the ground.* - Thu Sep 17 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was talking. - Thu Sep 17 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: .... - Thu Sep 17 22:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had already realized that Amai was thinking this. It's why she'd told Zetsumo to give her the ink pot.

She waves the girl around for several long seconds. Eventually though she'd stop, leaving her ear near her own mouth.

"As I was saying...." she says, glancing over at her.
"Rules...."

She then lowers her voice, not intending to make a scene with this. She speaks quietly for only that reason. So as not to distract people. She's well aware that she's not stepping out of line in any way. This is Kat of all people after all. She's not indignant.* - Thu Sep 17 22:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: You will not, under any circumstances, pull out the scroll you use for drawing unless you've let me know in advance that you're going to do so. - Thu Sep 17 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Uh-huh. - Thu Sep 17 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: This is so I don't have to flinch every time you touch it. Understand? - Thu Sep 17 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: It's not a lot to ask for. - Thu Sep 17 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I was wondering if I could ask you something. - Thu Sep 17 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: What? - Thu Sep 17 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: How old are you? - Thu Sep 17 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Sixteen. - Thu Sep 17 22:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Hm.. - Thu Sep 17 22:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Bra-size? - Thu Sep 17 22:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Thu Sep 17 22:22:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn pink. Eyes close, and an eyebrow twitches. Abruptly, Kat yanks the girl to and fro once more, this time all the way accross her chest -- possibly forcing her to stumble over -- though she swings her back in the opposite direction afterwords.* - Thu Sep 17 22:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's against the rules too. - Thu Sep 17 22:23:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. I was getting to that. - Thu Sep 17 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: She's talking about rules or something like that, and said something about her girlfriend being crazy @ Mariana - Thu Sep 17 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lowers her voice again.* - Thu Sep 17 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Every time we get to my house. . . - Thu Sep 17 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Naked slumber party. - Thu Sep 17 22:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: ...Didn't Hanabi say Amai liked it in the ass? - Thu Sep 17 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: You're to hand over your ink and scroll, and brush, the moment we get in the door -- unless it's day time and I have no intention of sleeping or bathing. Then it's different. - Thu Sep 17 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh...Alright. - Thu Sep 17 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: You're to do it without me asking. I'll test you ever single time by never, ever asking. - Thu Sep 17 22:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: But it'll be on my mind. - Thu Sep 17 22:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: What kind of punished? - Thu Sep 17 22:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Hrm. . .When am I going to get around to taking Amai's ass. <*Licks lips like Cell*> - Thu Sep 17 22:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: First time? Maybe nothing at all. - Thu Sep 17 22:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Maybe I'll just punch you as hard as I can in the gut. - Thu Sep 17 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Shrug* - Thu Sep 17 22:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: I am too oung to be around. - Thu Sep 17 22:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel, letting Amai sway to the side a bit. Abruptly, Kat turns on her heel and launches a rock-hard gauntlet-covered fist to Amai's face. Right on the nose. The strength undoubtedly would send her stumbling backwards, if not knock her over.

No amount of durability will stop that, because durability doesn't keep you upright. "Minimum" damage means it hurts like hell too, considering where she punched. If it's not "zero," then it hurt.* - Thu Sep 17 22:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Hm... - Thu Sep 17 22:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hey, Shin. - Thu Sep 17 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: I would fight her..But I'm to lazy to do infront of zetsumo. - Thu Sep 17 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Yes . . . - Thu Sep 17 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Uhm - Thu Sep 17 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You - Thu Sep 17 22:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Lend me a genjutsu. - Thu Sep 17 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: How does one lend a technique? - Thu Sep 17 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: By putting it in a scroll. - Thu Sep 17 22:36:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: How does one put an idea into a scroll? - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's not an idea, it's a technique. - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops, having not lost her balance or removed her eyes from Amai. She hadn't expected that to hit. Taijutsu isn't Kat's strongsuit...yet.

That, and with Kat's eyes, the girl appears to move in slow motion. "No more pretentious behavior." she says.

"If I have to put up with you first of all, you're going to be respectful, instead of being...a pretentious cunt. Secondly, mess with me and I'll assign you to someone way less fun. Zetsumo won't force me on this. He doesn't force me to do anything."

Her eyes are cold.* - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Is he stupid? - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Are you referring to teaching yu a genjutsu - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm trying to be nice because I sympathize. - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Yes. - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I suppose I can do so - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Let me sleep. - Thu Sep 17 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Cool. - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmmm - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm respectful. - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: And you are a-? - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: As far as, the type of shinobi you are - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'd respect you more if you got me more bottles of ink. - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Hm? - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I'm an Elementalist. - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sabo(Chevy Impalla) says: Yo... - Thu Sep 17 22:38:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: But, I want to learn genjutsu aswell. - Thu Sep 17 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Attempting to break up the monotony of elmentalism, ay? - Thu Sep 17 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmmmm - Thu Sep 17 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Then I suppose this technique will serve you will - Thu Sep 17 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I would prefer dissida watching me, since I like her and I'd do whatever she'd want anyways. - Thu Sep 17 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross, and her weight shifts a bit. She's still staring. Briefly she glances down towards Amai's current bottle.

"For what reason?" she inquires.* - Thu Sep 17 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: And.. - Thu Sep 17 22:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I know why you want Dissidia. Don't try and con a con artist. - Thu Sep 17 22:40:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: So why treat someone so cold to get their respect? - Thu Sep 17 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo knows better, and I know better. - Thu Sep 17 22:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nah. - Thu Sep 17 22:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to follow Amai's movements. Arms move and hands meet. She begins forming handseals.

If not interupted she forms five in all. Once she's formed all five -- and only if Amai hadn't moved from her current position -- Kat's right arm lights up with lightning, being painted in the substance. It crackles loudly, roaring. Strips of lightning rain down to the grass below. Abruptly, Kat would shove her arm forwards.

A stream of lightning is unleashed. It comes forwards in the form of a very wide net of shockwaves -- the type that stun, rather than kill. One of the many ways to use this magnificent jutsu.

Should Amai move even the slightest, Kat simply sprints towards the target the -moment- she begins moving....and she herself moves as a blur.

Chances of dodging this jutsu with Kat facing her the entire time and it being so wide-spread, as a massive net and a constant, non-stop stream? Basically zero.* - Thu Sep 17 22:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) keeps tazing her. -Maybe- Paine can step in the way and stop the shock before it's done one-hundred percent of the damage, but that'd be all.

Her head tilts a bit.

"You are by far..." she says through gritted teeth. "The -most- pretentious -cunt- I have ever met. And I thought my ex-boyfriend that I murdered was bad."* - Thu Sep 17 22:57:55 2015

"Anyway." she says, staring down at her coldly.

"Most of the guards here aren't equiped to deal with her." she says, with a glance at Paine.

"Hand me her ink bottle. I'm giving it to Zetsumo when he's awake."* - Thu Sep 17 23:14:59 2015

Kat isn't someone who throws her weight around, though. She has no interest in torturing this girl without a fantastic reason.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns at the waist. She no longer cares whether or not her excuse is valid. Whatever punishment she herself has to deal with, it'd be worth it.

The girl's left leg is lifted up. Eyes move to stay on...not Amai, but Paine. She stares coldly, maintaining eye contact.

Abruptly, Kat would then launch her left foot straight into Amai's nose.* - Thu Sep 17 23:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tenses up at the sight of the snake, her eyes slowly trailing up its length. Her breath had caught in her throat, briefly. Eye contact is eventually made. It doesn't take her long, though, to remember how to breathe.

With Zetsumo right there, she can't panic too hard -- because of his strength.* - Thu Sep 17 23:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares back. First of all Kat has reason to be confident. She's fought on par with, or beat, every single person she's fought aside from a single genjutsu user -- and that was before she knew to always be ready for genjutsu. She'd made the mistake of looking at the hands.

Even so, the girl remains a bit tense. She maintains eye contact. Her eyes suggest little more than caution. She's not cowering, but she's definitely ready to bolt at a moment's notice. She doesn't move a muscle.

She visibly relaxes when Manda turns his attention back to Zetsumo. The girl watches his neck.* - Fri Sep 18 00:32:38 2015
