<br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When we talked in the secret room. - Wed Sep 30 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Because I am a being that stand by my word. - Wed Sep 30 18:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That has nothing to do with embarrassment. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: -Nothing-. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I....was ready to trust you the moment we finished that discussion in the mansion, underground. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Quite frankly... - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: -Fuck- your trust. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fuck you, Erebus. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't need you. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm capable of surviving you. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then die. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: God damn it. - Wed Sep 30 18:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel the instant Erebus even begins moving. She's lifting her arms to form the tiger seal even as she does so, and she's running even as she turns.

Due to their speed being similar, it is an indisputable fact that it'd take several turns for Erebus to catch up with her, even if he would eventually.

Mid-sprint, after Kat's covered a few feet, she shoves chakra into her body's nerves and muscles all over. The shunshin jutsu. Instantly, Kat's propelled forwards. She moves twice as fast as Erebus can manage. If his eyes aren't good enough, it'd appear she'd simply disappeared instantaneously. Teleported.

Mid-stride while in shunshin, the girl leaps at the end of the road to get over the fence. Due to her limbs being augmented with chakra, she's still going at the same speed or close to it. Faster than Erebus at any rate.

Without pause she keeps sprinting, even after shunshin has worn off. The girl suffers no side-affects whatsoever, since she's only used it once.* - Wed Sep 30 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had already planned to use "Hiding Like a Mole jutsu" well in advance. She'd had her escape planned from the moment she left the inn. She knew he may bring an army. She knew he may command these. She'd never have showed up if she saw any nearby.

The girl glances to and fro as she comes skidding to a stop at the end of her march, now so far away from Erebus. As she does so, she's crouching down. The dirt becomes easy to manipulate, so she rapidly digs down under the ground. Her hole closes up behind her, as is the nature of this jutsu. The girl descends to twenty feet below the ground.

Magnetic sensing capabilities are active to be sure no one's following her. She can't be sure that Erebus doesn't know this jutsu. Should she confirm this or otherwise not sense anyone on her tail though, she simply keeps sprinting. The girl's senses stay alert and she watches out for any square objects. Anything suspicious. 

Anything hard like rocks in her path, she avoids them.* - Wed Sep 30 19:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes skidding to a stop at some point and turns to face the east mid-stride.

She shifts her weight a bit there and watches out for Kilm.

Eyes dart to and fro, to make sure no one else is coming.

Of course, if anyone does, she intends to kill them. No loose ends.* - Wed Sep 30 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel the moment Kilm is close. She says no words.

He'd better follow if he doesn't want to fall behind. She expects him to know that without her speaking.* - Wed Sep 30 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is sprinting of course.* - Wed Sep 30 19:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmm. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where should we go? - Wed Sep 30 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Think fast. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Suna or Kumo, Your choice. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There's a bounty of one-hundred million. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That means Erebus isn't our only enemy. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have no idea who could've placed that on you. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though, Guards could attack. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: In hopes of getting the bounty. - Wed Sep 30 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have an idea. - Wed Sep 30 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Seisuke the prince. - Wed Sep 30 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 30 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But I doubt he would. - Wed Sep 30 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Must be someone else. - Wed Sep 30 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Seisuke's infinitely wealthy. Son of the king and queen. - Wed Sep 30 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No one else...not even any of the villages.... - Wed Sep 30 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Could be that wealthy. - Wed Sep 30 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll find Seisuke and talk to him. - Wed Sep 30 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've seen him in Kiri a few times. - Wed Sep 30 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Niza. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He could order the guards. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not to pursue the bounty. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need to ensure Ushinawa likes us first. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We should probably go rogue at least for a while. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can meet other rogues. Make friends. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: None stronger than us. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Where do you want to go right now? - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: None faster. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No chances. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some village that isn't filled with powerful shinobi. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need disguises. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Forged travel papers maybe. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I know who to talk to. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Seisuke. I bet fake papers are within his power. - Wed Sep 30 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's....get somewhere.... - Wed Sep 30 19:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A meeting place. - Wed Sep 30 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have to meet....Seisuke. - Wed Sep 30 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Any ideas? - Wed Sep 30 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Pitch me suggestions/ - Wed Sep 30 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Around Sunagakure? - Wed Sep 30 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmmm. - Wed Sep 30 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Traveling there will take time. - Wed Sep 30 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have to get somewhere fast. Erebus will probably...place bounties or something. - Wed Sep 30 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have to out-run any couriers. - Wed Sep 30 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Get there before they do. - Wed Sep 30 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I thought Sunagakure was closest. - Wed Sep 30 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 30 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I suspect Erebus was playing us the whole time. Knew it all along. - Wed Sep 30 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's why I requested he entertain me. I knew it'd force him to do so or make his funny business obvious. - Wed Sep 30 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It did. - Wed Sep 30 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I doubt he was payed one-hundred million. - Wed Sep 30 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: paid* - Wed Sep 30 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted...to..... - Wed Sep 30 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either give us a chance to get stronger in secret, so he could use us that way....or. - Wed Sep 30 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted us out of the picture. - Wed Sep 30 19:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . - Wed Sep 30 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where...are we going? - Wed Sep 30 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have to go -somewhere-! - Wed Sep 30 19:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fine. Kirigakure. Come. - Wed Sep 30 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes a U-turn. The girl begins making her way to Kirigakure's outskirts.

"We'll stop at one of their smaller villages. Not the shinobi village that's a fortress. The ones anyone can easily hang out in."* - Wed Sep 30 19:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually makes camp. Her and Kilm presumably sleep in the same tent, within seperate tunnels made by Hiding Like a Mole jutsu. Closed tunnels. That way no one can sneak up on them. Once they awaken, they set off again.

"You should wait outside the village after I send a letter to Seisuke." she says to her traveling companion. "I intend to flee if he tries any funny business. I don't want to endanger you when I'm the one that decided on this plan." The girl sprints along, oh-so-quickly. Occasionally, for only very short distances, she puts her hands together to form the tiger seal.

The girl uses Shunshin to leap further, and then slows down into a jog so Kilm can catch up. She needs to become even faster, so she needs to master this jutsu even more. Anything to stay alive, when she has so many people hunting her for unbelievable reasons.* - Wed Sep 30 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need. . . - Wed Sep 30 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Some way to hide our scent. Or something. - Wed Sep 30 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is it. Kirigakure territory I think? - Wed Sep 30 20:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't have anything to hide our scent. - Wed Sep 30 20:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. Hmph. - Wed Sep 30 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I need you...to help me keep a look out for the next few days. - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Watch the east and north alright? - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll watch the west and south. - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be in that tree. - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) indicates a specific tree.* - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: IF.... - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You see any large numbers coming, or even three.... - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Come tell me. - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We need to be sure -only- Seisuke shows up. - Wed Sep 30 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off, and makes her way to the tree she'd indicated for herself. Once there she uses Suimen to sprint to the top. From there, she keeps a look-out. She scans the horizon to the south and west, fully expecting Kilm to do as asked and watch the north and east.

If any large numbers show up...anymore than a single specific man. They'll hopefully be able to spot them with their exceptional eyes.* - Wed Sep 30 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leaps down from her tree in response to Seisuke's message. Once there, eyes dart to and fro. The girl does her best to make sure no one's nearby. Once done, she uses the hidden mole jutsu to creep down into the dirt, closing her hole behind her.

From underground, she submerges to twenty feet below the surface. She then begins very rapidly digging her way into the village. Magnetic senses are searching for Seisuke and anyone else that's carrying shinobi-esque gear.

She needs to be sure her friend is alone when she meets him.* - Wed Sep 30 20:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is underground.* - Wed Sep 30 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is also actively looking for Seisuke at the moment, by way of magnetic senses. She's roaming the village to do so.* - Wed Sep 30 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's palms reach up out of the dirt, south of Seisuke. Her fingers wiggle to and fro as she takes a nice, firm grip on the ground. Once there, she slowly pulls herself out of the earth.

Dirt drips and falls around her, and she's left covered in the substance. Her hole closes up behind her, and Kat's brushing herself off as she looks up at him. A faint frown is on her face. "Hi." she says.

Her frown isn't one that suggests depression. It's one that suggests she's inconvenienced.* - Wed Sep 30 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sitting beside you.... - Wed Sep 30 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Is suicide if you want me dead. - Wed Sep 30 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But.... - Wed Sep 30 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll trust you. - Wed Sep 30 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You are my friend aren't you? - Wed Sep 30 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins making her way over to him. Eyes are locked onto him. "I'm a former politian. When we were disucssing things,everything we discussed was diplomacy. I can't be sure how you feel about me."

Eventually she sets her feet at his side. The girl remains standing though. She's six feet away.

Of course, if Seisuke were to go for his sword, that'd take time. It'd take twice as fast as usual to attack her, and Kat's aware of this fact.* - Wed Sep 30 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't appear to be hiding any weapons of any kind of course. There are her gauntlets, but they could easily be mistaken for simple armor.

She's wearing the body suit she always wears, but with a Kenryoku haori worn over it so that it'd take a bit longer for anyone anywhere to recognize her. Enough time to flee at the sight of said people.

"I...do, consider you a friend." she says.
"Me feeling that way doesn't mean 'you' won't attack me, though." she says.

"Someone placed a bounty of a hundred million on me. No one can afford that. First person that came to mind was you. It's how I got the idea to contact you. You're the only person aside from a Gezo king or queen that might be capable. I do not think it was you...but I have to take some precautions. That's fair, right?"* - Wed Sep 30 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm only comfortable telling you about the bounty because. . . - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're surely so rich it won't matter to you. - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I also think the bounty is a lie. - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A bluff. - Wed Sep 30 20:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus told me a lot of lies I'm sure. I played him so....he thinks he can play me. - Wed Sep 30 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's offended by it. Wants to prove to himself that he can out-do me. - Wed Sep 30 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Wed Sep 30 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Erebus is definately an interesting Fellow. - Wed Sep 30 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I say "played" but...I only hid enough from him to be sure I could stay alive. - Wed Sep 30 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's unpredictable after all. Psychotic. - Wed Sep 30 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Had to be sure. . . - Wed Sep 30 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No gambling. - Wed Sep 30 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't gamble when my life's on the line. When it's not on the line I always lose, so I don't gamble. - Wed Sep 30 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That was probably a wise action. - Wed Sep 30 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I believe he tried to kill me in Konoha when he brought the two-thousand. - Wed Sep 30 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That he only wants me to believe he wasn't trying to. - Wed Sep 30 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I believe he's tried setting up a 'lot' of things. - Wed Sep 30 20:53:07 2015

"It'll change my scent...-completely-? Permanently...?"* - Wed Sep 30 22:15:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. Eyes then wander, darting to and fro to make sure no one's nearby. With a shrug, she then strips. She wastes no time doing so either. There's little hesitation, because for all she knows, people are coming her way even now.

She makes her way to the opposent end of the tub even as she moves, to shield herself from Seisuke. Afterwords she crawls in and lets the women bathe her, or whatever. She allows them to be as thorough as needed. She's never going to see these people again anyway.

During the bath she requests her gauntlets be bathed too, so she can at least keep them with her. She'll never be able to wear them again, until she's strong enough to evade anyone Erebus sends after her. Even so, there may come a day when she can put them back on. If nothing else, they have sentimental value.* - Wed Sep 30 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) || "Aside from this? Nothing I'm not used to." she says as she's violated. She doesn't seem to care though. It's another woman and it's not personal, so she's not bothered.

"Zetsumo captured me when I was eleven. I've had to watch my back but...I'm not exactly spoiled. It was doable."

And eventually the bath is finished. The girl carefully makes her way out of the bath, not bothering to make sure Seisuke isn't looking. Naturally she's quick to dry off and get dressed afterwords. At that time she definitely 'does' eye him to make sure he's looking away.

And it doesn't take long. She's soon standing in a new outfit. One that the old her has never worn, of course. A new style completely, even. Her hair, two, is fixed up differently. Said hair has already been dyed before-hand, and she's put in colored contact lenses.* - Wed Sep 30 22:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) eyes the man's hands, blankly. Her arms are at the moment crossed, and her weight is shifted a bit.* - Wed Sep 30 22:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) takes the documents with a nod. "Thanks." she says, thoroughly examining them in the mean time. She has to be completely sure she knows all of the details here, so that she can act accordingly when questioned.

Lips twitch and she smiles a bit at the sight of her new family name. An unlikely coincidence.* - Wed Sep 30 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Don't care what happens to that man's daughter. I -owe- Zenaki, - Wed Sep 30 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 30 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) puts the papers away. In the mean time she places her washed gauntlets in a brand new bag as well, so she can keep them around.

Said bag is held in her left hand, and arms cross once more. She peers up at Seisuke.* - Wed Sep 30 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You know. . . - Wed Sep 30 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) stares at the hand.

"You should stop shaking peoples' hands. That's not even normal in this culture. I swear it's an act so you can eventually develop a related jutsu. I know because I've been considering the same thing myself. It may symbolize trust, but it's extremely and obviously rude anyway, because you're asking people to stick their neck out." she says.

"This'll be the last time I ever shake your hand."

Keiko reaches over with her right hand to shake Seisuke's own hand.* - Wed Sep 30 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: And only because you've helped me - Wed Sep 30 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Need to dye my gauntlets after this. Fuck having to deal with shit-faced grin hand-shakers. - Wed Sep 30 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) is watching the hand rather than anything else. After all, shaking hands legitimately isn't...normal, in Japanese culture. It's not something they do.

"Alright. Yeah...let me know if you need help too."

Presumably she's now taking her hand back. Both hands find her hips, and she stares up at him afterwords.

"I may not be a Gezo prince...or be rich, but I'm not too shabby as far as fighting and stuff goes."* - Wed Sep 30 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: More valuable than a few million yen that someone might pay you to kill me, that's for sure. - Wed Sep 30 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. Sunagakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Who's the friend? - Wed Sep 30 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Sergeant Muhhamed Hassan. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. He'd not recognize my ace. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Heard Fujitora's there...but I've also heard he's in Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fujitora -might- recognize me. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: He's in Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus gave me enemies I never should've had. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll try Sunagakure. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll have to be careful anyway, but yeah. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Stay save. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: safe* - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. You too. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'll see you later then. - Wed Sep 30 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe we can have that drink you owe me then. - Wed Sep 30 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then turns on her heel to wander off. Presumably Kilm, too, has already been taken care of as far as the new identity goes. Naturally she sends him a letter and they meet up before leaving the village.

They're gone within fifteen minutes though. Gotta keep moving, for now.* - Wed Sep 30 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Wed Sep 30 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) thought she was headed to Kirigakure. Apparently, though, she took a wrong turn somewhere. With a sigh, the girl turns and begins making her way back west. It'll be a 'really' long walk from here to Sunagakure. What a pain in the ass.

Hands meet to form the tiger seal. Occasionally, Keiko uses the shunshin no jutsu, pumping chakra throughout her body to do so. She does this for practice. She intends to some day master this technique so well that she can use it back-to-back. Why? Literally for out-running Erebus. Not out-running people in general. Not fighting. Just out-runnning that man in specific.* - Thu Oct  1 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) stops to rest somewhere. She's in an inn, in some unknown village. The girl wraps her arms around a pillow and hugs it close, curling up into a ball. Not due to stress or anything, though. No, she's very comfortable and relaxed. She's used to enduring terrible things so the matter of hiding from Erebus isn't all that stressful.

As long as she's not being held up in Amegakure as a not-so-clever plan of Erebus's to keep her out of his hair, she's quite satisfied. She's been given so much power, in having her identity changed. She's now free to do anything she wants. Of course, that's only if she has to skill and patience to get away with those things. Luckily for her, she does.

Once Keiko is fully rested, she resumes traveling.* - Thu Oct  1 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) is still traveling. Eventually, she stumbles upon Flexus's grave. A petty huge coincidence, but hey. It's on the side of the road. Why anyone would put it there is anyone's guess, but it's there.

With a shrug, the girl leaves flowers there. "Sorry." she murmurs. Afterwords, Keiko turns and gets back on the road. With her hair, eyes, and name changes..and new travel information granted to her, she has no reason to avoid said roads. The truth is, if she runs into anyone that's not Kenshin, she's probably fine. Even Erebus would struggle to actually kill her.* - Thu Oct  1 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) eventually stops to train. Literally just to train. Traveling gets boring, and she needs to make sure she stays sharp. With the mud silhouette jutsu, Keiko makes a wave of mud. With that done, she begins forming handseals.

At the end of this combination of seals, she sends chakra down into the mud below. Out of it rises a dragon's head made of the substance. A smug grin is on its face. Already its maw is open, and the entrance to its throat glows white. Moments later, it's unleashing the usual barrage of mudballs.

Hours of training pass before she resumes making her way to Sungakure.* - Thu Oct  1 03:29:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) slowly sets herself down on her back, with her head resting in her left palm. A faint frown is on her face. Lazily, she plants her hat on said face.* - Thu Oct  1 04:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Thu Oct  1 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to face the south. A single handseal is weaved, and she then takes a quick, sharp breath. Immediately she spits the breath out. It comes out as mud, as it's filled with her chakra. A huge river of it.

It hasn't occurred to her until now honestly but this is probably one of the best jutsus she has. She can do it without seals if she wants to. The mud spreads out, covering twenty feet easily and nearly instantly. Even then, it keeps going. A very literal...river.

Quickly Kat realizes that using her breath for this was a bad idea. With a shrug she begins moulding the earth present instead. Mud keeps picking up, until she's left with a trail of the substance that's sixty feet long and eight feet wide. Kat's hands part, and she gives her tenketsu time to cool off. Once they have, she reforms the same seals and continues practicing.* - Thu Oct  1 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) goes through the efforts needed to produce an earthen corridor. A massive one, twelve feet high and six times as wide. Once done, she rises to her feet and brushes her hands off. Hands then meet to form the tiger seal once more. Once more, Kat summons mud from her chakra.

This time she depends less on the earth already here and more just on her chakra. She needs to practice making mud from nothing. The girl can't always be lucky enough to be out-doors in a suitable terrain. This river races forwards, as fast as always. Eventually it crashes against Kat's corridor, very hard.

Even so, the structure doesn't even budge. The earthen corridor is a B rank technique. This one's only D rank. Take slowly takes in a breath. Hands part and come back together to repeat the tiger seal. 

She has to keep practicing until this wave is enough to push back even Erebus, or someone equally strong. She can't always be sure she'll be faster than her enemies. Sometimes she'll have to fight. If nothing else, there are definitely some people she wants to kill.

An awful lot of people. * - Thu Oct  1 17:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) continues training after discussing plans for Kilm. Her earthen corridor is still standing strong. She needs to at least see it shake to be satisfied. Once more she forms the handseal needed. Already she can feel her control over the Mud Silhouette jutsu getting a lot better.

Mud races forwards, ramming audibly into the corridor once more. The bangs come one at a time, echoing each other. Each time, Kat's corridor stands perfectly firm. It does make sense though. The structure is made of chakra reinforced stone.

How could mud ever break through that?

Hours pass.* - Thu Oct  1 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) || "Lu..." Keiko says to the disguised Kilm as she weaves through three handseals, just for the sake of practicing his new name. She has to get used to it. If they slip, it could mean death if Erebus's presumed bluffs are to be believed. Of course, she's no amateur like him. She'll find out for sure whether his words were true or not.

She only works with facts. He'd have done well to take her advice when it comes to that. "You sparred with Erebus. We know he's durable and faster than me. Do you know how physically strong he is?" Kat's mud dragon head begins slowly creeping out of the prepared mud.

Its face is soon revealed in full, complete with dripping fangs. "Or how fast his arms are? What elements he uses? What jutsus he knows?" The entrance to the dragon's throat glows white.

Mudballs come streaming out, speading forwards like bullets from a gun. Each one comes with a very loud, reverberating bang. All of these bangs are echoed twice over when they hit Keiko's earthen corridor. So many come forwards, that she'll probably struggle to hear Durn's response. When her dragon wears off she simply rests and creates another one.* - Thu Oct  1 17:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) kneels down. Both palms find the ground. At a lightning-fast pace, Kat pours chakra into the ground. It travels to underneath Kat's earthen corridor. Once there, it grasps at the earth. Four spikes are formed. 

Fast and hard, they're shoved forwards. Naturally, all four spikes break the second they hit the walls. That doesn't mean nothing happened, though. The corridor shakes. Echoes rattle wildly, being very loud.

Kat's palms rise up and then find the ground once more. Once more, she repeats this. The corridor is shaken over and over again, repeatedly. "You still don't know this jutsu, Lu? If not, It's the one I'll be training for the rest of the day. With this, you'd be pretty unstoppable."

Kat's corridor stands strong no matter how many times she hits it. The power of a B ranked jutsu that costs so much chakra. Again and again, she assaults it. Entire hours pass. Even after these hours, it's only been chipped in one or two different places. Not even an actual crack.* - Thu Oct  1 18:02:52 2015

After all. She's still not 100% sure she can trust Seisuke. She'll pretend she can, but...she has to be cautious. He's one of Erebus's allies after all. Talking to him was a gamble from the start. A desperate one.* - Thu Oct  1 18:51:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) continues facing Durn. She's mindful of all things in her peripheral vision at all times. Arms rise and hands meet to form the tiger seal. "This jutsu requires only one handseal. The tiger seal."

Keiko begins manipulating her chakra and sending it into the ground. She takes her time and is lazy since she's not training it. She's only teaching it to her comrade.  Slowly, mud begins forming. After some small amount of time, it even begins hovering. 

It's collected into the air, spore of mud by spore of mud....spores being the namesake of the jutsus's alternate name. Once all are collected, Keiko wills them to race forwards. The  mud slams very hard against the ground. It releases a loud and reverberating bang when it hits it. The ground doesn't exactly shake, but it's clear that Keiko's ninjutsu prowess is respectable at least.

At a lightning-fast pace it races forwards. It's about twelve feet wide. It produces quite a bit of noise even as it travels. The range, especially, is absolutely ridiculous. It's possibly the longest-ranged jutsu in Keiko's arsenal, even. Eventually, sixty full feet are covered.

The teen keeps going though. She needs to show Durn this jutsu's -full- potential. He has to know exactly what its capabilties are so that he knows how far he has to train it. Having mastered this technique, Keiko is finally capable of showing him that potential. Eventually the mud has gone so far that one can't even see the end of it.

The girl's hands part, and the mud's force is reduced. It keeps flowing for a while, though it slows down. Without Keiko pouring chakra into it, it carries less force. Eventually, it's stopped. "Your turn." the missing-nin says. "Continue watching my back while you train. I'll be here to feed you advice. Not that you'll likely need it as fast as you learn."* - Thu Oct  1 19:00:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) Keiko notes the mouth opening and his breathing. The girl glances down at said mouth. Should she see any strength things or experience strange sensations, she's already planning Kai well in advance. The moment he tries genjutsu, she's ready for it. Prepared. 

It's the one thing she always watching for. Everything else is pretty obvious. She doesn't need to remind herself. But genjutsu? She's come too close to dying to it too often. 

And if she's watching for it actively, then good fucking luck catching her in it. With a nod, Keiko sprints forwards. She'd close in on Durn nearly instantly. As she does so, eyes watch his arms and legs. She's prepared for kicks or punches. Either one.

Her right fist flies forwards as she comes skidding to a stop. A rock-hard gauntlet punch is aimed for his diadem. The part of his chest that's particularly vulnerable. Kat's aware that he can take the damage. Even so, she aims for this place in particular to hopefully at least make him wince.* - Thu Oct  1 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) || Durn's arms are slow. And so, when Keiko sees them moving, she's already darting off in the opposite direction to evade them. As she does so, she turns in place and aims to sprint towards Kilm from the side. An arm his held out with an open palm. The girl would go so far as to touch him with said palm.

Why? To remind him that if she were using Exploding Palm, he'd be sent flying right now. They should've have agreed on literally "no" ninjutsu -- as Keiko had actually forgotten about this one -- but they did. With that done, the girl uses her legs to throw herself backwards. She's flipping into an entirely ground-based somersault as she does this.

She travels for only eight feet or so before coming to a stop, having done only one somersault in the process.

"...I should really..." she says as she watches his movements.
"Be using exploding palm."* - Thu Oct  1 19:50:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) shrugs as she steps to the side, still staying on the move as she watches Durn's arm. He may be sprinting even while he punches, but Keiko can still evade him by reflexes alone. Combined with her similar speed, she's capable of evading his punch. "We have to make sure Seisuke stays happy though. If he really is our ally, we need him. . . to not feel like he should betray us. In the mean time I'm spilling Erebus's plans to the entire world. Every kage. Every notable person. We'll make sure he's so distracted by his new enemies that he doesn't have time to focus on us."

Keiko forces herself into another somersault as she speaks. When her hands touch the ground, she comes to a stop into a crouch. From the moment her hands met the earth, she's sending chakra into the ground. It moves at a lightning-fast pace, and it finds the ground underneath Durn. Once there it forms four massive spikes.

All of them fly forwards, aiming to pin Durn from all directions.

If nothing else, it should slow her down.

"Erebus said he didn't fear me." she says, her expression perfectly blank despite her words. Always, she makes sure not to get cocky. She paid for that once, and nearly died for it. Staying humble ensures she's wise and cautious enough. It ensures she's never caught off-guard.

"He should have." she finishes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow, slowly rising into a straight standing position. Eyes scan the horizon behind Durn as she speaks, and magnetic sensing watches the ground.

"You think so...?" she inquires.* - Thu Oct  1 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit I was thinking the same thing. - Thu Oct  1 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) says: I try to avoid looking paranoid but....you're right. Now that we've realized this could be a trap...we should've left this morning. - Thu Oct  1 20:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Concealed Figure**(Shimizu3598) nods and turns to face the south. Palms meet the ground, and it turns to liquid. Gravity pulls her under immediately. And immediately, Keiko begins swimming, allowing the earth to shift back to earth behind her. The teen puts herself one-hundred feet beneath the surface and keeps moving.

Her scent is left untracable at least from this location. Perhaps it'll throw Seisuke's nose off if the former figurehead hokage's hunch is correct. Keiko intends to swim for...the rest of her journies in general. Her chakra may be stressed but not by much even remotely. She has enormous amounts, and since Kilm taught her this jutsu personally, Keiko uses little to no chakra for it at all.

She'll be able to use it at least until they're out of Sunagakure territory entirely. And then? She'll simply....rest, until she can use it again. With her knowing now that Seisuke may be abusing the chemicals for a new scent for tracking her, Keiko needs....to make sure he can't potentially do that, no matter what precautions are needed.

It's true that paranoia will end the girl eventually if shes not careful, but all of this...is temporary. One day, she and Durn will be strong enough to face the world will less caution. Righrt now, with so many supposed enemies according to Erebus...and so many confirmed enemies, they can't afford to relax too much.* - Thu Oct  1 20:18:33 2015
