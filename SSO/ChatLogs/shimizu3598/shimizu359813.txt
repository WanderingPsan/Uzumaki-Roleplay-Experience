<br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good. I half expect people to see kage robes and attack me. - Tue Sep 22 12:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dunno if it's smart to wear them or not. - Tue Sep 22 12:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts on her hat.* - Tue Sep 22 12:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You look nice in that outfit. - Tue Sep 22 12:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) begins walking. A faint, cheeky smile is produced in response to Kilm's comment.

"Mhmm..." she coos.* - Tue Sep 22 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: So where are we headed - Tue Sep 22 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: You'll see when we get there. - Tue Sep 22 12:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) thinks: Although a village having a kage as weak as me is...shameful. - Tue Sep 22 12:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: -- Remember. I need you two to not mention what the seals on my body are for while we're out. - Tue Sep 22 12:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Gotcha. - Tue Sep 22 12:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..It's postponed.. - Tue Sep 22 12:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Tue Sep 22 12:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Idiocy is contagious in Kirigakure. - Tue Sep 22 12:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I will talk him into meeting you here. - Tue Sep 22 12:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Or in a neutral place. - Tue Sep 22 12:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 12:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) removes her had, having only put it on to discourage people being brave enough to attack her while she travels.* - Tue Sep 22 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The clothing fits you. - Tue Sep 22 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Glad to see you wearing it. - Tue Sep 22 12:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Tue Sep 22 12:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What led to it being postponed, though? - Tue Sep 22 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Not that I mind. - Tue Sep 22 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: His lack of understanding. - Tue Sep 22 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did you let him know what my seals do? - Tue Sep 22 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or -- was he just not skilled enough? - Tue Sep 22 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Let us progress forward though.. - Tue Sep 22 12:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: We'll wait for him there. - Tue Sep 22 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: In Kirigakure? - Tue Sep 22 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Correct - Tue Sep 22 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She turns and begins walking to the south, putting her hat back on.* - Tue Sep 22 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Also, he lack of understanding about the stakes at hand. - Tue Sep 22 12:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: We shouldn't tell him what the seals do, since...that might discourage him. - Tue Sep 22 12:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I'll lie and tell him they keep me from saying what they do. - Tue Sep 22 12:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Here she is, Fujitora of the Sand. - Tue Sep 22 12:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... - Tue Sep 22 12:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) glances back and forth between the two of him, having been unsure who Fujitora was or what he looks like. A hand rests on a hip since she has no pockets, and her weight shifts a bit. The teen's expression is a neutral but good-humored one.+
* - Tue Sep 22 12:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) thinks: Zenaki. . . - Tue Sep 22 12:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: We'll have to stick around for a bit probably. - Tue Sep 22 12:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: You'll be fixing me, then? - Tue Sep 22 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) is careful not to say "unsealing."* - Tue Sep 22 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: How did they know of my fuuin, the world will never know. - Tue Sep 22 12:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: We'll wait for Suitengu. - Tue Sep 22 12:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) nods. Eyes wander off. The teen then reaches up with both arms to begin carefully removing her gauntlets. It's a lengthy process due to them being strapped on and all. Once her hands are free she offers Kilm the weapons, to hold them.

She then walks forwards, at a lazy pace. Both arms rise and palms are shown to him. Her tongue leaves her mouth as well, to show him there are three in all.* - Tue Sep 22 12:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Tue Sep 22 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: What's all this about..? - Tue Sep 22 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: -- I only brought some friends as escorts for the journey here. - Tue Sep 22 12:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I forgot to have them wait outside. - Tue Sep 22 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: One of your friends is a wanted outlaw here. - Tue Sep 22 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Is that so...? - Tue Sep 22 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Yes. - Tue Sep 22 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Tue Sep 22 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My affairs with Kirigakure has nothing to do with this. - Tue Sep 22 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll take my arrest once the Hokage is done and gone.. - Tue Sep 22 12:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It does, you're not even supposed to be here Erebus. - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..You don't seem to understand.. - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I said... - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I will take my arrest.. - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: When the Hokage.. - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Is done.. - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: And. - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Gone. - Tue Sep 22 12:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Mhm, Well see. - Tue Sep 22 12:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: He's next, my lord. - Tue Sep 22 12:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) doesn't comment. She's eying Fujitora, blankly.* - Tue Sep 22 12:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: Erebus . . . what are you doing? - Tue Sep 22 12:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (This seal) - Tue Sep 22 13:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: )Was put here by Noriko, so ICly u might recognize it) - Tue Sep 22 13:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (If she ever showed u her root seal) - Tue Sep 22 13:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. . . - Tue Sep 22 13:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) follows him to a private area, showing no anxiety whatsoever.

Briefly she glances over at the man's clone. Suddenly it's clear why he was so bold before.* - Tue Sep 22 13:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: (what does the seal restrict?) - Tue Sep 22 13:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (Kat from discussing the meeting between Noriko and Orakuru, and herself) - Tue Sep 22 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (Although idk if u'd be able to see that ICly) - Tue Sep 22 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (it also keeps her from discussing anything she sees in Kirigakure) - Tue Sep 22 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (or has seen, such as terrain or people) - Tue Sep 22 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (You'd probably know it keeps her from speaking or writing about certain things, or hand language, etc) - Tue Sep 22 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) whispers: (Idk if you'd know more) - Tue Sep 22 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) whispers: (He wouldn't determine the exact restriction, but he'd be able untwine the seal and breaking it.) - Tue Sep 22 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: (pretty much) - Tue Sep 22 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fujitora, may I come alongside you? - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: My friends can wait here. - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I'll come alone. - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: That was towards another..Continue. - Tue Sep 22 13:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) nods and follows.* - Tue Sep 22 13:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) watches Fujitora do his work, withdrawing her tongue for the moment as she speaks. She's presumably sitting down at the moment with one leg crossed over the other.

"Admittedly I don't know what you're talking about." she says. "Must be something the council has planned. I'm also afraid I can't tell you what these seals do. They keep me from explaining it."* - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I will say, though. These seals? - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: They're entirely responsible for the war. - Tue Sep 22 13:16:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: These seals are responsible for the death of my lover, and one of my closest friends. - Tue Sep 22 13:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Orakuru, and Kitora. - Tue Sep 22 13:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not in a hurry to watch anyone else die any time soon. - Tue Sep 22 13:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: -- Not unless it's for a great reason. - Tue Sep 22 13:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I fought for Zetsumo because he forced me to. I'm not sure if you're aware or not that nearly all of us were slaves. - Tue Sep 22 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Orakuru and Kitora hm?...I knew the two..But I was not. - Tue Sep 22 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I figured you all had some form of bloodlust. - Tue Sep 22 13:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I'll be honest with you. . . - Tue Sep 22 13:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo gave me something called "mental fortitude training." - Tue Sep 22 13:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not sure I want to elaborate. - Tue Sep 22 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I was in fact a slave though. - Tue Sep 22 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: This is what made most not so afraid of death? - Tue Sep 22 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: It did...something else. - Tue Sep 22 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Not quite that. - Tue Sep 22 13:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well...That's as much as I need to hear...But you are free now.. - Tue Sep 22 13:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) nods. She takes her hands back and takes a moment to examine her palms, and tongue -- the tongue being a very difficult thing to examine.* - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) || Are they clean and without seals visible, now?* - Tue Sep 22 13:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Heh, now that my own shinobi business is quite over...I think I'll return to my birthplace Ame.. - Tue Sep 22 13:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Thank you very much for this though. - Tue Sep 22 13:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: If you'd like, I can tell you about the seals now. - Tue Sep 22 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: No need. You may go back to your friends, with how long we've been here, you and them are probably growing impatient. - Tue Sep 22 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: True. Alright. - Tue Sep 22 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) nods. She then turns to wander off.* - Tue Sep 22 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) holds her hand out to Kilm, with eyes on the scene in front of her.

She's requesting her gauntlets.* - Tue Sep 22 13:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: Katsune . . . - Tue Sep 22 13:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) || Her palm is also bare. It's apparent she's been unsealed.* - Tue Sep 22 13:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: What is happening. - Tue Sep 22 13:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) fastens them into place, with some quiet snaps heard.* - Tue Sep 22 13:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Know this Erebus. - Tue Sep 22 13:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You do this and you will probably become an S-ranked criminal. - Tue Sep 22 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) eyes Shin. Is he doing something? A stance, or anything?* - Tue Sep 22 13:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel, having taken all the time she needs to consider the situation. The girl begins walking away, at a lazy pace. "Our business is done here, Konoha." she says, addressing her shinobi specifically.

"What that man does isn't any concern of ours."* - Tue Sep 22 13:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Hassan...Should I intervene? I heard this man is immortal. - Tue Sep 22 14:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Thank god Kat isn't grumpy like she used to be in Amegakure. - Tue Sep 22 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: We're coming back for Suitengo and Zenaki. - Tue Sep 22 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: We just don't want to draw unwanted attention to ourselves or the Leaf right now. - Tue Sep 22 14:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus did say he'd fight after we were done and gone. That's why we left. - Tue Sep 22 14:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: I assume he has a plan. - Tue Sep 22 14:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) is thankfully much faster than Kilm and Shin. As such, she can afford to be very reckless right now. Arms rise and hands meet as they travel. The lolikage forms the tiger handseal. Abruptly, she shoves chakra into her nervous system in a way that stimulates it.

The shunshin jutsu. Katsune had been walking up until now, but the moment she feels her nerves stimulated, she darts forwards, sprinting. The girl moves as a blur to maybe Kilm's eyes, and seemingly instantaneously to anyone else's. When she's stopped moving, Kat abruptly falls into a kneeling position -- thankfully, possibly, half a damned mile away from her comrades now due to her speed. The girl's face is yellow, and a palm finds her gut. Briefly, she heaves.

She does her best to not throw up.* - Tue Sep 22 14:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) gives no fucks cause she doesn't afraid of anything that isn't Zetsumo, Kenshin, or Hassan.* - Tue Sep 22 14:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) sighs, picking herself up off of the ground. Her body trembles, and the teen forms the same seal again. Lazily, she takes a moment to crack her neck, once to the left and then to the right. This jutsu makes her body ache. Once more, though, she pours chakra into her body's nerves and muscles.

Abruptly, the kage sprints forwards once more, turning to the left or right as needed while using shunshin to evade trees. She has little to no tunnel vision presumably, due to her eyes. Once more, she eventually comes skidding to a stop. Once more, she's kneeling down and doing her best to not throw up. Her left hand finds her hat and she pulls it downwards to cover her face, to hide the disgraceful appearance.* - Tue Sep 22 14:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(Shimizu3598) says: Goin' to the mansion. - Tue Sep 22 14:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls a scroll off of her shelf before sitting down. The girl is unrolling it and pulling out a pen shortly afterwords, as she speaks, and writes.

"I do hope he comes back alive." she says.
"Only left because he implied we should."* - Tue Sep 22 14:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We would've stayed for them, but. . . - Tue Sep 22 14:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Erebus got dragged into that. - Tue Sep 22 14:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I got the feeling if we stayed, people would see the conflict as a Konoha conflict, rather than a normal one. - Tue Sep 22 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or rather, be tense because we were there. - Tue Sep 22 14:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That'd be...what? An act of war? - Tue Sep 22 14:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We still gotta get more funds. - Tue Sep 22 14:33:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Negotiatable. - Tue Sep 22 16:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Sounds like a gift. Or a test. - Tue Sep 22 16:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Five hundred would be nice. Of course, if say. . . - Tue Sep 22 16:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He was never here. - Tue Sep 22 17:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way, one week on the job and this is already exhausting. - Tue Sep 22 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm gonna go take a nap. - Tue Sep 22 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises to her feet and wanders off.* - Tue Sep 22 17:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: r-rest well - Tue Sep 22 17:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hi. - Tue Sep 22 17:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off.* - Tue Sep 22 18:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) scales the wall to the east of the hokage mansion. Once standing on top of it, the girl casually skates down the side of it, using Suimen. Before hitting the ground, Kat leaps ahead. Feet come skidding across the grass. The girl then picks her feet up one at a time and shakes them around just a little bit.

They hurt, from the fall, and they're a bit dirty. Arms then rise and hands meet to form the tiger seal. The kage -- very much temporarily as she now knows -- begins slowly channeling chakra throughout her body. Sharply and quietly, with a smile on her face, she draws in a deep breath. Already she knows this is gonna hurt. A lot.

Even so, and even with the recent inferred news, she's in a good mood. A 'great' mood. Finally she's free to make her own choices and use her own ideas. The world is now a playground. Abruptly she sprints forwards, sharply shoving chakra where it needs to be at.

The shunshin technique. Something she intends to master, and very soon too. She moves as a blur, not bothering to mask her movement with a smokescreen. The only use for a smokescreen would be to keep people from knowing what direction she's moving in, and that doesn't seem like it'll ever be useful for what she intends to use this technique for. The area Kat's chosen proves to be an obstacle cours, too.

Trees. Enormous amounts of trees as far as the eye can see. The trademark of Konoha. All of them are packed close together, making it difficult to maneuver at ridiculous speeds. Earlier today when Kat trained her technique, she'd noticed something. She'd come dangerously close to ramming herself face-first into a tree. As such, that's how she chooses to train herself. Controlling her movements with percision and ease while sprinting with shunshin.* - Tue Sep 22 19:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) narrowly avoids the mentioned trees, having chosen the easiest path available. She's not looking to kill herself, after all. Literaly all she'd challenged herself to do was sidestep by a foot or so in either direction, occasionally. When the kage's feet come skidding to a stop, she's kneeling down in the same motion. Collapsing.

Immediately her left palm finds her gut, and her right palm her face. The teen's face turns green, and she'd gagged a bit. Sharp, quick breaths are taken. Eyes close. Kat's head swims, and she sways a bit. * - Tue Sep 22 20:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's right pinky finds her ear to begin cleaning it out. The teen's eyes are a bit red and droopy. A frown is on her face. She looks sleepy. Soon, her left hand finds the back of her head to rub at her hair.

With that, she turns around and walks away, to get coffee. Paine's got this.* - Tue Sep 22 23:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) kneels down in front of the expanse ahead of her. Palms meet the ground, and Kat pours chakra into the ground. Naturally it moves at a lightning-fast pace. Upon reaching its target -- a tree in the distance -- the ground shifts and stirs. Abruptly, four large earth spikes come flying out.

The sound produced is similar to a sword being violently ripped from a metal sheathe. Suddenly, the mentioned tree is impaled. Immediately it shakes, violently. The tree cries out as its wood is split, basically screaming as leaves rain down onto the ground below. It's not quite toppled, though.

The teen hasn't become quite that powerful just yet, unfortunately. Without removing her hands from the ground, the lolikage sends chakra elsewhere -- to a nearby tree. Aiming to spam the jutsu as quickly as possible, Kat impales yet another tree once her tenketsu cool off. After a full two second's time, Kat does the exact same thing again but from different angles. This time, the tree does slowly fall off to the side before crashing into another.* - Wed Sep 23 00:19:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He's a bit. . .pretentious. When he talked about painting the world red, he was testing me. - Wed Sep 23 08:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sips at her coffee, very slowly, with elbows resting on the table. Eyes wander for a very long while.

Yes. A shinonbi is drinking coffee.* - Wed Sep 23 09:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What form of agreement was established? - Wed Sep 23 09:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: In exchange of? - Wed Sep 23 09:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It seemed implied that we'll protect them if anyone attacks them while they're here. - Wed Sep 23 09:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds reasonable as long as it's not Kenshin or anything attacking. - Wed Sep 23 09:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He wanted to see how low I was willing to go. - Wed Sep 23 09:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll just squeeze more out of him later. - Wed Sep 23 09:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: They're loyal to no specific person, but whoever has the most cash. - Wed Sep 23 09:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: That's why I suggested only getting five hundred for the time being. - Wed Sep 23 09:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That might not be me. Seisuke's a prince. Although, I guess you're right. We'll be giving them regular pay checks and a happy community. - Wed Sep 23 09:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. They should be able to feel like in home. - Wed Sep 23 09:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Made sure to pay them off, just in case an emergency came up and we needed to spend off the remaining village funds. - Wed Sep 23 09:22:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can't fathom. - Wed Sep 23 09:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: How're you?\ - Wed Sep 23 09:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The teen then rises to her feet. Casually she pulls her robes off, with one stroke, leaving herself in her usual purple body suit. At a lazy pace she then turns and wanders over to a drawer behind her. The robes are stuffed inside and the compartment is locked.

Kat then turns around and makes her way over to Seisuke, and then past him, heading for the door.

"Guess I owe you a drink then." she says.* - Wed Sep 23 09:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off.* - Wed Sep 23 09:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) comes to a stop. Eyes wander. The girl's left hand finds her hip and her weight shifts a bit.

"On second thought. . ." she says.

"I've got better things to do."

With that, she turns and wanders off.* - Wed Sep 23 09:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Something wrong? - Wed Sep 23 09:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is soon out of range for any comfortable volume.* - Wed Sep 23 09:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I just wanted to negotiate with that man. - Wed Sep 23 11:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I took my robes off so he'd be caught off-guard. - Wed Sep 23 11:44:38 2015
