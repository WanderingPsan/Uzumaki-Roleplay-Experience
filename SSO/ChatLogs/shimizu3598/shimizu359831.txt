<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sat Oct 10 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: To do the jutsu . . . You gotta use your earth chakra to lighten the air around you as well as your own body. - Sat Oct 10 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It will increase your speed but make you weaker in terms of durability and strength. - Sat Oct 10 21:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods in response to Kilm's instructions. It's a seal that's used too often, but Kat forms the tiger seal. It's the handseal most commonly associated with earth release. As such, it's her hope that it'll help her grasp the concept of this jutsu easily. Manipulating gravity; not something she'd have ever imagined earth release to be capable of.

Kat begins walking off to the south. She moves ten feet away and then sits down. Carefully she focuses on the idea. Immediately her mind goes to the Hiding Like a Mole jutsu. That technique allows one to sense things by way of gravitational forces.

As such, she should probably keep that feeling in mind. The feeling of the gravity feeding her information.* - Sat Oct 10 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes close and she takes in a slow, deep breath. No doubt, this is a B or even A ranked jutsu. She's aware it'll be exceedingly difficult.

Flight? Even immortality is comparable. The ability to fly out of anyone's reach, throw ginormous boulders, and chase annoying sand manipulators that fly; it shouldn't be underestimated, that's for sure.  Probably hours pass. This isn't something she can learn in a single day, even with her extensive earth training and Kilm's guidance.

Eventually, dirt near Kat begins stirring. It shifts and stirs, and slides around. The movements are very subtle, as if blown by a human's breath. Only a grain or two even budges. And already, it stresses Kat's chakra. 

She has to take more breaths just to keep herself from getting frustrated and thus impatient. The more calm she can remain, the faster she'll learn this jutsu. Eventually it dawns on the girl that Kilm wasn't able to fly at first. He was only lifting heavy objects, so Kat rises to her feet with a sigh. Eyes wander to search the area.

First, she'll start by practicing on large stones. Heavy stones. She finds such a rock and lazily makes her way over to it. Upon reaching it, Kat sits down. The specimen is roughly sixty pounds.

For a shinobi it's maybe managable? Even so, it'll be a struggle. Kat reaches over to place both palms on it. She concentrates, sending earth release chakra forwards. Little to nothing happens.

Even so, Kat dares to go ahead and pick it up. The teen uses only her normal strength. As a kunoichi, it's barely managable. Arms tremble as she pulls it into her lap. She breathes carefully in the process so as not to straight herself.

Once it's in place, she takes the time to carefully fit her arms up underneath it. The weight is absorbed mostly by her gauntlets, protecting her own limbs.

Hours pass, but no progress is made. With a sigh and a shrug, Kat goes home to sleep. Kilm allows this. Even two days or so fly by, with Kilm showing an awful lot of patience with the relatively slow girl; at least in terms of learning jutsus. Few compare to him in that regard.

By now, she's feeling some progress being made. Or at least, she thinks so. She feels 'something' when she sends forth earth chakra. It's a numbing feeling, as if something's suckling at her skin. Something unusual.

Even a strand of hair or two eventually rises up. More hours pass. By the end of the third day, Kat's managed to reduce the weight of the stone by some amount. Upon feeling like this is true, Kat tests it. She slowly lifts it up in her arms.

The teen curls her arms, pulling it close to her chest. Afterwords she slowly sets it back down in her lap. Many more repitions of this exercise are done, just so she can be sure that she can maintain the effects of the jutsu. More days pass, and eventually Kat's capable of barely lifting the stone with a single arm. "Just think, Kilm." she chimes out.

"When I master this jutsu, I'll be able to throw boulders at your nuts." She smiles a bit. Kat rises to her feet. After another night in bed, Kat opts for a new exercise. Her stones now weigh little to nothing. 

As such, she picks them up fairly lightly. Slowly she slides her right foot backwards. Her right arm is drawn back behind her form. The palm faces the sky. With that, she then launches her weapon forwards into the desert.

With a loud thump, it touches down ten feet away. The girl sighs and reaches down to collect another one. She takes a step or two backwards. If she's gonna have to use these for training, it occurs to her that she'd better keep them close to each other for convenience's sake. And so, using the jutsu, she launches another stone.

It lands close to the last, and even audibly chips against its side.* - Sat Oct 10 22:01:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is gonna be a pain. - Sat Oct 10 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lies down on her back with a sigh. The girl reaches over for two of the stones she'd been using before. With that, she begins lifting them both with her two arms.

Slowly and carefully, Kat pulls them close to her chest. A deep breath is drawn in through the nose, silently. She needs to keep her blood pressure low of course. Every shinobi knows that. Kat then slowly pushes them away.

She's using the jutsu the entire time too of course. Or at least, what knowledge of it she has. These stones still aren't very heavy even for her normal muscles. In fact, said muscles are doing half of the work. She doesn't yet know enough of this jutsu to even be considered a practitioner of it just yet.* - Sat Oct 10 22:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm too sleepy to train. - Sat Oct 10 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Eventually, Kat's stones are too light for practice. She's officially learned the technique; that's for sure. Now it's time to master it. Learning how to fly is ugent. The advantage it'll give her over enemies that want to kill her is too great for her to risk slacking now.

Kat sways one arm to the side. With a soft and silent grunt, she then throws the stone away. The other one follows suit. After rising to her feet the teen begins walking around. Eyes wander the terrain in search of heavier stones.

Eventually she finds one of a suitable size. It's half as big as she is. The girl shakes her head. Already she knows this is gonna hurt. A lot. Her chakra circuits, her back, muscles, and potential blood pressure issues -- it's gonna hurt.

At a lazy pace she approaches it. Both palms move out to rest against its side. Carefully her chakra is sent forwards. Invisibly it surrounds the target before she begins turning it into earth release chakra. She's already capable of reducing the rock's weight. 

Kat needs, however, to reduce the weight of this stone by much more than what she did for the others. It's simply far too heavy otherwise. Kat's muscles are too weak. Hours pass, and her hair is picked up. It flows to and fro, as if blown by wind.

More chakra is sent to her palms to make use of Suimen. This secures her grip on the stone. Suimen isn't technically a jutsu so presumably she can do this with no trouble whatsoever. Gently she pulls at her arms, testing the rock's weight. It doesn't even budge, of course.

With a soft sigh, Kat pushes against it only with her arms. As a result, her feet slowly slide backwards through the dirt. That of course is her intention though. Eventually her feet are planted some three feet or so away. With that, Kat begins pushing. 

She uses both arms and legs, all while still using her jutsu. At first, the hardened and heavy earth only slides through the dirt. Dirt is shifted throughout the course of its movement. Soon, the teen is forced to use suimen on her feet as well. As such, this becomes a lot easier.

The stone slides across much more smoothly, and with little effort. Using all four of her limbs as well as the Lightweight Rock Technique, simply pushing the stone is child's play. Both palms move to begin rolling her practice dummy. After roughly half a minute, it becomes clear this isn't happening. With a shrug, Kat moves her palms closer to the bottom of it.

Once more she attempts to roll it. This time she proves successful. Stone grinds against dirt as it begins rolling, producing a rather loud noise. Kat's arms and legs tremble. She makes progress, though, Ten whole feet of it.* - Sat Oct 10 23:00:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way over to the nearest tree. The light-weight rock technique is stupidly hard to master. As such, the teen has decided to spend her time on something else. Her right foot slides backwards through the dirt and both arms rise up. Hands clench partially as if to mimic claws.

With that, the girl attempts to pour earth-release chakra into her gauntlets. Little to nothing happens. She can feel her chakra seeping out of her flesh and she can sense it too. She can't, however, see any changes in her gauntlet. A glance is sent towards the weapon.

It's a chakra flow weapon so it shouldn't be that difficult for her to see at least some reaction to her chakra. Presumably she'll start to see signs of the jutsu working way before it's actually mastered. With a silent sigh, the girl opts to simply throw a punch at her tree. If nothing else, the punching should test her ability to concentrate. She should also be able to tell whether or not her gauntlets are resisting more shock than usual.

For her first punch, she feels nothing. The tree of course doesn't budge. Even the bark is relatively unharmed. Maybe a single flake or so falls lose, but nothing dramatic. Kat's physical strength is a joke.

Her knuckles are spared any harm thanks to her gauntlets. Otherwise, the tree would probably do far more damage to her than she does to it. Due to her punch, Kat's concentration is broken. The chakra she'd been sending into her gauntlet is sent recoiling back into her chakra circuits. While drawing in a silent breath, Kat takes her arm back.* - Sun Oct 11 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) can definitely see some changes in her gauntlet after an hour or so of practice. She's good with earth release and has extensive training in that area so it doesn't take 'that' long. The color of her gauntlet has noticably shifted. With a quick glance at the opposite gauntlet she can confirm this. When she puts her gauntlets next to each other, there's no question whatsoever.

With a nod and a silent sigh, the girl then goes back to her training. Once more she attempts to ram her fist into the mentioned tree. This time, her concentration isn't broken. The gauntlet remains the same color. She does however notice little to no difference in the amount of damage she's producing.* - Sun Oct 11 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel with a sigh. She takes a few steps to the south and forms another handseal. This time the tiger seal. It's a seal that can be used for shadow clone jutsu and is also the most common seal used for earth release techniques. Thus, logically, this handseal in particular should help her more than any other when it comes to using the earth clone jutsu.

With little to no practice needed, thanks to the scroll's guidance, Kat's able to cause the earth in front of her to shift. Just the dirt. Some of it hovers up into the air before gently falling back down to the ground below. With more effort applied, Kat manages to force it to take on a slightly more wet nature. 

Mud. Only a few grains of the subtance are shifted, however. Lazily, Kat takes a moment then to crack her knuckles. This is gonna be a chore, it seems. Hands rise once more. This time she rams the appendages together into the tiger seal. With a quiet huff, Kat shoves enormous amounts of chakra into the ground.

The dirt leaps up abruptly, as if Kat had kicked it. Afterwords, her chakra is rammed back and forth into the dirt. Dirt is stirred up a bit more violently than before. Kat proceeds in this manner, as if beating the dirt up will cause it to work harder for her. Time passes, and the girl manages a bit more success than before.

She forces dirt to stir once more. It turns to mud as she works. Slowly, it forms a mound. Within several long minutes of work, Kat's managed even to make it take on the shape of a human head. 'Her' head specifically.

A silent sigh is produced. Kat's hands part and ram together one final time. With that, the dirt leaps up. The head this time is formed far more quickly than before. It begins to shift in color. Its face because -almost- caucasion.* - Sun Oct 11 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her butt in the dirt. Legs are left sprawled out underneath her form and she takes a long, silent, and deep breath. This jutsu is going to be more difficult to learn than she expected. Once more she ends chakra into the ground. Dirt moves as she wills it to.

It sways to and fro, as if unstable. Slowly it once more takes on the shape of Kat's face. She ignores color and whatnot for now. The most important thing is that her clone can fight. It looking like her is only a bonus.

Should she master this technique, she has little doubt she'll be literally twice as strong. By using a clone as a conduit for her landmine fist, she'll become that much more lethal. Add into the mix that her clones can use that jutsu as well, and she becomes a nightmare for most people. Still ignoring appearaces, Kat attempts to move her clone as if it's a puppet. Its mouth is forced to slowly open.

The clone's lips tremble as it opens them. Shortly afterwords, Kat bids it to close said mouth. Upon realizing that it has no teeth, she carefully adds some. They drip constantly with mud, but they're there. The teen glances back down at her open scroll for this technique.

The advice there guides her, and so she tries moving her chakra in different ways. Making it shift to earth and moving it about is one thing. For this jutsu though there are very specific instructions. A very specific manner in which you're meant to move it. You have to give the clone not only your shape and appearance, and ability to fight, but its own consciousness as well.

That involves an awful lot of work. The clone forms arms. Said arms swing about a bit roughly and clumbsily as Kat wills them to. Eventually she has its palms meet the ground. The clone pushes at the dirt, attempting to rise up out of the ground.

Little happens. Its arms tremble and it gasps out. Its head contorts to and fro in awkward and unnatural motions. The clone groans. Kat bites her cheek.* - Sun Oct 11 02:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: How observant. - Sun Oct 11 03:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Hey Kat-sensei. - Sun Oct 11 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches up to place her left palm on the nearest tree. The teen's right leg then slides backwards through the dirt. Very blankly, she stares ahead at the plant. The look in her eyes is a very dull one. Training, all day every day. 

It's all she ever does. On the one hand, her ability to do tedious things endlessly is becoming much better, and very clearly too. On the other, she's left very dull. The girl vows to kill everything that ever lived once she finally masters all of her jutsus. Earth release chakra is poured forwards into her tree.

Katsune does her best to alter its gravity. Naturally she succeeds to at least some extent. The tree becomes lighter. Naturally it remains right where it is. With that, Kat then clenches her hand into a fist and launches it forwards. 

As hard as she can manage, she punches it. Kat isn't using this jutsu on herself right now. As such, her arm is at its full strength. The tree as a result rocks to and fro. It doesn't produce an absurdly loud bang as you might expect. 

That'd happen if one had enormous amounts of physical strength but Kat is simply altering her target's weight. The girl glances over at Cypher. "Hey." she says. Her hand is clenched much tighter. Roughly she throws the fist at her tree once more.

Her expression remains fairly blank.* - Sun Oct 11 03:02:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. She frowns, and stares.

It's a cold stare.* - Sun Oct 11 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a few lazy step forwards. As she does so, her hands are rising and meeting to form the tiger handseal. "First lesson." she says as she comes into point blank range, if allowed.

Abruptly even as she draws near, the teen shoves raiton chakra throughout her form. It cloaks her entirely and produces a very loud, crackling bang. The jutsu extends to six feet or so of range in all directions.

Considering Kat's ninjutsu prowess and Cypher's lack of durability, he's likely hurt at least a little bit.

"This one's called Raiton Flash." she says.* - Sun Oct 11 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) tilts her head a bit. She stares. Senses focus on the boy.

She can't be sure whether she caused pain or not. It's tempting to shock him again, but she wouldn't want to accidentally kill him so she can only stare.

Disappointment is apparent.* - Sun Oct 11 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Outside the village then." she says.

The girl then turns on her heel and begins leading the way to her training grounds.* - Sun Oct 11 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way over to a tree. It's of similar size and of course weight compared to the one she'd been using in the village. This way it is of course much easier to track her progress. Kat places her left palm against its side once more. Lazily she takes a moment to crack her neck, from one side to the other.

Perhaps just laziness and an attempt to convince herself she's not just stalling. Training all day every day endlessly gets old fast. That, and her neck's getting stiff. She's been at this all day. "I'll admit. . ." she says as she pours earth release chakra into the tree.

"I'm not sure I have time for a student. I'm sixteen. Not even ready to be a teacher." The tree's weight is reduced. Kat draws in a slow, silent, and deep breath as her right foot is drawn backwards through the sand.

Her right hand clenches into a fist. Abruptly, she then shoves it forwards. When it rams against the tree, a loud thump is made. Loud, but not quite as loud as you'd expect it to be. Of course, this probably wouldn't be noticed on the first strike. 

Maybe several more strikes later though, definitely. "I have goals too. Ambition. Call me selfish but right now, my own power's just about all I care about." Kat rams her fist into the tree once more. 

Its limbs above shake and tremble. It has no leaves. "I may brag a bit every now and then, but the truth is, I'm weak as dirt." She punches the tree once more. Pretty much only the exact same thing happens.* - Sun Oct 11 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at him. The teen responds first to his last comment. "True." she says. Kat once more punches her tree. Even now, after all this training, she barely manages anything at all with this jutsu.

"Still. I'm not strong enough. To be good enough to be a great kage, you need to be able to compare to people like Zetsumo and Kenshin." Kat rams her fist into her tree once more. A silent sigh is released through the nose.

The girl glances back and forth between the back of her hand and the target. Slowly she removes her hand. The teen is attempting to make her chakra stick to her tree. Senses focus on the plant, but even with that done she can't be sure. Her sensory abilities are terrible after all.

Kat turns in place. She's lifting a leg up during this motion with her body facing the north. There's a brief pause as she assures herself she'll get as much out of this kick as she can manage. Once that's done, she shoves her boot-covered foot forwards. It rams into the tree, hard.

Even so, only a very quiet thump is made. This time, the trees limbs don't even shake. The girl sighs. Abruptly she jumps up into the air, covering about fifteen feet easily. She's placed near the top of the tree.

In her frustration, she leans backwards a bit. Both legs are drawn close, and she launches them forwards. As they move, she's pouring chakra into them. When her feet ram into the tree, she attempts to cast her jutsu on it. Little to nothing happens as far as the jutsu goes.

In addition to this, she's sent flying backwards by nine feet or so. She'd intended to kick the target several times during her fit, but she's no tajutsu specialist. She can barely manage a single one. The girl can't force her body to keep moving forwards. With a somewhat loud thump, she hits the ground shortly afterwords, landing on her feet.

Some very small amount of sand flies up into the air.* - Sun Oct 11 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head with a blank glance over at the boy. At a lazy pace she's approaching the tree once more. "Takes time." she says. "Not a simple thing, getting to truly know someone." Kat touches the tree and pours chakra into it once more.

Eyes wander off. "People lie. Show people what they want them to see." Kat gently pushes her hand against the tree. She glances up towards the top for the moment to ensure that at least something is happening. 

And she's right. With only a push now, she's able to shake the branches. "I do it. You do too I'm sure." Kat punches the tree, very hard. Its branches shake far more wildly than before. 

The thunk produced is a bit more hollow-sounding. It echoes a little. "No matter what you tell me right now; could all be lies. We can talk but just know, it'll take time no matter what. Give me enough time...." Kat punches once more.

"And you won't be able to hide anything from me."* - Sun Oct 11 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) removes her palm yet again. She stares for a long while, as if hesitant to punch again. She's lazy. She has to force herself to persist. The girl hates training and she's always been lazy.

Horribly lazy. Not having Zetsumo around to spoon feed her anymore has helped, though, in that department. Due to her pause, she has to place her hand on the tree once more to again feed it chakra. She does so. Immediately afterwords she removes her hand.

During the same motion she shoves her right fist forwards. The tree branches shake about as much as they had when Kat begin training. Even so, it's more than she could do ten minutes ago. A glance is sent in that direction. The girl once more applies chakra to her practice dummy.

"Nothing." she says to Cypher. "Like, at all." The teen launches a single kick to her tree. Minutes pass as she trains more. She tries different combinations of kicks and punches.

Kat aspires to be a nintaijutsu specialist in specific after all. Training her taijutsu is as important as training this technique, so why not cover both at once? The tree shakes and such as she continues occasionally pouring chakra into it. "Been in Sunagakure this whole time and no one ever talks. Can't learn anything like this."* - Sun Oct 11 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) allows him to approach. It's been a while since she dealt with Erebus so her paranoia is gone. This boy has no reason to harm her, and she's rather relax right now. Both of Kat's palms meet the tree. With both at once, she pours chakra into it.

The suimen technique is used on both palms and feet. The girl then begins pushing. Sharp, deep, quiet breaths are taken as she begins pushing. Legs move back and forth. Breasts bounce to and fro as a result.

They're big enough that it can't not happen. Kat's target tree shakes a bit. It even begins groaning. A quiet, splitting sound reminiscent of a tree being uprooted. Kat pushes harder against it.

Her back meets the tree, and she tries pushing from that angle instead. Chakra is poured forth from both her back and hands at the same time. Eyes are averted entirely. "I-I'll...think about it. . ." she says inbetween breaths. "What if I tell Hassan, though. . ." she says, pausing for a moment.

"And he kills me on the spot?" Kat lifts herself up. Abruptly she launches another fist at her tree. A few kicks follow for good measure. With a sigh, she stops briefly. Hands find her hips, and she turns to stare at Cypher.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders back to town once Cypher leaves to go sleep.* - Sun Oct 11 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out into the desert yet again. She's a bit surprised Hassan hasn't asked about her behavior yet. She hasn't done a single mission since she got here, and she's on the pay roll. Every single day, she comes out to train. Not a single day has gone by since she got here that she hasn't trained for at least twelve hours.

The girl puts herself on her back. A soft breath is released. Carefully she slides herself towards the east by about six feet. And then? A tree is in her face.

Kat had prepared this a few days ago. She'd moved two small boulders after enormous amounts of effort. Even more difficult was moving a tree and placing it on them. It's a dead tree so the weight was managable, if only barely.  It's also only twenty feet tall or so.

Relatively tiny for a tree, but an impressive feat nonetheless. Kat's arms move forewards, and her palms meet her dummy's wood. With that, she begins pouring chakra into it. Eyes go out of focus. She's worked so hard for so long, it's starting to become something she does without effort.

She day dreams while training. Time passes by as her body moves on its own. Not an unusual thing when it comes to manual labor and otherwise tedious activities. Eventually, the body adjusts. Kat presses against the tree.

She's slow, but applies her full force. She's very careful to breathe properly. Her tree moves. Kat's arms extend halfway. The tree rises by a full seven inches or so. 

It's an enormous amount if you think about it. Even so, Kat's physically stressed already. Eyes come back into focus and she glances over at the nearest stone, and then the opposite one. Her heart beats a bit faster, if only briefly. She realizes, quite quickly, that she won't be able to hold this tree up to this height for very long.

She gulps. Slowly she draws it back down towards her body. Quick and deep breaths are taken. They're relatively quiet. The teen continues glancing back and forth between her stones as she lowers the tree.

She needs to be sure she gets it to land on the appropriate places, and she needs to be sure she gets it right the very first time. She can't keep this up for more than a few seconds and she realizes it. The tree touches the stones. Immediately, Kat's jutsu ends. The rest of the tree's weight comes down.

A quiet creaking is hard, due to the weight of the tree weighing down on its very self. It's an old, dead tree. As such it's not very durable. It's breaking itself under its own weight. Kat takes a moment to crack her neck and catch her breath. She needs to be completely...one-hundred percent sure that the next time she uses this jutsu and lifts the tree's weight, she's recovered entirely. 

* - Sun Oct 11 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually begins removing herself from the death trap that his her makeshift bench press set-up. Slowly and carefully she slides herself off to the west. When she rises to her feet, she's carefully brushing herself off. This was a good idea in some ways, and an extremely stupid one in others. She's a tiny bit lucky she didn't die.

With a shrug, she walks off to the west. She places herself fourty feet away from her target dummy and turns around. Even as she'd got up, she'd come up with a new idea for training. A hand reaches into her kunai pouch. Kat's lips twitch, and a faint smile is produced. A cheeky one.

Already she knows exactly what she's going to do with this, in time. Should she learn how to use jutsus in quick succession, the combination of this one and certain others will be unbelievably deadly. The teen pours earth release chakra into her weapon. Its weight is reduced. Kat's legs part, sliding through the dirt.

They're planted soon, and she draws her right hand backwards. With that done, she tosses the kunai forwards. It flies. Not only does it fly, but its flight is perfectly smooth. It's now near weightless.

Kat's smile fades away as it travels. It fades all the way into a faint frown. Her kunai hovers up into the air and goes straight over the tree she'd laid down. Not only that, but it just keeps going. It doesn't seem to be even close to stopping.

It continues on until even with her eyes, Kat can't see it anymore. So much for that idea. It had barely gone any faster if at all, and the knife had even lost some of its accuracy. With a shrug and a silent sigh, Kat prepares another kunai. With this one, too, she pours chakra into it.

This one, too, is launched at her tree. The teen has decided that even if her idea had been a failure, she could still use some shurikenjutsu training. She can keep experimenting until the weight for her knives is just perfect, too. In addition to this she can even practice changing the weight of this specific material. It's become apparent to her that different objects react in different ways to her jutsu.

That might be of course why she can't yet fly. She's managed a bit of hovering of a limb or two but no actual flight just yet. She can't yet even lift her entire body. Kunai and eventually even shuriken fly forwards as a blur. The girl gains a bit more control over her jutsu as the day ends.* - Sun Oct 11 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Days pass, and Kat trains during all of them. Eventually, she's prepared for herself two large stacks of medium-sized stones. Each stone is only about twice as big as her head. In general, four times as wide and half as tall. Kat had spent hours picking just the right stones.

During those hours, she'd carried them from the far corners of the desert to this place. For every step she'd taken, she'd been using her jutsu. The Lightweight Rock Technique. In doing so, she manages to squeeze in a bit of training even with that. Time management.

Sometimes it better to work smarter than harder. Kat's palms rest on her palms at this time. With a sigh, she examines her collection. Each pile is roughly five feet and ten inches tall. A bit taller than Kat herself is.

As such, when the teen approaches the piles, she's almost unable to reach them without standing on tipy-toes. Her left palm at this time meets the surface of one of her precious rocks. Precious, because she worked her ass off just to get them here. Chakra is poured into her palms. Firstly for Suimen and secondly for her prized jutsu.

Using these things, she carefully picks the item up. It's about as light as a feather to her now. She's just become 'that' good with Lera's jutsu. More specifically, it's about as light as a kunai. Kat then turns on her heel and takes several steps to the southwest.

She's left fourty feet west, once more, of the tree she'd placed here. The teen faces it at this time. Maybe throwing kunai won't work. Stones, though? Potentially exploding stones, even? 

Oh yes. She has a good feeling about this idea. Kat's right foot slides backwards through the sand. Both feet are planted firmly. Kat's right arm slowly stretches backwards behind her form, and she bends at the hip.

With that, she then throws her arm forwards in one smooth motion. She turns at her hip as well to add extra power and especially speed to her throw. When she finally releases her weapon, the stone flies forwards. Its weight remains next to nothing since her jutsu sticks. It flies smoothly as well.

Almost as if it were a shuriken, it's entirely uninterupted for the entire journey. It's not a perfectly aerodynamic shape unlike a kunai so maybe some adjustments could be made but even so, Kat's not disappointed. From this range, it hits its mark easily. Briefly the girl is stunned, however, when the stone hits her tree. It does hit with a loud thunk.

That's fantastic. However, it's nothing like what she expected. The thunk is only a bit louder than that produced by a shuriken hitting the same target. And even then, it's only louder because there's more surface area. Kat takes some time to consider this as she draws in a slow, silent breath.

It doesn't take her long to realize what the problem is of course. Kat had made the stone lighter but it remained light all the way to its target. As a result, there's little to no point in using a stone instead of a shuriken to begin with. With disappointment, she reaches up to rub at the back of her head. Eyes wander.

A shrug follows. Even if her technique's not as amazing as she'd hoped, it'll still work. If she does figure out how to make stones explode which is her main current goal, then it'll make little difference what impact the stones themselves make. Kat makes her way over to her collection. Once more, she removes a stone.

With her ammunition in hand, she goes back to the start line. And for emphasis, she takes her foot and begins carefully dragging it through the ground. With patience, she forms a twelve-foot-long literal line in the dirt to mark where she should stay. This way, she can better compare her accuracy as she progresses with both this jutsu and her stone-throwing. Kat turns to face her tree.

Once more she takes a stance and throws her stone forwards. The wind is easily heard breaking as it travels. It's rather large and un-aerodynamic after all. As such, it can't be fixed. The light weight does help though.

A loud thunk is sounded off once more as Kat's weapon hits its mark.* - Sun Oct 11 07:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders off to go master a jutsu with t1 studious.* - Sun Oct 11 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way back out to the training grounds. Palms rest on her hips for the moment and eyes wander as she comes to a stop. Already she's dreading this. Even so, this is a world of shinobi. People rarely know to expect war or death in advance.

She needs to be capable of flight well in advance, and she knows it. The girl makes her way over to a rather large boulder. Roughly five feet tall and wide enough for it to be pretty much perfectly round. She'd prepared this one only a day before. Both palms find it and she makes use of suimen for the sake of gripping it.

Chakra is poured into it to lower its weight. Kat's right foot then slides backwards through the dirt. Both legs are planted hard, and firmly. She needs to be sure she's lifting mostly with her legs and not her back. With that, she begins taking a very slow and deep breath. 

Near the end of the breath, Kat begins pulling. The stone rolls towards her for a foot or two. With that done, Kat begins slowly lifting it. The boulder is on her right shoulder before long. The teen continues pouring chakra into it even now. 
She needs to be sure it grows ever lighter. Her breathing remains labored due to the strain on her weak body. Legs are planted once more. Many minutes pass. The entire time, Kat's pouring chakra into her stone. 

The objective, after all, is not to train her physical strength. The goal is the exact opposite. She specifically needs to make the dummy lighter. Eventually, she's succeeded by an acceptable amount. Her shoulder is drawn backwards a bit and her stone rolls a little bit onto her arm.

With this done, she tosses the boulder forwards as far as she can. She's pretty successul. It flies forwards by a whole ten feet. An extremely impressive feat for such a large boulder of course. Nothing compared to what a master of the jutsu can manage, but the teen is hardly disappointed.

It begins rolling southwards. Kat's palms find her hips and she takes a moment to catch her breath. Very small amounts of sweat roll down her cheeks. Even so, she stays where she is. The drive she has to go and catch her practice rock is pretty much non-existant.

Eventually though, hands meet to form the tiger seal. Kat flickers out of sight. When she reappears, she's south of her rock. The teen's right palm is stretched out already. As the stone draws near, she's pouring chakra forwards.

When it touches her, it catches much, much more of her earth release chakra. The weight is reduced just enough. Kat's feet slowly slide backwards through the dirt. It takes thirty full seconds or so. Eventually though, she manages to stop it from moving.

And with that done, she turns on her heel. The teen pulls her boulder along as she turns, forcing it to roll. Once more she picks it it up and throws it. This time, she manages to make it so light that it actually gains seven feet or so of air. In addition to this, it spans thirty feet or so of distance before hitting the ground with a nice, loud bang.* - Sun Oct 11 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually grows tired of throwing a boulder around. Far from fun and it left her with a headache. The girl now takes some time to stretch. She kneels very close to the ground as she stretches first her left leg, and then the right. Arms follow.

With that, the girl leans forwards and begins sprinting. Even as she does so, she's applying the Lightweight Rock technique to her entire body. She moves faster as a result. Dirt is thrown all over the place mostly due to Kat being insanely fast to begin with. She moves as a blur.

In addition to this, any dirt she travels over has its weight reduced. Mid-stride, the girl eventually bends her legs at the knees. She leaps, and is sent flying. As if she's using Niza's bunny jutsu, she easily covers sixty full feet or so. An absolutely insane distance.

She's a shinobi. They can all jump high by default. Combine this with how fast her legs move and thus how fast she's capable of kicking against the ground, and she's capable of jumping pretty high to begin with. With her weight reduced, she jumps a few times higher than usual. Eventually, Kat begins descending.

She does so relatively slowly. When she hits the ground on her feet, her weight is still reduced enough that it's a fairly gentle drop. A near-silent and brief huff is produced. In the same motion, Kat resumes sprinting. Occasionally she somersaults along on the ground.

The girl's flipping to and fro like an acrobate or, well -- a ninja. She twists and turns mid-flips. Occasionally she draws her arms close to her waist and spins wildly like a top. Her goal is to maintain control over her jutsu while moving around at her very best. Occasionally she'd even throw a leg out to begin rapidly kicking at the air.

Already she's noticed that this jutsu seems to make her lips move much, much faster than usual. As such, she manages twice as many kicks as she'd normally be capable of. Already she's impressed. Flight or no flight, this jutsu is going to help. No longer will she have so much difficulty landing a landmine fist.* - Sun Oct 11 18:49:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. The girl then rises to her feet. She brushes dirt off of herself in the same motion, ignoring Kilm so hard.

"Sure." she says.

Arms cross and she follows the boy.* - Sun Oct 11 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 11 19:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Don't tell yan I used anything alright? He doesn't want me using them on people..But I still wana fo spars. - Sun Oct 11 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl's eyes close due to Kilm's warning. She's expecting genjutsu. Senses lock onto Susumi, and she slowly slides her right foot backwards. Arms rise and hands clench partially as if to mimic claws.* - Sun Oct 11 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) really wishes she'd finished learning how to fly.

At any rate, the girl simply turns and sprints. She makes her way to the north. Eyes wander behind closed eye lids when she realizes she's being followed. The boy's jutsu moves so slow compared to her it's almost funny.

Even so, she soon realizes she can't dodge it. So, feet come skidding to a stop as she turns around. Mid-slide, Kat turns to where her left hip faces Susumu's jutsu. Eyes open to stare at it. Her left fist is rising as she stops.

It's pointed at his yellow fuuinjutsu words. The chuunin immediately pours explosion release chakra into the chakra flow weapons.

An explosive blast-like beam of energy is the result. It comes forwards with a very loud, reverberating, crackling boom. The ground and nearby structures such as trees and houses shake. This beam is quite, quite long and quite, quite wide. (http://i.imgur.com/zaGMMDS.png)

She also waits until the words are close to unleash her chakra. They'd undoubtedly be hit. Do note that explosions pack concussive force in addition to burning power. They knock back.* - Sun Oct 11 19:52:06 2015
