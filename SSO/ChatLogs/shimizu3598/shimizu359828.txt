With that, an explosion is released. The ground shakes. The trademark beam-like blast of energy springs forth. The landmine fist. This time, Kat's channeled it through her chakra flow gauntlets. Just an experiment.* - Wed Oct  7 20:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Come. Let us spar to battle ourselves. - Wed Oct  7 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out west of Sunagakure again. She walks over the walls literally, with waves to the nearby guards. They're usrely used to her doing this by now and so high alert Sunagakure or not, they presumably wouldn't mind. Kat's carrying a very large stack of white plates in her right hand. They're all porcelain.

As such, she has to be careful when she's scaling the opposite side. The western-most side. She can't just leap as usual. A smile is on her face when her feet touch the firm ground and she turns to wander off to the west. Today, she has a special training excercise prepared.

Carefully she kneels down to place her stacked targets in the dirt -- gently. She then rises up with a sigh. This stack of plates is about as tall as she is. Her right hand moves out to gently take one, and she takes some time to twirl it to and fro playfully as if it were a frisbee. Wind is heard breaking from the sheer speed at which she twirls it.

With a sigh, she then slides her right foot backwards through the dirt. Feet are planted firmly. Kat's right arm is held back behind her with the plate in-hand. Eyes are locked onto the sky. Once she's ready, the teen then swings her arm forwards. 

The plate is sent flying sky-high. It undoubtedly travels for half a damned mile due to the speed it'd been thrown at. While it travels, Kat's clenching her right hand into a fist. She's getting ready for it. Today, Kat's plan is this.

She'll toss plates up into the air as high as she can. When they come crashing downwards at a stupidly fast pace, Kat will shove her arm forwards and plant her fist against them. Kat does this to train how fast she can execute the Landmine Fist. Finally, the plate's within view.

Sharply, the teen shoves her arm forwards. Her fist hits it. The glass shatters, producing the expected flinch-inducing sound. A loud pop follows as well. An explosion, reminiscent of the Exploding Palm. 

However, that's not the sound Kat wanted to hear. She'd timed her landmine fist a bit slowly and only managed to detonate a single shard of the now-broken plate. Eyes wander back and forth between the falling shards as they make their way down. More difficult than she'd expected. Of course, Kat could just prime her Landmine Fist to explode the second her fist touches it.

That, however, wastes chakra. The point of this training is to save as much chakra as possible. Thus, she intends to train herself to execute it only as her fist touches the enemy. With a sigh, she picks up another plate. Once more, it's tossed up into the air.

It spins wildly like a frisbee and travels oh-so-high. It whistles loudly with every foot of distance covered. While Kat waits, she forces herself to stay alert and focused. It takes so long, she's tempted to fall asleep so she has to force herself. Eventually, she can see it.

It's coming back down, so she tightens her fist's grip. The plate comes within range. Once more, she sharply throws her arm forwards. Once more it breaks. Yet again, she'd failed to execute her jutsu in time.

This time there's not even a pop. The girl shakes her head. Standing straight up, she takes a moment to crack her knuckles and stretch her hands out. Arms follow, and then legs. A sharp breath is taken in through the nose.

She tenses up and grabs another plate. Roughly, with apparent frustration, she throws it up as well. The third time's the charm, right? Her hand is clenched very tightly into a fist and she keeps it there. Eyes grow sore from how much she focuses them.

Finally the plate's within range yet again. And so, taking advantage, Kat shoves her arm forwards. A sharp, loud, crackling "pop!" is heard. The sound of metal meeting porcelain. Most ears aren't sharp enough to notice this though.

Or rather, most peoples' reflexes aren't. They can't process it that quickly. The reason is the following very loud, reverberating, bellowing boom. An explosion spews forwards. Kat had uses the material inside the plate -- that itself -- to trigger her explosion.

That 'was' the goal after all. The blate disappears. It's disnitigrated on a molecular level. That's what an explosion is. Matter, being turned to pure energy. 

The resulting shockwave of energy is what you call an explosion. That's the definition. Not too entirely different from dust release, no? It really isn't. The plate's gone, but Kat's explosion release chakra remains. 

It spews forth in the form of a beam. It's hot, and she can feel the produced heat. Hair and skirt blow backwards wildly. Dirt is thrown all over the place. This beam of energy lasts for an entire three seconds or so.

Horrifying, definitely. "Hmph!" Kat explains, producing a cheeky smile. Without much pause she reaches for another plate. It too is tossed upwards very sharply and smoothly. Due to her enthusiasm, this one's left teetering to and fro throughout the entire round-trip.

On its way down Kat once more braces herself. Her excitement keeps her focused. Of course she enjoys blowing stuff up. Who wouldn't? The plate draws near, and Kat's atomic bomb of a fist flies forwards once more.

Once more, the plate is obliterated. Two landmine fists down and two more to go before she passes out. She sighs. Already her body grows weak, and she grows tired. Another plate is tossed up.

Time passes, and eventually Kat's out of chakra. With a nod, she slowly lowers herself down onto her butt. Arms cross, and she closes her eyes. Just resting them. She has just a bit of chakra left.

She's not gonna pass out though. Or at least, that's what she tells herself. A slow, deep, silent breath is taken in through the nose. And with that, she then falls backwards. The girl crashes into the dirt with a soft thumb.

Immediately she's out cold. Yet again, the landmine fist jutsu kicks her ass. The chakra cost is too extreme. But, hopefully not for long. Hours pass.* - Wed Oct  7 22:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Uhh...nasty. - Thu Oct  8 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Katsune. - Thu Oct  8 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Mhmm... - Thu Oct  8 00:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So what is going on here? - Thu Oct  8 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins walking backwards, expecting Cypher to follow her.

She'd get out of hearing range from these two so that they can converse without interuption.* - Thu Oct  8 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Thu Oct  8 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was about to train. You any good for a punching bag? - Thu Oct  8 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: ---- - Thu Oct  8 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Uh. - Thu Oct  8 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Not sure. - Thu Oct  8 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: I'd be willing to give you a round, But I warn you, I'm fast. - Thu Oct  8 00:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Me too. - Thu Oct  8 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. North of here then? - Thu Oct  8 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Uh sure, If you have a spot. - Thu Oct  8 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. The girl then turns to face the north and begins walking. She'd lead the way to where she plans to train.

Far away from potentially nosey guards.* - Thu Oct  8 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides her right foot backwards through the dirt and lifts both arms. Hands clench partially as if to mimic claws. A stance, most appropriate for her fighting style.

Kat eyes the boy blankly.

"Alright..." she says.

"Before we start, gotta ask. Are you durable?"* - Thu Oct  8 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head.

"I'll just have to hold back." she says.

"Anyway. Ready?"* - Thu Oct  8 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || "Five years." she says.

With that, she leans forwards and sprints towards him.

Katsune moves as a blur to most eyes.

Should she reach him she'd waste no time. Immediately upon reaching point-blank range she'd come skidding to a stop. During this same motion she'd lift her right arm with the palm laid pefectly flat.

Should this palm touch Cypher, it releases a very loud and powerful -- but very small - explosion.

Kat holds back roughly half of the technique's strength though, to be completely sure she won't put a hole in him -- which is very easy for her to do to a normal person even with this D ranked technique.

It may knock him back. Either way, it'll probably sting like hell and leave a bruise. It's not a technique meant for killing.* - Thu Oct  8 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) attempts to simply take a step backwards and to the side as this wind approaches. She can sense it, so she focuses said senses on it. Eyes lock onto it as well, though it's unclear if she can see it clearly even with her phenominal eyes.

While moving, she swings her arm to the side. An attempt is made to put her palm in the way of his technique's blast.

Should she get there in time, Kat produces another Exploding Palm.

An attempt is made to blast the wind and knock it back right at Cyher. Kat doesn't aim for specifics, though it's probably headed towards his face. She sure hopes he can dodge.

She's using the full strength of this jutsu. Will it work???
She has no idea! The girl is experimenting. That's the point of a sparring session, right?

Although, far more likely than anything else is that the blast of wind is just eaten. Destroyed outright, instantly.* - Thu Oct  8 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply darts backwards as possible, as eyes move to the keg. She'd sensed it before it came near. Of course, this all is if and only if her reflexes and speed are adequate.

During the same motion while dodging, Kat lifts both arms. Hands meet to form the tiger seal.

And with that, the dirt beneath Cypher's feet turns to mud. Oh-so-suddenly and abruptly it'd pick him up as it streams towards the east. It does so with tremendous force. Katsune's full power.

It'd do no serious harm presumably, though the sheer force of it may leave bruises.

Either way, he'd be carried away, by an enormous distance. This is classified as a "long-ranged" jutsu. It lives up to that too.* - Thu Oct  8 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) parts her hands and then forms the tiger seal yet again.

With that, Kat crouches down even as Cypher fights her mud river.

Palms meet the ground. Suddenly and very quickly, a dome of earth begins rising up out of the ground. It's about twenty feet wide in any direction, and ten feet tall.

Kat attempts to trap him inside. It'd be sealed completely with no exit. She decides not to add a floor to the structure though, to give him at least a chance.

Once done, Kat stays in her kneeling position and keeps senses locked onto him to see how he's doing. She waits patiently.* - Thu Oct  8 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Na. Mud Dragon Bomb would kill 'im. - Thu Oct  8 01:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders forwards at a lazy pace. It takes time but eventually she reaches the side of her earthen corridor. The young woman lifts an arm upon reaching it and plants the associated palm against its side.

Slowly, the wall opens up, as per the nature and versatility of this jutsu. Kat walks through the opening as if it's a door. Once inside, her palms find her hips and her weight shifts a bit.

A weak smile is on her face. "Yeah." she says, looking him up and down. "Not good enough for a punching bag."* - Thu Oct  8 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not at this time anyway. - Thu Oct  8 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. I'd keep going but. . . - Thu Oct  8 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm guessing it's not as fun for you as it was for me. - Thu Oct  8 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And don't get me wrong, I enjoyed that. - Thu Oct  8 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I never liked getting beaten up with no chance to win though. Doubt you do either. - Thu Oct  8 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Yeah, But It just means I have to get stronger. - Thu Oct  8 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: My Gramps used to tell me. - Thu Oct  8 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: It's not about how hard you can hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. - Thu Oct  8 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: If anything, I want to learn from this. - Thu Oct  8 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct  8 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: 'Course, I'm getting to that point. Pretty sure I'd be able to kill Zetsumo right now if he were alive. - Thu Oct  8 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Thank you though. - Thu Oct  8 01:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not yet. - Thu Oct  8 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: You plan to? - Thu Oct  8 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm pretty sure I'll join up some day but I dunno. - Thu Oct  8 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When I'm strong enough I intend to go rebuild Konoha and lead it as Hokage. - Thu Oct  8 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So if I join Sunagakure, it'll be temporary. - Thu Oct  8 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: I see.. - Thu Oct  8 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have no intention of hiding that from Hassan if I go to ask for a headband. - Thu Oct  8 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: That''s probably for the best. - Thu Oct  8 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: I would ask you if you wanted to get something to eat.. - Thu Oct  8 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: But I'm not allowed in the Village.. - Thu Oct  8 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Thu Oct  8 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, it would be pretty sucky to have to head home right after getting here. Kumogakure's -really- far away. - Thu Oct  8 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: You can say that again. - Thu Oct  8 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna see my place? - Thu Oct  8 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: H-Huh? You wouldn't mind? - Thu Oct  8 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "Na." she says.

"Friend might, but I don't."

Kat turns on her heel and begins walking away, to lead the way to Seisuke's hidden bunker-like home.* - Thu Oct  8 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ummmm.... - Thu Oct  8 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sort of. . . - Thu Oct  8 01:41:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) opens the door to the building. Arms cross with that done and she makes her way into the interior. Eyes wander. Kat keeps her gauntlets on. She's breaking a rule and all, but Seisuke's not here to see it anyway. She scans the entire building with her senses and senses no one but herself and Cypher.

Eventually they'd be in the living room. Lazily Kat plants her butt on the couch and crosses one leg over the other.

"Make yourself at home." she says.

"Fridge is stocked."* - Thu Oct  8 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) doesn't even notice the joke. Eyes are averted and she's rubbing at her face when she says "Sake."* - Thu Oct  8 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow. Lips twitch afterwords once she realizes that he's a kid. Her cheeks turn a bit pink. A nod follows.

Kat leans forwards to take a cup of the substance herself and then makes herself comfortable once more. Eyes wander off, and she brings the glass up to her mouth to sip at it.

When she's done she says "You get to where you like the taste."* - Thu Oct  8 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway. - Thu Oct  8 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks down at him. "Why come to Sunagakure?"* - Thu Oct  8 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kumogakure's not good enough for that? - Thu Oct  8 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll admit I've never been. - Thu Oct  8 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Went there once to buy something but I was in and out in ten minutes so it hardly counts. - Thu Oct  8 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) drinks more sake, gulping it down like it's just water and she's just getting hydrated.* - Thu Oct  8 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. . . - Thu Oct  8 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) averts her eyes and drinks more.* - Thu Oct  8 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dark place or. . .? - Thu Oct  8 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Orgies everywhere? - Thu Oct  8 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Thu Oct  8 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm always said it was bad. - Thu Oct  8 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetseun, Cypher(Jjking218) says: Kilm? - Thu Oct  8 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Friend of mine. - Thu Oct  8 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Was a Kumogakure shinobi five years ago. - Thu Oct  8 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then he got enslaved by Zetsumo, not long after Zetsumo caught me too. - Thu Oct  8 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) leans over to pick up the bottle of sake. She takes a moment to fill up her glass before pressing her back to the couch once more.* - Thu Oct  8 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- Yeah. That was probably TMI. - Thu Oct  8 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . - Thu Oct  8 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes him for a moment to make sure he's sincere. Afterwords she nods, averting her eyes.

Normally she'd never think it might be TMI, but hey. A guy killed himself over that recently. Literally he killed himself because he wasn't able to impress Kat.* - Thu Oct  8 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "I'm fine." she says.

"Feeling pretty good about life today actually." The teen then knocks back another glass of sake.

She's probably starting to feel it right about now.* - Thu Oct  8 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She leans forwards and sets her glass down. The teen has no intention of getting drunk. She never does really.

Of course, she's actually referring to how epic her landmine fist is, but she's aware that he's drunk.* - Thu Oct  8 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her feet up and turns in place on the couch to lay down. The girl's palms meet the back of her head. A faint, cheeky smile is on her face and her cheeks turn a bit pink.

"You drank too much." she says.

"You're not supposed to get drunk."* - Thu Oct  8 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing, for a while. Eyes wander.

There's little point talking to a drunk person if you're not trying to date rape them. The conversation can't really go anywhere after all.

That. and there's no way to respond without sounding either conceited or overly humble and Kat's aware of this fact.

Eventually though Kat reaches over to take the sake bottle. She plants it on the back of the couch.

"No more sake." she says.

Of course, her own glass is still on the table.

"For either of us."* - Thu Oct  8 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at it as it falls. She could catch it, but she opts not to. The glass breaks, shattering into a million pieces. Sake is spilled.

"Hmph." she scoffs, quietly. Her smile remains. She gives no fucks.* - Thu Oct  8 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. She's a sociopath for one, among many other things.

"Maybe." she says.

"All of those things might be true."* - Thu Oct  8 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Thu Oct  8 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an arm and points to the nearest bedroom. Her own, rather than Seisuke's.

After all, she's not yet aware that he's dead.

"You can have that one." she says.

The girl doubts Seisuke would mind finding out that she was sleeping in his bed instead of her own.* - Thu Oct  8 03:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She too probably falls asleep soon, and probably on the couch too. As lazy as she currently is, combined with sake, it's unlikely she has the drive to stand up and walk to a bedroom.* - Thu Oct  8 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) glances over at the grave. "Hmph." she scoffs in a polite and humble manner.

A nod follows. She hadn't seen who's body it was.

"Sorry for your loss." she says.* - Thu Oct  8 03:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: The mission is complete Lord Hassan. - Thu Oct  8 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way out to the middle of the desert. Specifically, the teen finds an area covered with cacti and stones. As she comes to a stop, her hands meet to form the tiger seal. Eyes wander as she takes the time to pick an ideal target. They soon lock onto the biggest cactus in the area.

With a shrug, she shoves chakra throughout her body; to nerves and muscles and such. The girl then immediately sprints forwards. She moves as a blur. Feet come skidding to a stop as she draws near, and her right arm draws backwards. She's very capable of punching even now, after shunshin with no delay.

However, she's not capable of using landmine fist yet. With her chakra circuits going wild, she can't concentrate enough to manage the feet. A sharp, silent breath is taken due to her frustration. Eventually though, she finally manages to send explosion release chakra to her fist. The arm flies forwards, and her palm hits it with a soft thunk.

Immediately, the ground shakes. Every cactus in the area is blown backwards without being uprooted. Kat's signature technique had been triggered, and the resulting very loud beam of energy is released. It roars and screams for a few long seconds. Even so, Kat's not satisfied.

Being able to use landmine fist shortly after shunshin is all well and good, but it's not quite good enough. She needs to be able to use it without any delay whatsoever. And so, to this end, Kat forms the tiger seal once more. Once more, she flickers out of sight. Kat blows up another cactus.

Hours pass.* - Thu Oct  8 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually goes home to sleep due to the chakra drain of landmine fist. When she gets back, though, she's grown tired of training her ability to transition from jutsu to jutsu. And so, the girl opts to simply focus on her signature technique today. The landmine fist. She's nearly satisfied with it, but there's just a bit more to go.

Mastery's so close she can almost taste it. And so, she approaches the nearest boulder. Just a warm-up excercise. The teen plants her right fist against its surface, and stares. Slowly she draws in a deep, silent breath. With that, she then shoves chakra into her fist.

Shoves, because she can't afford to take her time in a real fight. Even so, she still concentrates as hard as ever on withholding as much chakra as she can from her jutsu. Using as little as possible. First she changes the insides of the stone to sulfur. With that done, she charges it with electrcity all in one fluid and lightning-fast motion.

As such, an explosion is created. A massive one. The world shakes, and Kat becomes a tiny bit more addicted to blowing stuff up, as always. Kat nods. With that, she then turns on her heel and makes her way over to a cactus. She'd noticed the other day that they're a bit different from stones and human flesh.

The insides are different so it's not as easy to blow it up. She'll want to experiment with that, and so she does so. Her fist is planted to the side of the top of the plant. This time, Kat takes her time. She lets her chakra seep into the cactus and feel around as she struggles to change its insides.

Once satisfied, the chuunin-level shinobi withdraws her chakra. Once more she shoves it forwards as quickly and roughly she can manage. Once more, she saves as much chakra as she can. The explosion is as deadly as always. Hours pass, with Kat moving from target to target.* - Thu Oct  8 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) grows bored. In response, she turns on her heel and explores the desert a bit more. She's looking for something in specific, too. Water. Kat's seen how her exploding palm reacts to the substance.

Basically, nothing happens. The explosion isn't conducted in any way. In addition to this, it isn't deterred in any way either. Even so, she hasn't tested this jutsu in particular against it. After hours of searching, Kat finds what she's looking for. A little oasis in the desert.

Of course, the sensible and nice thing to do would be to leave it there. Some day, a dying man or woman could use this to survive. To not die of thirst. That's too damned bad though, because Kat walks right up to it. Lazily, she plunches an arm into its depths with her hand clenched into a fist.

Her knuckles are allowed to be consumed by the moist, mushy dirt. Carefully, she then pours chakra forwards. She shakes the materials at hand. Once everything is good and ready, Kat releases the fourth explosion today. The world shakes, and water is splashed all over the place alongside the pond's dirt.

No more water is left. The oasis is nothing now.* - Thu Oct  8 19:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way back out into the desert once more with a sigh. Finally she's mastered her landmine fist jutsu. However, there are still many more within her arsenal that are overly draining. Among them is the Earthen Corridor jutsu. An amazing jutsu that's sure to prove extremely useful.

She's also so bad at it that she hasn't improved it since she got it. It's been a crutch for ages, but she's neglected to train it. That changes today. Hands meet to form the tiger seal. With that done, she quickly crouches down. 

Both palms slap against the ground. Immediately the ground begins shaking, as if there's an earth quake. Rocky plates as hard as steel stir within the ground. Eventually they begin rising. It's slow, as Kat's focus is on saving chakra rather than anything else. 

She's being careful even for every single inch of the structure that's conjured up. An entire few minutes pass, due to how much care Katsune's giving this project. This training. The girl needs to conserve as much chakra as she can for every single training session with this jutsu. Kat's creation is eventually completed.

It's as tall as she usually makes it. Twenty feet wide in any direction and twelve feet high. Almost as tall as a two story house. Great and all, but not good enough. With a shrug, Kat rises back up to her feet.

Lazily she struts over to it. Upon reaching it she extends her right arm and places her palm to its side. As carefully as she can manage, she wills it to begin opening up at all ends. Doorways at every side of it. This continues until it has more holes than a cheese grater.

And then, to finish what she started, Kat makes the corridor disappear entirely. She then turns around and walks off to the southeast before coming to a stop shortly afterwords. Once more the teen forms this jutsu's handseal. With that done, she once more kneels down and slaps her palms to the earth. Another corridor is made.

This time, a tiny one. It's about as big as you might expect the average igloo to be. Many more follow, springing up out of the ground one after the other. Kat only has enough chakra to make so many big corridors after all, so she may as well make small ones. That, and she needs to practice making the size vary anyway.

Sometimes, a small corridor may be more ideal than a big one. In fact, it's likely often that this will be the case. Kat's hands part and join together once more to form the tiger seal. Once more she slaps the ground. This time, she attempts to make a corridor with a different shape than usual.

Slowly the earth rises up out of the ground, overshadowing all of the tiny variants quite literally. It boxes them in. There are four walls in all, linked at four corners. A rectangular earthen corridor. Probably never will be as useful as the dome-shaped one but you never know.

A roof slides into place, being fed mud from the ground far below. This corridor itself is probably twenty feet high. By now, Kat's sweating. This jutsu isn't nearly as consuming of her chakra as the landmine fist used to be. However, it's still stupid costly.

She hasn't come even close to mastering it after all. She can literally only use this six times per day before passing out, just like her mastered landmine fist. Her breath's labored. As such, she slowly sets herself down on her butt. With a nod, she then lies down.

In the middle of the desert, she opts to let herself sleep. She has no enemies these days anyway. Many hours pass. Eventually she wakes up and goes home for food and water. But then? 

The second she's rested up, she heads back out. The handseal is formed again. With that, Kat crouches down. Palms meet the earth, and chakra is poured into it. This time, she experiments a bit.

The girl's intention is this. To produce a massive corridor directly under her feet. It'd occured to her that some techniques come from the ground. And so, she needs to be capable of picking herself up without jumping. Jumping leaves you open. 

You can't easily maneuver in mid-air without some sort of magical BS means of flying. The ground shakes and earth rises up. It does so with Kat's feet planted on it, easily enough. There's a hole in the top of this dome, where Kat's hand is, but she opts to let it close up at this time. The lid has her hand on it, and it slowly rises up as well.

Kat's eyes sway to and fro to make sure this is working. Her palm is no longer on the actual ground after all. Presumably though, all goes smoothly and her creation keeps rising. Why wouldn't it after all? Presumably, she's able to simply keep feeding the ground chakra through the earthen corridor itself.

As such, Kat slowly rises up into the air. Eventually, she'd be on top of a twenty-foot-tall earthen corridor. It's three times as wide. With a sigh, Kat acknowledges her work. She stands up, and palms find her hips.

Using Suimen, she begins walking. She explores the surface of it entirely, circling it a few times even. She looks for any weak spots, using her senses to be sure there aren't any even as far as chakra distribution goes. And there are none. The handseal is formed once more.

If Kat can channel chakra through the corridor, it might be possible for her to put an earthen corridor on top of another earthen corridor, as she realizes. Once done, Kat kneels down and puts her palms to it. Chakra is sent forwards. Without much effort, the girl produces yet another corridor. It's several times smaller than the last.

Even now, she's sure to save as much chakra as she can manage. To further test her abilities, she constructs many more tiny earthen corridors. This time, even smaller. Eventually the entire structure is covered. She needs to be sure after all that she can perform this jutsu without any difficulty at all in absolutely any situation.* - Thu Oct  8 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wakes up on another day. She then takes to exploring the desert. She didn't exactly get permission from the Kazekage but he hasn't exactly given her a headband yet has he? Technically she has one already but technically she's not officially a genin yet. Or at least, that'll be what she says if she's harrassed. Kat's left palm finds her hip and her weight shifts a bit as she comes to a stop.

She's found a good place. Little desert hill top, entirely rock. A thumb is lazily and slowly swiped across her lower lip. A nod follows. Following this is Kat lifting her arms and forming the usual handseal.

Once she's done, she kneels down. Both palms meet the rocky surface below. Chakra is poured forwards into the earth. It's rocky so it's a bit different than usual, but that's what Kat wants of course. She needs to try this jutsu in as many situations as she can think up. 

Doing so will teach her how to do it flawlessly should the situation ever arrise in actual combat. Eventually the ground shakes, and the usual dome rises up. It's left small to conserve chakra. Kat repeats this for hours. By the time she's done, she's come up with some ideas.

People are always dodging her corridors. They fly or run up the walls. It's annoying. Even she dodges the jutsu in that way. Already, Kat knows how she'll counter this problem.

The jutsu is triggered once more. This time, Kat's rocky earth rises up starting within a small space of eight feet. It rises up to an equal height before immediately closing, even as the base grows ever larger. The result is that one has little time to escape. The concept is similar to that of Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot.

One would need more than speed. They'd probably need phenominal reflexes too. Kat smirks. The corridor continues growing until it's as big as it would normally be. And then to finish it off, she gives it a floor to counter Hiding Like a Mole. She trains for several more hours before sleeping.* - Thu Oct  8 23:01:07 2015
