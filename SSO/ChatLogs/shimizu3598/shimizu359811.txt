<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) avoids eye contact, not even once looking at Suitengo. She doesn't need to. She 'feels' his eyes on her.

Awkwardly, her eyes wander.* - Sun Sep 20 18:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides into a bench at a table. The girl's palms rest on the surface of said bench at either side of her form, and legs swing back and forth beneath her form. Nearly as soon as they're seated a waitress approaches.

Kat orders sushi, again, and water. She and the waitress then eye Taiga expectantly.* - Sun Sep 20 18:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lazily stuff her face with her own sushi. Her expression's fairly neutral and good-humored despite what she's saying. A glance is sent Taiga's way in response to his questioning.* - Sun Sep 20 19:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Konohagakure, you know. That one village that's basically dead. - Sun Sep 20 19:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did you serve Zetsumo there...? Or, a citizen? - Sun Sep 20 19:15:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: The village is basically destroyed, so I just left. I do have some combat experience, so maybe this is my way of identifying as a shinobi. - Sun Sep 20 19:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: I mean with the academy not functioning, this is the only way I could get a headband. - Sun Sep 20 19:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: But, if the village wasn't the way it currently is. .  I might have never stepped outside of those walls. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good idea. Zetsumo's gonna kill everyone in Konoha that gets in his way when he re-takes it. - Sun Sep 20 19:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had actually already been strongly considering getting off of this duck, considering it's to be the main target. The girl flinches at the sight of masks dying, and eyes dart back and forth between them. An eyebrow twitches, and a bead of sweat slides down the side of her face.

The girl shakes her head, taking a nervous step backwards. With that, as Zetsumo's leaping off of Dorja, Kat turns and sprints towards the beast's butt. Suimen keeps her attatched. Legs bend at the knees and with all of her strength, the girl kicks off to send herself flying to the west, moving as a blur to almost all eyes.

While moving, the girl's right hand finds the Kenryoku haori tied to her waist -- the one that signifies allegiance with Zetsumo. Roughly she rips it off at this time, and lets it fly away in the wind.

When she hits the ground, feet skid accross the ground. As they do so, she's already crouching down. Palms meet the earth, and it turns to liquid. At her best speed, the girl attempts to swim away, underground. A pond is left where she'd entered, but she doesn't stop.

Of course, there are thousands of Amegakure soldiers here. There's little reason for anyone to choose to target her in specific. She's just one in a massive crowd. That also means the puddle is pretty much impossible to notice, amongst all these people. The girl never even wanted to fight for Zetsumo to begin with.* - Sun Sep 20 22:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) swims at a diagonal angle to go as deep underground as she possibly can while at the same time, going west. The girl's presumably able to be long-gone within mere seconds, as fast as she is. 

Presumably, she's one-hundred feet or so underground.* - Sun Sep 20 22:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...Why didn't I grab Sabo? God damn it. - Sun Sep 20 22:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) kept racing along of course, not stopping.

She's probably leaving the village at this time. The girl avoids anything suspicious that she senses along the way, with her jutsu's magnetic sense-related qualities.* - Sun Sep 20 23:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stops to rest in a neighboring village of Kirigakure, having used the henge jutsu to get in and rent a bed. A warm meal and lots of sake are aquired while she's there. Once she's done, Kat once more uses the same jutsu to leave the village, heading west. Anywhere associated with Kirigakure can't be safe right now. The girl picks up a big bag of food on her way out and tosses it over her shoulder, intending to carry it for the duration of her travels.

Finally, she's free from Zetsumo. If only this had happened a week earlier, and he hadn't tried on his death bed to ensure the rest of Kenryoku was free to escape, she might be able to celebrate. It's for this reason that the teen is pretty numb the entire way home. While in another village, Kat buys several messenger birds and scrolls. Using them, she sends letters to every single one of the Kenryoku. In them, she lets everyone know to get out of Amegakure in case it's attacked.

The girl makes her way to Tea Village. Former Konoha territory.* - Mon Sep 21 00:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is wearing a white cloak, and a matching straw hat. One of those with beads that hang down over the face to conceal one's appearance -- one of those that still leave plenty of room for the wearer to see pretty clearly. For this reason one with extremely exceptional eyesight might be able to make out her face and hair color, though it's highly unlikely anyone not close to Kat would recognize her.

Being caught in in a town square full of people without a disguise at this time? No way. She'd used henge to even get into villages along the way here, and to leave, for that reason.

Palms at the moment rest on the bench at either side of her, and one leg is crossed over the other beneath her cloak. At the sight of Erebus, Kat takes a long moment to look the man up and down, with a blank expression on her hidden face.

No doubt, there are at least twenty people or so wandering the streets, with this being the town square and all. Considering this was once Konoha territory and Amegakure owned Konoha....and Kirigakure only took the village itself, it's pretty likely this is Amegakure territory. Thus even guards may be present. That is, unless Kirigakure fought any battles to take it. It is after all a neighboring village rather than something they could've taken during the Konoha battle.* - Mon Sep 21 08:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "Stop walking." she says as soon as he opens his mouth -- assuming he'd come no closer than a few feet so far.

The girl's never at any time in the past few years allowed people with kenjutsu-related professions to get close to her, unless she's in a safe place around trusted friends.

If they have a sword or other close-ranged weapon then it's always clear they're a specialist. Thus, she can and always does deduce that she'd likely have a disadvantage up close.* - Mon Sep 21 08:49:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's interesting. Although. . . - Mon Sep 21 09:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: There will always be armies. If you get rid of all the villages, and an army rises up, who will fight it off? - Mon Sep 21 09:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And keep it from doing what it wants with us all. - Mon Sep 21 09:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Armies are meant to fight against enemies. The world I have in mind has no enemies, for enemies are only formed with understanding and acceptance are shoved under the rug to rot. - Mon Sep 21 09:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Changing the entire world. . . - Mon Sep 21 09:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Much bigger dream than mine. A lot harder to accomplish. That's why I chose a 'small' goal. - Mon Sep 21 09:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: My goal is bigger, yes, but our paths will cross eventually.. - Mon Sep 21 10:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: But by then we'd be in contradiction to one another. - Mon Sep 21 10:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If we walk alongside each other, we form that understanding and acceptance. - Mon Sep 21 10:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Which goes back to my statement of enemies only forming when understanding and acceptance is nonexistant. - Mon Sep 21 10:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And how would you accomplish this? - Mon Sep 21 10:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A world where no one's misunderstanding each other at all. - Mon Sep 21 10:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just getting rid of the villages? - Mon Sep 21 10:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow everyone to experience life from the get-go. Release them from the cage of the village-system, allow them to explore and find their mind and soul. - Mon Sep 21 10:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: In turn, they'll find someone with their own beliefs. - Mon Sep 21 10:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Similar.. to their own beliefs. - Mon Sep 21 10:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Allow them to progress together. - Mon Sep 21 10:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Let them find another person, and another person. - Mon Sep 21 10:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Eventually, you'll have more than just a group of people, but an entire family.. - Mon Sep 21 10:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: ..Family.. - Mon Sep 21 10:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Fam.. ily.. - Mon Sep 21 10:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: That word reminds me of something I never had. - Mon Sep 21 10:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Fam.. I love you. - Mon Sep 21 10:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ride or die. - Mon Sep 21 10:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Interesting but as you said our paths would cross eventually. Not sure I like your goal more than mine. - Mon Sep 21 10:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've already played conquerer's sidekick once. - Mon Sep 21 10:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: If our paths meet at a later date, even I am unsure if we'll be on the same neutral terms we are at now- - Mon Sep 21 10:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I seek partners, not servants. - Mon Sep 21 10:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I...might be willing to help, then. - Mon Sep 21 10:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I can't say I'm a fan of 'any' of the current villages. - Mon Sep 21 10:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Then my cause should appeal to you more. - Mon Sep 21 10:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's true. If I ever 'were' to claim a certain village. . . - Mon Sep 21 10:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kirigakure would wrong us eventually. Kumogakure maybe. Sunagakure, maybe. - Mon Sep 21 10:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Kirigakure seems to attract a lot of hate; that will be my first project. - Mon Sep 21 10:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Exactly as I'd prefer it. - Mon Sep 21 10:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure how much use I'd be to you, though. My face is probably a bit known by now. - Mon Sep 21 10:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Wear your face with pride, for it is your face that will be statued once we recreate this world. - Mon Sep 21 10:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll go ahead and give you a fair warning. I'm a coward. - Mon Sep 21 10:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I only followed certain other people into battle even though their plans were bad because I was forced to. - Mon Sep 21 10:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Understood. - Mon Sep 21 10:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Sounds like an adventure. - Mon Sep 21 10:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing, still staring. Studying.

Looking for holes in stories.* - Mon Sep 21 10:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: State your sins. - Mon Sep 21 10:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Wasn't there to prevent my old best friend's death . . . I think that's a sin since I probably could've saved her had I been there. - Mon Sep 21 10:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I felt real shit cause of that. - Mon Sep 21 10:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: State your cause. - Mon Sep 21 10:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Mon Sep 21 10:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: My cause is to follow my heart at all times. I will always do what it tells me. - Mon Sep 21 10:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: What does your heart say? - Mon Sep 21 10:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Protect all my close friends no matter what. - Mon Sep 21 10:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Understood. - Mon Sep 21 10:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But . . . So far . . . My heart has led me to doing some good things. - Mon Sep 21 10:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: Those being? - Mon Sep 21 10:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . One of my friends got . . . sexually assaulted . . . I managed to get back at the person who did that with her. Made me feel real good when I did that. - Mon Sep 21 10:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sadly . . . From what I know . . . She's gone now . . . Nothing I could've done about that either. - Mon Sep 21 10:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: I see.. - Mon Sep 21 10:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Sep 21 10:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's eyes wander. They've been here for a long while, after all. The girl's legs part beneath her cloak -- one of her boots having been visble even up until now --  and she rises to her feet. At a lazy pace she turns and wanders over to Kilm's side. The hat is still held in her right hand. Her left hand finds her hip, since this person has no pockets, and her weight shifts a tiny bit.

"Anyway." she says, sying the scythe guy and casually glancing over at Kilm.
"Sake?"* - Mon Sep 21 10:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Err . . . Sure. - Mon Sep 21 10:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Sep 21 10:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) needs a moment to compose herself after witnessing the display. Eventually though she nods. "You're welcome to join us, Scythe guy." she says, against her better judgement.

The teen then turns on her heel and begins making her way to the nearest restaraunt. It hadn't occured to her when she got here that this is Amegakure territory. She'd in fact just hoped people here wouldn't recognize her, since she has definitely not made a name for herself.

The girl's only worried about people from the war somehow recognizing her despite that making no sense.

For these reasons Kat reaches up to her cloak's collar with her left hand and gently pulls the strings there apart. The garment is left to fall to the ground, and Kat tosses her hat over her shoulder as well, leaving it to roll along the ground for a great distance.* - Mon Sep 21 11:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and continues walking.* - Mon Sep 21 11:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: By the way.. - Mon Sep 21 11:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) says: The name is Erebus.. - Mon Sep 21 11:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm Kilm. - Mon Sep 21 11:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Katsune. - Mon Sep 21 11:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits down. Palms rest at either side of her and eyes wander.

"Not sure I wanna drink, honestly." she says.* - Mon Sep 21 11:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Only said that to get out of that atmosphere. - Mon Sep 21 11:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's fine. - Mon Sep 21 11:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wasn't sure either. - Mon Sep 21 11:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I won't say all that's happened recently wasn't unexpected . . . Though . . . I have no idea what now. - Mon Sep 21 11:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wondering if it's wise to stay here. - Mon Sep 21 11:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's possible Kirigakure would hunt us down. - Mon Sep 21 11:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People don't know we were slaves after all. - Mon Sep 21 11:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mmh . . . Tethys could've convinced them that we were . . . He did say he thought that killing zetsumo would make us free. - Mon Sep 21 11:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Though he also might've kept that to himself. - Mon Sep 21 11:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Amegakure must still have 'some' soldiers left. Kirigakure could attack, but not without losing lives -- unless Kenshin does all the fighting himself. - Mon Sep 21 11:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Which he can. - Mon Sep 21 11:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 21 11:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll assume that was Kenshin anyway. Whoever it was moved so fast he took out our entire army in a single assault, by himself. - Mon Sep 21 11:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . .I'd heard the stories, but wasn't expecting 'that' much speed. - Mon Sep 21 11:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yet to see him himself. - Mon Sep 21 11:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . You mentioned your goal. - Mon Sep 21 11:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What'd I say? - Mon Sep 21 11:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't remember. - Mon Sep 21 11:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Only that you have a small goal. - Mon Sep 21 11:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not what it is though. - Mon Sep 21 11:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's what I was going to ask. - Mon Sep 21 11:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not much of a "goal" really. - Mon Sep 21 11:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just something that's on my mind. - Mon Sep 21 11:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Mind telling me? - Mon Sep 21 11:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Orakuru wanted to take Konoha and make it perfect. - Mon Sep 21 11:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: A place where people could train and grow up as shinobi without being beaten and abused. - Mon Sep 21 11:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You want to do that? - Mon Sep 21 11:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Mon Sep 21 11:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have no home, and Kirigakure's not a good place to be. - Mon Sep 21 11:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So why not make one? - Mon Sep 21 11:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah . . . - Mon Sep 21 11:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just a thought, though. Not a 'plan.' Only mentioned it because that guy was shady. - Mon Sep 21 11:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 21 11:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . I want to do something that i've never got to do . . . Regretted not being able to do it. - Mon Sep 21 11:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Probably already talked about it a few times as well. - Mon Sep 21 11:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah? - Mon Sep 21 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly my only plan right now is to relax. - Mon Sep 21 11:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't care about building a utopia. - Mon Sep 21 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm free for the first time in five years. - Mon Sep 21 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I intend to take advantage. - Mon Sep 21 11:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Will you want to come with me to Kumogakure for that one thing I want to do? - Mon Sep 21 11:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It'll be a quick visit. - Mon Sep 21 11:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Depends. What are you doing? - Mon Sep 21 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Visiting a grave . . . If it's there. - Mon Sep 21 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kumogakure's far away...and probably dangerous. - Mon Sep 21 11:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ushinawa is raikage . . . He could let us in for a bit. - Mon Sep 21 11:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Didn't realize that. . . - Mon Sep 21 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might be a good place to stay for a while in that case. - Mon Sep 21 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should we send a letter first, asking if we can enter? - Mon Sep 21 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Want me to send it? - Mon Sep 21 11:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure.... - Mon Sep 21 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I've managed to keep in contact with him through birds long ago . . . Can probably stay in contact. - Mon Sep 21 11:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Mon Sep 21 11:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Ah. - Mon Sep 21 11:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He gave the title to Niza. - Mon Sep 21 11:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am on good terms with Niza too. I used to work with him. I will ask him. - Mon Sep 21 11:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. - Mon Sep 21 11:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How did he take Kumogakure without killing Niza? - Mon Sep 21 11:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He spared him. - Mon Sep 21 11:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Defeated but spared him. - Mon Sep 21 11:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't want to stay in Kumogakure. - Mon Sep 21 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just rest there for a while. - Mon Sep 21 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Think we can do that without getting roped into staying? - Mon Sep 21 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The plan was never to wear a Kumogakure headband. - Mon Sep 21 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yes. - Mon Sep 21 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We visit the grave and then we can leave whenever. - Mon Sep 21 11:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We should ask in the letter...just to be sure. I've heard very bad things about that village. - Mon Sep 21 11:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Mon Sep 21 11:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're finally free from Zetsumo. Free to do whatever we want. - Mon Sep 21 11:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Indeed. - Mon Sep 21 11:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Can't risk wasting it and just becoming slaves to someone else. - Mon Sep 21 11:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I already mentioned in the message that we're not going to become his shinobi. - Mon Sep 21 11:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Just going to rest for a bit and leave whenever we feel like it - Mon Sep 21 11:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly the weirdo scythe guy made some good points. What do 'you' think about what he said? - Mon Sep 21 11:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I think that there can never be an everlasting peace . . . Even through understanding one another. - Mon Sep 21 11:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Whatever he's trying to do . . . If he manages to do it . . . It'll be only temporary at best. - Mon Sep 21 11:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Sounds as delusional as Zetsumo. Never bought into Zetsumo's philosophy. Just knew he'd beat me halfway to death if I told him so. - Mon Sep 21 11:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Although. . . - Mon Sep 21 12:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds to me like that much was just...fluff. - Mon Sep 21 12:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And his only real goal is to get rid of the shinobi village system. - Mon Sep 21 12:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No more slavery. - Mon Sep 21 12:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not that he can actually succeed. 'Course I'm not dumb enough to imagine that. - Mon Sep 21 12:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zetsumo thought he could conquer the entire world. Kirigakure alone was too much for 'im in the end. - Mon Sep 21 12:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even we were led to believe that Zetsumo would win the war. - Mon Sep 21 12:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Guess not. - Mon Sep 21 12:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Well, he 'was' strong. This scythe guy, though. He's gotta be out of his mind. Dude smelled, even. - Mon Sep 21 12:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Doubt he's overly strong. . .I mean, Zetsumo's level of strong. - Mon Sep 21 12:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Which is what he'd need to be. - Mon Sep 21 12:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even if he was on Zetsumo's level of strong . . . Kinda doubt he'd win. - Mon Sep 21 12:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Thnk 'we' could ever be on Zetsumo's level? - Mon Sep 21 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not gonna lie. - Mon Sep 21 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm considering retiring. - Mon Sep 21 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: How come? - Mon Sep 21 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just from fighting. - Mon Sep 21 12:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Because, I'm kind've exhausted. - Mon Sep 21 12:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't plan on retirement yet. - Mon Sep 21 12:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Guess you haven't been fighting as much as I have. You were at none of the major battles. - Mon Sep 21 12:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah . . . Probably exactly why. - Mon Sep 21 12:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You'll still train, right? - Mon Sep 21 12:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno. - Mon Sep 21 12:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Mon Sep 21 12:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tired of barking at people though. Only did that because of the situation Zetsumo  put me in. - Mon Sep 21 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Tired of being barked at, too. - Mon Sep 21 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't think anyone will bark at you anymore now. - Mon Sep 21 12:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Might be nice to just stay in a village like this one. - Mon Sep 21 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not a shinobi village. Just a homey place. - Mon Sep 21 12:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You want to get a home here? - Mon Sep 21 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where there isn't any real threat of war. - Mon Sep 21 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Mon Sep 21 12:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: This village is pretty quiet and nice. - Mon Sep 21 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even if Amegakure is next door. - Mon Sep 21 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 12:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Yeah . . . A house here would be cool. - Mon Sep 21 12:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should I send a letter to Zenaki? - Mon Sep 21 12:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's weak. Can't defend herself if attacked. - Mon Sep 21 12:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Can't leave a friend behind. - Mon Sep 21 12:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You should. - Mon Sep 21 12:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 21 12:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Hm . . . I feel slightly bad after saying that . . . Probably cause I did something once that goes against what I said . . . Don't remember when though. - Mon Sep 21 12:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not a bad idea. - Mon Sep 21 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The gezo would be on my ass unless I become a sergeant. - Mon Sep 21 12:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is still way too tsundere to apologize. Like, ever.* - Mon Sep 21 14:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Where should we train? - Mon Sep 21 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This plaza...thing looks bad for earth jutsus. We'd break it. - Mon Sep 21 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Town would likely be mad. - Mon Sep 21 14:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Plaza reminds me of the training spot in Kumogakure. - Mon Sep 21 14:09:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like I said. - Mon Sep 21 14:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can't train here. We'd break the ground with earth jutsus. - Mon Sep 21 14:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 21 14:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: As Zetsumo was dying. - Mon Sep 21 14:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 21 14:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It seemed like he was trying to make it possible for all of us to escape. - Mon Sep 21 14:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Me and Sabo, and Amai. - Mon Sep 21 14:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . He sacrificed himself? - Mon Sep 21 14:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not sure. I might be jumping to conclusions. - Mon Sep 21 14:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just what it looked like. - Mon Sep 21 14:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If he was really honestly doing that then that was noble of him. - Mon Sep 21 14:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 21 14:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zenaki's in Kirigakure. Ushinawa brought her there. . . - Mon Sep 21 14:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . Strange. - Mon Sep 21 14:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Zenaki never wanted to work for Zetsumo? - Mon Sep 21 14:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He forced her. His own sister. - Mon Sep 21 14:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No you didn't. - Mon Sep 21 14:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Same as he did to us. - Mon Sep 21 14:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Apparently Ushinawa's kidnapping people now. - Mon Sep 21 14:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did you tell him where we are? - Mon Sep 21 14:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not at all. - Mon Sep 21 14:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should I ask him what's up with that? - Mon Sep 21 14:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hm. My last letter to Zenaki told her where we were. Hope it wasn't read by anyone other than her. Probably not. - Mon Sep 21 14:34:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ushinawa's always been secretive. He was never okay with Zetsumo's ideals and only joined him to take out Kirigakure, supposedly. - Mon Sep 21 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's possible he was a spy all along. - Mon Sep 21 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And now he's with Kirigakure. - Mon Sep 21 14:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yep. He said he hated them. Now he's working with them? Either he was spying on Zetsumo, or he's spying on them. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or both. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: From how much I know him. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd say both. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He's calculating, That's for sure. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way, Zenaki doesn't deserve this. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You want to get her back? - Mon Sep 21 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's wait for her letter, if there is one. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's possible they'll interogate her to find out where we are. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe we should meet up with scythe guy soon. - Mon Sep 21 14:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If they send for us, I doubt they'll send Kenshin. - Mon Sep 21 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can handle most people. - Mon Sep 21 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 21 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: No killing, though. Understand? - Mon Sep 21 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If we kill, we'll just make someone's friends angry. - Mon Sep 21 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then they'll be willing to kill. - Mon Sep 21 14:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Us. - Mon Sep 21 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Something Zetsumo never understood. - Mon Sep 21 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll hold back then. - Mon Sep 21 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- That's not me being soft either. This is just the smart way to do things if we want to live. - Mon Sep 21 14:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that. I wouldn't want to kill any of them anyway. - Mon Sep 21 14:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) receives another scroll. After reading it, the girl makes eye contact with Kilm and rolls it up. She silently offers it to him so he can read it himself.* - Mon Sep 21 14:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Okay. - Mon Sep 21 14:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Weird, right? - Mon Sep 21 14:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Huh . . . Ever noticed anything about his eyes? - Mon Sep 21 14:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not really. They did seem a bit different at one time...but I rarely look at him. - Mon Sep 21 14:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Mon Sep 21 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I feel kinda bad for him but...he still makes me uncomfortable. - Mon Sep 21 14:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He only has Zenaki now as family . . . Kinda feel bad for him too. - Mon Sep 21 14:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If people try to start slaughtering Kenryoku people left and right now that Zetsumo's dead, we should help them. They can help us stay alive in return. - Mon Sep 21 14:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kenshin showed no mercy in Kirigakure. He could've let those thousands of soldiers just go home...but he didn't. - Mon Sep 21 14:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We have no reason to believe they won't kill us if they find us. - Mon Sep 21 14:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My guess is Kenshin will be made Mizukage now. That other woman wasn't liked. - Mon Sep 21 14:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: They called her a traitor for surrendering. - Mon Sep 21 14:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 21 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We must help them. - Mon Sep 21 14:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's not just nice. It's smart. - Mon Sep 21 14:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 21 14:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Let's go now or later? - Mon Sep 21 14:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's wait. I sent her another letter. - Mon Sep 21 14:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: She's asking Ushinawa if she can leave. - Mon Sep 21 14:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Best to wait, right? - Mon Sep 21 14:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 21 14:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So.... - Mon Sep 21 15:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Ushinawa had Suitengo. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Let's just...think about that for a second. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Such a strong...guarded man. Quiet, secretive. Daring to carry around not only a child but...Suitengo of all children. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This is a bit weird, isn't it? Suspicious weird. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He has plans . . . Definitely has plans. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I don't think the end of the war signifies peace yet. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Or rather . . . It won't last long. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It sounds like he actually used Suitengo as a hostage and actually kidnapped Zenaki. - Mon Sep 21 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I wonder why he would do that. - Mon Sep 21 15:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Plans for Zetsumo's family perhaps. - Mon Sep 21 15:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't think they'd be hostages to lure us out...would they? Doubt anyone would care about us. - Mon Sep 21 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not to be rude but we're both pretty insignificant. - Mon Sep 21 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Either way this doesn't make much sense. - Mon Sep 21 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why kidnap Zenaki? - Mon Sep 21 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It doesn't at all. - Mon Sep 21 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Why not just kill her if he was that low? - Mon Sep 21 15:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: At times like this, I wish I hadn't killed Orakuru. He was strong. If his plans had been any good he'd have been unstoppable. - Mon Sep 21 15:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Maybe he plans to use them to get revenge on Kirigakure from the inside? - Mon Sep 21 15:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Why would he use them out of all people though? - Mon Sep 21 15:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Suitengu definitely has potential . . . He could've seen that. - Mon Sep 21 15:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Highly doubt it...but using her for personal gain at any rate...that hadn't crossed my mind. - Mon Sep 21 15:12:00 2015
