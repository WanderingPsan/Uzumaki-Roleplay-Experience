The girl places herself west of Tetsu, with an eyebrow lifted. She'd only just now realized what was going on over here.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fine, We can train in the basement. - Mon Oct  5 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhhmm. - Mon Oct  5 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I set up the corpses as dummies. So that'll work.  - Mon Oct  5 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should we take this new guy to train with us? - Mon Oct  5 15:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eventually follows with a shrug.* - Mon Oct  5 15:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Ah we probably can. - Mon Oct  5 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I do not mind. - Mon Oct  5 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: New guy, What's your name? - Mon Oct  5 15:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Learius. - Mon Oct  5 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Learius, Want to come train with us? - Mon Oct  5 15:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Sure, I guess. - Mon Oct  5 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright, Follow us. - Mon Oct  5 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Ugh, training. - Mon Oct  5 15:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: three* - Mon Oct  5 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) senses Zenaki's hand moving in motions that suggests the locking of a door, having been sensing her out due to her back being turned. She continues lazily walking though as if she'd noticed nothing. After all, it's probably not a big deal, legitimately.

Arms cross as she makes her way down.

Rather than sitting, Kat only stares blankly at the blood.

This 'is' Kat. She's seen much worse.* - Mon Oct  5 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What jutsu? - Mon Oct  5 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts her right fist to her mouth and quietly clears her throat. A weak, cheeky smile is on her face for the moment.

Katsune backs away, opting out of this test. She plants her back to the wall somewhere and watches the three of them.* - Mon Oct  5 16:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Chakra scalpels. Zetsumo wanted me to learn this a while back. But I am still testing it. No worries. I can heel you if you get hurt.  - Mon Oct  5 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: heal* - Mon Oct  5 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 16:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ...? So? - Mon Oct  5 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If...it makes you feel any better, no lock or walls in the world can hold me. - Mon Oct  5 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says this to Learius with her eyes averted.* - Mon Oct  5 16:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: To enter or not to enter. - Mon Oct  5 16:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. She studies Zenaki's body language though.* - Mon Oct  5 16:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We should really get to know you, Learius. - Mon Oct  5 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: There is no one creepier than you, Zenaki. - Mon Oct  5 16:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. Mmm.. Looks powerfull. - Mon Oct  5 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) flinches a bit. The girl gently pulls herself off of the wall in the same motion, and she stares. Her nose turns up a bit, as if she's assessing the situation. Eyes are locked onto Taiga's arm. Senses begin focusing on him, though not until after the damage is done -- meaning she learns nothing at this time.

Eyes then find Larius's.

She stares.* - Mon Oct  5 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: So . . . What can you do, Learius? - Mon Oct  5 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: I tend to hold back a lot of my words. - Mon Oct  5 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fighting wise . . . What can you do? - Mon Oct  5 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Well the screams stopped, things must be okay. . - Mon Oct  5 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Well.. My fire jutsu is very strong.. I have the ability to use storm release.. And I kinda have a little affinity for Earth... - Mon Oct  5 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Storm release hm? Great. - Mon Oct  5 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: What's that bumping sound I hear? - Mon Oct  5 17:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Should I knock? Hm.  - Mon Oct  5 17:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do not give her your blood. - Mon Oct  5 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That's the same as asking me to give her my blood. - Mon Oct  5 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I wouldn't be surprised if you were a distant or close relative towards me since I have no idea what my family is or was. - Mon Oct  5 17:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. - Mon Oct  5 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. With that, Kat begins walking forwards, even with a swagger.

Without any hesitation or pause whatsoever, Kat lifts her left arm with a hand clenched into a fist. She plants the fist to the side of Zenaki's head if allowed.

Right on it.

Kat's weight shifts a bit. With a cold expression on her face she says.

"I'm sorry what Zenaki? You're....making demands now?"

Her head tilts a bit.* - Mon Oct  5 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: I do not see myself being able to stop her from taking it, besides you just shoved me into this experiment. Why should I listen to you? - Mon Oct  5 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Because I'm getting you out of it. - Mon Oct  5 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Too late it already happened did it not? - Mon Oct  5 17:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Was only a cut . . . It's healed now . . .  - Mon Oct  5 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The true experiment would be you giving her your blood. - Mon Oct  5 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Only a cut? - Mon Oct  5 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Maybe you should ask her to do it to you so you see how it feels? - Mon Oct  5 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I will consider it. - Mon Oct  5 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: As for your elements . . .  - Mon Oct  5 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They're exactly the same as mine. - Mon Oct  5 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: No, do it now. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Considering that you have storm release. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: As in right now. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Naw . . . I'm not doing it. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: These arms had enough trouble recently. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I almost lost them. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Then I see no reason to withold my blood. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fine, Zenaki, Cut me. - Mon Oct  5 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Zenaki. - Mon Oct  5 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You had your fun with fujitora recently . . . Should be enough for the month. - Mon Oct  5 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Not reallgy. - Mon Oct  5 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: really* - Mon Oct  5 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lets Zenaki take her gauntlet-clad wrist. Her stare doesn't break.

She simply lifts her right arm in response, and keeps her right fist aimed at the woman instead.

It's not pressed to her skin, but it's there. One may wonder what she thinks she's going to do with it.

Judging by her eyes, nothing pleasant.* - Mon Oct  5 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: I know what she's going to do . . . That explosion fist that she destroyed my side with yesterday. - Mon Oct  5 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Who in the world, dares to knock. - Mon Oct  5 17:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins slowly shaking her head as her hand is moved. She allows it.

"If you...." she begins, pausing dramatically.

"'Ever'....touch my hands like that again when I'm giving you friendly warnings....you'll regret it, close friend and former comreade Zenaki." * - Mon Oct  5 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Former? - Mon Oct  5 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Work. On. Your social skills. - Mon Oct  5 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Friendly warnings, hm? - Mon Oct  5 17:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Someone's feeling confident today. - Mon Oct  5 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Oh? - Mon Oct  5 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm trying not to kill you. - Mon Oct  5 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I like you. - Mon Oct  5 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Stop...puffing....your -chest-. - Mon Oct  5 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: My chest? You need more -puff- in it then I do. - Mon Oct  5 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Nope . . . - Mon Oct  5 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Okay . . . Time to bet. - Mon Oct  5 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Her explosion jutsu to my side . . . Then Zenaki cuts me in the right arm. - Mon Oct  5 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Then I get pushed to the side. - Mon Oct  5 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Mhm . . . Greatest idea to stand in between them. - Mon Oct  5 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) thinks: Hmm.. If he dies to them, then he wont have to worry what happens to my blood. - Mon Oct  5 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is pushed back by Kilm apparently, considering her's and Zenaki's arms were joined.

They part at this time, only to rest at her sides.

Briefly she glances between Zenaki and the boy, though she rests her eyes on Kilm, as if to silently ask "Wtf are you doin?"

She says no words though.* - Mon Oct  5 17:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Please don't fight. - Mon Oct  5 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has bigger breasts though. . .* - Mon Oct  5 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: ....Fine. - Mon Oct  5 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Anyway, since I don't like peoples' tones..... - Mon Oct  5 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We should leave. - Mon Oct  5 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Don't break my door. - Mon Oct  5 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That's my advice anyway. 'I' am leaving either way. - Mon Oct  5 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . Yeah. - Mon Oct  5 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns on her heel and begins walking, at a lazy pace. The girl makes her way to the door. Considering Zenaki had locked it from the inside, it's probably easy for Kat to unlock it herself?

If so, she does so. If so, she then opens the door and walks out, leaving said door open behind her.* - Mon Oct  5 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It's best I leave as well . . . Maybe you too Learius. - Mon Oct  5 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: You didnt get cut yet - Mon Oct  5 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fine . . . Cut me Zenaki - Mon Oct  5 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cause this guy will give you blood if you don't cut me. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Good. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Cut me? - Mon Oct  5 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Then I will not cut you. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fuck. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Or can I have your blood? - Mon Oct  5 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Nope. Can't have it. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: First. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Says me. The 'boss'. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: Why do you want it? - Mon Oct  5 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Boy. Don't give this woman what she wants. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe you don't have reason to tell her no but we do. - Mon Oct  5 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: . . . He sure had a nope face. - Mon Oct  5 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) had stopped in the doorway. Both hands had found her hips, and her weight shifted a bit. Eyes remain to the south.

She resumes walking though, should she sense people following.* - Mon Oct  5 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Taiga, Leave and don't look back. - Mon Oct  5 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . So, the training didn't work out? - Mon Oct  5 17:34:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The training did not work out. - Mon Oct  5 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: I'm so confused right now. - Mon Oct  5 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) raises her voice to make sure Zenaki can hear her, as she leaves. "Have a good day, Zenaki." she says.

"See you tommorrow."* - Mon Oct  5 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Uhm, Zenaki. .  Is everything alright? - Mon Oct  5 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I'm fine. - Mon Oct  5 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do not provoke her, Taiga. - Mon Oct  5 17:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pauses for a moment to wait for Kilm and Learius. Eventually though, she shakes her head and resumes walking away, alone.* - Mon Oct  5 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Why are you guys scared? - Mon Oct  5 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I didn't do anything? - Mon Oct  5 17:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Could you explain to me what happened Zenaki? - Mon Oct  5 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Rule number one, Learius . . . Don't give Zenaki your blood. - Mon Oct  5 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants herself behind Kilm and Learius. About two seconds too late unfortunately. Either way, she whispers a few words to them.* - Mon Oct  5 17:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: 'Ey. You two. - Mon Oct  5 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Say nothing about what happened. Alright? - Mon Oct  5 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Nothing at all. "Zenaki's a nice and unsuspicious lady." Got it? - Mon Oct  5 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Learius(Josh1220) says: I have no idea about anything that just happened. - Mon Oct  5 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Okay. - Mon Oct  5 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods and walks away.* - Mon Oct  5 17:39:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'll just head back to training. - Mon Oct  5 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) lifts an eyebrow and makes eye contact with Hassan. She stares.* - Mon Oct  5 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah? - Mon Oct  5 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm. Nothing. - Mon Oct  5 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks away.

Never good to assume.* - Mon Oct  5 17:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) begins walking, to follow him.

"-- Although..." she says.

"If I'm having help, we might want to take it somewhere bigger. I'd rather not hit my team mate by accident and disintigrate them."* - Tue Oct  6 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Ehehe. - Tue Oct  6 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I see. - Tue Oct  6 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: You two may have the first move. - Tue Oct  6 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes a moment to actually crack her knuckles. Not a very lady-like thing to do but she does it anyway.

Afterwords she slowly draws her right foot backwards through the sand. Arms rise, and hands clench partially as if to mimic claws.

"I'll admit." she says.

"I may be out of chakra after one hit, depending on what I'm using. I'm still training this technique...so it knocks me out after two uses."* - Tue Oct  6 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms rise. The teen's hands meet shortly afterwords even as she kneels down, to form the tiger seal. Immediately afterwords, now already in close proximity to the ground, Kat slams her hands into the ground.

Chakra races invisibly through the ground. Once it reaches Tetsumi, should it ever do so, it moulds the earth beneath him.

Abruptly, walls of rock as hard as steel begin rising up around him. Said rock forms a rather large dome. It spans fourty feet or so in any direction, though its height stops at twelve feet or so.

There's one opening, and that's to the west. It's big enough for roughly two Trilliam-sized people to squeeze through.

The clones.

Immediately after forming the corridor, Kat sprints forwards, moving as a blur to most eyes.

She intends to plant herself just north of Tetsumi -- very close to the wall. Her senses are locked onto the boy, to keep track of where he is since she can't see him right now.* - Tue Oct  6 03:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) thinks: That's an epic earth technique...Maybe she'll teach me. - Tue Oct  6 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is sprinting forwards even as Tetsumi's sand comes out of his gourd. Using Suimen, she runs on top of her dome.

And then?

Should she successfully meet him in time, now standing nearly directly above him(Close enough to avoid the iron sand drill she senses), Kat would come skidding to a stop. Mid-stride she kneels down, and attempts to ram her right fist into the dome's cieling.

Should Kat succeed....the dome would be a medium, as was intended from the beginning. A medium for her Landmine Fist.

The girl had never hoped to trap Tetsumi. Only to make him blind to her incoming jutsu.

Should Jiki manage to beat her to the cieling, though, Kat's fist would still hit the dome. Either way, a massive explosion is sent in his direction from nearly point-blank range, if not point-blank entirely.

With an incredibly loud, gunshot-like, reverberating bang, the ground would shake. Even the nearby buildings shake. The explosion can only be compared to a beam, as it covers a great distance(http://i.imgur.com/zaGMMDS.png).* - Tue Oct  6 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Note: Explosions pack concussive force. They knock back.* - Tue Oct  6 04:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns and begins sprinting away as she senses Tetsumi's attacks. Even as she turns, she's reaching up to form the tiger handseal.

Roughly, she'd then shove chakra throughout her body. The shunshin jutsu is used, and she flickers out of sight.

The girl would reappear to the west, pretty much where she'd been when the spar began.

She comes skidding to a stop, her body turning to face Tetsumi mid-stop.

A weak, almost-cheeky smile is on her face.

Part of her's just happy he's not dead.

This is the jutsu that put Kilm out of a spar instantly, after all.* - Tue Oct  6 04:34:20 2015
