<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhm. . . - Fri Sep 25 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) makes her way east of the hokage mansion yet again. While she'd been away, Kat had assigned one of Konoha's genin a mission. She'd paid them to come here and place rods all along the mountain for the stretch of an entire mile. They're all metal and very sturdy. They also...are fairly short. 

Just enough for two feet to rest on. Using Suimen, Kat slowly and lazily scales the mountain wall. She passes many of these rods along the way, but doesn't stop upon reaching the closest one available. She goes all the way to the top. Eventually, the teen is two-hundred feet above-ground.

Once there, she places herself on one of these rods and faces the east. A slow, shakey, and deep breath is taken. The kage's right leg rises slowly behind her, and her right hand finds it. For a long moment, she stretches the leg. The other leg follows, and then each arm.

Wouldn't want cramps to ruin her day and be responsible for her death. She cracks her neck on both sides. Eventually Kat's done telling herself she's not just hesitating. Arms rise and hands meet to form the tiger seal. Abruptly, she shoves chakra throughout her body.

All nerves are set on fire, and they very strongly compel Kat to sprint forwards. Naturally she does so. The woman moves as a blur to some of the best eyes, and instantaneously to most. Feet ram roughly into each and every rod in her path. She's forced to leap from one to another at the dazzling speed.

Eventually, she's come to a stop. An eyebrow twitches, and both feet are pressed side-by-side on one of the rods she'd had prepared. The teen's chest rise and falls fairly quickly, and she sways to and fro just a bit from how dizzy the technique makes her. Having just used the shunshin jutsu, she struggles to use Suimen. It's not impossible as it's not even a jutsu, but it's difficult.* - Fri Sep 25 20:42:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not a single word off? - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's important to be specific when talking about something someone said. - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . More precisely . . . She asked if we rebuilt Konohagakure into an illegal village once more. - Fri Sep 25 21:22:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . I think the first words I said were nonsense . . . Since I wasn't 100 percent sure. - Fri Sep 25 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Whether or not we were such a village. - Fri Sep 25 21:24:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: A private just signifies you being a true jounin. - Fri Sep 25 21:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And he claimed to be my sword, shield, and armor. That's the only reason I was brave enough to accept this position. - Fri Sep 25 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can, though . . . Usually . . . At mornings . . . - Fri Sep 25 21:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People don't realize that because Erebus tries to keep his involvement a secret. - Fri Sep 25 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If I died, Erebus would just assign someone else. - Fri Sep 25 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I really want him to stop getting involved with Konohagakure . . . - Fri Sep 25 21:45:36 2015

"You're acting weird. . ." she says, a bit quietly.* - Fri Sep 25 21:49:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We are seen as a potential threat by Kiri and now Seisuke probably doesn't like us. - Fri Sep 25 21:49:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well, Erebus pissed Seisuke off . . . Because of that, I think Seisuke hates not only him but us too . . . - Fri Sep 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And Kiri labeled us as a threat, Which means they are weary of us. - Fri Sep 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . A potential one anyway. - Fri Sep 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gently pushes herself off of the bar she's on. The teen's feet land with a soft pat on the grass, and she stares up at the teen that's much taller than she is. Eye contact is maintained, and her frown remains.* - Fri Sep 25 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Are you sleepy right now? - Fri Sep 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Slightly. - Fri Sep 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Have you been stressed? - Fri Sep 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not realy. - Fri Sep 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm.... - Fri Sep 25 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I -need- you to get better at your social skills. - Fri Sep 25 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Fri Sep 25 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches up with her right hand to place her palm on Kilm's vest. The teen tightens her grip on it a bit, and gently tugs at it a few times. Eye contact is maintained all the while.

"This vest. . ." she says, with a stern look in her eyes.
"Means that you have great analytical skills and always think before acting. That means you think before speaking, too."

Kat takes her hand back. Her head tilts just a tiny bit.

"Right now, you're proving to me that you definitely have neither of those things. That worries me."* - Fri Sep 25 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay . . . I might've not thought before saying anything then. - Fri Sep 25 21:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You're speaking to a kage. Someone that takes any information you give her. . . - Fri Sep 25 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And uses it to protect the village. And yet you give me such poor information...out of context. Choosing very poor words.... - Fri Sep 25 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do you know how important it is that I have clear information? Clear and -complete- information? - Fri Sep 25 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll answer to your questions more specifically and not speak anything that is unrelated then. - Fri Sep 25 21:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Or is bad information. - Fri Sep 25 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not what I want to hear, Kilm. - Fri Sep 25 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. Both arms rise and her hands find the teen's vest. Gently and carefully, she begins unfastening his vest.

"I'm sorry but I have to take this away." she says.

"I can't put genins' lives in your hands right now."

Kat would begin circling the teen to more easily remove the garment.

"That happened to me once, and I almost died. I can't let it happen to anyone else."* - Fri Sep 25 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Okay. - Fri Sep 25 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) holds the vest in both arms and makes her way back to the front of him. Once there, she averts her eyes.

"I shouldn't have given it to you without being sure..." she says.
"Probably makes you feel bad."* - Fri Sep 25 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No . . . It's okay. - Fri Sep 25 22:02:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: That I couldn't hold my rank for a while. - Fri Sep 25 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm the one that should be embarassed. Erebus put me on the spot in the mansion. He asked me to give you a position. - Fri Sep 25 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I felt like it'd be an insult if I said you stay genin. - Fri Sep 25 22:04:22 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You shouldn't. - Fri Sep 25 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I don't share those feelings. - Fri Sep 25 22:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With Seisuke? When I needed to talk to him? Just minutes before we'd agreed I should talk him into giving us more shinobi. And then.... - Fri Sep 25 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You didn't realize that's what I was doing? - Fri Sep 25 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . I didn't . . . You're right . . . It gets in the way. - Fri Sep 25 22:11:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . - Fri Sep 25 22:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . If I don't think, I say bad things . . . If I think I get someone in trouble . . . - Fri Sep 25 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So that's it. - Fri Sep 25 22:19:44 2015

"Earn this vest, and I'll give you a date." she says.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What makes them think that? - Fri Sep 25 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They think that because he focused on his body durability for taijutsu attacks that he has a weakness in Ninjutsu . . . - Fri Sep 25 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I believe that he might also have a weakness to genjutsu for focusing on that. - Fri Sep 25 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: They didn't discuss about genjutsu though. - Fri Sep 25 22:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm very serious. - Fri Sep 25 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Listen... - Fri Sep 25 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) wanders up to where she's in front of him again and peers up at him from there. With her challenged height, it probably makes her look much -less- intimidating if anything.

"People pass on techniques when they're old and unbelievably skilled, and strong. Because at that point, they know people aren't catching up for ages anyway. Do -not- teach people without a -very- good reason. You're not there yet. You're a genin. Like me, we're still young. We should -be- someone's student. Not the teacher."* - Fri Sep 25 22:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . By showing it . . . I mean showing them how it's done on missions. - Fri Sep 25 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not the jutsu. - Fri Sep 25 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sounds good. - Fri Sep 25 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Will you uphold your promise though? - Fri Sep 25 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms cross. She turns on her heel and paces for a bit, with eyes wandering.

"Mhmm..." she says.
"You'll get a date if you earn the vest."* - Fri Sep 25 22:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Guess that just motivatesm e. - Fri Sep 25 22:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.* - Fri Sep 25 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you're a proper chuunin...a proven one. - Fri Sep 25 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Then strength is all you're really gonna need to become a jounin. - Fri Sep 25 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Keep that in mind. - Fri Sep 25 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I need to learn how to talk better. - Fri Sep 25 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. - Fri Sep 25 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Being articulare is extremely important. Orders, plans, things like that...you have to be extremely clear. - Fri Sep 25 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like earlier when I made sure you all knew who talked about painting the world red. - Fri Sep 25 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The details are everything. - Fri Sep 25 22:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll try to be more clear and tell you everything that you need to know. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Which is most likely everything. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It is, yeah. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Every single thing you tell me that I didn't know before will make me a lot more capable. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have to know 'everything.' - Fri Sep 25 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We're not strong enough for it to be any other way. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: No breathing room. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I guess so. - Fri Sep 25 22:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Are you sure you're fine with giving me a date if I earn the vest back? - Fri Sep 25 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Fri Sep 25 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's just a date. Not a contract. - Fri Sep 25 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You sure you're not telling me date as in a time? - Fri Sep 25 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dating doesn't mean we'll kiss. - Fri Sep 25 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I know that. - Fri Sep 25 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But we will have a good time. - Fri Sep 25 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm just not sure if you'll enjoy it. - Fri Sep 25 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll see. - Fri Sep 25 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I am feeling even more tired now. - Fri Sep 25 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll go to sleep. - Fri Sep 25 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: See you tomorrow. - Fri Sep 25 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good night. - Fri Sep 25 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) has her chin resting in a palm at the moment, and her elbow on her desk. Briefly she looks Maloth up and down.

"How strong are you?" she asks.* - Sat Sep 26 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did Paine beat you the other day? - Sat Sep 26 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 00:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) reaches into her desk and pulls out a leaf headband.

"Tell you what..." she says, glancing down at the accessory.

"Wear this headband and I'll give you things to do."* - Sat Sep 26 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: ...This is horribly inhumane. - Sat Sep 26 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Sat Sep 26 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) pulls open her desk drawer and begins digging through scrolls, looking to find something appropriate for such a brute.* - Sat Sep 26 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sat Sep 26 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: I can't send him to Kumogakure. He'll bother people there and hurt our relationship with them. - Sat Sep 26 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) passes Maloth a scroll. "I need you to deliver some things to Tea Village." she says.

"You look strong enough for heavy lifting. Don't die along the way."* - Sat Sep 26 00:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Do you wanna go with him, Paine? - Sat Sep 26 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He may not make it alone. - Sat Sep 26 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And you can take a third person if you're not feeling confident. - Sat Sep 26 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-umm...sure - Sat Sep 26 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: If you take a third, tell me who it was when you get back so I can pay them. - Sat Sep 26 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. The scroll is just mission details in case you forget. It tells you where to go, and.... - Sat Sep 26 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: The fastest, safest path.... - Sat Sep 26 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It also lets the client know you're one of us for sure. - Sat Sep 26 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You'll be carrying a basket full of iron bars. - Sat Sep 26 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's gonna be heavy. - Sat Sep 26 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You look like you can manage, though. - Sat Sep 26 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Iron and some other things. . . - Sat Sep 26 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Everything you need to make black steel, in fact. - Sat Sep 26 00:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . Hrm. <*Turns to Paine*> Be ready? - Sat Sep 26 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not thirsty for missions, Taiga? - Sat Sep 26 00:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I hope you're not afraid to ask. - Sat Sep 26 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hi Seisuke. - Sat Sep 26 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hey~ - Sat Sep 26 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're looking as nice as ever, How've you been? - Sat Sep 26 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kinda bored. Getting used to this job though. - Sat Sep 26 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe I can add some excitement? - Sat Sep 26 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe. - Sat Sep 26 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I believe it's tuesday as well. - Sat Sep 26 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 26 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We can go get something to drink. - Sat Sep 26 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) gently pulls herself away from her desk and rises to her feet. As she makes her way to another drawer behind said dask, she pulls off her robes and puts them away.

The girl only wears them so people can identify her as the person they need to talk to for missions. If she's not willing to do hokage duties at some time, then she doesn't need them.

Kat turns to face Seisuke afterwords. For the brief moment, her arms are crossed. She motions towards the front door with her head.* - Sat Sep 26 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stays standing for a long moment, as if hesitant. A glance is sent Seisuke's way. A slightly cold one, as if to suggest suspicion. Eventually though she sits down and faces him.

Eyes rest on the table. Arms cross, and one leg crosses over the other.* - Sat Sep 26 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: It's unfortunate Taiga's useless ass was sleeping. I wanted a guard. - Sat Sep 26 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll take whatever as long as you're willing to taste it yourself first. - Sat Sep 26 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll take whatever as long as you're willing to taste it first. - Sat Sep 26 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) briefly glances up at him. "How so?"* - Sat Sep 26 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: .... - Sat Sep 26 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What's the game? - Sat Sep 26 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I told you. - Sat Sep 26 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It'll change from day to day. - Sat Sep 26 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But since we have the wine out already. - Sat Sep 26 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Why not rock Paper Scissors? - Sat Sep 26 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We'll play three Games, If you win Two out of the Three, I'll supply you with Two Hundred and Fifty Soldiers. - Sat Sep 26 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I dunno that I should get drunk without a guard handy. Maybe if you found me before Erebus lost his mind and started ranting at you about destroying the shinobi world. - Sat Sep 26 01:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hm. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then how about this. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: It's equally as unbenficial to me. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you were to get hurt. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Therefore it isn't in my interest to hurt you. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: How would it be bad for you if I got hurt? - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Like I said. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I like to think of this world as a game. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And it's people as it's pieces. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It 'is' true that killing me would be pointless. You realized that when Erebus sent you that scroll. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If I lose a Queen, I've lost an irreplaceable piece. - Sat Sep 26 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Honestly? - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I care not for what was in the scroll. - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: There is only one thing that would make me kill you. - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And that is? - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you overstep a boundary. - Sat Sep 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I have no problem, helping you. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But when you begin feeling entitled. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You are no longer fun. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: So as long as you treat this as what it is. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A game. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You're fine. - Sat Sep 26 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) plants her right elbow on the table. Her chin finds her palm, and she stares blankly at Seisuke.

Not coldly. Not in a rude manner. Blankly. Her expression suggests nothing. It suggests she may even be in a good mood.* - Sat Sep 26 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've never won a game of this type. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not one single time. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I play them very often too. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It usually ends with me poor or embarassed. - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You embarrassed? - Sat Sep 26 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Isn't that a sight I'd like to see, But at the same token, I don't enjoy the bad embarrassment. - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not a robot. I hide my thoughts from strangers as part of my duty as hokage. - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: May I call you Katsune? - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes. - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I'd like to instate a rule then Katsune. - Sat Sep 26 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: What rule? - Sat Sep 26 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If at any point, you feel to embarrassed throughout any part of the game, I will allow you to reject the turn at no penalty---Afterall, A game in which one is made uncomfortable in a bad way. Isn't much fun at all...Is it? - Sat Sep 26 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: At the same token, I will not exercise this rule for myself. - Sat Sep 26 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Sat Sep 26 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Fine. - Sat Sep 26 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'll play some games. - Sat Sep 26 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares at the hand for a long moment. Without going for it, she shifts her attention back to Seisuke's eyes and only stares.* - Sat Sep 26 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) motions towards the glass with her head, to show that he can pour it.* - Sat Sep 26 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It 'is' weird playing this sort of game with a stranger. - Sat Sep 26 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: During my time with Kenryoku I played with friends. - Sat Sep 26 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A stranger is only a stranger until you get to know them. - Sat Sep 26 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: And I do recall you calling me a friend. - Sat Sep 26 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You did say to not tell anyone that we met. - Sat Sep 26 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That was for them -- I wasn't lying to you. Only doing what you asked me to. - Sat Sep 26 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I appreciate it then. - Sat Sep 26 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We can do without the drinks then. - Sat Sep 26 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head.

"We can play." she says.* - Sat Sep 26 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like you said. It's no fun if I'm entitled. - Sat Sep 26 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Well then, Let the first round begin? - Sat Sep 26 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. She extends her left hand, clenched into a closed fist, and lets it hover near Seisuke's own hand.

"It's good we're not using dice." she says, maintaining eye contact.

"I'm pretty sure Zetsumo used trick dice."

The teen plays along, and eventually throws out her own handsign.

Abruptly she pauses at the sight of Seisuke's sign and frowns a bit.* - Sat Sep 26 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yes, and yes. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I worked 'for' Zetsumo. Not with him. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I was a slave. - Sat Sep 26 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Planned on escaping but. . . - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He interrogated us every week and I was indecisive. I knew that if I thought too much about it.... - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Fair enough. - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'd have to say no to loyalty when the genjutsu check came around. - Sat Sep 26 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That jutsu was too strong for me. - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I applaud you though. - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For....? - Sat Sep 26 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) simply waits for round two, or whatever, while they chat.* - Sat Sep 26 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 26 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says nothing. There's a bit of delay, but she follows Seisuke's motions to throw out her own sign.* - Sat Sep 26 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: It's funny. My name means victory but I never win. - Sat Sep 26 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mm.... - Sat Sep 26 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. . . - Sat Sep 26 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes Seisuke's throat, trying to determine for sure whether or not he swallows.* - Sat Sep 26 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's hand closes into a fist again in the mean time.* - Sat Sep 26 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) mimics him.* - Sat Sep 26 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes her cup for a long moment. Eventually though she shrugs and brings it up to her mouth. Eyes wander, and she sniffs at it. Eventually, though, she tilts the glass up. Very slowly, she sips. Eyes lock onto Seisuke in the mean time. Only half of the glass is downed for now.

Eye contact is maintained, and she pauses for a moment afterwords.

She wants to see if her body reacts to it in any unexpected ways. As someone who used to be bored out of her mind for twenty-four hours a day in Kenryoku, Kat's become very, very used to getting drunk.* - Sat Sep 26 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her attention down to the liquid to stare at it for a long while. With her exceptional eyes, she looks for anything suspicious. Any unusual scents have of course already been looked for.

Eventually though she shrugs, and reaches up to pour the rest of the liquid into her mouth. Eyes wander off and she goes through the motions again for this game.* - Sat Sep 26 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Lost....as always. - Sat Sep 26 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. Eyes wander off, and she holds her glass up to let him fill it or her.* - Sat Sep 26 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) puts the glass down. Arms cross afterwords and she leans back a bit. Eyes remain averted.* - Sat Sep 26 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I simply want you to, Shake my hand. - Sat Sep 26 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: For the record. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) eyes the hand.* - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I have a technique that can blow your hand off. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: With a handshake. - Sat Sep 26 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shrugs. "Just letting you know how stupid I am for doing this." she says.

The girl waits for several more long seconds. Eventually though, she reaches out to gently take Seisuke's hand in her own and begin shaking it up and down.

Gently, because she's prepared to take it back at a moment's notice.* - Sat Sep 26 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) takes her hand back.

The girl takes a moment to eye it afterwords. She stares.

Any weird markings on her gauntlet now?* - Sat Sep 26 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just been worried. - Sat Sep 26 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) crosses her arms. Eyes wander off.

"Erebus has vowed to be my sword, shield, and armor. That means nothing though if people aren't aware of that fact."* - Sat Sep 26 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's technically a secret. - Sat Sep 26 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You 'are' his ally though. - Sat Sep 26 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've been wondering when a self-righteous idiot will come along and try to trap me in genjutsu. - Sat Sep 26 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I see. - Sat Sep 26 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or someone looking to get rid of Konoha for some reason or another. - Sat Sep 26 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I won't make a foolish promise, and say "I will protect you". - Sat Sep 26 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: .."I'll keep you safe." - Sat Sep 26 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: We both know that's a lie, But I'll say, I do what I can If I can. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Fair enough? - Sat Sep 26 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Like I said your death isn't beneficial to me, so I'd rather keep you alive. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: At the same token, you need to lighten up. You've been stiff this entire game. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It'd be appreciated. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: More than fair, of course. I haven't offered to give you much. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: You gaveme a momentary way to sate my boredom. - Sat Sep 26 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I hope you'll continue to partake. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'll see. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It 'was' part of the original deal. - Sat Sep 26 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I won't keep you binded to an idea you don't somewhat enjoy. - Sat Sep 26 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Oh yes, Hanabi told me to look at your butt while I was here. - Sat Sep 26 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I don't quite understand the reasoning behind it. - Sat Sep 26 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Sat Sep 26 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's cheeks turn a bit pink. Eyes wander off.

She reaches up to scratch at her cheek.* - Sat Sep 26 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slides out of her chair. Arms rest behind her back for a moment, with one hand holding the opposite arm. She has no pockets.

Eyes are averted when she says "I should sleep. It's late, and that wine isn't helping to keep me awake."* - Sat Sep 26 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) shakes her head. "Wanted a guard for genjutsu." she says.

"So I could relax and make eye contact."* - Sat Sep 26 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I'm not afraid of you in normal circumstances. - Sat Sep 26 02:50:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns to wander off on that note.* - Sat Sep 26 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Good night. Safe travels home. - Sat Sep 26 02:51:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) says: Excuse me.. Miss. - Sat Sep 26 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms are crossed and one leg is crossed over the other. She watches Arnitanu a bit blankly.

"Hmm...?" she inquires, turning to and fro in her chair as she speaks to him and lifting an eyebrow.* - Sat Sep 26 04:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks him up and down. After a brief pause she nods and turns to her desk to open the drawer and dig through its contents. She looks for a scroll.

Eventually she aquires one that's marked as D rank and sets it on the table for him.

Eyes are on him again when she says "It's D ranked. You did say you're fresh out of the academy."* - Sat Sep 26 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Or, if you'd prefer something more challenging....you're free to come back with a squad. - Sat Sep 26 04:13:00 2015
