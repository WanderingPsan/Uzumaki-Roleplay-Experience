<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Point taken. - Thu Oct 29 11:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Honestly. - Thu Oct 29 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I've been dying to test out one of my Techniques. - Thu Oct 29 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But Sunagakure makes it hard to use. - Thu Oct 29 11:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Did I ever teach you Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot? - Thu Oct 29 11:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Nope, Kat-sensei. - Thu Oct 29 11:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It can't wait. You need this. - Thu Oct 29 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You both can borrow my scrolls that I have if you want. - Thu Oct 29 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wanna go learn it now? - Thu Oct 29 11:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Sure. - Thu Oct 29 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Could I tag along? - Thu Oct 29 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods.

Afterwords she turns on her heel and begins walking away.

"Yeah." she says to Kilm.

"I was just about to suggest that."* - Thu Oct 29 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Honestly being outside the walls makes me nervous. - Thu Oct 29 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Having you there'll make me more comfortable. - Thu Oct 29 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. . . - Thu Oct 29 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sighs.* - Thu Oct 29 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Earth and Stone Bamboo Shoot. - Thu Oct 29 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) kneels down. Both palms meet the earth and stay there. Kat's eyes remain on the ground afterwords.

"Your palms -must- be touching the ground." she says with a glance up at her student.

"Never forget that that's one of the downsides of this jutsu. It's -always- something to think about and plan for."

Kat's eyes are on the dirt again. "And with palms on the ground, just shove your chakra into the dirt. Make it go to the enemy, underground. When it's at their feet you form the spikes."

Some spikes abruptly come out of the ground some sixty feet away. Even from such a great distance one can hear the loud rattling reminiscent of a sword being violently ripped from its sheathe, with gusto.

Kat then rises to her feet. Palms find her hips and she stares ahead at her handiwork.

"And -never- forget. . .if your enemy moves before the spikes are produced, your chakra can keep following them. You can keep manipulating it. So it's -very- hard to out-run it even with sensory abilities."* - Thu Oct 29 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And of course if you're desperate you could use it as a shield. Think I did that once. But you have better stuff. Mud Sillhouette, for that. - Thu Oct 29 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: -- I 'love' Mud Sillhouette. - Thu Oct 29 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: So much. . . . . . - Thu Oct 29 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I feel like a library. - Thu Oct 29 11:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your collection 'is' impressive. - Thu Oct 29 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I still have 17 scrolls to learn from. - Thu Oct 29 11:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Kilm with the war coming up. . .I feel like. . .I finally have to tell you this. - Thu Oct 29 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Thu Oct 29 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I've always been afraid to tell you. . .because I liked winning our sparring sessions. - Thu Oct 29 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But the truth is. . . . - Thu Oct 29 11:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Your skillset seems to support defense more than anything else. So if you wait for the enemy to either come to you or your allies first. . . . - Thu Oct 29 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: You should be insanely strong. - Thu Oct 29 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 29 11:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I want to be strong in both offense and defense. - Thu Oct 29 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Just remember what I said if you're attacked, alright? - Thu Oct 29 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Thu Oct 29 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I -want- you...to live. - Thu Oct 29 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Don't worry, I don't plan on dying. - Thu Oct 29 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We. . . - Thu Oct 29 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should be together on the battlefield. - Thu Oct 29 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We know each other very well. - Thu Oct 29 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: We'd make a great team. - Thu Oct 29 12:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Mhm. - Thu Oct 29 12:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Good. . . . - Thu Oct 29 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Too bad you might not have time to master it. - Thu Oct 29 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Wish...I'd got myself ready to teach you Earth Dragon Bomb instead. - Thu Oct 29 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: I'll have a lot of time after the war though. - Thu Oct 29 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's really good. I want you to know it. - Thu Oct 29 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Takes some time to realize how good it is. - Thu Oct 29 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: What's the difference between the two? - Thu Oct 29 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But that jutsu is 'very' good. - Thu Oct 29 12:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You haven't taught me that one either. - Thu Oct 29 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Would be cool. - Thu Oct 29 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) forms the snake seal and summons up a mud river.

After some amount of time she then weaves three more handseals.

The signature mud dragon head rises up and then fires off a barrage of mudballs. Each each ball, a loud and gunshot-like bang is released. There are perhaps one-hundred balls in all.

The eyes and throat glow white for the moment.

Kat's hair and skirt are blown back as it fires. Kilm's and Index's would be too.* - Thu Oct 29 12:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: When I've mastered it, I'll teach you both. - Thu Oct 29 12:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's too bad I developed the Landmine Fist. . . . - Thu Oct 29 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Before then, 'this' was my best jutsu. - Thu Oct 29 12:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Would've been fun to figure it out more. - Thu Oct 29 12:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm....? - Thu Oct 29 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: That technique, isn't apart of the base elements at all is it? So what was your motivation for trying to make it? - Thu Oct 29 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I like....punching things. - Thu Oct 29 12:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Bit more needed to read this scroll. - Thu Oct 29 12:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: It's a sensory technique, so it won't have 'much' application in battle. - Thu Oct 29 12:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: But I can sense around Three Hundred feet in a spherical manner. - Thu Oct 29 12:18:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yo. - Thu Oct 29 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) nods. Afterwords she takes Index's hand, gently but a bit abruptly, and begins leading him way.

Willpower is applied to not drag him.* - Thu Oct 29 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And I guess bye. - Thu Oct 29 20:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sits with legs sprawled out underneath her form, and palms against the cushions inbetween her legs.

"Okay." she says, eyeing the floor.

"'Working under you.' "

"What does that mean?"

The girl makes no eye contact.* - Thu Oct 29 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Thu Oct 29 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Okay. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: Well, I'd like to tell you form the start. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: She was talking to Kilm and Trilliam about buying techniques and etcetera. - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) says: So I approached her saying "I have a way for you to buy techniques -and- make money." - Thu Oct 29 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sends a clone to answer the door. Said clone's senses are locked onto it for the moment and it stares ahead, blankly.

Kat stares too, from the couch where she's sitting with legs sprawled out underneath her form and palms on the cushions inbetween her legs.* - Thu Oct 29 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The clone does nothing.

The real Kat simply turns her head to stare up at Index, very, very blankly.* - Thu Oct 29 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) looks at Saeza.

"What mission?" she inquires.* - Thu Oct 29 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The real Kat is speaking, that is.* - Thu Oct 29 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || The clone steps out of the doorway. Its senses stay locked onto Saeza and its eyes do too.

Saeza's totally in earshot though, easily.* - Thu Oct 29 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I see. - Thu Oct 29 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) turns her head to stare up at Index again.* - Thu Oct 29 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Index(Jjking217) whispers: Meh, You get first stab. I have no clue what she's talking about. - Thu Oct 29 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) stares at Saeza once more.* - Thu Oct 29 21:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's clone throws a fist forwards while stepping aside. She probably can't dodge outright but countering the kick? She probably can, especially since she and the real Kat both were already strongly resisting the urge to brutally murder the vampire.

In other words; she was already expecting combat.

The clone's fist touches the door, which she'd been holding and which now acts in large part as a shield. The wood inside of it is used as fuel...for an explosion, from this point-blank range.

The ground and entire house would shake. Hair and clothes are easily blown backwards.

From the door comes a massive beam. With it, a reverberating and thunderous roar. An explosive beam, aiming to consume and disintigrate Saeza entirely.

Katsune's aiming to kill. Someone triggered her murder boner.* - Thu Oct 29 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) || Note that explosions pack concussive force and white-hot heat at the same time.

They knock back.

No matter how durable one is, this beam would without a doubt knock someone to the other side of the village.

It's incredibly powerful.* - Thu Oct 29 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) rises up from her place on the couch. Feet touch the floor. At a lazy pace, Kat then walks forwards with a murderous cold in her eyes.

And Saeza apparently got disintigrated.

So, Kat simply looks down at the dust and stares.

She studies it.

For the most part though, Kat's lost in thought. Murderous thoughts.* - Thu Oct 29 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Dust means...no evidence. - Thu Oct 29 21:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is walking away as Index draws near, and her arms are rising. Hands meet to form the tiger seal.

Abruptly in a puff of smoke even as Index speaks, Kat would disappear.

When she reappears, she's on the other side of the room; against the eastern wall. Kat turns in place as she arrives, very lazily.

Her back is planted to the wood, and her arms cross. She stares at Index very blankly.

She looks relaxed.

In short, she never let him touch her. If he kept speaking though, she lets him.

"I see." she'd say, were that the case.* - Thu Oct 29 22:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) 's arms lazily rise as Index approaches, and her hands meet to form the tiger seal.

Abruptly Kat flickers out of sight once more in another puff of smoke.

When she reappears, Kat's at the table to the west. She's facing him. Her expression remains pretty stoic but she tilts her head a bit.

"You keep trying to get close despite how defensive I'm being. Despite me being in murder mode. Even after you claim to be terrified. Your body language isn't adding up. All signs point to you trying to kill me. You sure we're okay, Index?" she says.* - Thu Oct 29 22:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) crosses her arms. The girl hovers up into the air as Index approaches and slowly directs herself to the north, with her eyes still locked onto her potentially murderous boyfriend.

She at no time lets him get closer than ten feet from her.* - Thu Oct 29 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) sends a shadowclone to the village after settling into her new house, with a sigh.* - Thu Oct 29 22:52:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) is staring up at Marrissa with a very cold and murderous look in her eyes.

"One more word and I will beat the -fuck-....out of you."

Marrissa had dared to insult Katsune by implying she has no self-control.

Of -course- she's incredibly angry and defensive.* - Thu Oct 29 23:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) slowly hovers up off of the ground. Soon, her feet are planted gently.
