"You fucking Kumogakure pieces of shit killed Koeki. If you can't respect Kirigakure's decision to stay, then I can't quite respect your village's decision to live."

His body flashes temporarily above Asteroth's. His right hand aims to grip onto Asteroth's head and quite literally, smash her into the ground. His entire body is flashing with a temporary red as he activated his Gingot d'Enfer. 

Following the strike, his leg would attempt smashing into the nearby house and cause collateral damage by damaging the foundation of the house and perhaps cause it to fall onto the ground.* - Fri Oct  9 01:06:33 2015

He zooms towards Niza in a flash of sound and light. The wind breeze is incredibly incredulous, as it numbers perhaps five-hundred miles an hour under the wake of Kenshin's body that seems to be fighting against the air itself. 

His right hand attempts to smash itself into Niza's chest and cave it inwards. He'd then attempt to grab onto Niza's face with his other hand and proceed to drag him through the ground while running.

Whilst running, he targets Kojiro and Yukio next. He aims to swing Niza as a battering ram at Kojiro's body to smash the two into each other. His body flashes once more to attempt roundhouse kicking Yukio's side and send him barreling through the ground viciously. 

Tears were streaming down Kenshin's face as he executed each and every single action relentlessly against his opponents. He would not give them any quarter. * - Fri Oct  9 01:15:05 2015

"Hachimon Tonkou --- KAI!" He shouted. He summoned himself above Genesis first. She was the most available to him.

"Jet Pistol." His right hand doesn't make contact with Genesis. Instead, the sheer force of his attack generates a Sonic Boom that attempts to rattle her bones and send her crashing to the ground. He proceeds to flash towards the bird floating above Misa's head.

His hands attempts to smash into the back of the bird and smash it down from the air. However, that wasn't it. Kenshin's hands aim to grab the bird by its wings and he would fly through the air once more.

He'd swirl around and attempt to battering ram the mansion using the bird's body.* - Fri Oct  9 01:33:52 2015

"You fuckers! You killed Koeki!"

"You can't respect my decision to be with Koeki, then I can't respect your decision to be a legal village." He shouted. His entire body flares with flames as he continues to pummel the mountain.* - Fri Oct  9 01:43:15 2015

"RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH."

He screamed, unable to contain his manifested rage and anger. He was no longer listening to everyone. It was true, if Kojiro could jump, he'd have struck Kenshin. At this point, Kenshin's entire body flared into a sphere of fire.

He flew up into the air temporarily, searing through the syrup. Kenshin's entire body flares temporarily. He zooms downwards at the mansion from the sky, approximately five-hundred feet in the air.

"METEOR NIGHT." He aims to pummel his entire body straight through the mountain of Kumogakure, simultaneously killing himself and exploding the mountain at the same time.

He'd kill anyone nearby the explosion as well, probably.* - Fri Oct  9 01:57:45 2015
