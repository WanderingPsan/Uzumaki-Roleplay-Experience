<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) // Not even a single second had passed. Kenshin's entire body flailed into the air above Yan's body. His right hand attempted to clench onto Yan's head and then ram his body into the ground with a violent crash. Should he land, it'd craterize the ground in a brief instant. Kenshin's facial expression posed a smile. He hadn't found anyone who wanted to fight him in a while.

This mainly stemmed out of a misconception. Kenshin thought Yan desired to spar or fight him. Kenshin doesn't seem to be exactly aware that there could be something else that Yan was after. Nonetheless, an angry facial expression towards him only meant to Kenshin that a fight was desired, nothing more, nothing less. Upon completion of the headsmash, Kenshin would back off.* - Sun Sep 13 03:21:10 2015

"Gingot D'Enfer." He muttered underneath his breath. His eyes landed on Zetsumo briefly. Who knows why Kenshin seemed to be so angry. 

It wasn't because of Kirigakure though. Just because Kirigakure was threatened, it wouldn't make Kenshin so angry. It was because something valuable to him was being threatened right now.* - Sun Sep 20 21:54:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) // Suddenly, Kenshin leaped into action. 

"Gate of Opening -- Open."

Immediately, Kenshin's body darts across the field. His firey trail is left behind him, friction lines the ground, and his body quite literally flies across the battlefield. He is understanding of the Masks threats; he is fearless and adamant in his charge though. Suddenly, he routes across the area and heads towards the Masks. It is behind the masks and after the fire that Kenshin comes.

Kenshin's relentless assault begins now.

"Speed Star." 

His entire body flashes in an instant. His first attack is on the Lightning Mask. He appears above it. "Sonic Boom." He smashes into its back if it wasn't able to retaliate, hoping to crush it into the ground. His body would flash  towards the Water Mask, Fire Mask, Wind Mask, and repeatedly crush the three of them in a matter of a second. Merely nanoseconds were between his attacks. His body flashes towards the massive bird entity from the side, aiming to land on it from behind and smash its body into the ground. His body then flies towards Katsune, Sabo, and Amai. Indiscriminately, he aims to smash into them with his legs, a straight kick to Katsune's back, a kick to Sabo's shoulder, and a violent backhand to Amai's side.

Whether or not they were in the air would not abate Kenshin's ridiculously fast assault, which was accompanied by the speed of his Sonic Booms, which he was able to conjure in an instant with his movements. * - Sun Sep 20 22:14:49 2015

Kenshin's Sonic Boom effect seemed to wear off, due to fatigue. Kenshin pants and coughs lightly. "Shit..." Kenshin's legs hurt. They hurt pretty bad. However, Kenshin wanted to keep on fighting. He had to make sure Koeki was alright though. 

He unleashes his blades. 

"Three Thousand Worlds." He dashes through the army and slices straight through every single individual that stood in his direct path by outstretching his blade and swinging wildly. He aimed to reach Koeki and quickly pick her up. He'd drop his sword afterwards, and zoom into the air, hopefully carrying Koeki in his hands.* - Sun Sep 20 23:01:45 2015

Upon Muhhamed's call, Kenshin had to dash over. He moves towards Zetsumo from behind, trying to damage Zetsumo and get him off of Muhammed. With a firey leg, he pinpoints his target locations and fires off his leg in a series of hits.
