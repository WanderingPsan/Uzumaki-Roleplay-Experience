<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out a single sigh, grabbing a small scroll and the smallest bit of ink from a small vial, maybe enough for a small letter..But then again, it didn't matter how big she made the letter, it would come out how she'd like. She'd open her scroll and drip the ink onto it, creating a single letter.

"Well, I'll just kill you here then." She said blankly, not giving two shits for anyone else.* - Sat Sep 12 21:52:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've aimed to leap backwards as she was watching hanabi with keen eyes, she knew the female was incredibly fast, much faster then amai herself..But amai had worked on her reflexes for a reason. She'd aim to get out of range of the snakes as she got closer, aiming to slide against the ground, drawing a letter with the small amount fo ink...

But if she had not been able to, she'd of been restricted by the snakes, and staring at hanabi, "No..I didn't, I'm not a whore like you..I don't just randomly leave people with a note!"* - Sat Sep 12 22:09:42 2015

As for her now being so far away, she wouldn't be capable of fighting her from this range..So she'd bite her lip, "Yes, I would've stayed with your crazy ass, Because I'm loyal! I was going through a phase, and you could've at least told me face to face..Not just leave me a fucking note saying you're leaving!" She'd say, venom in her voice.

Her hands shook a bit out of anger...To many people around..And not enough ink for her to fight hanabi anyways..She'd glance over at zetsumo, "Can I have a bottle of ink please?" She'd say, staring back at hanabi..Incase they were to really duke it out right in the middle of amegakure.* - Sat Sep 12 22:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was done listening to the female....And was done listening to the ousiders of this one on one...Conversation? Suddenly she'd dash forward, standing ontop of the fence as suddenly the single letter bursted out into a full figure, nearly three times bigger then amai herself..It had a godly figure and there was only one of it, it seemed to be rather large and god-like. It'd rush towards hanabi in less then a second, aiming to smash her into the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) sighed, she hated people being around her while she trained..But she couldn't quite help it....So she'd stand south of zetsumo and stood away from the crowd, being within zetsumo's reach of course. She'd lift her hand, and bite her thumb before slapping her palm down on the ground, creating a small seal as a small ferret popped up, staring at amai. It would be kind of confusing as to how amai even got a ferret to summoning, with all her prisoner-time and other training..But she seemed to have met the ferret a little bit back, and apparently got it to be her summon.

Well, she'd stare at the ferret with a gentle smile, she'd have to get used to the drain..and summoning this particular type of summon for now, until she could get to stronger things. She'd let out a smirk, unsummoning the ferret, and repeating the process, her thumb already bitten, she'd slam her palm down as she formed another seal yet again, popping out another ferret, the chakra drain wasn't that bad..But it was a bit costly. ..

She'd then unsummon the ferret again, and give it a moment for her to rest.* - Mon Sep 14 18:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) continued on with her training, as she'd lift her thumb back up once more, biting the end of her thumb and causing more blood to draw, she'd then slam her open palm down onto the ground, making a mini-seal as a tiny poof of smoke formed, out of it popping the same cute little ferret, it seemed harmless aside from it's tiny claws and tiny teeth.

She'd rub the ferret's jaw, giving it some loving as she thought of him as a pet, and would probably keep him out once she got really used to the jutsu, then again..Hanabi did that and her snake got killed by klaus, since he's an asshole...So maybe she would keep him where he came from for most times...So she'd decide that later..

She'd then unsummon him once more, using the blood from her thumb again, and slapping down another seal, as the same little cutie-patootie ferret showed up..She'd give it a rub on the head, his fur really gentle and wonderful..Since he wasn't really a "battle" ferret, he was more for traveling and scouting, and of course..Playing with..

She'd unsummon him once more, and rested once more.* - Mon Sep 14 19:08:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've once again, began training for her summoning prowess with the jutsu, she'd have one of her thumbs already bitten, so the blood was there. She'd slap down her palm once more as a grin overtook her face, she'd summon two ferrets now, amazingly...Petting both with her hands, she'd giggle, ignoring the..Others around her. She continued to pet them, let them play on her and such, but unsummoned them, as she'd need to keep training.

She'd continue on with her movements, forming another seal on the ground as she'd resummon the two ferrets, getting used to now having to summon two small animals, it was getting easier but not easy enough. She had overrall an easy time though, as her chakra control was about the usual for most shinobi, and she had a good pool of chakra to keep up with the constant demands. 

She'd play with the two ferrets once more, having her fun with the two as they'd bond and connect, before unsummoning them and taking a quick breather.* - Mon Sep 14 19:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) sighed as she'd continue her training...almost everyone kinda left so she didn't care anymore, she'd continue on with her training...She'd use her already bloody thumb as she'd slam her palm down onto the ground, forming a small seal as two ferrets popped up, she'd let out a smile, playing with them once more..As they did indeed love to play, but she had to get serious..They'd run off to survey a few feet before coming back..Then unsummoned.

She'd then once again, resummon them as they'd pop up...She'd then send the little creatures out once more, now traveling a good ten feet, and coming back..Giving her some info about the grass, how it's sorta wet sorta not....She'd nod before unsummoning then, glancing back at zetsumo.* - Mon Sep 14 19:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: How goes your own training? - Mon Sep 14 19:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I don't expect you to simply be a toy for my own usage. - Mon Sep 14 19:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Your training. How has it progressed? <@Yumiko> - Mon Sep 14 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've once again continued on, biting her thumb again to drain more blood as she'd plop her palm on the ground and form a seal, two ferrets popping out once again, she'd nod as theyd run around, going a good few meters away from amai, out of her sight, before they'd relay the information back to amai. She'd give them a nod, unsummoning them. They were learning their job.

She'd then resummon them once again, feeling the chakra lessen a bit, as she'd get more used to using the jutsu, as well as the drain of the jutsu, this would in the long-term become very useful...She'd let out a grin as she told the two ferrets to go scout the area in a certain direction, they'd quickly run off in the direction, going out of sight completely before coming back, and relaying more information to her. She'd give them both pats on the head, and scrathes under their chins, before unsummoning them.* - Mon Sep 14 20:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've let the blood drip from her thumb as she'd open her palm up..She was getting better with this jutsu and wouldn't stop till she had it down pat, she'd raise her hand and slam it down onto the ground, a seal forming before it'd explode into a puff of smoke, now three ferrets appearing! She'd command them to go scout some of the village, which they did quckly, one going off in each area..As then they all came back a little bit later, each giving amai information about the surroundings of the village..

She'd give them a nod, each getting a pat on the head, a tummy rub, and a scratch under their maws, all of them were just so furry and cute! She'd unsummon them, returning them to their home.* - Mon Sep 14 20:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: You two. - Mon Sep 14 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Show me the fruit of your labors. - Mon Sep 14 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Who? - Mon Sep 14 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I grant you two options. - Mon Sep 14 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: <*Is speaking to Yumiko and Amai*> - Mon Sep 14 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: You may either challenge me in unison. Or fight one another. - Mon Sep 14 20:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: ...Can I have some ink? - Mon Sep 14 20:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I will grant you some ink, obviously. - Mon Sep 14 20:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ? - Mon Sep 14 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Is she talking to me? - Mon Sep 14 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Uh...Yeah? - Mon Sep 14 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Okay.. - Mon Sep 14 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Hmm. - Mon Sep 14 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Is she..awake..? - Mon Sep 14 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Guess not. - Mon Sep 14 20:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Mmm. I will wait a little while long. - Mon Sep 14 20:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: It may just be you battling me. - Mon Sep 14 20:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Fun. - Mon Sep 14 20:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Probably gonna be rusty anyways. - Mon Sep 14 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Been a long time since I've used my ink. - Mon Sep 14 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Hm?? - Mon Sep 14 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yumiko(Senna1234) says: Well, teaming up sounds like fun. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, I'd love to team up on you. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Just toss me like three bottles of ink. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or two. - Mon Sep 14 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Right then. Restrictions are simple. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: No flying -- I hate flying. - Mon Sep 14 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I could tell. - Mon Sep 14 20:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Can you pass me those ink bottles real quick? - Mon Sep 14 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) grabs the bottle of ink, looking at in disappointment, she couldn't use half of her jutsus, a shame...But whatever..She'd pull out a random paintbrush and scroll, dipping the paintbrush in ink, as she'd then do some ninja shit, and keep everything balanced perfectly.* - Mon Sep 14 20:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll let her begin whenever. - Mon Sep 14 20:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: This should be fun to watch. - Mon Sep 14 20:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) glanced over at the girl as she'd summon a strong wind, of course that wouldn't quite fit amai's fighting style..But she'd have to win the only way she knew how, overpowerment, even if it meant outnumbering someone who could take on an army of a thousand..She'd draw down six letters, which would pop out of her scroll into six lions, one staying next to her side, and one staying next to yumiko, or more behind her, as a bodyguard. While the other four dashed forward, aiming to get close to zetsumo, aiming to strike as the gust from yumiko was hitting zetsumo.* - Mon Sep 14 20:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Well that was dumb. - Mon Sep 14 21:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) // The lions had been destroyed by zetsumo's threads quit easily, as they were somewhat stuck, and the threads were rather fasts...So the lion behind yumiko stood next to amai, now she had a total of two tigers guarding her, as she'd draw six more letters, six more lions popping out, as two of them stayed near her as well, having a total of four guard lions, the other four rushing out towards zetsumo again, this time however..They had a strategy.

Two rushed forward, as the other two stayed a bit back, waiting for a moment to strike.* - Mon Sep 14 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) hadn't had the reflex to overrall..dodge the techniques, but she did indeed have her tigers, which most likely could dodge it..Maybe..Well, the lions tried to dodge his first attack, one escaping as it'd leap over where zetsumo was orignially, then turned and rushed at his side, the side where beth came from...As for amai, one of her tigers pushed her onto it's back, and all four attempted to leap over the wave, only two making it, as the others were washed away. While leaping in the air, amai had finished her next creation..This one was going to give zetsumo some trouble.

"Will this please you?!" She'd scream with a large smile, as suddenly two large godly-figures popped out of her scroll, each had toned muscles with rather perfect bodies and faces, and gigantic fists..Suddenly appearing right infront of zetsumo in the blink of an eye...Well, of course they did the only logical thing, and went to hit zetsumo, one aiming for his chest, the other...well, aiming for his..shoulder/chest as well...Of course, this was a rather powerful technique, and he couldn't just.."block" this could he?

* - Mon Sep 14 21:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've watched as he just..kinda..Shrugged off her attack as he was thrown into the ground..She'd stare at him intently, her most powerful attack just kind..of..Shrugged off, well that pissed her off more then being captured..But whatever..As he'd ask her if she were doing something tricky of the sorts, she'd shake her head, "Nope, I heard you were immortal, apparently you are since you can live through that..Well, then again, I know people who can live through that punch..I'm just guessing you're either using some type of ability with those threads to stop any damage, or some type of defensive ninjutsu, as real immortality cannot exist." She'd state.

"Anyways, back to the fight." She had no chance of winning with the other poison female, so there was only one choice, she'd roll her scroll up, and put her paintbrush away, along with the scroll, taking out the bottle of ink, it was pretty full for the most part, so she'd make full use of it, opening and letting out a gentle sigh..

Before throwing it at zetsumo, "See how you like this!" She'd say, aiming to smash the bottle of ink against his skin, covering his chest or arm in a blotch of ink.* - Mon Sep 14 21:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've caught the bottle with her teeth, keeping it steady as she stared at him with a sigh, forming a single handsign as the tiny fireballs came at her rather fast..Well, she'd do what got her captured in the first place..Shunshin.

Suddenly her form would've disappeared in time? As her body poofed, appearing right behind zetsumo, as she'd aim to smash the ink bottle against his back by tossing it with her mouth, the ink hopefully covering his backside.* - Mon Sep 14 22:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've been pinned down, but the bottle broke and ink splattered...But she was now incapacitated, her body rammed against the ground..Her body aching, but nothing was broken, maybe a few bruises..However..the ink suddenly burst into tons of snakes, wrapping around zetsumo and inside of his body, wrapping around his  threads as well, it seemed to make it so he'd have a harder time moving the top of his body as it aimed to completely restrain him, if he attempted to break one, it'd just reform...And if he broke them all at once, they'd all reform, amai liked calling it the never-ending bind for a reason.* - Mon Sep 14 22:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was pinned down, so she couldnt do anything..She had purposely let herself be attacked to restrain zetsumo for a moment so yumiko could attack..and it failed..Good job, the ink wouldn't go away until he incinerated it with his katon flames, all of it being turned into nothingness.* - Mon Sep 14 22:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) thinks: Mmm. I'll be to the south. - Tue Sep 15 17:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've taken out what little ink she had left, enough for four more creations...Well it was good enough, each one would make around an ink drawing the size of suitengu..Or a bit shorter, but she didn't care..It was time to have fun.

"So, your father gave me a little ink, wanna see some cool stuff?"

She didn't wait for a reply as she took out a scroll and a paintbrush she had used from her previous fight against zetsumo quite the bit ago...She'd dip the whole brush in the ink, creating a good..Good bit of ink. She'd then slop it down, four letters..As four kitty cats appeared, large ones to..They'd all stare at dissida, "Like them?"* - Tue Sep 15 17:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..Well whatever, have fun, gonna go learn stuff. - Tue Sep 15 17:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Hmph - Tue Sep 15 17:15:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I know what it is, never learned it. - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Like I said. "I've done some stuff." - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Gonna let me learn it? - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: Then show me what you've managed to accomplish with the Earthern Corridor. - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: And I consider it. <@Amai> - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) says: I will* - Tue Sep 15 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I take part in full on wars - Tue Sep 15 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Ommit - Tue Sep 15 17:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Oh yeah - Tue Sep 15 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: IC stuff  - Tue Sep 15 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: ^Not Ic - Tue Sep 15 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) nodded as she listened to zetsumo, this was be..rather simplistic for her, as she was pretty good with techniques already. So this was going to be a breeze in the park. She'd stare at zetsumo with a blank expression, she had to at least learn some stuff while she was here...So she'd at least learn how to break out of a genjutsu, because why not. 

She'd focus in on her chakra, and with ease, stopped it, it wasn't completely masterful, but it was at least, pretty good  as she had a good feel over her chakra control...And then she'd simply take a calm, deep breathe as she'd feel around her chakra system, she'd never really..pushed back against it..So she'd give it a shot, trying to give it an opposite shove..Well it didn't budge, which was a bitch of an itch for her. 

She'd continue on..trying to shove her chakra the other way...Using a bit of anger now, as she couldn't..Before giving a calming breathe as she'd let her chakra flow once more, she'd have to attempt to redo this once more. Clapping her hands together, she took a deep breathe as her chakra slowly faded to a stop, and she'd let a small bit of it shove back, pushing it the other way, which now successfully went through, this didn't quite..Make sense, but hey, if it got her out of a genjutsu, she loved it.* - Tue Sep 15 17:51:34 2015
