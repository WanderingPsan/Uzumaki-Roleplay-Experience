<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Interesting. - Mon Sep 21 19:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) gave the man known as erebus a single stare, a sigh coming out of her lips..She just wanted a peaceful life..But she had to deal with this erebus guy..Why couldn't people just be normal?

She'd crack her neck, giving the man a single smirk, "I have done nothing sinful, Erebus." She'd say, continuing on..

"I was captured by zetsumo, and had been froced to kill nobody..I have never killed anyone within my life-time, and I have been probably the best type of person..Yet, you seem to think I deserve to die..You see..You still have given absolutely no reason as to why you want to kill me..You just say I must repent for my sins, Yet..I have no sins.." She'd take a breathe, "You should go after the people who have actually sinned within their lifetime, There are many sinful people traveling throughout the world, yet you come to someone with no sins? You must be blinded, Erebus.."

She'd stare the man dead in the eyes, "Maybe it is you, who must repent for their sins..? Is that it? Are you running from your own sins, placing fake-sins on others just to escape your own?" She'd say mockingly.* - Mon Sep 21 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Tsk... - Mon Sep 21 19:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: We still need to have that talk... - Mon Sep 21 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: We'll see about 'having no sins' then. - Mon Sep 21 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) gave him a stare, she listened intently on his words..Thinking for a few moments..She had never shown betrayal, and most humans..Did have cowardice moments, but yet, she never did have one of those either..Or well, one that Erebus would've heard or seen about most likely.

"A mortal huh? Do you see yourself as some kind of God's hand? You're as mortal as everyone else within this world..And you seem to keep making thing up, Cowardice? Betrayal? And I have no morals? You're acting like you've watched my every move..I have never, and will -Never- Betray Niza, and my village..I am loyal, and when I am loyal to something, I will not rid of it. As for my cowardice? -Every- Being that has ever lived, has had a moment or two of being somewhat of a coward, You act all high and mighty..When you don't seem to understand basic things.."

And then she continued to the final one.

"And morals? You don't know me, and you will hopefully never get to know me on any level other then this current one..I have morals, morals I will always keep with me.." She'd mutter, her voice cold, "And you're sinless? Well that just proves my whole point, you see yourself as a saint, while everyone else is sinful..You truly are the sinful one, erebus...You just haven't realized it apparently."* - Mon Sep 21 20:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: Me? A saint? - Mon Sep 21 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: I impregnated a whore and got in my feelings over it...I am no saint. - Mon Sep 21 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) actually got..Pretty impacted by his words..No..She couldn't let herself fall for his words..But..She...She had done those things..She had let herself get caught by zetsumo..The enemy...But she had never betrayed niza..Nor will she ever betray niza..Even if niza were to die, she would follow him..For he had done something she was unable to..In the past..

A faint memory of quan surfaced her mind, but poofed off as she had to get into the moment..She could not let this man's words affect her at all..She'd have to stay strong, she'd never gotten into a deep conversation like this..Especially over this.

She'd grip her fists tightly as her eyes pierced in erebus's..A looming sense of fear raced through her body as her heart pounded..She had..She had not sinned..She had not willingly sinned..Nor was it her fault...Why would she be placed under this kind of..Trial from this man who claims to be god's sword and shield? A man who had thought he was above all else except for god..

"Hmph..You do not seem to undestand..That..I am not -Hiding- Behind my fellow villagers..My comrades..I am joined together with them, I am no coward." She'd say with a bit of courage in her throat, "You should realize something..All that you speak of..Is..Is truthfully, just -your- opinion..You need to realize something.." She'd say with a deep voice.

"You are not god's -anything- You are a man strayed off his path..If you actually wish to be useful...You'd eliminate the real sinful peope of the world..Instead, you waste your time here with myself, and my village.." 

She'd say this to attempt to crawl under the religious mans skin..Slowly getting down into a position to run off..As she didn't feel like getting fucked up...

"Your god is probably sickened by you.."* - Mon Sep 21 20:42:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You asked her for something and she didn't deliver, so you cooperated with Kronos, someone quite powerful, to kill her. - Mon Sep 21 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: From your end. - Mon Sep 21 21:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You spoke to Hanabi with Kronos as a bystander just in case because you were as you say...cautious. - Mon Sep 21 21:23:12 2015

"Well, first, as an enemy is coming towards you..and let's say..They aim to punch you..You have to act rather quickly." She'd say, pretending as if there were someone about to punch her. She'd move her arm accordingly, moving their strike out of the way.

"To which, it opens up a free shot."* - Mon Sep 21 22:07:34 2015

She'd then raise her arm, and thrust it forward towards him a punch.* - Mon Sep 21 22:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) got into a small stance, "This is a follow-up to the first one I showed you, once you move their attack..You then swipe with your hand, and aim to kit them right in the throat."

She'd then slide her arm through the air, as if she were backhanding someone's adam's apple.

"Fucking prick!"* - Tue Sep 22 00:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was rather clos..And niza had been no help, She truthfully had wished to fiill..Any of her goals in life, but finished absolutely nothing...She was a disgrace a failure..In every possible way..She didn't quite understand why life put her through constant death-scenarios, living through being captured in a war..And all the great things..Only to die here, by someone she didn't even know..It was to bad..She didn't even get to chuunin..

Suddely bones protuded into her body, striking vital organs, and other parts of her body..But as maloth ran into the kaguya, he'd hopefully knock the kaguya right off of amai, leaving holes in her body..She'd fall to the ground shortly after if that's what had happened.

As her body hit the floor with a squish, broken glass was heard as ink began to pour out of her front pockets..Blood slowly pouring out of the holes made by the kaguya's dance. She took a final few breathes..At least she could rejoin with some old friends of hers..Who cares if she hadn't accomplished any of her life goals..She'd had a good time while blowing in the wind..And that's all that mattered in the end.

If nobody had intervened with her, she'd slowly bleed out, a blank stare given towards erebus..a small smirk on her face as well..The pain was more then immeasurable, as it felt as if she were in some kind of torture chamber..But it would all be over soon..She either lay there, dying..Or die by some other means..Or..Maybe she would heal up?

Any of these could possibly happen..But she was most likely going to pass over in these next moments, with a smile.* - Tue Sep 22 00:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out her final breathes, her vision gently fading away as she could feel a cold breeze..She could hear the faint voice of maloth...She didn't know..If this was real or not anymore, her vision was nearly faded out as the blood spilled all over the ground, mixing with the ink, as it surrounded her..

Soon her breathe gave out, as her heart started slowly down immensly..Not before to long though, her bodily functions came to a halt completely as the woman's body turned cold, and her eyes stayed lifelessly open, a smirk still on her face...One final thought remained in her head however, and this would forever affect her for her next second or two of life..

"It was..a fun ride..Maloth...See you...Later.." 

And thus, her life ended as fast as it had been made, she was now a corpse, forsaken to rot in the ground with the millions of other shinobi.* - Tue Sep 22 00:53:07 2015

She was no scholor or anything, slowly reading through the scroll..She'd have to learn this jutsu hopefully, and she would..She just loved learning jutsus, Especially those of the katon element..Once she were done with this, She'd move on the anbu's non-elemental jutsus, which were just as good really.

She'd then begin her read, her eyes peering over every word, re-reading several times sometimes..She'd read to make sure she had or didn't have to use handseals, as to which she did not know at first..As she continued, she'd most likely find that she had to use handseals, and slowly started to go over the handseals a few times, remembering them..* - Tue Sep 22 18:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I wasn't training my jutsu. Or my body. I was training my mind. - Tue Sep 22 18:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I see, Still important. - Tue Sep 22 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: It's what I hope to do while away too. - Tue Sep 22 18:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Early retirement? Why? If you don't mind saying. - Tue Sep 22 18:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm not retiring, just getting a broader experience of the world. - Tue Sep 22 18:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) continued on her reading..She realized this was quite a long scroll, so this had to be a powerful jutsu! She'd nod as she read through most of the basic-katon stuff, going through it several times...She got the jist of it mostly, as she'd used jutsus similar to this..This wouldn't be to hard.

She'd then look back to the handseals, slowly doing them..And then repeating a good ten to twenty times..She'd have to implant the handseals into her mind if she wanted to get the jutsu down. After a few minutes, she'd of done the handseals quite a bit, getting the seals burnt into her mind rather quickly.

She would then take a quick breathe as her hands went through the handseals in a fast motion, she did two slip ups..Muttering to herself. She'd continue on though, repeating this step a few more times. Her hands zoomed through the handseals, a few mess ups here and there, but overrall it was good.

Of course, Kohaku wasn't learning this jutsu to be "Good" She was learning this jutsu to be "Great" So of course, she'd have to even better then great, she'd have to be fabulous. Suddenly her hands began redoing the seals everytime she finished it, finishing perfectly after a while, she'd of done it perfectly Six times in a row, which seemed to please her enough.

After getting the seals down, she'd have to move on to the next annoying part..But she wasn't annoyed by it that much, A single nod was made with her head as she took a deep breathe, letting her chakra flow throughout her body, she had a basic understanding of Chakra control, so this wasn't overly hard..She'd just have to work a bit harder then most shinobi at this.

She'd churn the chakra inside of her core, releasing it out into her body, increasing her chakra flow towards her top-side, specifically her hands and mouth. She'd then begin doing the handseals, simply getting a feel for the jutsu at first...After a while of doing this repeatedly, she'd take a deep breathe, She had to rest for a moment.* - Tue Sep 22 18:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had done enough resting for now! She'd have to continue on her studies. She'd already gotten down the basis of the jutsu, and all she had left to do was continue the seals and flow the chakra into a flame-thrower..Which was pretty basic, considering some of the jutsus she knew, were more complicated then that. 

A Moment was taken from her as she'd slowly get back up, and take a deep breathe..Her eyes closing as her stomach churned with chakra for a moment, she'd then begin pushing her chakra gently and equally to both sides of her arms and her head. Once the chakra had been placed within her hands and around her..mouth and stuff...

She'd take a deep breathe as she'd form several handseals, aiming to spit out a flamethrower..But failed..So she'd have to continue on..And re-try her session once more. Clapping her hands together, she'd take a deep breathe..Closing her eyes before opening them as she'd zip through the handseals, shooting out a tiny flame.

"That skill though." She thought to herself.

She'd have to continue on however, it had to be a full on flamethrower of destruction and burning and stuff. ..She'd repeat her motions once more, closing her eyes and zipping through the handseals, a few flickers here and there as a tiny flame came out of her mouth..She wasn't exactly..Pro at this she guessed...Taking a moment to herself once more.* - Tue Sep 22 18:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) could feel herself getting much more used to the jutsu..And learnt that she must continue on her training to get stronger! She'd clap her hands together once more, a look of determination in her eyes as she'd take a deep breathe, chakra flowed through her veins..Leading throughout her body, mainly colliding into her hands and head. 

More chakra being put into her body now, as she'd rip it out of her core, leeching it around her body. Suddenly her hands flickered, moving at faster then usual speed through handseals, perfection at it's finest. The moment the last handseal was made she'd take a large breathe before exhaling a mini-flamethrower, burning the ground infront of her gently.

She was nearly there!

She could smell candy in the area..Craving them so much..She loved candies! But she'd have to train now, Sweets for later! The girl clapped her hands dramatically one final time hopefully..As she'd take a deep breathe, chakra splitting up throughout her body in a rather perfect motion, before she'd exhale flames, had she gotten the jutsu down yet? Maybe..Had she mastered it? Hell to the no.* - Tue Sep 22 18:52:35 2015

She'd take a deep breathe as she charged the chakra up within an instant, suddenly exhaling a flamethrower of fire, 

She'd shoot the flamethrower across the terrain infront of her, scorching it gently, as she didn't mean to put that much force into it..She'd continue on though, repeating this once more as she'd exhale another jet of fire from her mouth, shooting it across the land infront of her once more, a gentle breeze amplified it by 0.1%, Making it just -that- much deadlier then before..That certainly was terrifying in every possible manner, 0.1% Was most likely the strongest amplification to any jutsu ever.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) took a deep breathe as she'd raise her head high, zipping through a set of handseals as chakra flowed throughout her system, connecting around. She'd take a deep breathe before exhaling a stream of flames infront of her, it'd shoot out infront of her, scorching the ground gently as fading black marks were made.

She'd hold the flamethrower for several moments before letting out a final spat, the flames getting a tiny bit bigger before disappear..She'd take a breathe, before repeating her actions once more. Chakra had began to flow through her veins and body once more, as she'd take a deep breathe, before shooting out a stream of flames infront of her once more, scorching the land gently one more time...

She'd let it run out after a few moments, taking a small breathe, it really had no affect on her chakra.* - Tue Sep 22 19:49:45 2015
