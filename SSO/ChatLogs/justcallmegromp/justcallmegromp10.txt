<br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) went to move one of her arms..but..She couldn't..and when she tried, immense pain ran through her body, as she'd nearly let out a howl of pain..But bit her tongue, keeping her from screaming..She'd slowly look over, her arm was probably wrapped up in a bunch of cloths, and the sorts..

"..."

A single stare was met with her arm..All she felt was pain from it..Why..?

She hadn't really recalled what happened..Just being told what to do, then suddenly turning into this state..* - Sat Sep 26 21:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked upon feeling her arm touched..Slowly looking at setsuna..A fire burning inside of her stomach emerged throughout her body..She knew it wasn't wise to physically move...But she wasn't..quite happy with the results of her body..at this very moment..

Her arm was useless..and who knows how many people died...

A glance was given to setsuna, kohaku's eyes being different then normal, now red with a single tomoe around the pupil..A single thing muttered from her mouth..

"Why..?"* - Sat Sep 26 21:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) kept her eyes on setsuna for a moment..Thinking of something to say, holding back most of her emotions..She'd move a bit from a sudden jut of pain her arm gave out, and the mental amount of stress from ten shadow clones being destroyed at once..It'd take her a minute to regain herself..

"This..is all your fault..Setsuna." She'd mutter.* - Sat Sep 26 21:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as the woman came forward, staring at the shuriken..Which looked as if they were aiming to miss..And then they seemed to perfectly symmetrical..Hmph..She wouldn't hold back against the woman..She wanted to beat her shit..So she wouldn't hold back.

Kohaku's eyes twirled around, forming a single tomoe around her iris, and her pupils turning red..She'd then clap her hands together and formed through a quick set of handseals, shooting off eight fireballs in all directions infront of her as she'd leap backwards as well.* - Sat Sep 26 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked..Izanami used those wires to, it was rather annoying...She'd bite the bottom of her lip as the female ran next to kohaku, her eyes trying to keep up with her. Kohaku let out a smirk as she'd slide back from the leap, getting in the same formation as the other woman..Suddenly she'd dash around the kunai with the tags..

'She knows that to..'

Thoughts zipped through her mind, but she had to be quick..Zooming around the battlefield rather quickly, she'd form several handseals, shooting another eight small fireballs in the woman's direction.* - Sat Sep 26 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9all of my stats raise with sharingan like - Sat Sep 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9I guess - Sat Sep 26 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) watched as the female dodged all of her jutsus..Interesting, her eyes kept track of the woman's movements though, since she could see the woman as..A walking jug of chakra pretty much, smoke wouldn't hide you from the eyes of the sharingan.

She'd let out a smirk, keeping track of her movements, and getting ready to counter them...As she seemed to toss some shuriken and then some..Suiton techniques at kohaku..A mental sigh escaped from her..She didn't quite like that.

Suddenly her form zipped around the waters as the woman's jutsus went on then off..Or something..Any normal person would indeed run around the field instead of charge head on..So of course, Kohaku wouldn't be that 99% that charged in..

"Let's see how you like this!"

She'd say, taking out six kunais, each one suddenly exploding in a glorious flame..The flames were rather hot of course..But kohaku didn't care if she hurt the woman that bad, since she knew the medic was strong, and could heal herself..Easily. The six kunai she'd have were thrown out in the direction of the woman, aiming to at least pierce her once..The flames most likely burning against her skin.* - Sat Sep 26 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9WHT - Sun Sep 27 00:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had noted before..he could see the anbu as a pool of chakra..

So she'd be able to see the woman, but because shit was broken..She'd get punched in the jaw, sending kohaku back a few inches..A glare being given to the woman as she'd string through a quick amount of handseals rather fast...Suddenly releasing a large fireball right ontop of the woman, most likely hitting her head-on.* - Sun Sep 27 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as apparently the female tried for another hit..Well, she wouldn't get kohaku this time, as she'd dash to the side, turning towards the anbu agent, formulating several handseals as she'd shoot off another 8 tiny fireballs at the woman.* - Sun Sep 27 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a mental sigh, setsuna was a fucking bitch in combat. 

So apparently, they'd had enough time to shoot a fireball, run on a mountain, and be able to unleash a barrage on kohaku..She wasn't kenshin, nor was she in rock lee in any possible form..

So her eyes kept up with the movements, annoyance taking over kohaku's emotions..As the female apparently thought she could run faster then kohaku could see..That was not the case.

As the girl went to kick her back..Yeah..She couldn't exactly do that now, as kohaku tracked her movments, twirling around, she'd already been on the final seal as she'd unleash a large fireball -point blank- In the woman's face as she came towards kohaku, there would be no way for her to dodge this.* - Sun Sep 27 00:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as the woman disappeared..She'd simply glance up, seeing her chakra signature ontop of the mountain..And hey, she was around the same speed as the agent, so...

She'd suddenly appear infront of the agent as she disoriented, ramming her fist into the woman's stomach.* - Sun Sep 27 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) watched as the agent drew back two kunai, she'd have enough time to dodge as they took this measure..Since that was kind of dumb to have wasted time grabbing the shuriken instead of punching her..She'd formulate several handseals, and spit out fire towards the agent..To which, she would've literally exploded in a good amount of fire, of course, as they pulled out the wires, it'd only make this technique even better.* - Sun Sep 27 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) 's hand hurt, but didn't really care.* - Sun Sep 27 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've watched as the anbu took on a large amount of fire, pretty much an explosion, if they came out without any burn marks on their body..Well they might as well be a mloth lookin nigga.

As for kohaku, she'd quickly release her suimen as she fell into the water, and swam down it into the lower deaths, letting the female burn and maybe get a few permanent burn marks on her body.* - Sun Sep 27 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've seen the women shunshin down into the water, as she was most likely behind her..And simly aimed to punch the back of their head twice while disoriented.* - Sun Sep 27 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) simply swam backwards as the girl swung blindly..And suimened ontop of the water, running off onto land.

"Guess I won."* - Sun Sep 27 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked, being ht in the face, stepping back for a few moment..Before wipping out a kunai and covering it with katon chakra, aiming to ram it into the female's gut.* - Sun Sep 27 00:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) stopped the katon-flowing to the kunai as she'd aim to dash in a blink right next to the female, "Goodnight!" She'd say, and with that, they'd ram their fist into the side of the woman's head, sending her to the ground.

"I win, that's that!"* - Sun Sep 27 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) hit the woman down, winning.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Maybe..I've been pretty tired lately, and stressed out. - Sun Sep 27 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Maybe there is a way to release all the stress, yes?.. - Sun Sep 27 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: There is? - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Like a massage? - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mhm.. - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'm sure, you'd enjoy it. - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: It's just a massage after all. - Sun Sep 27 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, sure. - Sun Sep 27 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Come, we'll get to a room...Hope you wont mind, first time massages are usually a bit funny at first..Feeling strange and all. - Sun Sep 27 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's fine. - Sun Sep 27 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) layed on the bed, "Both." She'd say, laying on her front.* - Sun Sep 27 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had only been wearing that of a bra, and pants..She'd snap her bra off, and simply laid there, "Is that good?"* - Sun Sep 27 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've let out a gentle sigh as he'd begin the massage, her cheeks gaining a small bit of brightness, nobody usually touched her body unless they were fighting her..Which was alot. She'd feel her muscle loosen..Which felt like heaven. She'd let out a relaxing sigh, "This feel's..so good.." She'd say with a bright smile, her body was rather relaxed now..

"Huh, Remove my pants..?" She'd think, "You wanna do my legs to..? Oh uh..I guess, Yea sure." she'd say, looking back at the wall.* - Sun Sep 27 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Keep it professional.. - Sun Sep 27 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) simply laid there, she didn't really have big "breasts" they were more like small hills. So she didn't really care, she'd simply lay there as he'd rub her legs, relieving the tense-ness and such, which overrall felt pretty good..She'd have to do a good several mile run soon.

She'd look up at him, and nodded, "Alright." She'd then turn around, layin on her back, giving him a smile, her cheeks were a bit blushed from being seen of course, as that was natural for any human being.* - Sun Sep 27 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) continued laying back, happily getting a massage from fujitora, she'd feel him rub up her legs, and then give her butt a squeeze weirdly..A giggle escaping her legs, "That tickled." She'd say, she didn't ever really see things as sexual unless she was trying to be a bitch.

She was laying -on- her back at the moment, so there wasn't really a way for him to get her back, and yes, she was wearing panties. Her panties had a bunny on the front, with a smile, while the back had a fuzzy-bunny tail.

She'd let him do as he please though, as her legs were spread apart, she'd give him a glance though, a bit curious...he was probably getting the insides of her thighs and legs.* - Sun Sep 27 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: idk when that activated - Sun Sep 27 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been staring down at him with a blnk as he started pulling down her panties, "Ora---?" She'd then let out a small moan as he licked her pussy, which to note, was a bit hairy as she'd forgotten to shave recently.* - Sun Sep 27 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) laid back, she didn't see her day going this way..At all..

She'd let out a moan as he started to rub her clit now, and licked her outsides..Moans coming out of her throat as she'd look down at him, her insides feeling hot, "W-What're youuu.." she'd couldnt' finish, a moan coming out once more.* - Sun Sep 27 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) felt him suddenly stop as he'd position himself over her, her eyes opening a bit widely, Oh god no, she didn't wanna do that just ye----Well looks like it was now happening. 

She'd suddenly insert himself inside of her, which was a bit..Hard, considering she was incredibly tiny. But hey, it would've fit after a bit..She'd let out a very loud screaming..moan sort of, as he kind of just popped her cherry, a bit of blood coming out of her as he'd thrust in and out, mixtures of painful and wonderful moans escaped her lips as he continued.* - Sun Sep 27 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out continous moans as she wouldn't fight it, wrapping her legs around his back as she'd moan out, "F-Fourteen.." The girl's face was blurred red, covered in a blush, "Y-You're..gonna..rip me..apart.." She'd say as he conitnued thrusting into her, she didn't know how to feel, all she knew was just..Wow, it felt pretty fucking painful, yet pleasureful.* - Sun Sep 27 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: and shove them in your ass. - Sun Sep 27 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've let out a smile as he bite her neck gently, then as he stopped for a moment she'd take a moment to rest..Before he'd suddenly tell her to brace herself..? She didn't like hearing those words and his actions together...

She'd turn around onto her back now, her tiny breats sitting there for the world to see, or well, just fujitora. She'd then let out continuous moans as he continued, letting him ram into her as hard as he wanted, wrecking her pretty hard..She'd wrap her arms around his neck as he continued thruting..And well, if he cummed inside of her, this was gonna end bad, but if he didn't..She didn't mind.* - Sun Sep 27 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been breathing heavily as she rubbed his cheek with a smile, "That..was.." she'd think for a moment, "Unexpected.." she said, trying to get up and put her panties on after he got up, wiping off any of his liquids of course. She'd slide her panties and pants on, keeping her breasts out, "That was...amazing though.."* - Sun Sep 27 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9brb - Sun Sep 27 04:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a giggle as he grabbed her butt, she'd put her head against his chest, "Mmm..Alright..Let's go.." She'd say, in a warm tone.* - Sun Sep 27 04:40:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as he kind of just turned on fire..Pretty much..She'd let out a nod, stepping in closer to him.
