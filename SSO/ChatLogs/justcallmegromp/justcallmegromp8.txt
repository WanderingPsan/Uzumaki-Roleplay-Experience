<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) looked down at the ground, staring at her head. She'd gently poke her forehead, "You're not a midget..I'm a midget!" She'd say with a smile, "Why don't you actually come out?"* - Thu Sep 24 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Sleeping all day is more enjoyable... plus I never know when people'll attack me.. or someone else. I'm paranoid.. especially about death.. - Thu Sep 24 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's fine. - Thu Sep 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No.. it's because I'm usually resting at home. I keep my levels of fatigue as minimal as possible... - Thu Sep 24 23:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well that's a weird-like to live, y'know. - Thu Sep 24 23:45:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You're just gaining knowledge from like the fake Setsuno. It ain't like they transfer feelings. - Fri Sep 25 00:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So we can get to know eachother a bit. - Fri Sep 25 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Duh. - Fri Sep 25 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Fri Sep 25 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I limit my interaction with people in this village. - Fri Sep 25 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Why? - Fri Sep 25 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Not a people person I guess. - Fri Sep 25 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well. - Fri Sep 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm the same way sort of. - Fri Sep 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: But I gotta get stronger. - Fri Sep 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So, spar? - Fri Sep 25 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh. - Fri Sep 25 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) quickly walked onto the water, staring at Kirie, "Any restrictions?" She'd say with a sweet tone.* - Fri Sep 25 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: None what so ever. - Fri Sep 25 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Just no limb-cutting please, or death. - Fri Sep 25 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or any of that. - Fri Sep 25 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as the mist was made..She'd scratch her cheek..This was usually a move used by kirigakure ninja who use suiton..She wasn't a fan of suiton that much..Well, there was only one thing to do..She would never risk going into a mist by herself..That's suicidal.

She'd lift her hands up as suddenly a puff of smoke formed next to her, a clone suddenly forming, looking exactly like kohaku. They'd both nod to eachother as the clone suddenly slid their leg back, before dashing into the mist. The clone took out a kunai and slashed around wildlly, while paying attention to any dark figures in the mist, they'd also be moving a bit fast.* - Fri Sep 25 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked, the clone continued searching around the mist, running around like a chicken without it's head..It couldn't find kirie anywhere.

"Are you really gonna hide?"

She'd blurt out as she herself was in the mist, dashing backwards out of it, staring at the mist as her clone continued to rush around inside.* - Fri Sep 25 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) sat there for a bit, the mist probably deforming after a while..And she was gone, the clone dispersed.* - Fri Sep 25 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: That was rude. - Fri Sep 25 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh? - Fri Sep 25 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She fled? - Fri Sep 25 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I guess. - Fri Sep 25 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well then. - Fri Sep 25 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hey guy! - Fri Sep 25 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Got any more jutsus to teach me? - Fri Sep 25 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: If she didn't want to spar you, coulda just said no. - Fri Sep 25 00:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yea. - Fri Sep 25 00:54:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..I need to start learning B-rank techniques. - Fri Sep 25 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Most of mine consist of C-rank. - Fri Sep 25 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Help me learn them... - Fri Sep 25 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: If you teach me a cool jutsu I will, setsuna. - Fri Sep 25 01:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She already done taught you. - Fri Sep 25 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Shadow Clones. - Fri Sep 25 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..And I taught her a uh..-jutsu- to. - Fri Sep 25 01:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: If I wanted to do a tradeoff I wouldn't have told you to help me learn.. - Fri Sep 25 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm. - Fri Sep 25 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Just help her, Kohaku. Sheesh, so stingy. - Fri Sep 25 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I can give you a scroll. - Fri Sep 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: If you'd like that. - Fri Sep 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: That's fine, then. - Fri Sep 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What katon jutsus do you know? - Fri Sep 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Fuuton empowers Katon.. right..? - Fri Sep 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: None. - Fri Sep 25 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) tosses her a scroll.* - Fri Sep 25 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's a basic katon, called Flamethrower. - Fri Sep 25 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Want a demonstration? - Fri Sep 25 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: No... a scroll'll suffice. - Fri Sep 25 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Fri Sep 25 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Flamethrower? That shit succkkks. - Fri Sep 25 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: But eh. It's good practice. - Fri Sep 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's a good starter Sanoke. - Fri Sep 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: And it doesn't suck. - Fri Sep 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hmph. - Fri Sep 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It totally does. - Fri Sep 25 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well, I might as well train. - Fri Sep 25 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) clapped her hands together before looking over at sanoke, "Teach me that wire thing sometime please." She'd say with a smile before forming several handseals, spewing out fire over a set line of grass, as it'd expand around before dissipating away.

She'd then repeat once more as she'd zip through the handseals, before spewing out the fire in a direct line infront of her, burning off the grass in certain areas..Making everything look rather uneven and weird.* - Fri Sep 25 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oi sanoke. - Fri Sep 25 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) continued on since there wasn't much else to do, and apparently setsuna could copy her jutsu by just shooting a flame out of her mouth, yea, if that was the case for all katon jutsus kohaku would be spitting out some hot fire. 

They'd formulate several handseals before spitting out the fire in a straight line once more, staring blankly at the ground..She was rather bored of just training her jutsus..To ba kenshin wasn't around to teach her.

Well, whatever..She couildn't help it..So she'd watch as the grass burnt gently, disappearing in the line..A sigh escaping her lips.* - Fri Sep 25 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yo. - Fri Sep 25 02:20:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nothing huh. - Fri Sep 25 02:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I don't feel compelled to teach you. - Fri Sep 25 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I can't be anything towards someone when I don't talk to them... - Fri Sep 25 02:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well that's because when I try to engage you, you walk away or get agressive. - Fri Sep 25 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That leech is reaall. This is how I feeell. - Fri Sep 25 02:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: That's done and over with, it shouldn't even be thought of. - Fri Sep 25 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Well,That's because you haven't shown signsof improvement towards me really. - Fri Sep 25 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Because I haven't talked to you. - Fri Sep 25 02:29:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Fri Sep 25 04:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) clapped her hands together as she'd zoom through a set of handseals, simply going easy on the girl at first. She'd draw chakra out of her core and focus it around her body. Suddenly she'd take a step forward as suddenly a large fireball formed infront of her, she'd aim to shoot it right infront of the female.* - Fri Sep 25 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've watched as the girl came back with her own fireball..Well that seemed interesting, looks like she couldn't take the little tike for granted..Well, she wouldn't then. As the two fireballs collided, they'd most likely sit in stasis for a few moment, kohaku's overpowering izanami's for a moment before they'd blow up in some explosion of sorts, or simply dissipated.

Either way, As the fireballs let up, covering the area in a dark black smoke cloud, kohaku slid her foot back, doing a small bounce with her feet before dashing forward, aiming to surprise the girl with a punch to the nose.* - Fri Sep 25 05:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: ..... - Fri Sep 25 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a blink as she was surrounded in fire..She'd really never seen this jutsu to be honest, well She'd already known there weren't usually regular ways to get out something like this..So she did it the mainstream way.

She'd form a single seal with her hands as a clone of her appeared next to her inside of the fire, she'd hop onto the clone's back before leaping right out of the flames, sliding on the ground with a smirk.

"Neat technique there, I don't even know that one." She'd say with a small giggle.* - Fri Sep 25 05:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Take me to the area? - Fri Sep 25 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm pretty good at Fuuinjutsu. - Fri Sep 25 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's probably a generic ass, Five Seal Barrier too. - Fri Sep 25 05:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked once more as the four shurikens came towards her, which a quick flick of her wrist she'd make several handseals as the shurikens came forward, spitting out fire towards all four.

If any of the four shuriken had any wires, the flames would've shot up the wires and hit the young female most likely..If they didn't, it'd most likely put them off course and slow them down.

As for kohaku herself, she'd aim to dodge to the side as this all happened, either getting struck in the arm by one or grazed..Or completely dodging, who knew..

And finally, Izanami hadn't destroyed the kage bunshin she left in the fire-run technique..Well, that was a bad idea as suddenly the kage bunshin created several handseals, before shooting a large fireball near pointblank to the young girl.* - Fri Sep 25 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm? - Fri Sep 25 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: THese ninjas annoy me. All they do is spar an' shit,. - Fri Sep 25 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Fire against Fire...Hmm.. - Fri Sep 25 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had a useless jutsu, so yep. 

She'd stare as the cords and shurikens caught on fire..A single blink given to the shuriken..Apparently her dragon flame was some shit-tier C-rank jutsu she wasted on getting..So she'd go to more of her jutsus she guessed..Well, she was done with this for now.

As the shuriken came for kohaku, she'd form a single handseal once more as four clones now appeared, one intercepting the two shuriken, aiming to grab the cords as they were now on fire and easy to see. If able, they'd yank the cords with the girl a bit, before poofing from damage..And Kohaku's other clone in the ring of fire hadn't quite been exhausted yet, as they'd run through another set of handseals, shooting off another fireball towards izanami.

While her other three clones she had just spunked up dashed straight towards izanami, all in a certain bouncy-type of state, one aimed to punch her right in the jaw as the other two formulated through several seals and shot off two fireballs in izanami's direction.

The real kohaku would've aimed to run off in the background, hopefully the girl was distracted.* - Fri Sep 25 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) kept her eyes on the girl as she would be covered in flames..Another technique kohaku didn't know..Interesting. She'd take a deep breathe...This litte girl really was something. Two of her clones poofed out of existance....And the girl was the hit by three fireballs..Kohaku kinda standing there looking at her, her position returning to normal.

"I think I won, girlie." She'd say, staring at the girl if she were on the ground....She already used quite the amount of chakra as well.* - Fri Sep 25 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Maybe I went a bit overboard.. - Fri Sep 25 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Nah - Fri Sep 25 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) gave the girl a blink, "I think I should get a medic..." She'd say pretty outloud..* - Fri Sep 25 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh uh.. - Fri Sep 25 05:49:52 2015

She'd then shoot a large fireball onto the ground, staining it with black ash..

She'd stare down at it with a blink.* - Fri Sep 25 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) continued on with her training, she'd have to master all of her jutsus with quite some skill..She had to get stronger! Especially for her next spar with sanoke.

She'd clap her hands together as she drew chakra from her core, her hands setting off in a quick set of handseals before tilting her head back and throwing it down towards the ground as she'd blast out a large fireball, scorching the earth infront of her.* - Fri Sep 25 21:00:22 2015

As she'd see him suddenly poof and appear elsewhere, she'd give him a blink..It was rather interesting...But then she'd see him about to throwup..And such, "So that's the drawbacks huh.." She'd say with a single smirk...

"Well that's easy!"

She'd then clap her hands together as she'd form the "ram" seal, with a single smile, nothing happened.As she had drawn her chaka and apparently failed.

Well, she'd then have to try once more! She'd clap her hands together, drawing her chakra out to cover her body in a weird way..Her chakra control wasn't that perfect..So she'd have difficulties...As she tried to shunshin once more, she'd just poof in smoke, moving exactly 0.2 militmeters..Amazing.

She'd then have to try once more!!! Her sudden power coming out of her in a mary sue fashion, her A-cup boobs swung around as she'd clap her hands together and formed the seal once more!

MARY SUE POWER ACTIVATE.

Suddenly she'd focus her mary sue powerful-chakra inside of her core and bring it out around her, as she'd aim to use shunshin, poofing away and appearing behind sanoke..

"O-Oh god.." She'd say, insanely dizzy as she'd fall onto her side.* - Sat Sep 26 00:47:21 2015

"Loony bottom line your a rhyme taker
Let me be clear homeys a faker
Stealin some bars is all good and fine
But takin a whole verse is crossing the line
I normally shred suckers like you but instead....
Nah who am I kiddin im still gonna verbally stomp your head
Pickin someons lines apart definetly aint smart
I'll use you to whipe a wet fart so your playin your part
Next time your able remember dont steal someone elses fable
I'm going to bury you in this box i made outta your own kitchen table
You'd like someone to give you an opinion of your rhymes
Your stolen words go on deaf ears like a cryin mime
I spit so much fire your ash's are incinerated
someone else step up cause this kids obliterated"
