<br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) looked over at the chef, "I'll just have miso ramen." She'd say, turning towards niza, "What've you been up to?"* - Sun Aug 30 14:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) // Their ramen came, and would be set infront of them, "So we've never really talked niza, tell me about yourself."* - Sun Aug 30 14:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) digs into her miso-ramen.* - Sun Aug 30 15:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) reached into each of her pockets, pulling out a scroll and a paintbrush, she'd slide open the scroll as she dipped it in ink after opening a small little pocket in the scroll. She'd close up where the ink was and wrote down six letters, and from each letter sprouted a panther. 

The panthers all stood infront of amai, as five of them charged towards niza, the moment they could get to him, they'd aim to rip their claws and bite at him, the last one however stood protectively next to amai.* - Sun Aug 30 19:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watched as he just..hopped over the panthers and came down, aiming to crush it, however it'd aim to quickly evade his power-jump, Having him land where it originally was, the panther had made amai scoot away as it kicked her a bit back. She'd draw down six more kanji letters as the panther aimed to bite it's jaws down onto niza's arm if possible.

And if it were done correctly or not, amai would've aimed to create six more creations, now six more panthers being created..And since niza had never destroyed one of the ones behind him..He would have one aiming for his arm, six behind that one, charging him rather fast as they aimed to take ahold of him, and five behind him, each aiming to dig their claws and teeth into niza's body.

Of course any of this could change if niza was able to make it change.* - Sun Aug 30 19:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watched as he simply tanked the panthers..He must've been something else, amai knew maloth couldn't even tank them, and that guy was built like a fortress..She'd leap backwards as he was hassled with all of the targets, upon seeing him slam the panther to the ground, dodge, and make handseals she took a deep breathe. 

All of the panthers charged him, rather close now, but they seemed to move in a battle formation. Three from each side charged at niza, as five laid back, he'd have two panthers from behind him charging, and three infront of him, two going for each leg, two going for each arm, and two going for his shoulders, the rest staying back.

Amai would've continued on with her drawing, she realized he was capable of beating her panthers rather easily, so she'd throw some real game out there. She'd finish her next six kanji letters, each one popping a snake that slithered around her, she'd wait to see how the panthers played out.* - Sun Aug 30 20:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) took out her scroll and paintbrush, dipping it in ink and then did a single letter a human-like ink figure appeared, giving her a hug, "You're anti-social."* - Mon Aug 31 16:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) scrambled off.* - Tue Sep 01 18:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) NAH NAH NAH SHE SHUNSHINED, BYE.* - Tue Sep 01 18:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) did a simple blink, she knew she shouldn't have said taifu's name..since so many people suddenly turned into rage itself at the mention of them..Such as the strongest person she's ever known, klaus. Suddenly she'd feel his hand wrapped around her neck, and was lifted up into the air, dangling her feet as she'd squirm in his grasp.

She was lightweight and didn't have much muscle or fat, so kaus wouldn't even have to try to pick her up. She'd look down at him, not able to really..talk as she'd grab his wrist with both of her hands, gasping for air..So she just squirmed in the air, looking at him with a terrified expression, nothing she could do.* - Tue Sep 01 19:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) fell down onto her side, her hands rubbing her throat, "Hnng.." she'd mutter..She wasn't one for taking any sort of pain..More delivering it.* - Tue Sep 01 19:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) gets back onto her feet, rubbing her throat one last time, followed by a cough.* - Tue Sep 01 19:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) nodded with a sigh.

"I see..well don't worry, fun things will happen sometime if you're patient."* - Thu Sep 03 05:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) looks around as there's a solid 5k npc shinobi walking about, "Uh-huh."* - Thu Sep 03 17:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) coughed as all of those fodder guards were probably C to A rank.* - Thu Sep 03 17:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) hit keyshawn in the face, "O-Oh..I thought you were assaulting me.." She'd then look at klaus, "Is he offically the raikage now?"* - Thu Sep 03 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) walks up to one of the many houses in the village, going up to a newly made one, "Here-ya-go."* - Thu Sep 03 18:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) quickly followed along with niza.

"Mmmhmm.."* - Thu Sep 03 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) mumbled to herself with a sigh, "Yes, sir." She'd say, giving niza a small bow before strutting off.* - Thu Sep 03 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) shook his hand, "Amai."* - Fri Sep 04 16:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) gives the hogo a wave, "Hi."* - Fri Sep 04 18:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) dramatically sweated while standing there, shutting up.* - Fri Sep 04 18:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watches as klaus poofs.* - Fri Sep 04 18:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) reached into both pockets, pulling out a paintbrush and scroll, a small container appearing inside of the scroll, which she'd dip the ink brush into. She'd then close the container as she looked at the three? four? Whatever...She'd do a quick six letters as suddenly six lions that seemed to be of an older fashion appeared, they were white and black and made of ink.

"Still think my drawings are lame?"

She'd ask as suddenly four of the lions rushed forward, while two of them stayed next to amai, one on each side of her. They'd all four rush to each of the men standing there, aiming to bite into one of their limbs.* - Sat Sep 05 00:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) noted that now two lions were going after each of the two men, keyshawn and regado. One seemed to..try to punch the lions...Hahahhahaha, yea, punch a lion please. Well, he would've missed the first strike, then hit the second..but then he'd find himself with another lion latched onto his upper shoulder area, it's teeth sinking down into his skin as it forced him down.

As for regado, the two lions were halted from the wind, but it wasn't strong enough to where they wouldve been defeated. The two continued rushing forward, both aiming for each of regado's arms, and aimed to push him down. She'd draw another six letters, as six more lions came out, the two next to her joining in..

There would now be four lions rushing at regado, and four more rushing at keyshawn, And keyshawn's mist was most likely stopped from even happening.

(10 Attack speeed, 10 Reflex, 5 Speed, 10.62 Strength for lions)* - Sat Sep 05 00:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out a small sigh, some of the lions poofing, others not..But she'd click her fingers as they all did.

"I'm done." She'd say, staring at the mist, "I've looked at your strength, not impressed." She'd say with a sigh..It'd be hard to find another roki or quan laying around. She'd put her supplies away, and began walking off.* - Sat Sep 05 01:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've sat down, taking out her scroll and paintbrush, then she'd dip her paintbrush in a small dip of ink, before she'd create two letters, suddenly two godly figures coming out of her scroll, and smashing into the ground, causing a huge crater to be made, "Neat."* - Sat Sep 05 08:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Since we've known eachother for quite sometime, And since..You and klaus still do consider me a pawn, would you like to see something interesting? - Sat Sep 05 09:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) turned towards the wall as she'd take out her scroll and paintbrush, popping open the ink container, she'd dip it in before shutting it. Amai looked over at niza, "Alright, well klaus didn't wanna see it, and the only ones who've seen it are maloth and Tethys." She'd say as she'd draw two simple letters, "I'd get...back a bit." She'd say as within a split second two godly ink figures with defined muscles formed into the air, their arms large and strong.

Suddenly within the split second they'd blink to the wall, suddenly their arms cocked backwards and both of their fists rammed into the wall, suddenly cracks forming as their fists created a large hole in the side of the wall, cracks forming from it and going around for a few meters, rocks falling down.

"Do you like it?"* - Sat Sep 05 09:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) raised her hands and swatted one of them up to where the fly would be.* - Sat Sep 05 10:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) nodded, taking a step forward and swatting her hand at where someone's hand would be, getting the imaginary fly.

"Like that?"* - Sat Sep 05 10:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watched him, "This is quite simple." She'd say, doing a simple stroke with her hand as she'd jut it out the same way niza did.* - Sat Sep 05 10:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) poofed.* - Sat Sep 05 11:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) took out her scroll and paintbrush as she'd dip it in ink before drawing two letters on the scroll, suddenly two godly-figures coming out and ramming into the wall, making yet another crater.* - Sat Sep 05 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) holds maloth.* - Sat Sep 05 17:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Gezo? - Sat Sep 05 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) took out her scroll and paintbrush, dipping it in ink, before writing down a single letter, creating a large bird able to hold three people, or in this case, two.* - Sat Sep 05 17:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) gave him a thumbs up, "Peace." Before the bird took off, gone within a few seconds.* - Sat Sep 05 17:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) lalala flew in.* - Sat Sep 05 18:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) walked up with maloth.* - Sat Sep 05 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) poked maloth.* - Sat Sep 05 19:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) took out her scroll, and a paintbrush, dipping it in ink and then creating a quick single letter as a large bird suddenly popped up. She'd grab maloth's arm and pull him onto the bird.

"Well, look at the time!" She'd say quickly, "I sure do like keeping my body parts!" She'd say, and if not stopped, the bird took off towards kumogakure.* - Sat Sep 05 20:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watched as she could barely keep up with tethys's speed..Niza let her travel to kiri because he thought it'd be safer then sunagakure..But nope...She'd be in a sudden state of crisis as she knew that this was going to end badly...Tethys was much faster and stronger then both maloth and amai combined...And if she tried to spark up a huge fight in the middle of kirigakure with one of their strongest jounin, she would have to be ready to fight a good few thousand shinobi and then some incredibly strong jounin..As well as maybe the mizukage herself.

Amai suddenly watched as maloth dove infront of her, pushing her out of the way as he absorbed the blow..Hopefully she could've got her scroll and paintbrush out, instead of creating a quick escape route..Which would fail as she would most likely get shot down...She decided to use her new technique.

"We don't want to fight, tethys!" She'd say, skidding out of the way from the blow, as she'd throw a glob of ink from her paintbrush straight at tethys. If the ink managed to plop against him, it'd suddenly expand into several snakes that wrapped around his arms and legs, all around his body, and if he were strong enough to break them, he'd suddenly find himself unable to as they just reformed right after, Hopefully this kept him in hold.* - Sat Sep 05 21:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) did indeed have much more ink left, she would never leave the house without carrying at least a few bottles full..But she couldn't access them, and she wasn't quick enough to react to tethys's blows..Man..First time out of the village and she gets attacked..Niza was going to be disappointed in her..She'd suddenly feel his fist meet against her jaw as it cracked, her hands letting go of the scroll and paintbrush as she was sent flying backwards, landing away from tethys on the ground in pain..But she couldn't speak either now...Since ya'know, broken...cracked destroyed jaw and all...If she was alive that is.* - Sat Sep 05 21:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) created a singular ink bird right quick, and then snapped her fingers as the snakes around maloth broke..Before they'd both hop on the bird, she'd glance at tethys..He shouldn't have hurt maloth. They'd then take off, disappearing* - Sat Sep 05 21:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) poof poof, they'd swoop down on a large bird, and got off, "Where is niza?"* - Sat Sep 05 21:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) reaches into her pocket, pulling out a small bottle of ink, and putting it in her front pocket for so she could grab it easily and quickly. She'd take a step forward, getting into a fighting position.* - Sat Sep 05 23:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was covered by the mist, letting out a sigh..She couldn't fight in these conditions..She'd simply stand still, putting her hands together as she waited for the others to become visible.* - Sat Sep 05 23:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) began walking forward, simply seeing dark figures, she'd known it was one of them..but simply waited for a right moment to strike.* - Sat Sep 05 23:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watched as his body landed infront of her...It was time. She'd raise her hand as he tried to get up, her form more of a shadowy figure of a woman. Suddenly her hand flew down towards his throat, aiming to backhand his adam's apple.* - Sat Sep 05 23:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) looked down at him, she'd grab her bottle and pop it open, pouring ink on him, as it'd form into several snakes which wrapped around his body completely, keeping him in place, "Stay there, boy." She'd say, looking around the mist..The next target would be slithering in the mist, but the mist would clear up soon..As these were windy mountains.* - Sun Sep 06 00:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was simply restrained on the ground, as she wasn't a close up fighter, "You win."* - Sun Sep 06 00:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) snapped her fingers, the snakes exploding.* - Sun Sep 06 00:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) literally had no physically power.* - Sun Sep 06 00:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) picked up the bunny, depending on it's size, she'd put it on her shoulder. She'd then reach into her pockets, pulling out seven ink bottles, and wrapping them on a small belt and tucking them inside of her pants, so they were easily grabbable. She'd then take out a scroll, and dipped her paint brush in one of the ink bottles, before shutting it. 

She'd then turn around, "I will be as fast as I possibly can, if something happens and I can not make it back, I will try to keep the bunny safe." She'd say as she'd then walk out.* - Sun Sep 06 12:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've flown down from the sky onto the ground in the area east of konoha, the bunny hopping off and walking around the area, What would she or the bunny see or hear...?* - Sun Sep 06 12:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) had the bunny return back to her, and the bird would've then taken back off, seems nothing was really here or happening...She'd fly off towards kumogakure once again, back to niza.* - Sun Sep 06 13:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) walked in with the bunny on her shoulder a bit later, "We're back." * - Sun Sep 06 13:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) had totally been storing over tens of thousands of explosive tags in her house.* - Sun Sep 06 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) leaves for a bit, before coming back, now carrying a good....Thirty explosive tags, and it'd be noted ink bottles were all around her waist, and probably in her pockets..A few scrolls in her pockets as well, as well as some paint brushes as well, "Who will we b---"* - Sun Sep 06 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) plops the bunny next to niza.* - Sun Sep 06 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) took a deeep long sigh.* - Sun Sep 06 15:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) reaches into each pocket, pulling out small little cases. She'd open them, each having a single stack of fifty ink explosive tags.

"Take them, both of you."* - Sun Sep 06 16:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) //In the background you can hear the many souls haunting niza.* - Sun Sep 06 16:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was simply flying high above the rest of the army, ontop of a large bird as she'd scan the area, looking down. Her scroll was out along with her paintbrush..She'd draw a simple few letters, popping out six birds and attaching two explosive tags to each of their tails, as they'd sit ontop of the bird's head, amai looking down at the situation...Waiting for the war to begin, if it were to began anytime soon.* - Sun Sep 06 20:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was still flying high in the air, as she'd create six more birds, attaching three ink explosive tags onto each of them as well. Suddenly the twelve birds began to rain down from the sky, each of the twelve birds had three explosive tags on each of their tails, any soliders who attempted to fight against kumogakure's own would find themselves face ot face with one of the birds as all three explosive tags went off when within close range.

All of the birds went throughout the area, blowing up any soliders they could find, amai kept looking around as well, keeping track of the raikage, keeping her eyes on him.* - Sun Sep 06 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was just fliyng above.* - Sun Sep 06 21:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've watched as the godly-tier B-rank summoning appeared, along with the kage...She didn't know what to do..So she did the only singular thing to ever do...She'd let go of her scroll and paintbrush, there was no time to think..You know, since the bird was faster then her, as well as zetsumo..Well she'd suddenly disappear from sigh, as she'd be raging down towards the ground, or maybe even landing on the ground..!?

Yes, she had done it...She had attempted to shunshin dodge away from the tendrils and bird thing..She was either on the ground, or plummiting towards it rapidly...* - Sun Sep 06 22:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was screwed, she'd be left unconcious unless someone saved her of course..Her body was unable to keep up with a kage's.* - Sun Sep 06 23:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) had been ontop of dorja's head, so she'd probably fall to the ground if not grabbed.* - Mon Sep 07 00:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was kinda sitting on the ground half-naked in her underwear, everything stripped, and several guards around her..She was also just staring at the ground blankly.* - Mon Sep 07 11:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) sat on the floor, her body cold..She'd glance over at kilm as he talked..She recognized him but couldn't put a name on his face..But he is most likely someone who betrayed kumogakure of course..She'd look up at zetsumo as he spoke..She didnt want a war, yet she had been dragged into one..And all of her nine bottles of ink, five scrolls, seven paintbrushes and sixty explosive tags had been taken..So she couldn't..really fight at all...

She didn't quite have a reason to live, she'd let out a sigh, "Hmph, it wasn't my choice to attack konoha.." she'd mutter, "Even if I gave you a reason not to kill me, you'd probably kill me..And you'll probably keep me locked up in here anyways." She'd say with a small hiss to her tone.* - Mon Sep 07 11:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've been smacked on the face, of course leaving a red mark the shape of his hand on her. It stung but she'd be fine...But she didn't like being talked down to..Amai looked up at the man and let out a small grin..He was probably gonna strike her down for this..

"Yea...I know absolutely nothing about the attack or who Orakuru even is..I was simply told we were going to war with konoha, and I came.." she'd say with a snicker...She kept one eye on kilm though, trying to remember who he was..* - Mon Sep 07 11:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've been put under the genjutsu, of course not noticing..As she was the pretty crap in genjutsu...She'd stare up at him, her eyes opening a bit..Now that she had a good look..It was kilm...God..damnit..Was the only thing her mind could muster up..But she'd simply stare at him for now.* - Mon Sep 07 11:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) stared up at kilm, sort of forced to tell him, "I no knowing of any squads in kumogakure, The army has more then five thousand soliders. There is not much on their abilities besides taijutsu and kenjutsu...As well as many fists..." she'd say blankly, but truthfully.."Most of the genin are weaker then myself and there are incredibly strong men living there..." And then she'd stop talking, she really didn't keep up with anything military-wise...She was uninformed for the most part, they captured the wrong girl.* - Mon Sep 07 11:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) stared at him blankly..."I think."* - Mon Sep 07 12:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) bit her lip as she'd look at zetsumo...She was most likely going to die..And there was no ink to protect her..No scrolls..Paintbrushes..No behemoths there to take the punch for her now..Well this sure did suck. She'd tighten her hands into fists..She hoped niza would incinerate all those pornos she had..If he didn't she'd be quite angry..

Since she was bound by chains and unable to do anything..She had a choice..Either grovel for her life like a fucking bitch.....Orrrrr...Make some smartass comment and be killed...Man why did she have to be placed in a situation like this? Out of everyone in the war..She had to be the one captured..She'd slowly look up..She had to go kill hanabi still..So she couldn't quite die yet.

Amai shuffled a bit forward..She'd have to suck it up this one time, "I am not kept up..On any information regarding kumogakure, I am simply a pawn in niza and klaus's army..I am not useless, as..I am rather strong..when I have my supplies...I can do alot more then make a bird..Zetsumo."

"I could..Assist you..if you wanted.."* - Mon Sep 07 12:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out a small laugh as kilm spoke...He hadn't seen her in five years or more...Hehe...She'd look up at zetsumo, even though she was in her underwear, stripped down to near-naked levels..She listened to zenaki..Things will be ending bad for amai no matter what..She'd slowly put her hands on the ground as the tendrils wrapped around her neck..Amai had been warned about these..

She'd get onto her hands and knees, looking down at the floor, a bit up at him..

"I..I can..Do quite a lot..with my ink.." She'd mutter..She didn't exactly know how to say what she could do.."More then..animals..." She'd say, before finally, having to beg for mercy..at the feet of zetsumo..This sickened her mentally. She'd put her head down, forcing tears through her cheeks, "P-Please let me live..I'll do anything you wish! She'd say more loudly then she had before, "I can offer you free explosives..More power in battle..More mobility...Anything you wish for..!" * - Mon Sep 07 13:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was released from the chains..she did not want to go with zenaki for more then a million reasons, but she had no choice..She'd be pulled by her hair, nearly screaming but she bit her tongue. She'd then be forcefully pushed down , staring into zenaki's eyes, amai's were a very bright blue.* - Mon Sep 07 14:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) simply looked up at sabo, and glaring at zenaki, "I'm supposed to zen--...Mistress's...Doll or..something..And still be useful to zetsumo..."* - Mon Sep 07 20:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out a fake cough, "You should get me some ink before I get mad."* - Mon Sep 07 20:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) gave paine a gentle smile, "Just get me a bottle of ink, doesn't even have to be that big..Come on~" She'd say with the sweetest voice she could muster up* - Mon Sep 07 21:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out a sigh, looks like she couldn't pass the time with drawing..She'd look at the floor for a moment, "It's alright." She'd say gently towards the female before her gaze found itself back at sabo, "What're you still doing here?"* - Mon Sep 07 21:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was totally in her underwear chained up here.* - Tue Sep 08 16:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) continued to stare at the ground, it was fun having a bunch of men stare at you out in public while chained up, "Hmph.." She'd mutter, standing next to zetsumo.* - Tue Sep 08 16:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) shrugs with a sigh.

"I like knowledge."* - Tue Sep 08 17:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've most likely been grabbed as she would've had flash backs of klaus strangling her for speaking of taifu the waifu. She'd squint her eyes at her, "Not like..I can do much..In chains..Besides..I'm not exactly a fan of killing..When we entered the war..I never struck a single person..I simply did small explosions to make the villagers and anyone there run off..." She'd say, her body limp...Of course trying to make him not kill her, she did like life.* - Tue Sep 08 17:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was shoved against the wall, closing her eyes for a moment, things were always difficult..And she of course, had to be the single one who was abducted in the latest war..Like..They could've taken niza..Keyshawn..Anyone else, but nooo..Get the only female in kumogakure.

"I'm good..on...not..dying.."* - Tue Sep 08 17:41:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) suddenly had a clump of threads invade her mouth and throat as she'd stumble back, but didn't fall since she was chained to zetsumo..And of course, not being able to breathe did infact, suck. She'd go into panic mode, trying to grab at the tendrils, but the chains of course stopped her for the moment..So she kind of had to accept it...* - Tue Sep 08 18:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) lets out a series of coughs, rubbing her mouth and the liquid off of her face, "I..I..guess.."* - Tue Sep 08 18:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would of course, kneeled down.* - Wed Sep 09 18:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've been placed in the genjutsu...Not really minding..So as zetsumo spoke, she'd reply mindlessly, "No." She'd reply to the first question, then to the second, "No, I hold large amounts of fear every moment." She said, and since zetsumo had not gone deeper into questions, she'd of course not reply any further, waiting for the next set up questions.* - Wed Sep 09 18:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) again, simply answered as before, "I've learned to stay calm under situations, due to any word I might say being a trigger for Niklaus." She'd then continue on answering, "I would prefer not to be under a dictatorship, I enjoy the company of some people within your ranks, others not, and dislike the overrall threat-levels within the area." She'd say, continuing with the question, "I dislike the thought of being a servant to anyone, or a pawn, or anything of the sort, as well as disliking being ruled by someone who may...Give harsh punishments." She'd then stop talking, the interogation jutsu was working 100%* - Wed Sep 09 18:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) did a simple blink, "I do not torture."* - Wed Sep 09 19:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) did a simple blink once more, "Maloth." She'd say plain out, continuing, "I prefer to kill someone quick and make sure they don't suffer at all.." She'd then end once more, she didn't feel she needed to share anything.* - Wed Sep 09 19:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) stared at him, having the usual cut to her nose from time to time, nothing causing to much pain. She'd stare at him blankly, quiet...

"Ink."* - Wed Sep 09 19:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) just did a few blinks.* - Wed Sep 09 19:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) grabbed it, "Why?"* - Wed Sep 09 19:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) took a deep breathe...Man this was some...Dirty ass shit...She'd slowly stand up, staring at the young child..So she'd turn towards the child...She'd raise the kunai..And put her hand on the child's head..Mentally hoping she found peace in the future life..She'd then grip the kunai tightly, before pushing them against any kind of bedframe, wall, anything. She'd then start slowly cutting up their skin, giving them small marks on their body....The child screamed under the muffles, amai tried not to focus...

She'd then stab into the child's legs, stabbing each one once..Then went up to their chest, doing several slashes across it, drawing blood with each stab and cut...She'd then proceed with getting to the killing, after a while of cutting and stabbing them gently, she'd raise the kunai the child's neck, doing several slashes, each one closer to the inside of their throat, before ripping it open, blood pouring out as they'd suffocate to death.

She'd stand up, splattered in blood..Glancing over at zetsumo..* - Wed Sep 09 19:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) wasn't trembling at all, blood dripped from her cheek onto her mouth, spilling off of her face....She'd let out a small sigh, Her soft silky skin was coated in the blood-red liquid, it dripped off of her whole front side, staining her little to no clothing..Her feet were completely coated in red as it was also covering her whole face. She'd slowly turn towards zetsumo...A small giggle suddenly given.

(https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/25/43/1e/25431e39c316af00af43fd3973487eb2.jpg)

Some of her hair covered one side of her face, stained by red, mixing it with a blonde/red look now...Another giggle was given as she held the kunai up near her face...Her eyes slowly scanning up to trace straight into zetsumo, a simply echo of words were spoke out.

"That was..Fun."* - Wed Sep 09 20:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was grabbed by the chin as she looked into zetsumo, staring into his eyes...She could partially tell some of his story..As he was rather demonic in a way..It did make it harder to read..As for..Amai's eyes...She had never felt the rush of killing someone..Her eyes were bright blue, a hint of a simple life, and an isolated life..She hadn't ever experienced the world as it is..Or any war..She was like a tiger in a cage..Waiting to be released.

Her eyes shook with intensity though, not used to the feeling she was having...

"Another..?"* - Wed Sep 09 20:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) blinked several times..She'd stare at him, "I don't care.."* - Wed Sep 09 20:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) did several blinks again, "I'm...not used to killing..but...I don't know.." She'd say, apparently she might get a bit crazy if she -is- killing someone, but when she isn't, she's her usually self.* - Wed Sep 09 20:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've been under yet another genjutsu, answering that she did get a rush..and she wasn't lying....She'd then nod, "Alright."* - Wed Sep 09 20:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) poofed in some clothes.* - Wed Sep 09 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) // It would be noted, she was fully clothed and no chains.* - Wed Sep 09 21:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) had 0 pints or anything of ink, sadly.* - Wed Sep 09 21:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) is infact, gay, she was into women.* - Wed Sep 09 21:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) appeared next to zetsumo, she was either naked and in chains...orr fully clothed? Who the fuck knew.* - Thu Sep 10 18:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was tied up on a chain, or chains..Whatever worked for her really..She'd trudge next to zetsumo with a blank face...Man this really did suck, she was gonna buy a puppy when she got back home to...Amai let out a gentle sigh, glancing between the three infront of her, "So...uh...what's..kenyroku anyways.."* - Thu Sep 10 18:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) nodded..right..right..She totally know how to calm down prisoners...Yep..People that were just like her..Uh-huh..The knowledge she had was totally on how to calm down prisoners....Yep..She TOTALLY knew how...So she'd take off her chains..or had zetsumo remove them, and walked towards where-ever the prison was..Or prisoners were..So much fun.

She'd stand at the entrance with her hands in her pockets, taking a step in as she looked around at the guards, and the prisoners..Some quiet, some..rather energetic, banging the bars, punching eachother..Raging and screaming, crying...Most of them seemed to be men, any women in there were sitting in the back and being alone..It semeed he'd captured mainly the brutes and the ones who can fight..Let aside a few women..

Well, while amai was still a level-headed shinobi, who had studied in school, and learned quite the much...She'd think of a way to calm down the brutes..She let out a sigh, walking into a closet, and grabbing a blanket, "Open that cell." She said pointing at one filled with a few women..Then she'd walk in, and give all the women blankets, along with a cup of water and a tiny bit of food..

She'd then close the cell up, having the women calmed down from any anxiety..For the most part..Then she'd continue to move on with her life, going into another few closets, getting some food..It was great zetsumo let her off a leash for a bit..So of course, she snuck in a cheese burger for herself, "So...Amazing.." She'd say thankfully..Food was so amazing....

She'd continue on working, getting food and drinks to calm down the prisoners, "Just let them have it, food calms everyone down.." She'd say, giving each and every prisoner a small sandwich, and a glass of water..After everyone was done eating, they all seemed to calm down a bit..All the kids also got cookies...Amai was kind of soft-hearted for young children....

But then the prisoners suddenly got all angry once again, wanting more food..Some got more rowdy now, banging against the bars of the cells....She'd let out a sigh, asking the guards to sit them all down, after a moment or a few..All the prisoners went silent as she'd speak, "All of you should calm down..Or else bad things will happen alright? I get it, You're all angry about being in here, if you take it calmly..You'll.." She'd hestitate..."Be fine."

She'd then take a deep sigh, "Now how about everyone just sits down, and thinks to themsevles..We can all have a much easier time then needed..." She'd say with a fake smile..before one prisoner suddenly banged the bars, "How about you go die in a hole!?" The bulky man decide to say..And well, amai asked the guards to bring him out..

"You see, I've learned something here.." She'd say with a grin, handing a guard a whip as another guard pulled up the man's shirt, "You obey, or get punished." She said as the guard started to whip the prisoner, pained screams coming out of where-ever they were...She'd then have him placed back in her cell, giving a small sigh, "Now you all should calm down.." She'd say, turning towards the day, "Good day." 

Then she'd walk out and back to zetsumo, "I finished it, the prison is calm."* - Thu Sep 10 21:44:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Sat Sep 12 14:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've sat down on the chair with a sigh, grabbing an ink brush and dipping it in ink as she'd write down six ink letters, less then a second later suddenly the letters popped out of the page and made six explosive tags, they seemed to pile infront of her. She'd then repeat this again, more explosive tags popping out of the scroll.

As she continued on, even if the fuuinjutsu shinobi stared at her, it looked as if she were just writing down seals that popped out explosive tags with already written seals, which would've been pretty confusing. She'd continue on, drawing more and more letters, each black letter popping out more explosive tags after time...After a while of her popping down letters, she'd let out a sigh.

"Each of these explosive tags are almost two times stronger then regular explosive tags..And if you had let me have ink a while ago, I could've trained my ability with them and pushed them above two times stronger..And yes, they work like regular explosive tags, but have a slightly bigger explosion, and I'd reccomend acting cautious with the tags." She'd say out towards zetsumo, a good five hundred explosive tags lay infront of her after an hour....She never really did focus on just creating explosive tags and then resting..then making more as she had been now.

After a few moments of resting her chakra back up, she'd continue on writing more letters, it seemed as if every time she drew a letter and made an explosive tag, the letter disappeared on the scroll...Maybe this was a trick with fuuinjutsu? Who knew?
After around two more hours she'd let out a long sigh, only going through twenty bottles of ink, she'd completed around 1,500 explosive tags..But was pretty exhausted.
