<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) raised a single hand to her mouth, "Shhh.." She'd say with a smile as suddenly one of her ferrets ran up to her, holding a bottle? She'd bend down quickly, grabbing the bottle containing black liquid, popping it open.

She'd then leap backwards as the ferret was unsummoned, suddenly taking out a scroll and paintbrush, she'd dip it in ink and drew down six letters, "This is what you wanted, Paine." 

She'd say as six lions leapt out of her scroll, three infront, two behind, and one next to amai. The three lions in the front quickly rushed paine, two aiming to tackle her down from the front, as one laid behind, ready to pounce. The other two coming at different sides.

Of course this was if paine had let amai do this.* - Sun Sep 20 15:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out a blink as she'd go against the lions near immediatly..She'd of course kick one ink lion's face, it'd open it's jaw to aim to bite into her leg as she kicked inside of the lion. It dug it's teeth into her leg before exploding, as the other aimed ot bite into her side, and the one on the ground leapt up towards her, aiming to bite into her already stretched out leg. Of course, her arms were free as she continued on. 

But then there were two lions behind her,  so that was also another worry. They'd quickly rush towards paine as she was coming down from the air, one aiming to jump up and bite into her shoulder, the other remaining on the ground, waiting for a good strike.

Then there was amai, She'd leap backwards as this all happened, drawing down six more letters..Suddenly six more lions leapt out of her scroll, rushing towards paine. Two aimed to leap up and land on her front-side, the other four staying behind the original ones.* - Sun Sep 20 16:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) continued to watch paine through the air..Her movements were rather nice..But amai could see why paine was a bit useful...A skilled taijutsu artist eh? She'd met enough of them in kumo, Niza..Klaus..Tethys, She was not a fan of any of them...Well, as she came down, there were currently eleven lions now on the field, That was quite the amount to keep track off, and you'd have to add amai to that list as well, as she was the most dangerous of them alL.

The lion that she'd kicked first, drew some blood as she destroyed it before it could inflict any real damage, their reflexes and speed seemed to go slightly above the female's, which was to be expected by amai. Even without her constant training, she was still very powerful with her ink at hand.

She'd watch as the female aimed to fight against the lions, a smirk coming upon her face. The lions aimed to leap over her sweep across the floor, half of them making it of course, the other half being sent backwards, the one that had leapt over the sweep went down towards paine, one aiming to dig it's teeth into her arm, the other aiming to dig it's teeth into her thigh.

She'd then continue on, there were still..Eight more lions around the female, and one next to amai. Suddenly the six that had just been made split up. Five going forward, one standing next to amai. They also seemed to be in some kind of pattern, their speed was rather fast as well. Paine was surrounded.

She would have quite the hard time getting to amai if she tried to get through the beasts. Three rushed forward as the two leapt down onto her, the two from before that she had strayed from also came down towards her. She had a total of seven now coming down onto her, As three remained waiting. 

Amai leapt backwards, a little farther now as she'd do several quick swipes on her scroll, six more letters made..Instead of lions, snakes were now made, snakes that leapt onto the ground, sitting infront of amai.

"Is this all you've got?"* - Sun Sep 20 17:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watched as the girl plopped around the battlefield, amai's eyes keeping up a bit..She was getting out of room to move back...Playtime was over, She'd grab the ink bottle in her hand as...Yes, paine did destroy -some- ink tigers, but her whirlwinds weren't able to completely obliterate them all of course..And they were indeed faster then her, So she'd end this in a final move.

All the tigers left over from the fight, which were about..six or seven, rushed after her in a sudden fashion as the snakes infront of amai kept up, the moment paine got near amai, the snakes would wrap around her, and restrain her to the ground.

As for the two lions next to amai, they'd also rush towards paine from the front, she had a good six-seven from behind, closing in faster then her..And two from the front..Every single one aimed to bite into a part of her body, and it would be..very difficult to avoid them all, as well as the snakes..And as it seemed..Paine had dared stepped near the snakes, so they'd wrap around her legs, and keep her put..

Amai leapt back as all the tigers went to bite into random parts of paine's body, the snakes wrapped her legs. She'd hold the bottle of ink in her hand, staring forward..

"Do you give up?"* - Sun Sep 20 17:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) blinked once more as..Her body was moving rather weirdly..She didn't really know what was happening..(oocly..)But she'd roll with it for now.

So...Paine's body would not be able to keep up with all nine tigers, and manage to kick amai in the chest, that would be a rather tricky move most likely...Amai watched as paine attempted to take out all of the lions. Well, first off..The first lion she went to attack quickly dodged away as she went to kick it in the neck, missing.

She couldn't have used that tiger to spin into the other ones, and if she did, most of them quickly dodged, as ink usually exploded on hit...Well, as she went to go back into the air, she'd find herself unable to as the tigers aimed to grab her, restraining any further movement, they all went to a different limb of course..And the way she was, she most likely couldn't escape their grasp.

Amai on the other hand simply held the bottle of ink tightly, before chucking it straight at paine as the lions grabbed hold of her, the ink bottle most likely breaking on hit, as paine's front was covered in ink.

And this is the where the battle ended, The ink suddenly turned into a large nest of snakes, wrapping around paine's figure, and restraining her arms, pulling them to her legs as the lions aimed to bring her to the ground, and bite into her at different parts of her body.

"Do you give up yet, Paine?"* - Sun Sep 20 18:48:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) didn't notice zetsumo.

She'd snap her fingers, all the ink exploding as she'd put a hand down to help paine if she were on the ground.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) was not doing this shit. She didn't feel like dying today, she hadn't lasted being captured by zetsumo just to die for the people she had worked with..Nah nah. Suddenly a ferret popped out of her front-pocket with a bottle of ink, she thanked the gods for her ferrets. Taking out a scroll and paintbrush, she'd dip the paintbrush in ink as everything happened. 

And well, as the gigantic bird was attacked, and most likely kiled or unsummoned, amai would've written down a single thing on her scroll...She wasn't gonna die to no hassan, kenshin, niza, or zetsumo today.

She'd leap off of the bird as white and black bird popped out of her scroll, beneath her. She'd land on the top of this as the bird then took off as fast as it could, flying upwards..Away from the commotion.

"Not today..Not today." She'd mutter, hopefully nobody minded her flying off...And tried to stop her.* - Sun Sep 20 22:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) would've been flying in a slanted motion, since nobody had decided to disturb her, she was quite glad she could finally be away from them...The the bird shook a bit, it was a two-person bird, thank god. She'd feel a poke on her shoulder, looking back at niza with a sudden smile.

"Yo, I thought you died..Great to see you again." She said as the bird now carried them both higher then three hundred feet, and continuing upwards at the moment..* - Sun Sep 20 22:45:32 2015

So yes, all the big-guys took out the big-apple...She'd take care of the small-fry that came, nobody paid attention to him or her, so it was fine..

She'd draw on her scroll rather quickly, using up most of her ink as she came towards sabo...Suddenly two large godly figures coming out of her scroll as she got closer to sabo, they'd be behind him, so he'd most likely...Be hit.

The two figures aimed to smash their fists into his head, obliterating him in a singe hit of course.* - Sun Sep 20 23:29:55 2015

"Repent this, creeper."

Suddenly two large godly figures appeared, aiming to punch the man's body, and break most of his ribs, and send him back, effectively killing him hopefully.* - Mon Sep 21 00:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) couldn't..Write fast enough or dodge effectively..So she'd either be saved or cut up.

Well, if he hadn't been fast enough, she'd of been sliced up, and fell black, depending on the size of the cuts...She'd either be ok..Or not.

Well, then came mamoru, if he had been quick enough...She' of pulled off her jutsu, and sent the jashin flying backwards, hopefully breaking his weapon into pieces as well..

But hey, it was all chance.* - Mon Sep 21 00:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) usually kept some of her ferrets in her pockets, to help her out now. Suddenly three ferrets popped out of three different pockets, each carrying a different thing. She'd grab a scroll from one, paintbrush from another, and then a bottle of ink from the last, giving them a smile and nod.

She'd then unwrap the scroll, dip the paintbrush in ink and then drew on the scroll as fast as she could, and finally..Six Lions popped out of her scroll, lining up in two rows of three infront of amai. She would approach maloth differently now.

"Come on, You shouild have gotten stronger maloth..Show me!"* - Mon Sep 21 16:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) watched as maloth took off rather quickly..Maybe he had gotten stronger? Who knew. In such a small area, this was going to be fun for her. As he came bumbling forward ready to rampage through the lions..Well, maloth's body may have been two things..Strong, and Tough..But he was indeed, not fast.

The lion aimed to leap over maloth as he went to club the lion in the head, it'd aim to leap over him, and swing back around, digging it's jaws into his shoulder, the one next to the original lion quickly went to restrain maloth's arm, as yet, the last one from the first row charged forward, going towards maloth's leg.

As this all happened, amai continued on her scroll, six more lions coming out of her scroll now. They'd get into the same stance, as the three in the front went around maloth and covered his backside. The six infront of maloth surrounding him as well, everytime he'd shake one off, another jumped on, so on and so forth.* - Mon Sep 21 16:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) let out a smile, maloth hadn't changed in the little bit she'd been gone. With a sudden leap backwards, she'd continue on her drawing.

As for the lions? Well maloth had them mostly handled, except for the twelve to one odds..But aside from that, she did nickname maloth the human tank, as his body was nearly like the jutsu zetsumo had used, But she knew his body had a limit...But she wouldn't put him in the hospital again.

She'd let out a sly grin, He'd rip through the tigers..Yes, they could dodge..But not 100% of the time, as they weren't gods. After a small bit, there seemed to be eight left, out of twelve, so he'd successfuly ripped off four. But now he had three infront of him, two next to him, and three behind him..Trapped in an unfinished circle. 

Amai had finished her next creation, as suddenly six snakes leapt out of her scroll, and rushed towards maloth.

Now, amai had a finisher here, Suddenly the lions began to leap onto maloth, going tryhard mode as the snakes aimed to keep a low profile, the lions providing cover. And, if successful, the snakes aimed to crawl up maloth's body quickly, and wrap around his arms and legs, keeping him binded.

If this had worked out, one of the lions pinned him to the ground, and kept a paw on his chest, staring at him.....But if it hadn't there'd hopefully be at least one or more snakes on him...Unless he dodged.* - Mon Sep 21 17:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) echoed out a single word, "Surrender?"

If he complied and said yes, all the ink would explode..

But if he said no, she'd continue her drawing, popping out six more snakes, which crawled around his body, putting him a rather..Tight bind now. And the tigers kept him down along with that, His neck would have to be rather long to bite the ink, his flexibility would also have to be quite on fleek.* - Mon Sep 21 17:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: He is never going to give up... - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
