<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as she walked into the huge mansion..It was so huge and rather amazing...She'd look around as they entered the basement, or..Chamber. She'd listen to him..And of course, blushed when he mentioned sex...She'd ignore it for now and continued on...As he slapped her butt, and told her to step in..She'd wait for a moment..

Kohaku would've done a few stretches herself as she'd nod, listening to him..This sounded pretty fucking hard..So her eyes twirled into the first stage of sharingan..Getting into a fighting stance as she'd listen to the rest of his speech..

"I see..I see..So this'll be difficult.." 

A single grin was given to him with a thumbs up, suddenly dashing in..She'd feel immense heat poured upon her so suddenly, but she'd have to rush through it, stepping on a trap, suddenly kunai were launched at her. Her body twisted and turned in different ways as her sharingan attempted to keep track of all the kunai, she'd of been cut on her arm and leg as she'd leap into the air, dodging most of the kunai as she'd twist onto the ground.

She'd twist back onto the ground, already sweaty as her body was already heated up from the immense temperature of 110 degrees...She'd take breathes in her nose and breathe out of her mouth as she was already getting a bit tired..She didn't think she was allowed to use any jutsus...So she would probably still use some of her jutsus though..Like the fire shroud..But that'd be for later..She awaited the next challenge.* - Mon Sep 28 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've landed on her feet, nodding to fujitora's advice..She didn't know how people even did this kind of stuff..This zeemed like Kenshin-tier training to her honestly..The heat was just agonizing in every possible way..She'd have to continue though, taking another step forward, ready to handle the next trap, no matter what it was.

So, her foot landed on the next tile...What would happen?* - Mon Sep 28 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Training.. - Mon Sep 28 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've seen the gas starting to come out, her eyes opening widely as she charged full speed forward, dashing right out of the gas, she be running around a hundred and fourty miles per hour now, charging forward quickly. She had to get through this! She had held her breathe as well, making her more fatigued..But able to go a bit faster, as her body focused on speed at the moment..Stepping onto the next set of tracks possibly?* - Mon Sep 28 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, Well I specialise in ninjutsu so I guess this won't help. - Mon Sep 28 01:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) //https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwlYstABFSM

Kohaku would've flawlessly ran through all of the kunai, aside from a single swipe on her back, blood dripping little by little..She'd stop for a moment as..Suddenly the traps stopped and the golem was formed..Her eyes opened widely, She'd bite the bottom of her lip..She'd form a single handseal as her body began to get into a stance..Fire radiated around her form as a clone of her appeared next to her, copying her motions, also activating her sharingan..

She'd be in a certain stance along with her clone, both of them cloaked in fire..She'd stare forward and took a deep breathe, both of them split up, running different directions around the large golem at their maximum amount..The heat had lowered to 100 degrees..But was still horrid..Sweat was Drenching her form..Only to evaporate to the flames surrounding her body.

"Ha! As if something like this would stop me!!"* - Mon Sep 28 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9damage - Mon Sep 28 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // Both of the Kohaku's would find this incredibly..Difficult..At her current power..She couldn't do much..Unless she'd conjoin power with her clone..The sharingan's eyes could sense chakra itself, making those techniques themselves easier to dodge.Both of the kohaku's aimed to dodge all of the hits..But the real Kohaku would've formulated through several handseals, sending off a large fireball towards the firsts coming at her, aiming to buy her some time and let her escape...

As for the clone, it had dodged all of the fists amazingly..And threw six shurikens onto the golem which stuck..There seemed to be a thin light that reflected from the clone's fire, between the clones fingers..Maybe a wire? Who knew? It seemed to be maybe kohaku was planning something.* - Mon Sep 28 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Kohaku is doing quite well all things considered. - Mon Sep 28 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Although, that's not hard to achieve. - Mon Sep 28 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've watched as it regenerated rather quickly..Getting rather angered..Suddenly she'd be attacked by a series of kunai and as being attacked by the golem's arms now..Unfairness was a bitch..She'd suddenly take off at full speed, running around the golem, a kunai lodging into her arm..Or being deflected by the fire shroud? Who know..But she'd shake it out and continued on.

Her clone began throwingmore and more kunai that latched onto the golem, and..The clone and the real Kohaku met at the point, a nod given as kohaku went through several seals, breathing fire through the cords...It'd be noted, if allowed..There would be over fifty cords connected onto it's side, and running against it's stone skin..If this had been pulled off perfectly, all fifty or more cords suddnely lit up in glorious flames, burning against it's skin..The flames were rather large, and as the flames hit the kunai and shuriken against it's skin, it'd result a large amount of fire protruding it's skin..

Then she'd formulate through several handseals as the fire met with the shuriken, releasing yet another large fireball, now shooting it where all the fire would meet, hopefully breaking it's skin..In a rather large explosion maybe. As for the clone, it'd run around, formulating several handseals and spinning back around follow kohaku, and shot another large fireball..Resulting in a large explosion..Of two fireballs and fifty cords of fire..

This would most likely blow a hole in the golem? If not..Well, Kohaku was out of strategies for the most part.* - Mon Sep 28 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) fell onto her knees with a smile, the shadow clone poofing away as her shroud of fire dissipated, and her sharingan turned off, along with her stance stopping..

"T-Thanks.."* - Mon Sep 28 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Sure... - Mon Sep 28 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had to focus on more physical forms of fighting..But for now, she'd result to ninjutsu, upon seeing the fireballs made, her hands bumbled into the same set of handseals, colliding with himura's own fireballs..As for kohaku herself? She'd taken off in a dash, holding the giant shuriken in hand..

If her speed had been fast enough, she'd zoom right behind himura, giving him a smile..If she had not been, she would've ran around him, grinning of course..

"You should get into the spar."* - Mon Sep 28 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) grinned as the male had aimed to attack her, suddenly the giant shuriken itself became alive with glorious flames as he went to slice into her arm. She'd raise the shuriken, ramming it forward into his kunai instead, hopefully overpowering it..

And if she did this correctly, she'd aim to push him back before going for a quick punch to his gut, and if this had all gone correctly the female would've then aimed to leap backwards and throw the flaming shuriken towards himura.* - Mon Sep 28 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've opened up her eyes widely, suddenly they'd swirl red and gain a single tomoe around the iris, while the pupil turned red. She'd just away from the fire, aiming to manuever herself around the male and end up behind him..If she was successful, she'd release a punch to the back of his head, followed by a kick to the butt.

And then she'd dash backwards if successful.* - Mon Sep 28 21:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've nailed him in the face instead of hitting him in the back as planned, which sucked..She'd blink as he suddenly created a large mud river liquified the earth..So he also used doton, which was an annoyance to her..She'd attempt to quickly dash backwards, getting out of range of the mud most likely.

"Oi Oi, I didn't know you used doton to." She'd say if she was successful..* - Mon Sep 28 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a small sigh, as he shot the fireballs, "You're not being to fun, Himura!" She'd say angrily, "Maybe this'll make you fun!" She'd slide her leg bag as chakra began to surround most of her figure, before not to long she was wrapped in a shroud of fire, and in a special stance taught to her by kenshin. 

She'd suddenly dash forward, dodging the fireballs as she went for a straight up attack, aiming to nail her fist into his face with a rather heavy hit.* - Mon Sep 28 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as her shroud of fire dissipated and her stance changed, her eyes twirling back to normal as she'd sigh, "I'm sorry."* - Mon Sep 28 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Why not? - Mon Sep 28 22:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll be right here. - Mon Sep 28 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Waiting. - Mon Sep 28 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) didn't have much to do with their time..So she'd turn around and began jogging in a circle, expanding over time as she'd keep going faster and faster, wider and wider, till she was at full speed and going in quite a large circle..

She'd continue this for quite some time, waiting for himura to get his ass back here..* - Mon Sep 28 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've gotten down into a running stance, before dashing off forward..Going top speed forward as the grass flew around her, she'd be gunning it straight ot the edge. The female then leapt off of the edge, looking down at the water as she'd utilize her suimen technique, sliding down the cliff, before coming to a complete stop..To which she'd then twist around and rush upwards, leaping up and onto the ground. 

Once she'd land, Kohaku would've skid against the ground, before running towards the walls as fast as she could, she'd have to please kenshin with her speed! The female kept up at an average high speed pace of her choosing, a steady 134mph..Which was pretty insane for a human in all actuality..But then again, her teacher had been the mighty kenshin..So of course, being his student..She'd have to be strong as well!

She'd have no worries about himura at the moment, he told her he'd be fine, so if he wasn't..She'd have to kick his ass as hard as she could...She'd focus on that as well. Her legs continued at a speedy pace, racing towards the wall. Once the female had reached the wall, she'd utilize her suimen technique once more, leaping onto the wall before she'd begin her run upwards. She'd dash all the way up before she'd leap up off of the wall, landing on the top of it. 

She took a quick breather, looking at her surroundings for a moment..She'd have to get faster and stronger..Somehow, Someway..She had to. If she were ever going to please her master, she'd have to beat any other student he's ever had! She was going to be the one! The one who would triple his sound-breaking speed! This drove her with motivation of course, filling her with adrenaline..!

She'd begin another run on the top of the wall this time, before leaping off of it, and sliding down the actual wall with her suimen technique..She'd be doing more of a slide-run now, aiming to gain even more speed from the extra boost from gravity. She'd have even more speed now, and the moment she hit the ground, she'd take off in a sudden dash towards the tree that seemed to be not so far away.

Her legs carried her quite far lengths as she percieved herself to be decently fast, not as fast as kenshin though..But she'd be there soon! The female continued on however! Once she had reached the tree, she'd leap up onto it, climbing up it without the use of suimen, and getting onto one of the branches as she'd quickly run off of it, thanks to her small figure, she weighed little to nothing..So the branch didn't break.

She'd quickly leap off of the branch, doing a flip in mid-air as she'd slide onto the ground. Once on the ground, she'd stare forward, tensing up her leg-muscles as she'd zip-zap forward, now going in different formations that would make it as if she were going against obsticles..She'd have to get faster and faster, stronger..And stronger for kenshin to truly take her in as a student! Above Edge, and Sabo! She would be..Number one!* - Mon Sep 28 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've continued on with her dash forward, feeling her legs tense up..But she hadn't one care for them! Her legs would carry her to the heavens or to hell! She would be faster then kenshin! She would have her family be proud of the life she had lived from their sacrafice..Her dreams were to be recognized by the shinobi world, and let them all know just who she is, And just what that bitch noriko had done to her whole family..These thoughts fueled her with rage and ignition..Keeping her going forever!

She'd keep her dash up in rapidness, the grass flying up behind her as she'd start running alng the wall once she'd reach it..She kept good tracks of her speed and stamina, somehow able to calculate how much she'd have left in all of her skillsets. She'd utilize Katon and Taijutsu together one day, and make it the ultimate fighting technique...If she were to turn the shroud of fire into some type of Nintaijutsu technique, she wouild most likely have to train them together in some sort of co-operation..Maybe she could one day get kenshin to help her..Yet she kenw he didn't like elemental-jutsus..Neither did sanoke..

She'd continue her run across the walls, tracking them precision until spinning around and running the way back around..Her speed picking up as she saw a familiar face crutching her way up..Kohaku's legs raced far and wide towards the girl, going off of course..She'd look like a tiny ass cheetah running towards kirie..She couldn't slow down..! Once she'd reach kirie, she'd literally do a front-flip over the woman, and land next to her, rubbing the back of her head.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) opened her eyes widely as he did...God knows how many kicks within a few seconds, she'd blink several times tying to comprehend that..Even with her sharingan, it'd be near-impossible to read the amounts of kicks he'd just popped out there.

"W-Wow.."* - Tue Sep 29 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You'll figure it out. - Tue Sep 29 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Soon. - Tue Sep 29 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I see.. - Tue Sep 29 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So..How do I..Do the technique, Kenshin-Sama? - Tue Sep 29 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You have to practice your legs. - Tue Sep 29 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You've run a lot, haven't you? - Tue Sep 29 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: A lot. - Tue Sep 29 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yes. - Tue Sep 29 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Try kicking really fast in front of you. - Tue Sep 29 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thought for a moment, that didn't seem that hard..Kenshin made it look like a breeze..Then again, kenshin's legs were probably more muscular then the gods themselves. She'd nod at kenshin before balancing herself on one leg and sending a decently fast kick forward, it would be pretty fast..But not -that- amazingly fast.

"Like that?"* - Tue Sep 29 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: To be quite fair. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You're pretty good. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: For a starter. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Means you have the potential to master this. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Try it again. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: But this time. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Don't fully extend your leg. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Just bend it and kick. - Tue Sep 29 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: And then repeat rapidly. - Tue Sep 29 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm..I see. - Tue Sep 29 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 29 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What you guys doing. - Tue Sep 29 01:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Training. - Tue Sep 29 01:34:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You know the farm offers good chicken, right? - Tue Sep 29 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) got back into her position, she'd raise her leg, standing still as she'd beathe in her nose and out of her mouth as kenshin had taught her during their first training session, she'd attempt to kick in the air several times, of course..Accidently overextending her leg the first couple of times..She was not to used to a technique such as this, but her flexibility sure did help in this situation.

She'd take a deep breathe before releasing out, this time though, she'd do a quick two small kicks infront of her, which seemed to be faster then her before-kicks. She'd get rather excited by this and continued on..Attempting another two fast kicks..One failing, one succeeding..She'd have to try harder god damnit! She had to impress kenshin even more! She'd raise her leg a bit higher and did a perfect four-hit combo with her leg this time, each one being the same length as well.

"Am I doing good?"* - Tue Sep 29 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Impressive. - Tue Sep 29 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) nodded to kenshin, putting a thumbs up towards him with a large smile, "Alright! Once more for the win!" She'd say rather happy, this time more joy and excitement inside of her, that burning passion of praise filling inside of her once more! She'd raise her leg up and started off with two quick kicks in the air, each one more perfect then the last. She'd continue on with the next, this time she'd of done four perfect short fast kicks in the air, all of them looking a bit faster then before. 

She'd have to continue on until she could do more! She'd raise her leg even higher, and started rapidly jabbing the air with her foot, Two..Four..Six..Four..Six..Two..She'd stop and repeat over and over each time she did the tiniest of fails..After about six minutes, she'd finally get the perfect string of kicks. Within a minute, she'd of kicked the air with near-perfection, doing around eight kicks in perfection within the second.

"How was that Kenshin-Sama?"* - Tue Sep 29 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: It was excellent. - Tue Sep 29 01:44:57 2015
