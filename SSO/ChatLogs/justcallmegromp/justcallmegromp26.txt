<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) followed along with the group as he'd begin taking out several kunai as he'd strap some explosive tags on to each end, around five at the most. Once he'd finsh, he placed them in his side. The male watched as katsune sent a clone rushing in front of the group towards the scorpions..There sure were a crap-ton of them..

Susumu kept his eyes on the group, watching over the other three as he'd slip his hand down and grab the end of a kunai, taking it out of his pocket. He'd divide the scorpions in his mind, two hundred..Fifity for each of them, he'd think inside of his mind. A single step was taken forward as it seemed katsune was rushing faster then the other two..And it seemed she had laid out a clone to protect trilliam and himself which was annoying...

He'd quickly began moving forward, a good..Twenty feet per second, he wasn't that fast compared to all the other shinobi..So it wasn't amazing. He'd run a bit away from the group, a good..Thirty feet between trilliam and susumu. Lifting up a singular kunai, he'd quickly throw the kunai at a set of scorpions, it'd implant into the ground before going off, killing around ten-twenty of them within a moment, and hurting around...Ten others.

The male keeps on going, he didn't have any clones like Katsune..Or AOES like marrissa..And he was probably less-skilled then trilliam, being the weakest link on the team sucked. The male continued on though, gripping onto two more kunai as he'd zip them out of his pockets. There seemed to be an array of scorpions rushing towards susumu, as well as them rushing at katsune..It was a divided effort, susumu would probably claim failure in the end though. 

He'd leap backwards, throwing out another kunai as it'd blow up in their faces, blasting more off again. Although they seemed to be fast, he'd quickly begin a small retreat, throwing another kunai as it'd blow up several more scorpions in an instant. He only had two left..Which was a problem. He'd keep on his run back towards the group, as he had strayed off a little to the right, Scorpions rushing behind him.* - Fri Oct 16 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) kept on his run towards the group, sliding in behind katsune's clone as he'd throw another kunai towards the group of dwindling scorpions, blowing up the tag right in their face, effectively killing off the last of them...Or so he'd thought..More seemed to spring out once again, rushing towards the group and susumu..Annoyance surrouded the male's head as he stared forward at them, with his single kunai and explosive tag left..Well, it was time to improvise.

A sudden spring of his hands, and with that, a chain of events were set into motion..Suddenly around a hundred or so clones of susumu surrounded the area within a moment, each carrying a kunai in hand..It'd be noted they were surrounded all the scorpions, and they'd be throwing kunai every moment they could..But the scorpions also attacked them..So the best part about this, was that they kept splitting up..So in time there'd most likely grow to be four hundred susumu's or more in the area. All of them throwing kunai around the area, it was a..rather massive army suddenly filling the area. 

And added to marrisa's attacks, the clones began to grow and grow from the amount of attacks...There'd most likely end up being over a thousand susumu's by the end of her attacks...So it'd be insanely hard to keep track of everything now, but the real susumu was easily visible..As he was stated right next to katsue's clone, keeping still. He'd toss out his final kunai, blowing up another array of scorpions.* - Fri Oct 16 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) would've simply sat there now, wearing down the remaining scorpions with constant mist servant attacks, the susumu's were around 1,000+ at the moment, so it was utter chaos...Of course, once the scorpions were gone, they'd all dissipate into nothingness within a moment's notice..Although for now, it looked like a miniature slow army was formed around the area...He'd lay back and stand next to katsune's clone, waiting for the fighting to end.* - Fri Oct 16 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) continued to laid back, relaxing as everyone continued to fight onwards, his clones continued to multiply each time they were attacked..It was a gruesome technique or AoE shinobi indeed....A single sigh was given, the male snapped his fingers in an instant, suddenly all of the clones evaporated into nothing, the army was gone within a moment's notice, there may or may not be any more scorpions left, who knew. Susumu had simply felt the need to cause panic in the scorpions, most likely terrifying any of the alive ones.* - Fri Oct 16 22:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) lead her off.* - Sun Oct 18 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) was horrid at hand to hand combat, his body was usually beat to a pulp as he took two dempsey rolls in a short amount of time..His jaw ached but he'd get over it. He had no sensing capabilites, and overrall for him, his dark chakra was usually unnoticable and anyone who did notice it, usually ignored it 99.9% of the time. The male noticed the small aura around her, a blank look given at her..He could really only fight with curses..

But alas, he'd have to fight..Somehow. So he'd take a step back as he'd begin chanting, not caring for the woman to hear, chakra swelled inside of his core..As he did this, he'd create a single handseal as nearly seventy five clones of him spewed up from the earth, surrounding asteroth and hiding the real one's location as he moved amongst the crowd, lowering his voice of course.* - Sun Oct 18 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) would've finished his chant as the woman commented, tossing the dark spears forwards, "They work amazingly well together!" He'd scream out with a smile, as a spear cut his shoulder, but now there were over a hundred and twenty susumu's, and they all began throwing kunai knives towards asteroth..As yellow words shot out of the male's body towards the woman, aiming to wrap around her body and put her under paralysis.* - Sun Oct 18 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) had apparently been unable to talk and cast a jutsu at the same time, and apparently asteroth had amazing hearing to hear his nearly completely quiet voice..But whatver, He'd of finished his incantation and stuff, and since asteroth had somehow found him amongst the large crowd, he'd notice the several spheres, and quickly aimed to leap back from their direction, dodging them hopefully as he'd cast out his technique, sending yellow words bounding towards the female.* - Sun Oct 18 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) had quite an idea as he caught the woman in paralysis..Of course, being a rather..Smart intellectual, He'd muster up that asteroth most likely knew how to break curses..So he'd begin his walk towards the woman as his clones continued to bumble around, a very quiet whisper being drawn out from inside of him as he approached it, the other clones doing the same.* - Sun Oct 18 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) would've...Not been expecting this. His chanting stopped the moment the monstrosity was made...His mouth just wide open with amazement and a tinge of fear from the female's summoning...He'd never...Quite seen something like this....Well, it was pretty much over with a single hit to the male as he was pinned down, a gasp of air being shoved down onto the ground painfully. 

He'd release asteroth as he was currently..In a bad situation.* - Sun Oct 18 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright.. - Sun Oct 18 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) also got up.* - Sun Oct 18 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) nodded..listening to her, before getting a thwack in the head..He'd let out a sigh and sit on the ground slowly, a bit of pain in his head from the thwack..But he'd be fine. The male would've gotten into a meditative pose and brought his hands together as he closed his eyes, focusing on the inner-core of his body...

A single sigh as given as he'd hear her, nodding. He'd never -had- to specifically concentrate his chakra except for his words, but it couldn't be that hard. He'd begin concentrating as he brought out his inner-chakra from his body and...nothing happened...He'd have to try once more, this time ripping his chakra out from his core and around his being, it was flawed, wild, and unstable..Thus it was quickly dissipated into nothingness.

A single sigh was given as he'd continue on focusing on bringing the veil of dark chakra. He'd focus for a few moment, messing around with his chakra network before bringing it outside of his body in a more gentle manner, and forming a very elegant stream this time, as he was instructed by Asteroth..He wasn't a natural genius for nothing....It did take several tries since he was no god-tier prodigy....

"What now?"* - Sun Oct 18 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) continued on with the session, having formed the chakra around himself in a gentle stream. He'd slowly begin to divide it..First one was divided, creating a spear..It was decently long, a bit unstable but stable enough to keep together as susumu's will forced it to. He'd continue on with this, slowly but surely dividing them up after some time, after it all, he'd create five spears above his form, or around...Maybe he finally completed the jutsu?

Well, if he had, he'd shoot them forward, piercing into a tree with all five.* - Sun Oct 18 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) apparently was horridable with learning new techniques as the moment he tried to divide them, it'd all shatter into nothingness, gone forever. He'd let out a sigh as he'd draw the stream out once more, it looked quite elegant by now, matching the female's. A single glance was given towards her as the male continued on..Struggling to shape the chakra and mold it into a certain form. 

After several long moments, he'd rip apart 1/5th of it, and formed a sloppy spear, a sigh was given as a reaction towards this. He'd dissemble it, and form it once more..Now splitting the group up once more, 1/5th leaving as it'd form a spear, which seemed to be more..Graceful and perfect this time around.

He continued on with his learnings, and continued dividing each and every 5th of the elegant stream of dark chakra. He'd reform it after a minute of dissembling it into different pieces around ten times. It had apparently been more difficult then earlier instructed, since susumu usually had a breeze of a time learning techniques, especially basic ones..

After molding together his chakra more and more, dividing it into seperate parts several times over and over...He'd finally hit the mark one final time. After ripping apart the elegant stream with a gentle twist of his chakra, it'd form into five spears, each one seemed to have a slight glow to it, and shined from the sun...If he had learned the technique that is..But if he hadn't well he'd have to continue trying more and more..

And he was looking like a retard to asteroth now.

Well, with the five spears perfectly formed, he'd motion them with his will, shooting them forward..Except now, they did indeed pierce the tree in a perfect manner. Five slices on each layer on the tree from to to bottom...* - Sun Oct 18 03:01:20 2015
