<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) //Blah blah, she had her skin carved in and such, letting out small screams of pain as she bit her tongue, "...Write..your name.." she'd mutter, painfully.* - Wed Sep 30 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) cringed from the word being written, she could tell what was written..but ignored it..Biting her tongue..She'd endure through the pain. She'd then feel her back being practically ripped through, kirie carving pointless lines down her back painfully..Kohaku holding in any screams of pain..

"Family..is..all..dead..All I care for..Is..Kenshin..and..Fujitora...Sanoke.." She'd mutter painfully.* - Wed Sep 30 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been pushed forward to where her ass was up in the air, pain circulating throughout her body..Her hands grasped the cold ground painfully as she'd grit her teeth together..She couldn't ignore the pain any longer..She was hot and sweaty and her back felt on fire. Kohaku woud've felt another two words written above her butt, now screaming out in pain instead of holding it in..It was to much for her..Her hands looking to grab onto something but nothing was there..

The young uchiha was shaking with pain as she'd keep her eyes shut, "No...Fujitora..is..my..distant relative..in..a way..You'll...never..understand my friends..because you.." She'd bite her lip from pain for a moment, "You'll never..have relationships..like..mine.." She'd say with pain in her voice, she could only take so much.* - Wed Sep 30 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been shaking by now, her ass doing a small jiggle as it was slapped..She'd slowly glance back at kirie, listening to her talk about her eyes..Fujitora had spoken about them with this..woman..How could he? She' be spanked yet again, biting her lip once more as she didn't exactly enjoy being spanked..And to make it worse..the wires were pulled tighter, some of her skin having bruises of lines, others having small bits of bleeding as she'd feel pain erupting all around her body, letting out another scream of pain.

Kohaku hadn't built herself to take damage, only inflict it..The young uchiha would've continued to have her ass slapped repeatedly, it jiggled each time she did, and by the end had a handprint of kirie's hand. The uchiha was breathing heavily now, getting angered and pained by what kirie was speaking of...and of what she was feeling...It was to much for her to handle..

"You..Don't...know..anything..." she'd say, painfully..Her voice hoarse and her body shaking, blood dripping from various places around her body, "Y-You'll..never...under..stand.." she'd mutter, trying to keep herself together..The pain overcoming her though, her body couldn't stop shaking and her heart wouldn't stop racing..Yet kohaku's will still held tightly.* - Wed Sep 30 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've continued to scream in pain as the woman continued really..She'd look up at kirie as she herself was being rather perverted..

"You..just..wouldn't..understand.." She'd mutter, as her butt was grabbed again, but this time squeezed and pulled to the side a bit..Causing kohaku to shift a bit. Her body was covered in sweat and she was in a state of misery..But she wouldn't let this beat her spirit..No matter what kirie did, kohaku would stay strong, that's how she was. As the girl talked about more carving..Kohaku let out a fake smile..

"It doesn't matter..what..you do..to..my body...You'll never...Hurt me.." she'd say with a small scream, followed by a muffled one..."I wasn't..thinking.about...any of them.." She'd say painfully, her legs shaking with pain as her back was nearly giving out, her spine sticking out from how skinny she was, "You're..just giving..me..more beauty...marks..Kirie.." she'd say with a fake laugh, followed by a muffled scream as she wrote on her skin once more.* - Wed Sep 30 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was trembling..But she couldn't give in..Even if it meant suffering for hours on end..Kohaku had to stay strong if she wanted to see kenshin again..Her mind and body told her no, and that she should just have the torturing stop..But her soul, her soul told her to stay strong, and keep together. So the female had done just that..Even as she heard the tanto coming out of it's sheathe..She'd grit her teeth, waiting for her skin to be cut even more..Well, that didn't happen.

Suddenly the girl would've let out a scream as the wires cut into her skin all over her boy, the girl literally screaming bloody murder..And then well..She'd have the hilt of a tanto shoved up her -tiny- ass..And that..That was probably the worst pain..She'd let out a painful scream at the top of her lungs..She could barely withstand any more...Even with her will and soul clinging on..Her body was no match for this..

The female would've shook with absolute pain, her back and ass feeling as if they'd just been ripped to shreds and ripped open forcefully..Which one had been. As she'd feel the tanto shoving up inside of her, tears rolled down her cheeks, she couldn't find anything to grip onto..Which was overrall complete torture as well..She couldn't do anything to save herself, and there was no knight in shining armor on the way to rescue her...

She'd drop her head down onto the ground, her legs shaking more then before as she could barely keep herself up..Turning into a wreck as blood was slowly dripping from parts of her body, her heart beating more the average as she was covered in sweat..She felt extremely warm and humiliated...She hadn't wished for this..at all, she only wished to get stronger..What had she done to deserve pain like this?* - Wed Sep 30 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had already been defeated physically, her boy shaking as she stared up at kirie with heavy breathes, "You'll..never...understand..What willpower..can..do..to a person.." She'd say as the woman walked back around, shoving the tanto inside of her even more, the girl screaming out once more..Pain continuing to course through her body as her face was covered in tears..She'd never even have that hole touched one..A small bit of blood coming out of it as the tanto continued..Pain was just coursing through every fiber in her body.* - Wed Sep 30 04:07:02 2015

Her voice echoed outside of the cave, for anyone to hear..She hadn't been a good enough shinobi yet to activate her sharingan on reflex..She wasn't on that level of skill yet..Since she had never quite experienced a genjutsu herself.* - Wed Sep 30 04:30:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've gotten up, stretching her body for a few moments..She didn't like cold caves, and she'd have to get stronger while here she guessed. The female slowly turned towards the bookshelf and got into a running position before dashing at it as fast as she could, then she'd twist around and run the opposite way. Half-way through she'd jump into the air and do eight short kicks within a second, before landing on the ground and continuing her run. 

Her legs continued onwards to the wall, before jumping up and landing on the wall, flipping back onto her feet and turning around once more. She'd then dash once more, running towards the bookshelf once more as she'd leap into the air once more, doing another eight small kicks in the air within a second, this time landing on one foot. Before leaping forward, once she'd reach the bookshelf she'd gently go ontop of it, her weight helping not knock it over as she'd then do a flip backwards, landing on her feet.

She'd have to continue her training within the small room unless of course, erebus decided to have her stop...But if he didn't, she'd twist back around and got back into her running position as her muscular legs dashed forward, running up against the wall as she'd utilize the suimen technique, running up the wall before transitioning upside down. She'd dash now upside down, running on the ceiling as she didn't disturb a single thing, no lights or anything..Her weight wasn't that much and she was very good with balance, so she was good at making sure not to run into things.

She'd continue onwards, running upside down before jumping off, doing a roll downwards and landing on her foot and leg, taking a deep breathe in with her nose and out with her mouth..A deep breathe was given in and out. She'd continue on with her running, dashing towards the wall and leaping onto it, utilizing her suimen once more. She'd dash on the side of the wall now, going at full speeds once more, she was rather quick on the wall, since she went a good hundred and thirty four miles per hour..So, she was moving pretty quickly. 

Her legs carried her quickly as she'd switch walls, and run up one once more, now leaping onto the ceiling. She'd rush on the ceiling now, running upside down to the bookshelf. She'd land ontop of it, with little room to spare between her and the bookshelf. With a quick small leap she'd drop down onto her feet breathing a bit heavily, but calmed herself down as she'd take more air in with her nose and let it out of her mouth. 

Her legs then carried her forward, dashing towards the opposite wall once more as she'd continue her dash..Now running at the wall once more, her legs were carrying her quite fast..Probably higher then regular genin-speed. She'd continue on her running, this time doing several flips in the air after a large leap, and kicking the ground with a kick. She'd land on a single foot before doing a flip and landing on her palms. She'd then lean onto her feet once more, bending upwards and back onto her feet once more, taking a deep breathe as she had to take time to regain her stamina.* - Thu Oct  1 01:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hmm? Sure? - Thu Oct  1 03:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) turned towards the wall with a quick breathe, in her nose and out of her mouth as she'd get into a running position. Suddenly she'd zoom forward towards the wall, her legs moving faster then most people. She'd zoom straight into the wall, leaping up onto it as she'd land a single foot on it before flipping backwards onto it, landing on her hands then balancing herself until she could plop onto her feet. 

Once back onto her feet she'd raise her leg up, suddenly splitting out eight kicks within a second, and repeating this for about a minute or two, constantly kicking the air several times over the span of a second to sixty seconds. Once she felt she was done she'd get onto both of her legs and began doing stretches, cracking her neck and fingers, as well as stretching out her legs, along with other muscles. Once she had completed her quick break she'd look back towards the wall and quickly leapt up on the wall, before leaping up onto the ceiling, staying up by utilizing the suimen technique. 

Once up, she'd begin preforming squats now, upside down squads. Gravity wished for her to fall, but of course she'd defy it. After around a hunred and sixty-six squats she'd take a deep breathe, dropping off the floor and landing onto the ground with a flip. She'd have to move onto her next training exercise, facing the wall and leaping onto it utilizing suimen once more as she'd begin racing back and forth between the room, going south then north repeatedly. It'd be noted she seemed to be quite fast and as if she were a taijutsu specialist, but who knew.

She'd continue on with her training, once more finishing the nineteenth time to the south, she'd leap off, sliding on her feet to an upright stand. She'd once more lift a leg up, preforming sixteen quick small but powerful kicks within the span of four seconds. After around two-hundred and ten kicks in the air she'd lower her leg back to normal height with a sigh, taking a moment to herself to regain stamina and energy. She'd breathe in her nose and out of her mouth as her body cooled down. 

The female might be a slave or something, but that didn't mean she couldn't continue her training. Several more kicks were given into the air a final time before she'd plop down and begin doing squats.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) slowly moved over from erebus, and faced the wall with a single sigh..She'd have to at least stay fit while being here..So she'd slowly slide her leg back into a taijutsu stance. With a single kick forward she'd suddenly dash forward, she'd leap onto the hokage's building and dahsed up on the side of it, by utilizing her suimen technique. Her legs carried her over the door, as she'd dash on the wall, leaping off of it with a single spin in the air, landing on her feet with a little wobble.

She'd then dash towards the tree, closing the speed rather quickly. She'd jump up and land on the tree, doing a flip backwards and landing back onto her feet. She'd then take a quick moment to gain some stamina back..And continued on, suddenly dropping down into a position as she'd start doing squats rapidly. Two, four, six, eight..And it went on from there, she'd of finished when she neared around fifty squats. Letting herself rest for a moment before focusing on a different tree. 

She'd shift her body into position as she dashed off towards another tree, this time instead of leaping onto it..She'd stop with a sudden slide, raising her foot as she'd start rapidly kicking it with her foot. Eight kicks per second were her usual amounts, but she'd slowly change it, one on the first second, two on the second, and it went up until she made it to eight seconds. On the eight second, she'd continue doing eight kicks per second for a good three minutes.

A single glare was given at the tree as her leg lifted back down, a sigh escaping her lips..She didn't like all the green here to much..She'd turn it to black sometime later, she'd think to herself. But for now, she'd deal, Taking a moment to rest up she'd then begin a jog. The female would've began running at medium speed, a good seventy miles per hour, around half her speed of course. She'd begin jogging around the trees, swirving left and right, and going over to the next set of trees. This time utilizing her suimen technique to leap onto one tree, and leap onto the other before leaping back onto the building.

She'd let out a sigh as she'd begin running up the kage building, but when she got to the top, she'd turn her suimen off, she'd fall down, and utilize it again to slide down. She'd repeat this several times, now training her chakra control quite a bit as well as her stamina and speed. After around twelve times running up and sliding down. She'd stop and take a moment, standing next to erebus to rest.* - Thu Oct  1 22:35:05 2015

Once she'd reach the top, she'd begin kicking out singular leaves, every kick blew away several leaves..So within ten seconds, there were over a...lot of leaves falling on the ground as she'd break a branch on accident.

After that, she'd quickly leap back onto the ground, running past yumiko once more as she'd place her foot on the side of the kage building, utilizing her suimen technique once more. She'd run up the side of the building and onto the top of the first set..She'd then begin running around the kage building..Several times, running at a speed of fifty miles per hour..Not that fast, but fast enough for her...She'd run around the building around nine times before stopping in the front above the door..She didn't really like that erebus gave her so much freedom..Yet she did like..But she couldn't leave, which also sucked..

A sigh was given out as she'd stare among the land infront of her..Missing the cold waves and her master..But she'd have to deal with the circumstances for now, he'd taught her...A single move which would be very effective in her life..And she'd make sure to keep it to herself until she'd maybe live long enough to grab ahold of a student of her own..Maybe. She'd continue on with her exercise, sliding down the wall and leaping onto the ground as she'd bolt past the trees, beginning a circular run.

As she'd begin her circular run, she'd take her hands out of her pockets and got into a position, going somewhat faster now..As she'd whirl around the sets of trees several times, her legs going faster then most people thought. After around twenty laps she'd slide into a complete stop and faced the tree, raising her leg as she'd begin rapidly kicking the tree now, causing it shake several times. She seemed to be preforming seven to eight kicks per second, and to note, they were semi-short kicks.

After around five minutes of hundreds of kicks she'd stop kicking the tree for a moment as she took a deep breathe. With swiftness, she'd turn and leapt over anyone in her way, before reaching the kage's mansion once more. She'd turn around and then began to do rapid squats next to erebus. Her body was going a little faster then she'd usually go, as she was in training-hype at the moment. After around a hundred and fourty five she'd stop doing squats, standing up completely straight as she'd let out a deep sigh.* - Thu Oct  1 23:41:39 2015

As she'd begin her circular run, she'd take her hands out of her pockets and got into a position, going somewhat faster now..As she'd whirl around the sets of trees several times, her legs going faster then most people thought. After around twenty laps she'd slide into a complete stop and faced the tree, raising her leg as she'd begin rapidly kicking the tree now, causing it shake several times. She seemed to be preforming seven to eight kicks per second, and to note, they were semi-short kicks.

After around five minutes of hundreds of kicks she'd stop kicking the tree for a moment as she took a deep breathe. With swiftness, she'd turn and leapt over anyone in her way, before reaching the kage's mansion once more. She'd turn around and then began to do rapid squats next to erebus. Her body was going a little faster then she'd usually go, as she was in training-hype at the moment. After around a hundred and fourty five she'd stop doing squats, standing up completely straight as she'd let out a deep sigh.* - Thu Oct  1 23:45:04 2015

Along with that, her eyes swirled and formed a single tomoe around her pupil, as her eye turned red within the inside..Forming the sharingan.

As for her clone, they'd run up as well, but instead of launching a physical assault, they were launching something else, suddenly the clone zipped through several handseals before releasing another barrage, this time it hppened to be eight small fireballs, all aiming around erebus, and where he might go to dodge.* - Fri Oct  2 15:59:34 2015

And they would have, two against her back, but the blow wasn't as severe due to her cloak of chakra..And with that, she'd grit her teeth, aiming to unleash another barrage against erebus's face, eight kicks in total.* - Fri Oct  2 16:08:57 2015

However, the clone was still on the battlefield, and kohaku wouldn't of given up, even as her cloak of fire diminished..Suddenly the clone jotted through several more handseals, this time shooting out a large fireball towards erebus instead of smaller ones.* - Fri Oct  2 16:20:03 2015
