<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) didn't feel like being affected by yet another genjutsu as she stared at rymei's eyes, she'd take out a kunai as it lit ablaze infront of rymei, "Just because my arm and my leg are broke doesn't mean I can't fight you, rymei."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // If rymei had known kohaku, she wasn't a very violent person, and usually resorted to the non-violent way..But..Then rymei cut kohaku's fingers..straight off..Which was rather..Shitty. She'd suddenly blink as the katana cut her fingers straight off, the katana flickered with a large flame before trickling..And with that, half of kohaku's skillset walked out of the door. 

She'd open her eyes widely as suddenly..her fingers kind of disappeared..And blood started coming out of her hand, gushing..She'd then let out a scream of pain moments later after she applied the pressure to her hand kohaku staring up at rymei.

"WHAT THE FUCK!?" She'd say, her eyes twirling into a single tomoe out of anger as her arm was trembling..First her arm and leg, and now she couldn't use her other hand..Kohaku was gonna have to retire from being a shinobi apparently, with all these struggles in her way.* - Thu Oct  8 00:10:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) couldn't..really do much, suddenly her hair was pulled and her body was flailed onto the floor, the rag left behind as her four stubs bled out onto the wood, two other appendages immobile and her only workable leg trying to get her back onto her feet, but failing..She'd bite her tongue, trying to hold back the pain as tears went down her face, her hand hurting immensly.* - Thu Oct  8 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was kept onto the ground as her clothing was stripped off, she'd feel the knee rammed into her back as she'd let out a grunt, her stubs continuing to bleed as blood covered the floor, the female struggling with her single leg, trying to go against rymei's strength..* - Thu Oct  8 00:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) looked up as she'd see the piece of wood, her body suddenly struggling more then before..She didn't want that again! No! The uchiha struggled as much as she could, but it was futile..Rymei would also notice a carved in tatoo right above the female's ass...Kohaku would've heard the word punishment as she'd have flashbacks from kirie..and then to edge..Why..did people always have to do this..?

She'd bite onto her tonuge tightly, causing a bit of blood to come out of it as rymei forcefully inserted the piece of wood inside of kohaku, she wasn't an ass-virgin, but she was still pretty tight..So it would hurt like all hell. Kohaku's bum suddenly began to swirl with pain as it got warm and painful. The girl let out a scream, but kept her tongue bitten down as it was more of an inside scream..Her finger continued to bleed out, her body shaking profusely..She didn't like this one bit..

The girl's breathing increased as her heart rate went up, she was going through a panic attack as memories flooded into her mind from the hours of torture done to her ass..Painful memories scarring her brain as the girl was shaking even more then before, going through a large panic attack.* - Thu Oct  8 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) couldn't escape rape much it seemed..Maybe she attracted it or something? She'd feel rymei inserting it in and out as she'd now let out a real scream, pain coursing through her as well..Was she just going to be tortured like this for the rest of her life? She couldn't answer that..Blood continued to pour of her fingers, kohaku feeling light headed between the blood loss and the woman's wooden object. She'd barely feel the slap to her butt as the girl was still freaking out from a constant panic attack, still struggling against rymei a little lighter now, dried tears stained on her face, fresh ones replacing them.* - Thu Oct  8 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been pinned the floor letting out pained cries as the girl seemed to use the wooden block as..a dildo apparently..Although it didn't really matter to kohaku..She couldn't escape this. The girl's body was immobile for the most part, her breathe was heavy as her shaking came to a halt..She felt light headed and had small flashes of pain, blood continued to pour out of the four stubs of her fingers..She was practically laying in a small pool of blood as her skin drenched in it for the most part..

The girl continued to let out pained cries as rymei continued, her face showing defeat and pain together..She was going in and out of conciousness for the most part.* - Thu Oct  8 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) didn't have much energy, her insides full of pain as rymei continued to pound her..The girl was nearing unconciousness..She couldn't hold out much longer, blood continued to cover the floor from her hand as the let out a final scream of pain as she thrusted it in, pushing against her insides..Kohaku let out a single reply to the female's question..

"F..uc..k..you...B..itc..h..." 

And then she'd pass out from blood loss and pain, she wasn't a very pain-taking person, and anymore pain would cause more mental trauma to the young female's brain.* - Thu Oct  8 01:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) remained unconcious as the girl's body was limp, blood continued to pour out of her fingers less now, seemingly stopping a bit..But she couldn't..do..much..So all the poor fourteen year old could do was lay there in a slight comatose state unless someone decided to help her..If not, well then this would've ended horribly for kohaku..Either way...* - Thu Oct  8 01:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // So, while rymei continued to violate the young unconcious female..The girl's mind couldn't take much more..And suddenly her body began to jerk and flail for several seconds, before going completely limp, her eyes opened during the seizure, but they looked as if she had already died..The female's body stopped moving all together, and her heart stopped within moments...

It looked like the young female wasn't going to be doing anymore training..She couldn't have even given any final goodbyes..It was a pity that her last moments of life were spent in a horrid way.* - Thu Oct  8 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) didn't really have many weakpoints, aside from the usual..Human weakpoints, like necks and such. She was pretty much average, and her chakra was normal. She'd blink once as the male seemed to be preforming handseals..Well, she wasn't much of a fighter at the moment, so if it were a jutsu..this could end badly.

"Yeaaaa, I don't think I wanna spar anymore!"* - Fri Oct  9 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) didn't even..Have a moment to comprehend what the actual fuck was happening at all...She'd see the man get..rather angry as he targeted in on kaori. She'd just recently graduated from the academy, and had been searching for the raikage, niza as a teacher.Since they did share...Many similarities alike..

Well, it looked like she wouldn't have been able to even say hi to the man as within her first few days of graduating, she'd already been struck down in a spar..Suddenly he'd zoom in on her and with that..Kaori was done for..Her reflexes were barely high enough to do anything of usefulness.

She'd be suddenly stabbed straight in the heart, and within that moment..The young girl's life was gone, a flame flickered out..She had never even gotten to really make a friend, which was a shame...The girl's eyes opened widely as her chest was pierced, she hadn't even a moment to respond as she took a step back, her body shook a tiny bit for a final moment before the young girl's body went limp and fell against the ground, cold and dead..* - Fri Oct  9 00:45:13 2015
