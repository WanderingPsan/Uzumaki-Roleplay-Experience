<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) wraps her arm around kenshin's, "Start running. then."

She'd say with a grin, it'd be impossible for her to lose if she held onto kenshin!* - Tue Sep 22 20:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had known kenshin to be one of the fastest things alive, she'd wrap both arms around his arm as he took off..Who the fuck knew if she'd stay on..?* - Tue Sep 22 20:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) fell off in like 0.1 seconds, faceplanting the ground pretty hard, he was then gone, and she just kinda..stayed on the ground.* - Tue Sep 22 20:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) raised an arm into the air, putting a thumbs up. She'd wiggle back up and wipe herself off, a little blood on her cheek, "Pfft! Is that your fastest speed?"* - Tue Sep 22 20:08:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or kenshin, whatever your real name is. - Tue Sep 22 20:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: But I think you'd win a race..At the moment. - Tue Sep 22 20:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: At the moment. - Tue Sep 22 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: I'm glad that you're confident in your skills developing. - Tue Sep 22 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmhmm, Give it a few years, I'll be running twice your speed maybe. - Tue Sep 22 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Maybe even three times. - Tue Sep 22 20:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: I'm glad to hear it. - Tue Sep 22 20:17:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Do you want me to train you? - Tue Sep 22 20:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..I have been looking for a suitable teacher.. - Tue Sep 22 20:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 22 20:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Im mostly capable of using Katon at the moment, but my speed is Decent. - Tue Sep 22 20:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: I don't do elements. - Tue Sep 22 20:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: That's fine. - Tue Sep 22 20:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Follow me for your first lesson. - Tue Sep 22 20:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: So what's the first lesson? - Tue Sep 22 20:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Can you walk on water? - Tue Sep 22 20:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nope. - Tue Sep 22 20:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I can spit hot fire. - Tue Sep 22 20:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: So. - Tue Sep 22 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: I want you to compress chakra to your feet. - Tue Sep 22 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: And try walking across the water. - Tue Sep 22 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Go ahead. - Tue Sep 22 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm...Sounds easy enough. - Tue Sep 22 20:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) did a small leg stretch before taking a deep breathe as her eyes gently closed, chakra churned around in her core before slowly yet surely, traveled through her veins and down into her legs, entering the chakra system that was located down in her feet. She'd attempt to cover the bottom of her soles in chakra, yet she had done this slightly unbalanced..

She'd take a step forward, standing in on one foot..For a mere second before faceplanting into the water.* - Tue Sep 22 20:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) lifted her arm, and did a thumbs up! She was unimpressing kenshin! Which was not allowed in her mind. She'd leap out of the water and took a deep breathe, closing her eyes as she let her chakra churn once more..She'd be covered in water but could care less at the moment. She'd let chakra flow down into the soles of her feet as she'd take another step onto the water, holding it for a good six seconds now..As she had balanced out her chakra, before falling in once again, yet this time it was simply up to her ankles! 

She'd get out and try once more, putting her hands together she'd let the chakra from her core seep down into her veins, traveling down her chakra system into her soles once more..She'd then attempt to take a step or two forward, now standing on the water hopefully.* - Tue Sep 22 20:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Not bad, not bad. - Tue Sep 22 20:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: A fast learner. - Tue Sep 22 20:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: That's good. - Tue Sep 22 20:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Walk one more time. - Tue Sep 22 20:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) took another few steps in the water, hopefully staying ontop of it.* - Tue Sep 22 20:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 20:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Since you can walk on water. - Tue Sep 22 20:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Try walking up the mountain. - Tue Sep 22 20:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Same method right? - Tue Sep 22 20:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Yep. - Tue Sep 22 20:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a gentle sigh, this wasn't draining her chakra one bit really..So she could do this for quite some time. She'd begin her strut towards the mountain and got into a running position..If she could stick to the water using this technique, she could most likely stick to any material with some limits, using this technique.

She'd take a single step back, getting into a running position before aiming to kick herself off the water, and onto the mountain, running up it at a decent pace..A few near-falls, and slips..and slides, but in the end she'd make it to the top, hopefully.* - Tue Sep 22 20:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Keep on going! You're doing great.  - Tue Sep 22 20:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Once you make it up the whole way, today's lesson will be over. - Tue Sep 22 20:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) ran as fast as she could up the mountain, still slipping a few times and restarting..After a good long moment..She'd struggle her way to the top, apparently going on land like this was a bit harder then gentle water. She'd rush herself to the very top, grasping on to dear life, as she didn't wanna slip from here.

She'd sit on the top of the large mountain, looking down at the ground below with wide eyes, "I did it!"* - Tue Sep 22 20:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Did I do okay? - Tue Sep 22 20:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Yes. - Tue Sep 22 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You did fine. - Tue Sep 22 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: I'm glad that you're such a fast learner. - Tue Sep 22 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: It gets boring with the slow ones. - Tue Sep 22 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You still able to continue lessons? Or should I give you a break? - Tue Sep 22 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I can go on as long as you'd like! - Tue Sep 22 20:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Then how about I work on your Taijutsu stance? - Tue Sep 22 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Come down here. - Tue Sep 22 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 20:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) activated her suimen once more, and slid down the mountain, until she hit the water, to which she'd then walk over towards kenshin.

"Taijutsu stance? Alright."* - Tue Sep 22 20:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) watched his movements carefully..He'd draw his leg back with one leg, the one which he hadn't preffered..Interesting, she'd think to herself as she'd study the stance slowly as he got into it. Once he had begun keeping himself in a rhythm..She'd nod at his words.

Suddenly she'd dash forward, raising a fist and attempting to strike him in on his lower-cheek, around his jaw.* - Tue Sep 22 20:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) could barely follow his movements with her own eyes, a blink over-coming her..His movements were quick..This seemed to be an effective stance as he had barely even tried.

She'd be pushed backwards a bit, stumbling until she stood straight, looking up at the man, "O-Oh wow..That was fast."* - Tue Sep 22 20:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: So. - Tue Sep 22 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You're going to learn this stance. - Tue Sep 22 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: And you're going to learn it well. - Tue Sep 22 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Try moving yourself into it. - Tue Sep 22 21:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've slowly slid her...Other leg back..She had felt that her left leg was the best suited to her, as her main hand was her right hand. She'd take a deep breathe as she'd slowly attempt to slide into the stance, she was in an awkward position as she'd bounce on the balls of her feet..

"L-Like this...?" She'd say, shaking in her stance, as it was.Very akward. * - Tue Sep 22 21:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Yes. - Tue Sep 22 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Just like that. - Tue Sep 22 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Though.... - Tue Sep 22 21:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Maybe you should try your other leg. - Tue Sep 22 21:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm..Alright. - Tue Sep 22 21:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've slowly slid her legs at the same time, changing each of her legs. Now she'd be awkwardly bouncing on her other leg, yet it seemed to have a better flow then before, and it wasn't as wobbily..Maybe she had picked the wrong leg before?

She'd bounce a bit awkwardly, but overrall, She'd have it in a good motion.* - Tue Sep 22 21:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Mmmm.... - Tue Sep 22 21:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Practice bouncing. - Tue Sep 22 21:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've nodded as she listened to him, calming her breathe somewhat as her heart slowed down a tiny bit..To regular beats. She'd then slowly focus on simpy bouncing on her foot, going up and down slowly increasing in speed after about a minute, she'd give him a nod, "I think I've got that part..almost down." She'd say with a smile, still a bit wobbily, but her bouncing had gotten a bit better.* - Tue Sep 22 21:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a single nod as she'd begin breathing in her nose and breathing out of her mouth, her breathing steadily calming down. As she did this, she'd begin bouncing on both legs now, her tiny body moing a bit faster then usual, but her breathing kept her rather from getting tired quickly. 

After a while of bouncing on both feet, and keeping her breathing calm and steady for the most part she looked at kenshin, "Like this?"* - Tue Sep 22 21:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Yep, that's it. - Tue Sep 22 21:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 21:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Practice that stance. - Tue Sep 22 21:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) nodded, as she'd begin moving a bit faster now, bouncing up and down more then before, getting into a better understanding of the stance, she'd breathe in with her nose, and breathe out with her mouth, before she'd then start looking a bit more like kenshin did while in the stance, it overrall wasn't that hard to understand, as taijutsu like this was simply understanding how your body works and getting it to work a certain way..

Or well, that's how she saw it, "I think I've pretty much got it..Should you try attacking me?"* - Tue Sep 22 21:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: No, I won't be attacking you. - Tue Sep 22 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: It won'tt be a good assessment. - Tue Sep 22 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You should test it in a real fight against someone else though. - Tue Sep 22 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Tue Sep 22 21:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Tue Sep 22 21:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Shall we continue then? - Tue Sep 22 21:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: That'll be it for today. - Tue Sep 22 21:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Don't be dying on me anytime soon. - Tue Sep 22 21:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Go practice your stuff. - Tue Sep 22 21:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh, alright! - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Mhmm. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Kumogakure and Sunagakure are good places to train as well. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: More clear than Kirigakure. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Kirigakure has the ocean which you can swim in though. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: So that's good for cardio. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmhmm. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Kumogakure has mountains. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Sunagakure's heat is really good for control of your actions. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Since you sweat a lot more. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: And burn energy faster. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: You must travel alot. - Tue Sep 22 21:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: I do. - Tue Sep 22 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: Whenever I'm bored. - Tue Sep 22 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Man..That's nice. - Tue Sep 22 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I wish I could do that. - Tue Sep 22 21:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeki, Kenshin(Barock Obama) says: You'll be able to in the future. - Tue Sep 22 21:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: His name is kenshin. - Tue Sep 22 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: He already taught me two jutsus. - Tue Sep 22 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or..A jutsu and something else. - Tue Sep 22 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Oh really? - Tue Sep 22 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Speaking of that, Would you like to spar? - Tue Sep 22 21:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: Erm, sure. I guess. - Tue Sep 22 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Where? - Tue Sep 22 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: I guess you can just follow me. - Tue Sep 22 21:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) followed.* - Tue Sep 22 21:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Any restrictions? - Tue Sep 22 21:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: The usual. - Tue Sep 22 21:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Like uh..No fire.. - Tue Sep 22 21:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or.. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: No explosives. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..Alright. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: No lethal attacks, worth killing someone. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I might burn you. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: You may begin. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ikarus(Punkamainia) says: It's fine. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: And alright. - Tue Sep 22 21:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) took a deep breathe, she'd learn start with what she learned from kenshin..Suddenly sliding one foot back, and then she'd begin kind of like..Doing a small jump up and down, a small bounce if you will.

Suddenly the female took off in a sudden dash though, aiming to land a punch straight on ikarus's face.* - Tue Sep 22 21:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) successfully hit him, the stance she'd been taught had been pretty darn effective..But her stamina couldn't keep it up all the time, as she had never really gotten used to it..So she'd watch as she sucessfully hit him, causing him to fall back a bit..It had been rather surprising she guessed..But that made her happy.

She'd quickly hop out of the stance for a moment as her hands suddenly shot into several handseals, taking a deep breathe..Suddenly a large fireball shot out of her mouth, most likely overpowering his watergun, and maybe causing it to steam up a bit, but her fireball was rather effective..Hopefully she got it off in time.* - Tue Sep 22 22:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked as he disappeared..It seemed as if the fireball gobbled him up, but she knew how it worked..She guessed she wouldn't hold back against the male, Of course nobody but herself knew about her visual prowess..Since most people had tried to kill her family..And suceeded, but luckily she stayed alive through it all, and got stronger through it.

Suddenly her eyes began to spin and turn red, as a single tomoe appeared in her eye. She'd let out a small smirk, seeing his chakra signature within the ground, "Clever.." She'd mutter..She didn't have any way to really get to him actually..Since she had no ground-destruction techniques...

She'd begin formulating more handseals, as she'd follow any movements he took.* - Tue Sep 22 22:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had kept her sight locked onto ikarus like a hawk, keeping track of his every movement as she held the final seal..And well, as fate would have it..She'd see him suddenly coming up towards her, her body moving out of the way as he popped out of the ground, "Well played, Friend." She'd say with a smile before releasing a large ball of fire right at the ground, burning a crater to the spot where ikarus came out of.

If successful, or if he had dodged and resurfaced, her eyes turned back to normal.* - Tue Sep 22 22:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) gave him a single nod with a bright smile, her dark eyes staring into his soul for a moment. She'd take a step back, "Shall we continue then?"* - Tue Sep 22 23:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) Nodded..She was running low on chakra...Not really, but from the way she saw it, He'd last longer in a fight..So she'd have to end this soon..She'd take a deep breathe, putting a leg back, she'd be ready to enter her fighting stance if needed, but for now..She'd aim to keep using her main jutsu, the fireball.

She'd zip through the handseals, and created yet another large fireball, sending it off in his direction..It seeme as if she were taking this as time to think through how she could use her techniques..Spamming them off randomly at the moment.* - Tue Sep 22 23:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hi. - Tue Sep 22 23:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: They're having a spar by the looks of it. I doubt they can pay much attention to anything else. - Tue Sep 22 23:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Oh. - Tue Sep 22 23:19:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Hm... - Tue Sep 22 23:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I think you better come over here. - Tue Sep 22 23:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Tue Sep 22 23:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Why does everyone do that to me? - Tue Sep 22 23:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) started bouncing as her speed increased to a degree, and she'd form several more handseals, she had been done with this..Those two girls better watch out as well, she'd note.

Suddenly Kohaku took off in a breeze, only to appear close to ikarus, able to use her jutsu..

"Try to dodge this then.." 

She'd think to herself before releasing a flurry of mini-fireballs at ikarus, hopefully hitting him with some.* - Tue Sep 22 23:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hey.. - Tue Sep 22 23:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I'm not really too worried about my leaving being secret or not, I'm just worried about visiting other villages. - Wed Sep 23 17:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Indeed but, I'll just have to make the most of it. - Wed Sep 23 17:26:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Let's go. - Wed Sep 23 17:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked for a moment, looking over at niza, "Hello." She'd say with a kind smile, before turning to the anbu. She'd have bandages over some of her body, by the by. But that wasn't important, She'd come at the masked person easy at first, and then continue on to get stronger.

She'd slid her foot back, and begin a bouncing motion with both of her feet before she suddenly took off in a dash, aiming to land a punch on the anbu's mask with a surprise attack.* - Wed Sep 23 17:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've blinked once as she saw the woman dodge her strike, racing behind the young female rather quickly. She'd guessed that the woman was rather strong..As she wore a scary mask. Kohaku's body was kicked by the opposing female, being pushed off in another direction. 

After a moment, she'd regain herself, the strike had hurt pretty bad..But she could take it. Suddenly the girl's hands started coming together rather quickly before she'd take a quick breathe, suddenly shooting out a flurry of  fireballs towards the anbu, it would be quite hard to dodge.* - Wed Sep 23 17:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: . .. Uh. Are they sparring in a place like this? - Wed Sep 23 17:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was just kinda baffled by all the sudden clones appearing..When did this become a thing? She was never aware of this kind of technique..Damn...Well she didn't see this shit coming. 

The fireballs were all against the raging waves, steam being produced as the two jutsus collided together. She'd leap backwards as apparently one of them also apparently went behind her as well, like how was she supposed to fight this? Damn..How would she fight them all? Well..She certainly had a plan as she'd stare at the line of enemies infront of her..

She had a single plan in mind, to get rid of as many as she could..And with them all being probably as strong as the original, this would be difficult..She had no wire or cord with her, so she'd simply use one of the bodies..Hopefully not failing.

She'd do several handseals as she'd aim at one of the clones, aiming to use them as a conductor, She'd aim to light them on a quick fire, which would hopefully spread to the other shadow clones, if they were close enough that is.

Aside from her using her jutsu, she'd try to keep up with her surroundings, as she'd most likely be attacked from behind.* - Wed Sep 23 17:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been blown back and such, taking out some shadow clones but lost, landing on the ground.

"Good spar." she'd say with a smile, some cuts on her face.* - Wed Sep 23 18:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was apparently also uppercutted, fuck this bitch.* - Wed Sep 23 18:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: You mentioned you were trained by Kenshin. What type of stance were you using to boost your speed? - Wed Sep 23 18:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: It's called the uh..Hit-n-Run style. - Wed Sep 23 18:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Teach me it. - Wed Sep 23 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Why? - Wed Sep 23 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: It's important to my fighting style. - Wed Sep 23 18:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: But I don't get anything out of it. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Also, Kenshin is my teacher. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I cannot give out his techniques so wildly. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Out of all the jutsus I used in our spar, choose one. - Wed Sep 23 18:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Choose one? - Wed Sep 23 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: To learn? - Wed Sep 23 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: Obviously. - Wed Sep 23 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: How did you split yourself up? - Wed Sep 23 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) whispers: A jutsu. - Wed Sep 23 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: That one. - Wed Sep 23 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) blinked once as she formed a clone handseal..She only knew the bunshin, not a solid clone though..This would be more difficult then most things. She'd nod as she clapped her hands together, creating a singel handseal, letting her chakra branch off from her core and spread throughout her body, traveling into all her veins. 

She'd look at the anbu with a weirded-look, thinking, "Is this is gonna be hard?" She'd question, still forming the seal, and letting her chakra travel around her body.* - Wed Sep 23 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Likewise. - Wed Sep 23 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: It's a B-Rank jutsu. - Wed Sep 23 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Wed Sep 23 18:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I see. - Wed Sep 23 18:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) nodded as she'd continue on with her training! Her first B-rank jutsu, this was great. She'd let her chakra gently flow through her body, her mind concentrating rather hard on her chakra, before letting it just flow..She'd remember that she had to let her body settle, and let it just happen. She'd get into her relaxation mode, or concentration mode..Her eyes slowly shut closed.

The girl then let out a small breathe, charging the chakra through her body as she'd form the seal, nothing happening at first, she'd wait for a moment..And nothing happened once more.

She'd let out a sigh, she'd have to redo this once more...She'd close her eyes once more, calming her body down..As her hands slowly stayed up near eachother..Her body stood still as chakra was gently pulled from her core and spread throughout her body, trying to rush out of her body and split up..Which was the basis of bunshin, and had to be the basis of kage bunshin.

She'd let her chakra flow throughout her body in a near-perfect motion, as she'd form a single handseal, suddenly a poof of smoke appeared next to her, a pure-white weird creature appeared, it seemed to look human..But wasn't..and it was kinda dead. She'd poof it out as she'd let out a final sigh.

"This is quite dificult, but I have a knack for learning jutsus." She'd say with a smirk.

Closing her eyes once more, she'd calm her breathing, now in a mode of stasis as she put her hands together, letting chakra flow through her body in an equal manner, she'd have to split her chakra up in a fraction..So she'd attempt to split it up in a good fraction of her chakra, as she'd let the chakra flow out of her body, and suddenly a clone plummited from smoke appeared next to her hopefully.

"Did I do it?"* - Wed Sep 23 18:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Uhuh. - Wed Sep 23 18:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Now then, show me that stance you were in again.. - Wed Sep 23 18:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I guess I should. - Wed Sep 23 18:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) slid her leg backwards as she'd get into a certain stance, doing a small bounce.

"You slid your preferred leg backwards, and then begin a small bounce, using some leg energy." She'd say with a smile, "Now pick which leg you prefer, that's more comfortable."* - Wed Sep 23 18:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) nodded, "Yea that's pretty much it."* - Wed Sep 23 18:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Right.. - Wed Sep 23 19:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) clapped her hands together as she'd draw her chakra out from her core, doing a set of handseals before spewing out fire from her mouth in a straight line, and moving her head around. A "flamethrower" being shot throughout the area infront of her, scorching the ground a bit. 

She'd continue it on for quite some time, until she'd end with a quick breathe, repeating the handseals once more, as she'd draw chakra out, shooting out yet another long stream of fire.* - Wed Sep 23 21:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was simply training over here, spitting out hot fire, Literally. She'd be forming handseals after handseals as she'd keep shooting out more and more flames, in a continous flamethrower that scorched the ground infront of her. Also, to note, the ground infront of her was more of a thick dark black line now.

She'd continue on her training, glancing over at ushiwana if he walked that, that lying son of a female dog..She'd think to herself, but she'd gotten a better teacher anyways.* - Wed Sep 23 21:14:40 2015

She was some savage kinda woman, messing with the ground hard.

She'd let the flames continue on for a few moments before releasing, and re-applying the handseals once more, as she'd take a breathe before shooting out another continuous jet of flames against the ground, covering it in even more scorches.

She'd then zip through a quick set of handseals as she'd aim to shoot out a large flamethrower-like technique from her mouth, hopefully executing it quickly, aiming to hit him of course..Or make him back off.* - Wed Sep 23 22:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Always. - Wed Sep 23 22:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a smile, she'd formulate a plan within her mind for a moment..He was faster..But he had used something she could use against him..If she had used it before, it'd of been over..She'd let out a small smirk..

"Prepare yourself, Sanoke." She'd say with a single smirk.

She'd formulate a single handseal, suddenly two puffs of smoke appeared infront of her as she leapt backwards? What were they? Full on shadow clones, and they looked at sanoke with a glare, already going through handseals, before releasing a storm of fireballs upon him, all together shooting out fourteen fireballs in sanoke's direction, as the real kohaku was formulating her next move.* - Wed Sep 23 22:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) let out a small grin as he'd create a shadow clone, and evaded her fireballs..She'd end this quickly! She hadn't ever really experimented with the shadow clones..So..It was better to do it now then never! Suddenly six more shadow clones were created as she'd form the seal once more, in a screwed up line for the most part...But that wasn't the point.

Suddenly each one formed the same handseals, all eight shooting out seven fireballs from their mouths in the general around sanoke, this would be impossible to dodge for the most part.

As for kohaku, this drained her quite a lot, and her eyes kept keen on sanoke, taking a step back as this all happened..She'd have to get ready to fight him in taijutsu, as that's what he seemed more skilled in...* - Wed Sep 23 23:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) saw the turtle with a simple blink, it'd be noted that every fireball the clones had made left a gentle scorch on the ground, and where-ever it hit also had turned black with ash. She'd think for a moment, what was the best way to handle this? Well of course..She could set all the grass on fire, but there's no fun in that..

"Come fight me, taijutsu on taijutsu." She'd say as all nine of the kohaku's got into a stance, sliding their foot back and doing a small bounce..Before they all took off in different directions.

Aiming to be infront of the turtle, four of the clones shot out large fireballs from their mouths, as the other five ran around the side of the turtle.* - Wed Sep 23 23:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // As the water came forward towards the four clones, two had managed to dodge the technique, creeping against the building as again, they'd aim to create several handseals and shoot off two fireballs from one side of sanoke...

Meanwhile, on the other side, Amai acted quickly, two of the five there created a set of handseals, shooting out two large fireballs to absorb the shuriken, and push towards the turtle and sanoke. It seemed as if this was now a trap in a way, as he was being hit from both sides.

But wait, it gets better.

Thre three remaining Kohaku's ran around and behind the turtle and sanoke, formulating several handseals, these being the phoenix fire ones now, So if the turtle managed to dodge the four incoming fireballs, they'd be met with a rain of twenty one fireballs from behind.

Of course, this was if all went as planned.* - Wed Sep 23 23:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was done playing the game. After witnessing the strength of the turtle's shell, it was..Insanely strong...She'd have to aim down sanoke...

As the turtle came spinning towars the three shadow clones, only one rolled out of the way, as the other two were caught in it, exploding into smoke. Well, that left five more kohaku's on the field, or well..Six including the real one of course.

Well, amai had enough play-time..Sanoke was a formidable foe..And she thought he was worthy enough to see what she was really capable of. Suddenly the two kohaku's in the northern area glanced back at the four sanokes..

She only had a few more chances to beat him, especially now..The kohaku's from the south darted over, a nod given between the remaining ones...

Suddenly the two in the south flipped over, and the one that had dodged, also got back up and spun towards the turtle, Forming several handseals, a single kohaku blew a fireball at the spinning turtle, if able to.

As for the others..Well, the five kohaku's eyes began to spiral, their pupils turning red as a single tomoe formed on the outer-ring of their pupil. Suddenly the two from the southern side formed several handseals, shooting out twelve mini-fireballs.

While the two from the northern quickly ran up towards sanoke, one staying back and forming through handseals, aiming to shoot a large fireball at the four, as the other quickly raced forward, aiming to nail one right in the face.* - Wed Sep 23 23:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: stop saying fireballs - Wed Sep 23 23:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // Since niggas couldn't read.

One had dodged the turtle's attack, the two others were destroyed. Then she'd use fireball, on the turtle. 

As for the southern two clones, they'd run up and use phoenix flower towards the four sanokes, aiming to hit them all, or around that general area.

As for the two kohakus in the north, they'd turn around and one ran up, while the other shot a fireball at the group.* - Thu Sep 24 00:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: He's low on chakra, Good. - Thu Sep 24 00:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // The clone let out a blink, seeing the turtle come through the fireball by staring at it's charka signature, they'd quickly leap up, dodging the turtle spin hopefully, and landing behind it. As the water wall is delivered, one of the clones caught notice of it, quickly dash forward, it was time for an all out brawl, Kohaku didn't have much chakra left..So now seemed like the perfect time. She'd swing around the side as the three clones currently in the fray ran up to the other clones, Kohaku's last hope had come. 

Suddenly she'd form several handseals, probably exhausting a lot, if not most of her chakra reserves she had before KOing.

She'd spit out fire from her mouth, using one of sanoke's clone's as a conductor, aiming to light sanoke and his clones, as well as hers on fire hopefully.* - Thu Sep 24 00:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) koed for now, all the clones poofing as her eyes were back to normal.* - Thu Sep 24 00:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: . . That eye technique. . It was interesting. - Thu Sep 24 00:22:24 2015
