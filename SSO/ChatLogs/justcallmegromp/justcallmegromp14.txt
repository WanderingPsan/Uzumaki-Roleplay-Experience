<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) raised her foot up into the air as she'd rapidly start kicking mid-air, as if she were attacking someone's body rapidly, doing around 7-8 kicks per second. Her leg was moving rather fast compared to any other shinobi actually..She seemed to have lower-leg strength more then upper-body strength..Or else this would be a bitch of a move to learn..

She'd start running and flipping, preforming the technique mid-air, her legs moving extra-fast and extra-strong as they were responsible for kicking 7-8 times in the air and on the ground, added to the constant running, but thanks to her weight, it wasn't quite as strainful as you'd ever think. The female continued running in the a circle, everytime she was at a certain point, she'd jump up and began kicking the air several times.* - Tue Sep 29 03:11:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) fell on her face sort of..Coughing up water..glaring at kirie..Her sickness only lasted a bit, as she already felt a bit better from just sitting..However the female would've stood up, shaking the water off herself..Still feeling somewhat sick..But she was in a bitch-mood for nearly being drowned..A single glance was given to kirie..

"Bitch."

Suddenly her eyes swirled as her pupils turned red, her iris's gaining a tomoe around them as she'd raise a leg, and rapidly kicked kirie in the head eight times for payback.* - Tue Sep 29 03:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've went to speed off, keeping an eye on seisuke.* - Tue Sep 29 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've kept her eyes on the male, and as he went to move towards her and take grasp of her arm..Well..She didn't feel like being sealed into a rock, or being raped on this fine day..So she'd either do one of two things.

Her eyes would've swirled into the single tomoe sharingan, and she'd aim to slip her hand away before he touched her wrist, and dashed off at a good seventy miles per hour quickly..If she could escape, she found seisuke to be a rather big threat..

And well, if she couldn't esape him and got grabbed, as she was flipped, she'd aim to rapidly kick him with her leg eight times..Of course, if unsuccessfull..There wasn't anything she couild do.* - Tue Sep 29 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been restrained as she lost control of her arm, stuggling with her other as she was going to let out a scream before her voice stopped working..Suddenly a foot came against the side of her face, causing a red mark to form as pain was etched into her skin. She'd continuing struggling however, She didn't have time to waste with these people! Kenshin would come around soon and expect her to meet him at the training location..She couldn't give up on him.

Even with the pain traveling around her face, even though she had her arm's mobility sealed off as well as her voice, she'd continue to struggling, her legs were a bit buff since that's what she mainly worked out on, so she'd try pushing him off of her back, even in a rather..Near impossible way..But she would never stop struggling though..!* - Tue Sep 29 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've suddenly had her legs sealed as she stopped moving all but one arm, she couldn't really move that arm from it's position..And as she was about to be put unconcious, she didn't really know if she would or wouldn't, it didnt' really matter..She'd just have a lot more hate for kirie and seisuke if she had been put under..

Anyways, she'd of then been kicked in the face again, able to make no noise as her voice had been sealed..Then she'd be wrapped up in metal wire..Unable to move..And well, Seisuke and Kirie had forgotten about the shadow clone kohaku made earlier..Which was underwater..

She'd pop out of the water and was already on her last seal before shooting off eight mini-fireballs at the duo, four at each of them of course, Would they be able to react quick enough?* - Tue Sep 29 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // Well, everything stood in kohaku's way, the clone would've dispersed before making it out of the water as the other clone intercepted it..And kohaku would've been KOed by the chop to the neck, her eyes going blank.* - Tue Sep 29 22:47:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was still..Rather hazy as she had woken up with a rather big headache..She could remember what happened perfectly though..She should've listened to himura..Never be with the blonde hair..He..was evil..She'd bite her lip as that thought..Himura was probably dead..and she'd never see him again..The blondie was probably the cause for it to...

She'd try to move around, but everything except her head and arm would move..and she was covered in double bindings of rope..It would be nigh-impossible for her to break out..Yet..Kenshin had told her to meet her at the training location soon, and it was around that time now? Or soon..She'd have to meet him there..and she couldn't disrespect her master by not going..

The uchiha's gaze met up with the two infront of her, one a traitor to kirigakure in kohaku's mind, the other an evil man who she must rid from this planet...But he had a weird sword that seemed to have more chakra then she could comprehend..And he was stronger herself..Kirie was also stronger then kohaku to be honest. She'd been a ninja for longer, and had more skills then the young genin..

She didn't quite know what to do..Except that they wanted her to give them a decision on something...

"What..?" She'd mutter out, dazed and confused.* - Tue Sep 29 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been stripped naked as her eyes opened widely...Then she'd be sent with chills down all the parts of her body she was splahed with ice-cold water..Her body shivering. 

She'd look up at Seiuke..A single glare given..She -had- to be with kenshin..She couldn't disappoint him nor her family now..The time when was she becoming strong..No..This wasn't fair! This wasn't a place she had deserved to be..Dirty liars and cheaters of the world will -never- get anywhere..Especially those who ruin other's dreams..

She'd bite the bottom of her lip..She couldn't afford to die, but she didnt' wanna be kirie's slave..Nor did she want to be sold..None of these decisions seemed appealing to her in any fashion..Yet..She had an idea come to mind..

"Sold.." she'd mutter, her teeth chattering.* - Tue Sep 29 23:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) had wanted to just go train with kenshin again..Not be stuck in some cave masturbating infront of some pervert..Life wasn't fucking fair..She'd been told if she had done this she could've maybe been able to get out...

She'd slowly move one of her fingers inside of her hole..Moving a single finger inside as she'd blush deeply, letting out a small noise as she did..Although it would appear that wasn't even trying to be passionate in any way, shape, or form...She couldn't give up training with kenshin and all she's worked for, over one female's pissy attitude..* - Wed Sep 30 00:33:42 2015

She'd look up at kirie now, with a blank stare, she was a bit sweaty as wel, "Why did you make me come here? Is it because you find me annoying..?"* - Wed Sep 30 00:55:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Maybe it's because there's actually emotion there? - Wed Sep 30 00:59:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been kicked in the head, grunting a bit as she'd glance up at kirie with hate..She'd move her hand back down and shoved a finger in again..moving it in and out of her sensual-spot..She didn't seem to be enjoying it, as it felt more like rape then anything..But she had to get back to kenshin, No matter what.* - Wed Sep 30 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So. - Wed Sep 30 01:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was trying to stay strong, not shaking or showing any fear of course..Or trying to show she was embarrassed, her eyes stayed shut as she moved two fingers inside of herself, letting out a small moan out of instinct of course..She was pretty much a virgin, so she couldn't help but moan. She wasn't as loose as kirie..

Kohaku would've continued on, she didn't really know what would happen at the end, since she's never really..Gotten to any point of pleasure like that..But she did have one thing on her mind. She'd have the single individual known as kenshin on her mind..She'd have to get stronger and faster for the next time she'd see him. She wouldn't die nor give up until she'd gotten yet another look of kenshin, and had shown him how strong she was...She wanted to see that look of amazement..

Her single goal at the moment was to simply have kenshin know she was going to succeed..Even if it meant doing such pitiful sexual acts in a dark cave...Even if it meant being shipped off to some foreign land to be a sex slave..She'd meet him again before she would pass, that was the single thing she knew..Her hand began moving faster as she let out several more moans..She had to meet kenshin again..One last time..She couldn't get him off of her mind, she just..She -had- to please him...

And of course, with that..She'd open her eyes a bit widely as the fourteen year old female let out a moan, hitting her climax rather easily, before nearly falling back..But she wasn't as weak as women like kirie, no..She stayed in her position..She would never fall.* - Wed Sep 30 01:15:31 2015
