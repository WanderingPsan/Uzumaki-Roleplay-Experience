<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) took a deep breathe, "I'm not holding back." She'd mutter as her eyes began to swirl around, turning red as her pupils gained a single tomoe around them. She'd then slide back into a stance, sliding her foot back and doing a small bounce..Followed by her beginning to do a small bounce.

Suddenly, the air around her began to change a bit..As her muscles seemed to get a bit..stronger..

"First gate..Open.." She'd think to herself, Suddenly she'd take off in a flash, her speed above average as she'd aim to appear next to the male and send a barrage of eight to nine kicks in his chest, and head region.* - Mon Oct  5 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been zooming at a rather fast speed, as he..Was apparently a pupeteer..Which most people usually were not, It was quite annoying to her..She just wanted to get this fucking seal off and leave this god-forsaken village..But no, things always had to be complicated.

As she was met with the first puppet..Well, this was going to be sad for the pupeteer. She'd suddenly dash around it, and aimed to completely smash the puppet's head, making it rather..Useless, as she'd also aim to smash it into oblivion, most likely making it unfunctional..And along with her sharingan, she could see the strings of chakra very clearly, long lines of blue. 

She really wasn't even strong..Why did she have to fight such strong people, so unfair in her mind..She'd watch as the other puppets seemed to be rushing in at her, rather quickly..Annoying. Suddenly she'd take off in a burst of speed, away from the puppets, as she was most likely much faster then all of them combined.

Her speed was currently at around a hundred and sixty-nine miles per hour..A bit..High. She'd of effectively destroyed one puppet, and dodged the other two, aiming to appear behind the male and send a solid punch to the back of his head..She didn't wanna continue the fight, along with her gates..She was also not one for fighting to often, She just wanted the seal off.* - Mon Oct  5 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've suddenly turned off her gates as the water was seemingly made, she'd aim to dash backwards as she still had her feet on the ground, aiming to get out of range from the puppet, and dodging ..She didn't need another broken bone, thank you...

She'd also get out of her stance, now staying away from the man..With a single glare.

"How about we just say I won, and I'll give you everything I got? I'm really not a fighter." She'd mutter, she didn't feel like fighting god-tier C-rank puppets today.* - Mon Oct  5 04:18:33 2015

Well, as they all began closing in, she'd form a single seal as three clones appeared around her, one infront, on on each side, each going through several handseals as they'd shoot out a large fireball..Any kunai or wires caught within the fireballs were most likely incinerated on touch. They were all going forward towards the puppets rather fast..As for the original kohaku, she'd raise her hands and put them together as well...What would the pupeteer do against four kohaku's?* - Mon Oct  5 04:39:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) // Since nothing made sense, and she had never gotten touched by any puppet by any roleplay..She'd never have been affected by any imaginary cords, as she would've gotten away from it, with every single ninja using cords now a days.

She'd watch as it seemed as if all of her fireballs were ignored, so they'd incinerate a puppet or two...So now, without two puppets..He'd only have a single puppet on the field. Sucked to be him. Well, only parasite remained, so she'd watch as cables came out of it's head a shittily slow pace, slower then kohaku in every possible way. She'd -EASILY- dodge any cables, along with her three clones, suddenly they'd take off in a quick dash, two clones sending a volley of fourteen small fireballs towards the pupetteer, and the other clone sending a fireball at parasite..

While the real kohaku also led up with seven fireballs, twenty one in total.* - Mon Oct  5 05:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Taiga, Edge(RuinousAnchor) says: You have to pull it inwards. - Tue Oct  6 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) simply began to control her chakra, with a single motion she'd aim to bring it inwards..Alas, her technique had failed, let alone her basic understanding of chakra control and her semi-intellegant brain. 

She'd then try once more, closing her eyes as she'd aim to draw chakra from her outside and pull it inwards..It'd be noted she was forcefully trying to pull it inwards and towards her core..But had failed.

She'd continue once more, aiming to rip her chakra from the outside and pull it inwards, and this time..It flickered for a moment, before poofing back into sensory-range..Making her a target once more.

She'd try this several more times, on and off..She seemd to be getting the hang of it as she'd bring her chakra in..Then out, in...then out, in short intervals of time, she'd be doing a small suppress..

After several tries, with a final struggle..She'd bring chakra into her core, and suppress it..Making her no longer a target to any sensory-type shinobi.* - Tue Oct  6 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've continued on..Her chakra going out once more..With a deep breathe she'd shut her eyes and concentrate as she'd slowly bring the chakra within her body inwards..The chakra slowly evaporating from sensory-sight..It seemed as if she were disappearing off of the radar. After several seconds of calm meditation, her body suddenly began to pull the chakra inwards more..With a more relaxed and gentle pace..Before her chakra faded from the grid..She'd succesfully suppressed it?* - Tue Oct  6 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Now what? - Tue Oct  6 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) didn't even bother trying..

"I'm Kenshin's protege." She'd say blankly.* - Tue Oct  6 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Kenshin most likely has other protege's..Why you...Unless you want me to kill you and find another protege to replace you. - Tue Oct  6 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) got tired, Suddenly her eyes swirled aroud and formed a single tomoe around her pupils as her eyes turned red..She'd then tell she was in the genjutsu..And let out a sigh..She couldn't -stop- answering, but there wasn't much to say.

"The only unique thing about me is my eyes, and the fact that he finds my young body satisfying." She'd say, a shiver running down her spine even in the genjutsu.* - Tue Oct  6 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) was forced to answer, "They can see through genjutsu, and increase my reflex..As well as my strength in genjutsu, taijutsu, and ninjutsu..They can also evolve into different levels." She'd say, since that's all she had collected throughout her time with the eyes..It'd be noted her eyes looked like they were staring right into rymei's soul.* - Tue Oct  6 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) 's eyes flicked back off..

"No clue." She'd say, her memories were completely hazed over when she recieved her sharingan.* - Tue Oct  6 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) would've been thrown against the ground, away from her wheelchair..moving in an awkward fashion as she'd try to get onto her butt, once in an upright position she'd stare at rymei..

"That was rude.."* - Tue Oct  6 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: Sorry... - Tue Oct  6 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) noted her tea was also on the floor..She'd slowly crawl and grab her wheelchair, climbing up into it weirdly..

"Don't do that again." She'd say rather angered, "Everyone here seems to have no boundaries or limits.."* - Tue Oct  6 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: So, when are you out of those casts? - Tue Oct  6 05:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Since you tossed me. - Tue Oct  6 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) says: If you try and toss me, you might not have an arm to toss with. - Tue Oct  6 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm. - Tue Oct  6 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm gonna go to bed. - Tue Oct  6 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) sat around..

"Not much to do in a wheelchair..with nobody around.."* - Tue Oct  6 23:56:35 2015
