<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) took in the information that Mirai had given him. Before she demonstrated the jutsu, he'd activate his Byakugan. He needed to take mental note of the chakra that would be used with this technique. As she began to spin, chakra would be poured from her tenketsus. His eyes shifted from tenketsu to tenketsu.
The technique looked like it required alot of chakra something Otorius didn't have just yet. 
"Right." He'd pause and begin to attempt the jutsu himself, expecting to end in failure. His feet begin to pivot around each other simultaineously. He'd spread his hands agape and expel chakra from the tenketsus that rested in his palms. ; spinning 360 degrees. Spinning rapidly, the boy's chakra begins to weave into a circular motion though it was incredibly unstable, causing him to stop in his tracks, leaving what seemed to be a miniature crater compared to Mirai's.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You'll get use to it. - Sat Dec 12 12:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) would begin to concentrate on the chakra within him as he'd just expelled what seemed to be lots of chakra. His feet advance and spin his body entirely. He begins to pour chakra from every tenketsu in his body, creating a dome of pure chakra. The chakra weaves together and becomes a tight and solid defense. He was now utilizing the jutsu at it's most basic of levels. The chakra usage being incredibly high due to his lack of mastery.
". ." He spoke no words as he ended the technique. The jutsu resulting in a much bigger crater.
"Like that?" He panted.* - Sat Dec 12 12:59:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Hiroshi. Jump in. - Sat Dec 12 14:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) advanced forth. He was on the offensive. The boy's stance would take effect as he tucks away both palms and thrusts them at her figure, releasing chakra from his tenketsus. He didn't worry about Hiroshi's actions though he expected Hiroshi to have enough sense to assist Otorius with the offensive.
"Hm!" He'd grunt, releasing the palm toward he figure.* - Sat Dec 12 14:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) found his hands being parried. His visual would catch prey of Kinami as he flies forward from his momentum. He'd turn around and advance toward Kinami, seeing as Hiroshi had her quite distracted. 
His right palm would tuck once more, thrusting into her waist. If that palm were to land or not, Otorius would pivot off his right, coming to her flank sending yet another palm to her rear-side.* - Sat Dec 12 14:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) whispers: (what do you mean by that?) - Sat Dec 12 15:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) had his attack redirect which didn't phase him at all as he had already pivoted. Though his action resulted in him getting punched in his abdomen area. The attack sends him staggering backward but not causing major damage. He'd lock on with Kinami's position. 
His feet advanceonce more, lunging forward sending a barrage of open palm attacks, releasing chakra with each strike.
"Hai! Hai! Hai!" He'd yell with each thrust of his palms.* - Sat Dec 12 15:03:12 2015
