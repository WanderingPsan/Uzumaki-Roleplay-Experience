<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  |  The boy pans the dusty area. He grew bored of the loitering that took place within his village and wished for something excited to happen. An audible sigh is released before trudges off into the distance, looking for something that could actually interest him in the slightest.


"Tsk.."* - Sun Dec  6 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Hm? Who're you? - Sun Dec  6 17:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: You need to find something to do. - Sun Dec  6 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | A shrug manifests. 
"That's what I've been looking for.." He'd give a kick of his toe. "Maybe I should try self-training."* - Sun Dec  6 17:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mizora(Dandere-chan) says: I was busy doing that. - Sun Dec  6 17:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) simply pivots off his foot.
"Well, um, see you later."* - Sun Dec  6 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | A dull frown forms onto Otorius's face. Self training wasn't much of his thing. He liked to spar with other's so that he may learn from their loses or from his victory. Either way, Otorius enjoyed sparring with his peers. Though now that he is a Genin, things have gotten weird for him. He was now in the real world where death is as common as murder.
His chakra is soon elevated into the sole's of his eyes. Veins bulge and his sight is enhanced greatly. The boy activates his Byakugan. He then enters the stance of Gentle Fist. His center of gravity is lowered as his leg's expand from each other. A slight flare in his chakra happens. Otorius then takes lock on the boulder before him. "Hmph!"
He'd grunt before launching his right leg into a lunging motion, followed with a cocked palm. Chakra begins to flood through his palms as he thrusts at the boulder, releasing the chakra only slightly before his palm makes contact. A small chip is broken off the boulder.
"Tsk..."* - Sun Dec  6 17:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | The boy quickly retracts his wrist as he closes in yet another chakra-infused palm at the boulder. He was bored! He didn't have anything else to do yet he wanted to continue with his training. The thought of self-training almost drove Otorius to hell. He'd quickly exit his stance and disperse the use of his Byakugan.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Hey. - Sun Dec  6 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) urns his attention over to Hiroshi.

"Want to spar?"* - Sun Dec  6 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hey~ uh... huh? Who are you again? - Sun Dec  6 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: I'm Otorius. - Sun Dec  6 17:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: I'm a freshly new Genin. - Sun Dec  6 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hiroshi and oh~ cool. Alright I guess. - Sun Dec  6 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Lets go to the training area. - Sun Dec  6 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: So you wanna start? - Sun Dec  6 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | The boy would lock onto Hiroshi. His frown would quickly turn into that of a smirk. He finally had someone he could spar! His feet quickly spread apart and his arms shift, followed with the opening of his palms. His eyes are soon flooded with chakra, followed with the bulging of his veins. His center of gravity lowers and he gestures the boy to come forth! It was a mere tease.
Otorius would propel himself forward, rushing in one the boy at an average speed that a fresh Genin would have. His movements weren't fast but his attacks were.* - Sun Dec  6 17:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | The Hyuuga glanced at the male's usage of Fuuinjutsu. He'd never fought someone who used such a technique. He's only seen them in action. Hiroshi's words kind of hurt Otorius as he didn't know if that being one of 'them' was good or bad! Once the boy came in range, a barrage of shuriken is sunt in his direction. 
The boy's Byakugan reacts. As each came in range, Otorius would palm each one with the use of his chakra. His hands never made contact as it was his chakra that would be knocking the shuriken away.
A leg lunges forward closer to Hiroshi, a palm is tucked into his waist as he releases it into Hiroshi's torso. His attack being sharp and precise. If his attack were to land, he'd follow up with another palm to the male's stomach. He would be using much energy to perform such an act, though he's only a Rookie Genin.* - Sun Dec  6 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: 6.5 - Sun Dec  6 18:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | The Hyuuga had a slight lead on the male. His strikes were swift yet Hiroshi had something up his sleeve. Otorius would quickly widen his eyes as stream of water jets off into his person. The pressure would send his feet staggering backwards. A wrist would glide across his wet face. A smirk would reveal itself as his wrist drops.
"Ha! Perfect! After this, we will become freinds, alright?" He'd exclaim, rushing back into the boy's figure! His right and left palm would tuck into his waist as he releases both of them in unison.
He'd release a certain amount chakra from the tenketsu's that rested in his hand.* - Sun Dec  6 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Mmm.. - Sun Dec  6 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | Otorius would find himself coated paralyzing electricity. The muscles within his body quickly stiffen, preventing him from moving. His opponent, Hiroshi surely had quite the mindful thinking. He had to give Hiroshi his props. As his body stiffens, a training tag is thrown his way, emitting a small explosion onto Otorius's figure. The explosion sending him staggering back once again.
The boy could now move freely, his limbs loosened up slightly. He once again charges into the boy's position. Though this time he would tuck his palms once again, thrusting them into Hiroshi's figure. The boy couldn't run forever!* - Sun Dec  6 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) thinks: That explosion really weakened my arms..or I'm just getting tired? - Sun Dec  6 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | Otorius' Byakugan would take effect once again. The constant chakra drain was aswell. His eyes quickly bulge once again. Otorius would flank off to Hiroshi's side and drop to the floor. His leg extends as he spins his entire body. He aimed to trip the male who was in pursuit of releasing said electric ball.
Otorius' body was beaten up enough, he wanted to end the spar as his chakra levels were depleting.
"Hum!"* - Sun Dec  6 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | The taijutsuist would be smacked with a flash of Raiton. The pulse sending his figure to the ground. A small burn would appear on the boy's shoulder. The pain irrated his skin as he released a chuckle.
"Pfft! Ha! That was sneaky.." His eyes and veins would return to their orignal state.* - Sun Dec  6 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Phew..I'm tired. - Sun Dec  6 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Yeah... - Sun Dec  6 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Sorry about all the running but I'm not all that good with a katana yet and I didn't want you to hit me. It'd hurt.. a lot. - Sun Dec  6 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: It's fine. - Sun Dec  6 19:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Hmm, Tetsuki? I haven't seen her around but I can keep an eye out if that's what you need. - Sun Dec  6 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Please. - Sun Dec  6 20:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Plus...she's been alone most of her life, I don't want her to be alone anymore. - Sun Dec  6 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel) would pan his attention over to the conversing kids.
"Hey. Who're you guys? I'm Otorius."* - Sun Dec  6 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hi. - Sun Dec  6 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Alright I'll do my best not to scare her. I'l put up missing posters and a 24hr unit. - Sun Dec  6 20:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | The boy would offer each and everyone a wave.

"Are you willing to teach me? I'll become as respectable and humble as I need to be. I don't really have anyone to mentor me."* - Sun Dec  6 21:15:44 2015

It was simple scouting, perfect for wielders of the Byakugan.The boy's first mission is going smooth so far.

With a step, the boy enters the building behind Koji. His chakra dissipates from his eyes as his veins disperse from the naked eye's visual.
"Huh.." He'd stop and stare at the screaming lady. He didn't really give any type of expression. The whole sight was incredibly weird to him. He didn't know how to respond to such a random yelp! His eyes quickly act on Hiroshi's current position. Sucks to be him. A smirk forms but is quickly removed at the sight of the screaming lady.
"Ma'am. Calm yourself." He'd attempt to speak with the lady, holding a single hand up as a calming gesture. His tone was calm and humble. ; for a 10 year-old atleast. He didn't wish to startle the lady and cause that senbon of her's to stab Hiroshi, though at the same time, if Hiroshi were to make a reckless move, the mission would become a complete failure.* - Mon Dec  7 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | Would avert his gaze at the woman. His Byakugan instantly activating as he enters the stance of Gentle Fist. He would soon flank to her right, a palm then manifests. The Hakuma would thrust the palm toward her direction, releasing chakra from the tenketsu that rested within the palm of his hand.
He aimed to send the girl flying into a near-by wall. He really wanted to knock her out with all his might. He thought that if she were knocked out then she wouldn't have to feel such a sorrowful feeling.
His idea may seem dumb toward the citizens but it was for her own good. The strike would only send her into a wall, not enough to cause any major injury.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | A scratch would manifest as Otorius yawns. It seemed the square was quite lively today. He hadn't really seen everone since his mission. He was..out? A smile would form across the Hakuma's face as he offers a wave toward everyone within the general area.
"Hello, everyone." He'd greet, followed with another yawn. He was just waking up so please excuse his yawns. His milky irises then land on that of Koji. His smile would grow to a larger extent.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel)  | A stream of water is released at Otorius' stead. Infront of him lays an arc'd puddle of water. His eyes then bulge as chakra flare's within his network. He activates his Byakugan. The boy's senses are enhanced greatly though before he made such an action, the boy's mind would goto work.
"I'm sure he's planning something. The water and the electricity thing he did last time. He is for sure going to use that stream to his advantage alongside his Raiton. I'm in a toughy, huh?" He'd ponder to himself.
The boy's feet advance, seperating from each other, followed by the shifting of his arms. The Gentle Fist stance. A stance created for the Kekkei Genkai he possesed. He'd soon jet off to Hiroshi's right flank. His eyes remained locked onto Hiroshi.
"Then we shall!" He exclaimed.* - Thu Dec 10 02:51:31 2015

His eyes quickly shift over to Hiroshi as a set of Kunai soar toward his person. Palms would erupt and strike each Kunai, releasing chakra with each palm. - His eyes soon fade back to normal as he feels his body become quite heavy. The boy's stance is revoked as he tumbles to the ground.
His chakra level had depleted from the last mission he had took on. The mission took quite the chakra for him to comeplete. An audible sigh is released.
"Time...out.....tired.." He'd state before closing his eyes and 'take a nap ere''.* - Thu Dec 10 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) took this time took react. He awaited the time for him to attack. His eyes would waver over to that of Booty Warrior's. A slight arch of his brow would form as he performed what seemed to be Shadow Clone whilst yelling 'For the Booty'. The words disturbed the boy but he didn't let it keep him from performing his actions.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) brings himself into the Gentle Fist stance whilst activating his Byakugan. It was time for self-training again. Though over the years, Otorius changed. He didn't think of anything as bad or good. His ability to have his own opinion just became dull. He just goes with the flow. - A palm manifests as he strikes the air, releasing chakra throughout his tenketsus.
"Hya!" He'd exclaim before tuking away his another palm, releasing an onslaught of palms. The years have been pretty easy for Sunagakure and everyone has grown alot. Especially Koji, which was the drive that Otorius apparently had. He just wanted to get stronger so that he could become a Jounin and punch Koji. He had no other reason to become strong. Though he still needed to learn techniques of the Hokuma clan which is his second priority.
Hopefully Mirai hs the time of the day for the boy.* - Sat Dec 12 10:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) wouldn't rest there not once. His feet adavnce as the boy tucks away both palms. Within a second, the boy would thrust each palm into the air. He didn't rest. His right foot pivots and his left leg lunges forward, followed by the thrusting of his index and middle finger. Chakra would release from the tip of his finger's tenketsus. As his hand is brought back, Otorius would send his other palm flying infront of him. It'd been a while since he were in a real spar.
"Hup! Hya!" He'd express a series of grunts before contending to more barrages of palms and thrusts. The external use of chakra was thanks to his Kekkei Genkai allowing him to release chakra from his tenketsus.
"Phew.."* - Sat Dec 12 10:54:52 2015
