<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: They weren't ready for me yet. - Thu Dec  3 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You should step down then in all honesty. - Thu Dec  3 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Not until I find someone that can suit this village. - Thu Dec  3 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Of course, I look out for myself and only myself but fucking Kirie died like an idiot. So I'm doing this for her. - Thu Dec  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right. - Thu Dec  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: So currently, I have to 'care' enough to look out for you people. - Thu Dec  3 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't understand that logic. - Thu Dec  3 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Just know until someone stronger than make takes a stand, I'll be your leader. - Thu Dec  3 21:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sounds stupid. - Thu Dec  3 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hmm...Hey..Do you want to spar again? I've learned to hold back while training in Sunagakure no Sato. I'd really like to see your abilities. - Thu Dec  3 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Thu Dec  3 21:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't really care what you or anyone else thinks of me. - Thu Dec  3 21:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't care what you think, I progress myself in my own time. - Thu Dec  3 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Facing you and getting kicked into the dirt every time isn't going to help me at all. - Thu Dec  3 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I want to get stronger, just not with your help. - Thu Dec  3 21:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Or anyones. - Thu Dec  3 21:16:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks off.* - Thu Dec  3 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) steps onto the water, walking near or around the middle of the small lake produced by the waterfall. He would turn and face the waterfall as he began building up a mass of chakra inside himself. He would start to superheat that chakra, applying the katon chakra nature change. As he did this, he would slowly weave the hand seals required for the jutsu he would be performing. Once the hand seals were finished he would push his chakra up to his chest and take in a deep breath. He would mix his heated chakra in with the air he had breathed in before puckering his lips and exhaling fiercely. A large and expansive flamethrower would then be produced from between his lips, sizziling and boiling the water beneath it. The flames would die out after a few seconds and he would fall into the water as he lost chakra control momentarily.

As he swam back to the surface and pulled himself back onto the water with suimen, he would pant and gasp for breath, quickly moving to dry land. Fireball jutsu was incredibly draining for him afterall.* - Thu Dec  3 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: They're sparring again, pointless. - Thu Dec  3 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would have been resting on top of the waterfall as he gathered his strength back slowly. He would turn as he heard and unfamiliar voice, Yumiko. "I'm much better at Taijutsu, Just felt like practiing that for some reason." His tone was slightly overbearing and aggressive, especially for one of his tender again, probably pointing to him being upset or annoyed in someway if Yumiko could tell such a thing.* - Thu Dec  3 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Taijutsu is good but when you fight someone long range it becomes bad thing. I know this. - Thu Dec  3 22:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) half opens his eyes and glances over to Yumiko. "Hello again." He states in a low and robotic tone. He would sit up straight and fold his arms over his chest, trying to compose himself as he usually did.* - Fri Dec  4 16:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) continued to glance over to Yumiko, watching as she yawned and stretched. "Just woke up?"* - Fri Dec  4 16:41:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see. Up for training in the mean time? - Fri Dec  4 20:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Once you're squad has arrived, take thhem on that mission. - Fri Dec  4 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: It is a C-Ranked mission, you can handle it, right? - Fri Dec  4 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Gather your group and holla' at me. - Fri Dec  4 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: The client will tell you himself. - Fri Dec  4 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Also, was gud Wyn. - Fri Dec  4 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would be seen with a large piece of robe looking up at the tree he was next to. There would be a large wood log next to his feet. As Heiwa came into sight he would glance over to him. "Yes?"* - Fri Dec  4 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls the rope off his shoulder as he focused on the tree again. <If I tie it to a stable branch...then connect the log in a way that would make a swing...I could make a trap like contraption for my training...Hm...> He thought to himself as he half listened to Heiwa.

He would glance back with his equally black eyes. "Hm? Squad? Good luck with that, my squad is never around...not that I really want them to be."* - Fri Dec  4 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) focuses his chakra to his feet as he steps onto the tree, working his way up it step by step. He found a large and strong branch from which he could make his contraption with. He walked along the branch and tied the rope to it, then jumped down to the ground. He picked the log up a little and lifted it so it would be around chest height off the ground. He moved the rope underneath it, tying it around one third of the way along it. He would then cut the rest of the rope off and walk up the tree again, tying it to the branch. He jumped down and then tied another knot around two thirds of the way down the log, leaving it suspended in the air. He gave the log a few pushes from each side, making sure it was suspended correctly. Once he was happy with it, he got into position for his training to begin.* - Fri Dec  4 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) grabbed the large log he had hung from a tree and threw it back with all his strength. As it travelled back he would part his legs and place his feet a short distance away from each other to give himself a good amount of balance. As he watched the log reach its highest point and swing back down he would extend both arms straight out infront of himself and hold his wrapped palms out. He tensed himself and braced for impact, knowing it was going to hurt but not sure on how badly. As the log came down it would eventually connect with his palms, knocking him arms completely back and forcing his body back too. Somewhere along the line he would tip over his heels and fall over, tumbling a little as he did.

He got straight up and stretched his shoulders out a bit, he wasn't expecting quite as much force behind the log as that. He let the log burn off some of its momentum before stopping it himself. He got into position just like before and grabbed the log, pulling it back a bit and then launching it forward as hard as he could. He held each arm and hand out again, tensing his body as he braced for impact once more. The same as before would occur as the log swung back down and made contact with his tensed arms, forcing them and him back and over. He would roll and tumble along the ground ground again before coming to a grinding halt.

As he got to his feet his would wince in pain and clutch each hand into a fist, already feeling pain shooting from his hands and up his arms. Even with this pain he would continue on, moving back over to the log and stopping it once it had lost some momentum. He swung the log back again and got into position as it came back at him, his feet would angle in slightly in the hopes of keeping him steady as he braced for impact, holding both arms out again. He log would make contact with his hands and knocked them back, sending him skidding across the ground on his feet for a moment before he keeled over. He got to his knees and held his arms in tightly as the pain worsened.

He sat there hugging and kneading his arms, both waiting for the pain to lighten up and trying to work some of it off. After a minute or two he would suck it up and get to his feet, walking over to the log and getting into position. He grabbed the log as best he could with his hurting hands and swung it with all his strength just as before. His legs would part, setting his feet into position to help balance him and brace for impact. As the log came at him quickly he would extend both arms forward and hold each arm out in an attempt to stop the log in its tracks. He tensed as much as possible as he held his arms out, waiting for impact. Just as before the log would collid with his hands and knock him flying, sending him crashing across the ground again.

He called out something inaudible as pain coursed through his hands, arms and shoulders. He sat there for a good few minutes once more as he kneaded and cared for his arms, trying to ease some of the pain up. He knew he couldn't use his arms as a buffer against the log again, they hurt too much and it could end in an injury for him. Instead he walked up to the log, grabbed it and threw it back with all his strength again. This time as he positioned his feet and braced for impact he would stand a little forward and push his chest out, tensing his entire body as much as he could, he knew this was going to hurt but he had no choice because of how his arms were. As the log came close he pushed his chest out slightly and accepted his at this point inevitable fate, the log collided with his chest and knocked him completely off his feet. He coughed something fierce as the log hit him, winding him instantly. He laid on the floor for a few seconds as he came to a halt, thinking about how bad of an idea that was. He slowly crawled over to the tree and sat up against it, resting himself as his arms pulsed with pain and his chest gasped for air.

There were these weird white blob type things that appeared out of everyone, someone turned into an alligator...type...thing. He was pretty much done with the situation, he didn't know why it happened and he didn't really care he didn't get any action from it.

He would take in a deep breath and let out a long sigh through his nostrils. "Well that was a clusterfuck." Clearly stating the obvious, a slight tint of sarcasm in his voice.* - Sat Dec  5 04:22:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) watched as Kana went through the probably most interesting change of all out of everything that happened. His onyx eyes scanned her being, observing the green residue engulfing her body, he had an idea to what it was but he was honestly quite intrigued and confused by it. The fact that she was then extending said residue into a hand suggested she had control over it, even more intriguing.

He was about to turn away but seeing as this happened, it was all too tempting to pass up. He would beging to walk towards Kana, mostly out of interest at this point.* - Sat Dec  5 04:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns around now that the action had subsided. "Now -that- was interesting." He states, starting to walk off as he did.* - Sat Dec  5 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: No. this is the payment I must pay for my actions. - Sat Dec  5 05:36:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) steps onto the water, moving over to where the watefall was. He started building up a lot of chakra and slowly went through the small amount of hand seals needed for the jutsu, this would also help him concentrate and focus his chakra. As he build his chakra up in his stomach he would start to super heat it, intentionally apparently the katon nature change to his chakra as he did. He would push his chakra up to his chest, holding it there as he took in a large breath of air. He would then knead his chakra into the breath he had taken in, doing so slowly so he could get some general practise with the jutsu in. Once he was ready he would pucker his lips and pivot his body forward as he exhaled, pushing his chakra up and out with his exhale. A large plume of fire would burst out of his mouth, arcing over the water. He worked slowly, concentrating and practising his control over the technique until he could do so no longer.

Once he stopped producing flames his body would flop over slightly as he gasped for breath, tired and fatigued from using that jutsu as it took a significant toll on his body.* - Sat Dec  5 05:47:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs as he walks over to Thirteens body, giving it a nudge with his foot to make sure it wasn't a dud. Once he was sure everything was normal he'd grab two of his appendages and begin dragging him off past the group, not saying a word as he did.* - Sat Dec  5 05:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) continues walking off with the body in toe unless stopped.* - Sat Dec  5 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would note this mans blood is black, not that he cared all that much honestly, to him it could just be dried up blood.* - Sat Dec  5 05:54:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) drops Thirteen next to the water and started taking his handwraps off. He would walk around and collect a few rocks, tying them to his handwraps. He would then tie said handwraps to Thirteens body before throwing him in the water, watching him sink before making his way back.* - Sat Dec  5 05:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks back into the area, clean bandages present in his unwrapped hands. He would begin wrapping his right hand in a specific way, as if he had done this many times before. If one looked closely enough they would notice his knuckles had quite a bit of scar tissue on them, something that he personally hated and was partly why he kept his hands under wraps. For the most part he kept focused on wrapping his hands up, looking about the area briefly as he did.

He glanced over to Sekisui, still wrapping his hands without a probably even with his distracted focus. "How is Makkuro?"* - Sat Dec  5 06:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) continued to wrap his right hand, nearly being done with it in fact. "Makes sense, I guess the alarms must be really irritating for dogs."* - Sat Dec  5 06:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs as he glances around the area, half considering sparring a random person despite his personal ideals on sparring. He would then lock onto Heiwa. "I don't train with others."* - Sat Dec  5 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And why not? - Sat Dec  5 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs as he looks around again, mostly out of boredom since he seemed to having this exact same conversation ever few hours. His own onyx eyes would then flick back to Heiwa, giving him a half uninterested look. "People don't like me and I don't work well with others."* - Sat Dec  5 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You choose not to work with others which makes them not like you. - Sat Dec  5 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The question was why do you choose not to work with others? - Sat Dec  5 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because I don't work well with people. - Sat Dec  5 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And because I generally don't like people. - Sat Dec  5 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: And why's that? - Sat Dec  5 21:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because of how people act. - Sat Dec  5 21:48:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: To become strong. - Sat Dec  5 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And be a good soldier. - Sat Dec  5 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Why? - Sat Dec  5 21:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Why do you want to become a soldier? - Sat Dec  5 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why are you asking me these questions? - Sat Dec  5 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Because I'm curious. If you don't like people why would you become a protector of the village? - Sat Dec  5 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just because I don't like them doesn't mean I want them to die. - Sat Dec  5 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And besides, I don't hate everyone. - Sat Dec  5 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Who do you not hate then? - Sat Dec  5 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You, Anguo, Sekisui. - Sat Dec  5 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Why the exceptions? - Sat Dec  5 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because you're not an idiot. - Sat Dec  5 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Anguo is both strong and intelligent. - Sat Dec  5 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And Sekisui has a dog. - Sat Dec  5 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walked up to his training device he had rigged up before. He made sure everything was intact before getting into position in front of it. He would close his eyes and think back to what he had done the first time he had trained this way. He mulled over a few things in his head, trying to decipher how to better balance and steel himself when faced with something that overwhelmed him. Inevitably he would get his feet and legs in position, grab the log and then throw it in the direction opposite to him. The log would swing back and then forth, coming at him with speed and power. He would hold his arms and hands out in an attempt to stop the log though just as before it would strike him hard, knocking him off his feet.

Because he knew how to brace himself, it was a lot easier to take the impact and not cause himself overwhelming pain. He would get back on his feet straight away and wait for the log to lose some momentum before bringing it to a halt. He would then repeat as before, getting into position and throwing the log, he had an idea that he wished to explore. As the log came close to him he would bend in his arms slightly as he prepared them to take the blow, at the same time his feet would twist inward slightly, providing angled friction to him as the log struck him and sent him back. He skidded across the floor for a second or two before being toppled.

As he got up for the second time he would think on what he just did, how he prepared specifically for the strike, how he changed his stance. He felt he may have been onto something here and as such he would need to bash himself with a log again. Once he had everything ready he threw the log and began preparing his body to tank the incoming hit. He took up the same stance as before, this time crossing his arms over his chest to cushion the impact. As the log struck his chest region, his arms taking the blow, his body would be thrown back. As he was taken back by the hit he would twist his feet slightly to provide better friction and balance to himself and the ground, allowing him to glide along the ground for a moment before gravity took its course.

He got up and shook his arms off, stretching his upper body out as he did, hitting yourself with a heavy and fast moving log over and over took its toll afterall. Even so he was making good progress and didn't want to give up now, not yet at least. Instead he stopped the logs movment and set it, and himself, up for practise. The log would be thrown and his arms would immediately cross over his chest to cushion the impact. His upper body tensed up but he tried his best to keep his legs limber, wanting to keep his lower half free moving. As the log struck him for a fourth time he would attempt to manuever his footing in a way that gave him friction and balance, trying to keep himself upright. The result as as before, allowing him to glide across the gound momentarily before keeling over.

Once he himself came to a stop he would sit up and take in a much needed breath, that last hit had winded him slightly. As he sat he would recover his breath and stamina, thinking on his progress so as well. Seeing as his recent progress was having a positive effect on his balance and durability, he would take in a deep breath and get into position by the now motionless log. He grabbed the log and threw it back with all his strength, crossing his arms over his chest as a pseudo armor in the same motion. He tensed up as the log came back down at him, smashing into his already hurting arms and chest. He would be knocked back as he had been four times previous and just like before his feet would twist and turn as he attempted to stay standing. He dug his feet into the ground as hard as he could to try something new but all this did was topple him faster. He would tumble and roll across the ground for a second before coming to a halt. He laid there in wait, letting his body recover. Once he felt better he would stand and walk up, knowing that was enough for today.* - Sat Dec  5 23:45:29 2015
