<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He is going to find us a different venue but I told him you should speak with him about the location since you chose the court yard first. - Wed Nov 18 13:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Also he said that we could have the shinobi build the gazebo for the wedding but that you have to fund the mission commissions and supplies. - Wed Nov 18 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats fine. - Wed Nov 18 13:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Also I spoke to marco about the weapons and told him the specifics since he asked because you had only told him what kind of weapon. - Wed Nov 18 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Ahhhh. He can make them now? - Wed Nov 18 13:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I...don't... - Wed Nov 18 13:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Looks like you won't be training for a little bit, I could make you dinner tonight instead of you always going and eating at those fancy restaraunts after training? - Wed Nov 18 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Especially after how you already broke the bathroom. - Wed Nov 18 13:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Heh, that's good. - Wed Nov 18 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm Akira by the way, I think we've met one or two times before. - Wed Nov 18 16:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Nice to meet you too, anyway I was just checking you were ok since that little incident. - Wed Nov 18 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: No need to worry bout me, but actually... mind if I take the seat next to you. I'm supposed to be taking it easy. - Wed Nov 18 16:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Of course...plus it's better than talking over a bin right? - Wed Nov 18 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) watches her little stretch display, smirking a little. She reminded him of someone he knew.* - Wed Nov 18 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I wasn't just checking up on you randomly by the way, I noticed you were friends with Rias so I just thought...I dunno, Just wanted to make sure you were ok I guess. - Wed Nov 18 16:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) coughs a little as she elbows him in the side, rubbing the spot she elbowed him in. He chuckled though, laughing off both the pain and the remark she made. "No no...I mean I do like Rias but she already knows that. She doesn't feel the same way though. I was just looking out for someone that looked out for her, y'know?"* - Wed Nov 18 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) chuckles again, though on the inside he started to worry that maybe this might go a little too far. "Heh well, I guess I like her personality, she's quite a likable person...and yes, I do think she is quite beautiful...but that isn't what I focus on about her. I guess I just like her company."* - Wed Nov 18 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods to what she said, he understood what she meant and he was already doing that for the most part. "I mean, we spend a lot of time together already, we're both from Konoha after all so i've known her a little while now. I don't think she doesn't like me in that way...she just said she doesn't want anything like that right now...which is understandable I suppose." He'd sigh as he finished, looking down for a few seconds before regaining eye contact with Chikyu.

"I do talk to other women too, though most of the women here are older than me so...they don't tend to take too much notice of me, Heh." He said, finishing off with a small smirk to hide how much that hurt to say.* - Wed Nov 18 17:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) chuckles again, he could tell why her and Rias were friends, they had very similar personalities. "Yeah, they are. It doesn't help that I live with one of them too..." he trailed off towards the end, attempting to continue but ultimately falling silent.* - Wed Nov 18 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You live with one, lucky. - Wed Nov 18 17:23:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Though...don't get the wrong idea. We're not together or anything...she just lets me stay at her house. - Wed Nov 18 17:24:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Don't tell her I said that though...she'd probably beat me up or something... - Wed Nov 18 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Marrisa is pretty too but...she seems a bit...aggressive. - Wed Nov 18 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah she is...I kinda like that about her too though... - Wed Nov 18 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean uh... - Wed Nov 18 17:28:44 2015
