<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks up to Marrisa's door, pulling the spare key she gave to him out. He placed the key into the lock and unlocked the door, looking around quickly inside. He expected to see her in here treating her own wounds, but it was not to be. The house was cold and empty, rather like his own personal feelings right now. He took some things out of the house that he owned before taking one last look and heading out.

He closed the front door and placed the key in again, shaking as he did which made him scrape the the lock no doubt. When the key was finally inside he started to cry as he went to lock the door, he never even got to tell her how far he had been come. He sucked in a deep breath and wiped his face, finally turning the key and locking the door for good. He took the key out and spun it around, placing it in his pocket. He knew this would be the last time he came here, probably forever.* - Thu Nov 26 05:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sits down next to her, patting a hand on her shoulder and taking a quick peak of what she was reading. He knew exactly what it was and peeled his eyes from it, knowing it was private and special to her. "Take your time."* - Thu Nov 26 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) puts his arm around Rias, pulling her closer as she read the scroll. "It's ok to be upset you know. I understand acting strong around others but no one is here right now, remember that alright?" He'd say, giving her arm a bit of a rub for comfort before retracting it back to his side.* - Thu Nov 26 06:52:09 2015
