<br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) cough out a heavy cough, probably spitting out blood too as Kinami punch him in the chest. It sent him flying back again, some might think it was turning into a sad game of ping pong with all this back and forth. Once he had stopped in his tracked his put his kunai in his mouth and brough out another, this time with a tag on it. He would prime the tag and throw it at Kinami, taking the kunai he had in his mouth in hand again.

He didn't care at this point, he was just out for blood. Red mist filled his eyes and anger clouded his judgement. He would begin his treck back to Kinami, swinging for her again as soon as he got close.* - Sat Nov 21 13:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) did not in fact have a trick up his sleeve. The punch connected with his chest once more and it would be rather akin to a yamcha scene aside from the fact that Kinami would not punch a whole through his chest. Instead she had shattered his entire chest cavity, probably cutting into and rupturing his lungs and heart from the force of the punch. He would cough out a mass of blood, probably all over Kinami. He would cough out again as he went to speak, more blood being produced from his mouth. By this point it would probably be running out of his mouth and down his chin, staining his shirt.

In the end he just closed his eyes and put on a small smirk for Kinami, as if he was happy to die. He never really had a great life since Konoha had been destroyed and it was just all going down hill from there. He coughed out a little more blood before opening his eyes a little. "Tell...Kiyoko...Sorry..." were his final words, she had attempted to help him through his troubles after all.

With that his eyes, mouth and head would drop. Then his shoulders and arms would go before finally, his legs gave out. He hit the floor hard, coughing out a small amount of blood into the sand as he did. The final thing to give out would be his heart...then it was just silence. The sad existance that had been Akira...was gone.* - Sat Nov 21 13:45:36 2015

He started scratching at his cast in boredom, not really knowing what else to do. He spotted Kiyoko next to Lera and wondered whether she could fix his lip or something...it was better than just standing around right?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was not all that happy with his state of affairs at the moment, not only was he bored out of his mind with this broken arm because he couldn't train or even work. For someone reason Lera was annoyed at him, he hadn't seen Marrisa in days and to top it all off, he felt like a useless cripple now since that last spar. He came to the training field to get a bit of piece and quiet, he was sick of people talking about getting married and having kids, stuff like that was just annoying to him now. He needed something to vent towards, something for him to do...but there was nothing, and that only made him angrier.

He punched the rock wall in anger with his left hand, quite hard too. He pulled his hand back in pain, wincing slightly. It then occured to him that he could still be physically training, even if it meant he couldn't train his right arm, it wasn't his dominant arm anyway. He punch the wall again, same as before. He took a deep breath and then just exhaled...and began hammering the wall with as many punches as he could throw with only one arm. He wasn't hitting the wall too hard, just hard enough to be classed as training. He kept at it, punching over and over.

Eventually he would notice a small blood smug on the face of the rock which caused him to look at his knuckle, it was grazed and had started to bleed. He didn't care though, his anger was starting to take over at this point. Within a few moments he go back into position and began punching again. A few minutes went by and the blood smug on the wall was now quite a bit thicker as the skin on his knuckle broke and gaze way to the hard surface of the rocky arena. He continued on though, not even working up a sweat yet.

Another few minutes had past and his knuckle was quite messed up at this point, he must hit that wall so many times by now. He stopped and looked his knuckle and fingers over, he didn't think anything was broken as he wasn't hitting the wall all the hard. His knuckle was now dripping blood though but he didn't mind all that much, this was the first time he had felt alive in days. He pulled his broken arm close to his body and then set off, running next to the wall and trailing around the arena.

He wasn't the fastest of shinobi so it took him a while to get all the way around the training field but at least he was working up a sweat now. He kept on running after his first lap, his naturally high stamina levels shining now shining through. After his fifth lap of the training field he ran around again until he found a dried up blood patch on the wall, his blood. He would then return to punching the wall for a few more minutes before stopping and leaving, his anger and adrenaline having subsided for now.* - Sun Nov 22 09:50:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Your heart doesn't beat at a normal rate when you are tired because it can't make as strong of a beat. So it gives faster weaker contractions instead to make up for the weakness. - Sun Nov 22 10:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes another swig of the bottle, about to continue walking off. He stops as he takes his first step though, turning his head and his body to look over to Lera and Kiyoko. With a sigh he turns back and begins walking towards them, stopping just infront of where Lera is sitting. He would look back and forth at them both a few times, then look down at the bottle in his hand. He chucked the bottle in the bin, wiped his face off and straightened himself out. He kept his gaze mostly on Kiyoko as he felt he offeneded her the most.

"...I'm sorry...I'll slow down and listen to you more..."* - Sun Nov 22 10:37:26 2015

And thank you for teaching me those two jutsu before Lera...you don't know how much I appreciate that even if I don't say it." He would then wipe his face again and clear his throat.

"Right...you're right sorry...Heh. But you gotta help me find stuff to entertain myself." he rubbed his head a little more before letting his arm flop to his side.* - Sun Nov 22 12:21:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Or dating, like Lera. - Sun Nov 22 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Ah...I won't beat her seneless then. - Sun Nov 22 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: I can't wait for their wedding its going to be nice. - Sun Nov 22 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Heheh... hope she doesn't drool by falling asleep at the wedding. - Sun Nov 22 14:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mhmmmm. - Sun Nov 22 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Talking about weddings is weird for me. - Sun Nov 22 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Don't think i've ever been to one. - Sun Nov 22 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Not sure i'd ever have one either. - Sun Nov 22 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: I wonder if Lera has other gay friends... - Sun Nov 22 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) thinks: Maybe, I can find one at the wedding. *gasp* That be perfect! - Sun Nov 22 14:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm...Would you have a wedding one day Chikyu? - Sun Nov 22 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: If I met that special girl, I guess. - Sun Nov 22 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Really? - Sun Nov 22 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Huh...I thought you'd have the same opinion as me. - Sun Nov 22 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just don't really understand weddings. - Sun Nov 22 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean, you both know you love each other right? - Sun Nov 22 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So why do you need a wedding? - Sun Nov 22 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why do you have a funeral? - Sun Nov 22 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why do you have a birthday party? - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its just to celebrate a special day with someone. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm, just seems weird to me. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Something, to physically mark youself and be an important event to remind you the moment you truly cemented your love for that person. - Sun Nov 22 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sounds like you got this whole love business down a lot better than me Chikyu. - Sun Nov 22 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I wouldn't have a wedding because just like a funeral...that's all you have to remember lost ones by... - Sun Nov 22 14:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Lera. - Sun Nov 22 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Could we go train? - Sun Nov 22 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm... - Sun Nov 22 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So uh, Chikyu. - Sun Nov 22 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You ready to go get something to eat yet? - Sun Nov 22 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sure, we can have something real quick. - Sun Nov 22 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sits down and looks at the menu for a little while too, they honestly didn't have that great of a selection. In the end he put the menu down, ordering two bits of bacon, one sausage and one egg...he was healing after all. He noticed Chkiyu was still tired however. "Hm, you ok there sleepy head? Long night last night?"* - Sun Nov 22 14:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) had a little bit of a worried expression on his face, he cared deeply for his friends and hated when they didn't tell him what was bothering them. "Hm? Oh yeah...it kinda is but I don't sleep much anyway because I have bad nightmares..." He then started twiddling with his fork as he waited for his meal to come along, his mind still set on what was bothering Chikyu.

Eventually he couldn't think about it any longer. "Hey uh Chikyu...it's ok if you don't want to talk about it but i'm your friend...I want to know if something is bothering you ok?" he said in a slightly worried but soft tone.* - Sun Nov 22 14:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head, he wouldn't press the issue anymore. He did start smirking when she told him to think about the best thing that could happen to him, his slightly dirty side surfacing. "Well ok then...so long as she didn't hurt you that's fine. I think you should just stop worrying about it though and just say sorry, that's the easiest way."

He then had his meal set down in front of him, probably a long side Chikyu's pancakes. He started to cut into his bacon with his fork, not having much luck in doing so. <This is really hard to cut...> He thought. "But uh...what is the best thing that you imagine happening to you?" He said, smirking again.* - Sun Nov 22 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) chuckles a little at her innocence. "Yeah me too...though mostly to do with girls I guess..." He looks away after saying that, a little embarrased that he had just admitted that to another girl, he sometimes forgot Chikyu was female because of how casual he could be around her. He would look back after a few seconds and continue to cut at his meal with a fork, still not having much luck. "Uh Chikyu...could you come help me out here a sec..? I'd really appreciate it."* - Sun Nov 22 15:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sort of just sits there, not really know what to do or say to what Chikyu just did. Eventually he just burst out laughing, putting his fork down to grab his chest as he struggled for air. After a few seconds he would pick his fork up and scoop some bacon into his mouth like she would, still laughing as he did. After he swallowed he would look at her. "I like hanging out with you Chikyu, you make me laugh and all my problems seem to just go away for a while when i'm talking to you. We need to hang out more." He'd say, giving her a sincere look before stabbing his fork into a sausage and bitting into it.* - Sun Nov 22 15:13:55 2015
