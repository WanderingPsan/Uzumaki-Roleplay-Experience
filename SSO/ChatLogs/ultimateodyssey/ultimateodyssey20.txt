<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walked up to the help desk in Suna's hospital. He spoke to the helper at the desk, explaining he was supposed to come in today to have his arm cast removed. He showed the cast and gave his name and age, then was directed to a room with some equipment in. He was sat down by a nurse who then took hold of his right arm, looking it over to make sure it was properly healed. She did some stretches of the arm and asked him a few questions before she was finally happy to continue.

She made a small incision into the cast with some scissors before brining him over to some of the medical equipment. It only too a few mere moments before the cast was being pulled open and he could finally see his rather dirty arm. He looked at the nurse a little embarrased with the state of his arm, she gave him a small smirk and directed him over to the sink where he throughly washed his hand and forearm, the first time in a month.

Once it was all clean he thanked the nurse and left the hospital, his arm finally having healed fully.* - Fri Nov 27 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) came to the training field soon after he had his cast removed, moving to one of the corners for some quiet. He wanted to start off slow to test the waters with his arm so he formed the ram hand seal slowly as he began building his chakra up. He thought back to what he last practised and remembered it was earth stone and bamboo shoot. With that in mind he knew that would be perfect to start off with. He got on his knees and clapped his hands together once, placed themon the ground after and pushing his chakra to his hands. He began kneading it into the sand, splitting it off into four and focusing it into four points. He would then use his chakra to start drawing sand into those points, condensing and hardening it. He would then release that sand forward, forming four spiked shapes as he did.

He stretched his right arm out a little before forming a few practise hand seals, nothing was hurting so everything seemed to be fine with his arm. This spurred him on to continue training, he had been waiting a month for this so he wasn't about to give up now. Forming the ram hand seal to help focus his chakra again he would wait until ready, then part his hands to clap them once. He placed his hands on the floor and began pumping his chakra into the sand again, focusing on refining his use of chakra as he did. Once he was ready he would split the chakra into four again and start drawing in the sand. He focused his efforts on drawing more sand in, trying to create a more condensed spike. He would then release these four points outward, forming the spikes again.

He moved position since there were quite a few spikes at his last one but he quickly sat back down and began to meditate as he regained focus. As he was meditating he would form the ram hand seal and begin building his chakra up. Within mere moments he clapped his hands together, then parted them and placed them on the ground. He pumped his chakra into the ground and then split it into four, refining his chakra control all the while he did this. Once he was done he would start condensing sand down into four points of his chakra, manipulating his chakra to draw more sand in and harden it. With a pulse of his chakra he would then release this condensed sand into four small spiked pillars.

He leaned back and formed the ram hand seal again, wasting no time in letting himself 'recover' from this, it wasn't overly draining in the first place. He was managing to get back into the swing of things now, it was taking only a few seconds to build up his chakra once again. After those few seconds had passed his hands would clap together again, then straight back on the floor they went as he began pumping his chakra down his arms and into the sand again. The chakra split off into four and stopped at four different points. He would then work on condensing and hardening more and more sand as time went by. Once ready he would release the chakra again, shooting the sand forward into four spikes once more.

He got up and moved to a new spot again so he could work with a clear area. He began meditating once more, he used to think such a thing was silly but since he broke his arm he found it a good way to spend his time and focus his chakra. He would form the ram hand seal a few seconds later to help focus his chakra as he built it up quickly. His hands would then meet with a clap before being pressed flat against the floor, serving as the connector for his chakra to be pumped into the ground like fuel. This chakra would the split off and focus into four points, gathering sand and condensing it as it did. He focused his chakra into hardening the sand as he gathered more and more of it. He then utilised his chakra by manipulating it to shoot the sand off out of the ground, shaping it into four spikes.

He got up and dusted himself off, about to exit the area. He sat back down again though and shrugged his shoulders, this was the first time in a month he could train he so thought he might as well practise one more time to get the most out of this, he was making good time anyway. He formed the ram hand seal and shut his eyes as he focused on his chakra as much as he could. He clapped his hands and lent over to place them flat against the ground. He then began pumping his chakra into the ground, manipulating it into four points that he used to draw as much sand as possible in. He would then condense this sand down and harden it before finally using his chakra control to shoot off four spikes. He got up and dusted himself off as he looked around and admired his work, a small smirk forming on his face as he thought about all the training he could finally catch up on.* - Fri Nov 27 10:03:44 2015

He took in a deep breath as his body started to shiver slightly, she might have noticed since his hand was only her shoulder.

He would turn his head to look at her, his eyes seemed to show mixed emotions, namely worry and anxiety. "Please take the house Chikyu...I need you to be safe."* - Fri Nov 27 13:54:08 2015

He wondered if he should ask about it later...then again it must have been wrapped for a reason.
