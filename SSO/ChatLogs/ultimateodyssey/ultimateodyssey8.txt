<br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I want you to take up drinking tea -or- coffee. - Mon Nov 16 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Whichever you prefer. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Um... - Mon Nov 16 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mostly... - Mon Nov 16 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Okay well you should but if you can't then at least drink tea or coffee three times daily. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then have a cup of non caffinated tea or coffee before you go to sleep. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: These will form a habit that isn't too much to be addictive but will help stabalize your shakes. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Your shakes are because of nerves as well as you trying to go cold turkey. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You are going to have to learn to deal with them. - Mon Nov 16 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks down into his tea at that last comment, he fell silent for a few moments again. "I don't know...you're probably just going to think its petty and laugh at me or something..." he would reply, clearly having some form of insecurity problem.* - Mon Nov 16 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Ok...well... - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: One of the first ones is my family. - Mon Nov 16 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I miss them a lot...walking into a house and having no one greet you is hard. - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just wish I could see them one last time, y'know? - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just to say goodbye. - Mon Nov 16 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The next thing would be...well... - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm a very lonely person...I have no friends...at all. - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just want someone to talk to...like we're talking now... - Mon Nov 16 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I want to go back to Konoha some day... - Mon Nov 16 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And i'm not sure if Rias wants to be friends with me anymore... - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Things are so hard with her, I don't what to do or say half the time. - Mon Nov 16 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It all changed for us when I told her how I felt about her, now it just confusing to be around her. - Mon Nov 16 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Half the time she's holding hands with me, not really minding my advances. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Other times I just feel like she wants me gone for good. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Its even harder when I feel like this about her and she tells me she doesn't want a relationship of any kind with anyone. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Make new friends. - Mon Nov 16 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I think it would be wise to move on from Rias. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: It seems like she is stringing you along. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But I don't want to hurt her...and without her then I truly have nothing. - Mon Nov 16 04:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If she wants to be your friend then she will come to you. - Mon Nov 16 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just ...don't go to her first. - Mon Nov 16 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think its all my fault really... - Mon Nov 16 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think she wants to be friends...but finds it hard because she knows I want to be more than friends. - Mon Nov 16 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then you need to stay away from her for a bit. - Mon Nov 16 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I've been trying but...its just hard because i've never felt like this about anyone before. - Mon Nov 16 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think I might just try a different approach, leave all my feelings to the side for now and just be friends with her. - Mon Nov 16 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't know...I need to do something. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But you really should make new friends. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Now then. - Mon Nov 16 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The drinking, have you drank any? - Mon Nov 16 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No...not yet. - Mon Nov 16 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess i've just been too worried about stuff to drink for the moment. - Mon Nov 16 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) picks up the cup, drinking a large portion of the tea to wet his throat since it was dry from all the talking.* - Mon Nov 16 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean...I have some on me right now...but thats just to reassure myself. - Mon Nov 16 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...give it to me. - Mon Nov 16 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: And you don't say 'not yet' you say no, not ever. - Mon Nov 16 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Mon Nov 16 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But what? - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You don't reassure yourself you aren't going to drink by carrying it on you. - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You don't have it around you, at all. - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Didn't I tell you to pour them all out? - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mmmm... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine fine... - Mon Nov 16 04:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) slowly reaches a hand into his backpouch, pulling out a scroll. He'd hand it over to Kiyoko cautiously, a small frown on his face.* - Mon Nov 16 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Damn...how did she know I sealed it... - Mon Nov 16 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm sorry...I didn't mean to... - Mon Nov 16 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I know you must think i'm a shitty person...I just can't help it... - Mon Nov 16 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks down at the floor, bringing his knees in line with his chest and them hugging them. He looked and felt upset, he was disappointed in himself and he felt like Kiyoko probably hated him right about now.* - Mon Nov 16 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked up to the scroll she had placed down, he didn't bother taking it back, he simply stared at him. "I think I take back what I said about my family...I don't want to see them again because they'd be ashamed of me...I know I am..."* - Mon Nov 16 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's okay because we are going to fix your problem, right? - Mon Nov 16 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...probably. - Mon Nov 16 04:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You uh...never told me your name by the way... - Mon Nov 16 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...I didn't? - Mon Nov 16 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh dear. - Mon Nov 16 04:51:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thank you for all this Kiyoko...you didn't have to bring me into your home. - Mon Nov 16 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well the hospital is getting a little construction but I thought you might like this. - Mon Nov 16 04:54:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, and the talk too. - Mon Nov 16 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's nice to just talk. - Mon Nov 16 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Heh. - Mon Nov 16 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's good. - Mon Nov 16 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think even my shakes have stopped for now... - Mon Nov 16 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Good good, probably the tea and the talking. - Mon Nov 16 04:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yep. - Mon Nov 16 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No more than every four hours. - Mon Nov 16 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: If you really need it that often even. - Mon Nov 16 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Ok...well at least this gives me another reason not to drink. - Mon Nov 16 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 16 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Can't drink with this. - Mon Nov 16 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) finishes the last bit of his tea off before placing the cup on the tray. He stood up and put his shoes back on. "Thanks for all this...I should probably get going now."* - Mon Nov 16 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Mhm.~ - Mon Nov 16 04:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks to the door, stopping just as he opens it. He'd wave to Kiyoko, "See you soon."* - Mon Nov 16 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks up besides Rias, tapping her on the shoulder to let her know he was her. If she turned to him he'd give her a small friendly smile. He seemed happier than before.* - Mon Nov 16 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yo, Kiyoko, sup? - Mon Nov 16 05:04:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Steps onto the training field and cracks his neck left and right, stretching his back out a little after. He moves a little further to the back and picks a spot in the corner, standing up straight and forming the ram hand seal as he builds his chakra up. Once his chakra was ready he would pull his hands apart and kneel down. He would clap his hands and place them on the ground, sending his chakra down each arm and into his hands so he could knead it into the ground. As he started to spread his chakra through the ground he would split it into four points and focus those points in four different places, still quite near each other. He would then build sand up at these points, condensing and hardening it. With a small push of his chakra he would spike all four points outwards, forming four sharp spikes which stuck out of the ground.* - Mon Nov 16 09:31:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) oes back to the spot he was just in, closing his eyes and concentrating on his chakra. He would form the ram hand seal again to help him focus his chakra, he didn't really need to do it but everything helps. He wanted to get started on practising and refining different parts of the jutsu until it was mastered. With that in mind he knelt down and clapped his hands, placing them on the ground he would then begin kneading his chakra into the sand. He would refine the chakra he kneaded into the ground and then concentrate as much as he could into splitting the chakra into four, trying to keep his chakra balanced. He would then send those four lengths of chakra through the ground and concentrate them in a square formation, one at each 'point'. He would condense the sand to these points and then spike it forward, forming the four spikes.

He stayed kneeling down and formed the ram hand seal again, wasting no time in beginning to build up his chakra. Once he had moulded and mixed his chakra up correctly he would clap his hands together once and place them flat on the ground, starting the jutsu once again. He closed his eyes to help refine his chakra as he kneaded it into the ground. As he split it he tried to make sure the ratio was correct for all four points and then began drawing in and condensing sand to each point. He made sure to condense as much as possible down, then when he released that sand in the form of a spike he would continue to condense more and more to extend the spike out. With that, four more spikes would be sticking out of the ground.

He would shuffle around on his knees a little to face a new direction since there were too many spikes to work around now. With a new set of sand to practise with he would clap his hands together once and hold them together, building up his chakra as quickly as he possibly could. Within a few moments his hands would be back and he would be sending his chakra through the sand again. Just as before he repeated the process of splitting his chakra into four and then focusing it at four separate locations. Once they were in place he would start drawing in sand from the surroundings, condensing it more and more into these focal points. After a few seconds he would pulse his chakra and send the spikes off upwards, completing the jutsu.

He figured he'd give it one more go before going to lay down a while or checking what was happening in the courtyard, if anything. He shook that from his head though and began focusing on his chakra, quickly building up an adequate amount of chakra for the jutsu. With a clap of his hands he would lean over and place them flat against the ground, sending his chakra down his arms and then into the ground. Once he had split his chakra into four and focused it into four spots in the ground it was just a repeat of before, condensing more and more sand from the ground into those points. As he shot the spikes off he would pack more sand into the stem of the spike, reinforcing the structure of it. Once that was done he would stand up and dust himself off, walking out of the training field. The spikes of sand would eventually crumble back into the ground.* - Mon Nov 16 11:24:22 2015
