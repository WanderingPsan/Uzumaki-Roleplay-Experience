<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: May I ask why? - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because it just seems odd. - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I've had to fight for my life twice in less than a week. - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: And what does that have to with me or my village? - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Someone is bombing the village. - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And suddenly someone is taking in our refugees? - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I've been a refuge, I've been in your shoes. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't like how it fits on my feet. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm just wondering why you're taking people in. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And what you're offering people. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Spar him. - Thu Nov 12 04:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I would, but I physically can't. - Thu Nov 12 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Tough break pal...she ain't interested. - Thu Nov 12 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I came here to learn things rather than spar people. - Thu Nov 12 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..How can I know what you're capable of without you sparring someone? - Thu Nov 12 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I was poisoned a few hours ago. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It took a lot to just walk here. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I physically cannot fight that man. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then rest up. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you want to know what i'm capable of, I'll tell you. - Thu Nov 12 04:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can rest after I kill people that keep using Konoha as their play thing. - Thu Nov 12 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Are you dumb? How are you going to do that when you can barely walk? - Thu Nov 12 04:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Simple. - Thu Nov 12 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Easy. - Thu Nov 12 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Thu Nov 12 04:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks forward, turning as he got close to Ortho and moving towards the tree. He would sit down against it, pulling out a scroll he had on him as he sat down. He would sit forward and open the scroll, rolling it out infront of himself. It had a single seal on it, one anyone with basic seal knowledge would recognise. He held up the seal of confrontation and focused on the seal, releashing it with a puff of smoke. After the smoke cleared it would reveal a shuriken sitting ontop of the now different looking seal. <Might as well practise this while I 'rest'...fucker...>* - Thu Nov 12 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) started to bob his head up and down, his eyes flickering between being open and closed. It was clear he was falling alseep, even if he was fighting it. Unfortunately this was another side effect of the poison, extreme drowsiness and even passing out. He'd bob his head down for a few seconds before whipping his head and neck back up. "Fuck..!" he'd say slightly louder than he meant to.

After a few seconds he would be falling asleep again, even with his attempts to keep himself awake...* - Thu Nov 12 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to slump down against the tree, his head even falling to the side a little. "Shit...I don't-" was all he said before looking at the new arrival to the area. He seemed to be a lot more awake and alert now, even pushing himself to sit upright.* - Thu Nov 12 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head, pulling up a limp looking arm to push Eri's hand away. He would slowly push himself up the tree looking over to Naoya. Placing a hand into his backpouch he would grip onto a kunai, a paper bomb attached to it. His eyes, despite looking weiry and tired, looked alert as he gazed up and down Naoya. <Poison isn't going to help much out here> he thought to himself, still staying silent as he stared Naoya down.

"I don't need to sleep...but you do...forever." he would say in a breathless voice, clearly having trouble both keeping himself up and speaking.* - Thu Nov 12 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I see, I see. - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: No beef, i like him. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Naoya. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Step outside of the settlement. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: It's even more stupid that way. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And you didn't beat me, I had you on the run. - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I could of killed you, but i don't do finishers like that. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That's your problem. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: Not a problem. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It is now. - Thu Nov 12 05:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: This is that pervert's settlement? - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Akira, are you gonna handle him? - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Of course. - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Damn, what a shame. - Thu Nov 12 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I just came for knowledge. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Exactly. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Like you did me. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Leave or prepare yourself. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I'm already prepared. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Good. - Thu Nov 12 05:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...My jacket and NinjaTunes.... - Thu Nov 12 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Hmph. - Thu Nov 12 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) thinks: Shitty guards.. - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) thinks: Sounds normal. - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) puts a small smirk on his face, he takes in a deep breath and begins building up chakra within his body. He starts to move towards Naoya as he pulls the paper bomb kunai out from his backpouch. He launchs the Kunai towards Naoya and the kneels, skidding across the ground a little as he did. He'd clap his hands together and place them on the ground, kneading his chakra into the ground as fast as possible. The chakra infused ground would then start to change into a viscous mud, it would race at Naoya, aiming to wash him away and push him back.* - Thu Nov 12 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) jumps back from the dome, holding up the seal of confrontation to set the tag off. He'd probably be in his original position by now.* - Thu Nov 12 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Were you..... - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Flying? - Thu Nov 12 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) slumped against the tree, using it to help him keep himself stood up. He just looked at the body of Naoya and shook his head. He'd then turn his gaze to Eri, "Hey...come here a sec." he'd said, motioning her over to him with a limp wave of his hand.* - Thu Nov 12 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) turned his body to enable him to look at Eri better and pivot himself against the tree easier. "Sorry about knocking your hand away, what were you trying to do?"* - Thu Nov 12 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) lift a hand up to his head, rubbing his head and then his eye before letting it fall back down. His eyes looked weary and tired. "Yeah, That guy poisoned me earlier...I don't think it will kill me...probably." 
If she looked closely at him she might notice a small blood patch on his coat near his right shoulder. "Are you a medic of some kind?"* - Thu Nov 12 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked down at his shoulder, noticing the blood. "Oh sh- Uh yeah, Thats pretty new. That guy stabbed me in the shoulder with a kunai." He unzipped his large coat, slipping one arm out of it and using it to carefully remove his other arm with the injured shoulder. He chucked the coat to the side and pulled away any clothing that would block the wound from view.

He had attempted to treat the wound himself, attempted is a mild word because the bandage he placed on it was poorly wrapped and soaked in blood, it definately looked like it needed changing and renewing by someone that knew what they were doing. "Could you take a look for me? I can't quite tell how bad it is."* - Thu Nov 12 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was quite surprised at how quickly his wound closed up and healed. He had heard of medical ninjutsu before but he didn't believe it was this good. He nodded his head in thanks to Ortho before returning his focus back to Eri. He flexed his shoulder back and forth a bit before resting it, and himself, back on the tree. "Anyway, sorry about batting your hand away...and thanks for taking a look and checking up on me, you didn't have to." he'd remark to her, looking into the leaves of the tree.

He didn't say anything else after that, going quite silent both in speech and movement...mostly because he recently got blown off by a girl and didn't really want to continue talking to another right now.* - Thu Nov 12 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks back down, noticing Eri had walked off. He looks down at his feet and wonders if he came off a little rude. He wasn't sure whether he should or not but he kicked off from the tree, making his way slowly over to Eri. He'd leave his coat behind, he robbed it from a dead guy anyway. Once he got within reasonable talking distance he would speak up. "Uh...hey again. Sorry if I came off a little rude...I didn't catch your name?"* - Thu Nov 12 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) wondered what she was doing with the notepad, but he guessed it didn't really matter and it would be rude to ask. He was a little surprised by her name, its certainly unique to his ears at least. "I'm Akira, just a genin from Konoha I suppose." he'd reply with, pulling a hand up to rub the back of his neck, he wasn't quite sure how to continue really. "So...what did you mean by important to this settlement?" he'd ask, just placking anything from his head to prevent an awkward silence.* - Thu Nov 12 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) shrugged as well. "Not really...well kinda but I don't like to talk about it much, y'know? I kinda like introducing myself with my first name. I guess I have been through something in life too...but I won't bore you with past events." he'd reply, letting his hand fall from his neck as he began a little less tense. He still didn't have much to talk about so he figured he take a shot in the dark. "Do you mind me asking what you were doing before I came a long? You looked like you were drawing or writing something."* - Thu Nov 12 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Akira shrugged as well. "Not really...well kinda but I don't like to talk about it much, y'know? I kinda like introducing myself with my first name. I guess I have been through something in life too...but I won't bore you with past events." he'd reply, letting his hand fall from his neck as he began a little less tense. He still didn't have much to talk about so he figured he take a shot in the dark. "Do you mind me asking what you were doing before I came a long? You looked like you were drawing or writing something." - Repost* - Thu Nov 12 07:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked down at the notepad, then back up at Eri, "Huh, Well at least you got a flyer...I know pretty much nothing about this place." He'd take a short looking around, taking in the scenery and his surroundings. "At least I know who to talk to if I get lost now, thats a pretty smart idea." he'd say, giving her a small compliment because he still felt bad about practically ignoring her a few minutes ago.* - Thu Nov 12 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked down at the flyer for a second before returning his focus to Eri. "It's fine, i'll just learn my way around here eventually I guess." he replied, turning his head to look at Ortho and Paine, "I guess, I mean i'm not really complaining since he fixed my shoulder up...why do you ask?"* - Thu Nov 12 07:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head at that, it was true after all he looked and acted nothing like a doctor. "Well, Maybe he does it as more of a part time thing rather than a profession, y'know?" he would then look back at her, then to his surroundings again. <Hm...maybe I should stay here for a while...> he thought to himself as he continued to looking around. Eventually his gaze rested upon Eri again, "Uh, I know you don't know this place very well...or me...but, would you mind showing me around a little? Its fine if you don't want to."* - Thu Nov 12 07:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..... - Thu Nov 12 07:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) scratches the back of his head, a small smirk appearing on his face, "Heh, Thanks." he could tell he was being a bit of a pain to her but he did want to get to know this place...and make a few friends here. "I guess you lead and I follow?" he placed his hands in his pockets and looked onwards to Eri, awaiting her response.* - Thu Nov 12 07:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) chuckles slightly as she gets the name wrong, mostly because he said the same thing. "Shinkogakure. I made that same mistake." he would look around at the shops, noticing they were quite pint sized. "This place must be smaller than I thought...though it gives it a nice feel." he would add before going silent to continue listening to Eri.* - Thu Nov 12 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was a little taken back by the family comment, no one had ever really asked him about his family...then again he didn't have many friends. "I did...until the destruction of Konoha a few months ago...now I just live alone..." he'd trail off, going into a semi-brooding mood. He'd shake his head though, not wanting to be a downer. "You got any family back there?"* - Thu Nov 12 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) probably wouldn't have been able to know she was lying, not in his current state of mind at least. "I'm sorry to hear that." is all he'd say, not wanting to press the matter any further. "Eh, I'm not sure if I'll stay here yet. I think I will for now but I don't know about long term." he'd responde, looking to his surroundings to take in how peaceful and tranquil they were. "Do you want to step into one of these food places and get something to eat or drink...i'm quite hungry because of everything thats happened to me today and I could use the company." he'd say in a fairly neutral tone because he wasn't really hinting towards anything, he was just hungry.* - Thu Nov 12 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) shrugged as he half entered the store, waving her off. "Nice to meet you too, thanks for showing me around. Remind me to pay you back sometime" he'd reply, letting his hand fall to his side as he properly entered the ramen shop. He'd buy himself a simple meal to eat, spend some time there to savour his meal and leave, heading back to the hub area.* - Thu Nov 12 08:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sits down, crossing his legs. He rested an elbow on his knee, hunching over to rest his head in his hand. Here he was again, alone and in silence.* - Thu Nov 12 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks along the mountain side, trailing a hand across the side. He'd come to a stop as he spots Ziare, wondering what he was doing all the way out here. "Odd place to relax, Ziare."* - Thu Nov 12 22:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov 12 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I just finished my last bit of training. - Thu Nov 12 22:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Lucky you. - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah... - Thu Nov 12 22:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Sits down, crossing his legs. He rolled the scroll out in front of himself and started at the beginning, wondering what the technique was. It was called 'Kai' which seemed odd to him. As he read on it started to explain about how genjutsu worked by disrupting the chakra network flow. By using Kai you could apparently rid this effect and break out of the genjutsu by further disrupting the flow of chakra in your chakra network. It went on to further explain that through physical contact and a small exchange of chakra, you could release another person from a genjutsu. It seemed that you have to pulse a stronger force of chakra through your chakra network to achieve this…but he wasn't entirely sure how you'd accomplish that.* - Thu Nov 12 22:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Continued to read on as while genjutsu wasn't much of an appeal to him, breaking out of it easier certainly was. It explained how you could either use pain to shock yourself back into reality or use a large burst of chakra through your chakra network. It detailed that while the pain method was quick and easy, it wasn't the best option to use it battle as you are damaging yourself. By building up a large amount of chakra within your stomach and then bursting it though your chakra network, you cause no damage to yourself. It also explained about the technique was used, commonly the ram hand seal was held up to help focus your chakra while you release it through your body.* - Thu Nov 12 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Looked away and stretched it aching back out a little before lumping back over to glue his eyes to the parchment of the scroll. There were a few diagrams on it, mostly to show how one built up chakra and then released it through their body. It went onto a finer detail though, explaining how one should first regulate and control the flow of their chakra, bringing it down to a normal rate. Then once they had built up their chakra, form the ram hand seal and stop the flow of your chakra all together. Within that moment one should then burst a large supply of chakra through their body, stemming from their stomach. If done successfully the genjutsu should be broken and the chakra network should have returned to normal.* - Thu Nov 12 23:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) would have been sitting down, legs crossed and an elbow resting on his knee.

He would tilt his head up at the sound of a soft, timid voice, looking on over to the one he saw Ortho carry off yesterday. With his free hand he'd give her a small wave to be polite and to show not everyone here was asleep. "Hey..."* - Fri Nov 13 00:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked up at Ortho again, this time his gaze would stay on him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) places his back against the wooden pole, slowly sliding down it until he was sitting. He would push both arms out of the neckhole of his coat, forcibly unzipping it. He'd reach into the coat and pull out a bottle, its contents not made for one his age but he popped the cap off and began drinking, setting the bottle down between his legs after a quick drink. Here he was, alone again.* - Fri Nov 13 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks around the area as he takes another swig from his bottle of sake that he stole out of Konoha while leaving...that and a couple of others. He noticed quite a few females around here, shrugging his shoulders at it. It's not like he cared since his last fling was a total failure.* - Fri Nov 13 07:10:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes another drink from his bottle, continuing to scan the area as he looked around. He saw the two on bridge messing around with an orange, he assumed it was for lunch or something. <Wonder where they got fruit from in a barren place like this...> he'd think to himself before looking up to Mitsunara, wondering why she was so close to him and where she came from. Another swig and shrug ensued.* - Fri Nov 13 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) squints his eyes at Mistunara as he drinks some more sake, <Do I know her..?>* - Fri Nov 13 07:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) spots Marrisa in the distance. "Psst, Marrisa come over here!" he'd shout over to her while also trying to imitate a whisper, it would sound kind of raspy. He'd take another drink from his bottle before placing it on the ground quite hard, he looked at Marrisa to await her reaction.* - Fri Nov 13 07:36:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) lets go of the bottle, reaching a hand into his coat to grab onto something. With his free hand he'd attempt to wave her in closer. Regardless of whether she came closer or not he would pull out of his coat...another sake bottle...holding it out for her to take. "This is for one...don't tell the others..." he'd say, whipping his head right and left in a suspicious manner.* - Fri Nov 13 07:39:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) throws whatever was left of the bottle to the side, shaking his now probably wet hand off to dry and help dry it. "Well theres no need to be like that...damn...I was just trying to be friendly..." he'd sad in a slightly sad tone before taking his own bottle in hand, drinking a large amount of it at once. His face looked a bit sad now, <Why would she do that..?>* - Fri Nov 13 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh he's gone...of course. - Fri Nov 13 07:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes one last big chug of the bottle to finish it off. He looks into the hole of the bottle to make sure he got everything before looking over to Marrisa. <Maybe she's right...maybe I shouldn't drink this stuff...but I feel so much better...> he'd think to himself, placing the bottle down and taking a third one out of his backpouch. He'd pop the cork off of it, taking a small drink to begin his second bottle.* - Fri Nov 13 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls his arm around, letting his arm take the impact of the rock. He'd rub his arm a little and pull a frown. Reaching into his backpouch again he would grab hold of and take out two items this time, a lighter and a pack of smokes. He would set the lighter down on his leg, opening the pack of smokes with his free hand. He shook the back until one came free, grabbing hold of it with his lips. He'd place the pack down and light the lighter, bringing it up to the cig as he inhaled, lighting the end of it.

He put the lighter down and took the smoke out of his mouth with his free hand, exhaling as he did. He'd then take another drink and hold both the bottle and the smoke up to Marrisa with a cocky grin.* - Fri Nov 13 08:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) took two more drags from the cig, drinking again once he had. The smoke helped calm him down and relaxed him, he looked around himself and then down at the bottle in his hand. He wondered what he was doing right now...had he really become this lonely that he had to sit on his own in the middle of the street likea hobo..? He shrugged and downed the rest of the bottle, placing it in line with his last one. He had another hidden in his coat but he didn't bother taking it out, for now he was just sitting and chilling as he smoked.* - Fri Nov 13 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks over to Marrisa, feeling a little bad that he had just taunted her when she stuck her neck out for him. He would take his half smoked cig out of his mouth, "Marrisa..." he'd say in a much more chill down. He'd wave her over again if she turned around.* - Fri Nov 13 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes another small drag, blowing it out to the side of himself before looking back up to Marrisa. "Hey...i'm sorry I didn't mean to piss you off..."* - Fri Nov 13 08:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) falls asleep with the lit cig in his mouth, it slowly starts slipping from between his lips.* - Fri Nov 13 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) falls lip, his head rolling forward and his arms hitting the ground either side of him. The smoke falls from his mouth and onto his coat, it starts to burn a hole...* - Fri Nov 13 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) immediately wakes up as he feels someone get near him, he wipes his mouth and feels no smoke there. He shakes his head and rubs his face with a hand. He stands up, picking up his lighter and and cig pack as he did. He would place them both in his backpouch before taking out his last sake bottle, also storing that away in his backpouch. He picks up both used bottles and makes his way towards the bin, placing the bottles in there.

Oddly enough he would take his coat off and stuff that in the bin too, its not like it was worth much to him anyway. He would then walk off in the direction of the shops, stumbling a little as he went.* - Fri Nov 13 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) returns a few minutes later, bread stuffed in his mouth as he carried a bottle of water and a cup of black coffee. He put the bottle of water away and took the bread out of his mouth, biting a chunk of it off, chewing it and then swallowing it. He would then take a swig of coffee before looking at Marrisa and smirking a little. She had told him to sober up...at least he was trying right..?* - Fri Nov 13 08:54:36 2015

The expression on his face had changed from relaxed and carefree to pissed off and sour. He even looked a little more sobered up for some reason. "Marrisa...can we start training or something...right now please..." he said in a slightly raspy tone. His alcohol induced state probably not helping with his anger.* - Fri Nov 13 09:15:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) kicked at the ground a little, noticing it was sand. <Welp...can't use my only jutsu here...again...> He thought to himself, putting both hands in his backpouch. He would pull out two kunai, one of which had an explosive tag on it. He would throw the tagged Kunai at Marrisa and run after he, other Kunai in hand.* - Fri Nov 13 09:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) continued running forward, not even bothering to stop as a large wall of earth surged upward in front of Marrisa. His thrown kunai would most likely hit the wall and bounce off it. As for his other kunai he chucked it away and clapped his hands together, running up to the wall. He would place his hands on the wall of earth, kneading his chakra into it. Within a few seconds the wall would hopefully start to turn into mud. He would then attempt to move this mud forward and wash Marrisa away.

Something to note though, this may not work as planned since the wall is kneaded with Marrisas own chakra...in which case he would just be standing with his hands on the wall...staring at it.* - Fri Nov 13 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) would slam his fist against the wall twice in anger. "Shut up about Rias!" he'd shout over to her. He would take three tags out and place them together on the wall before pulling a kunai out, holding it in reverse. He would run around the wall and at Marrisa. As he emerged on the other side and probably into the sight of her, she would probably noticing him holding a kunai and a hald ram seal up, also known as the seal of confrontation. The tag would then ignite and explode...his plan would be to distract her with rubble from the blast before going in for a stab.* - Fri Nov 13 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) shouted an inaudible shout in anger. A sizable rock would knock his shoulder back, causing him to jump back in surprise of the crumbling rocks. He would look around for her, wondering where she had gone. "Yeah, Not very adept at Doton my ass!" he shouted as he got on his hands and knees and started...stabbing at the ground with his kunai. Pure anger now fueled his body, rather than logic.* - Fri Nov 13 09:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) gets kicked in the stomach as he stabs the ground, being knocked through the air and onto his back a couple of feet away. His kunai would most likely have been left in the ground. He groaned as he stared at the sky, gripping at his stomach. He would slowly sit up as he listening to Marrisa, her words were harsh but true, and he knew it. Still like any 15 year old male the though of Rias still played on his mind. He pulled his knees to his chest somewhat and wrapped his arms around his legs, resting his chin on his knees.

"I just...don't understand what I do so wrong...I barely have any friends and then she comes along and before I could even start anything with her she blew me off to go train in a different village...then see sends me scrolls signing her name with 'love' at the end of it...looks mortified when I turn up here and now she's running off with someone else..."* - Fri Nov 13 10:29:20 2015
