<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns and start walking towards Kiyoko and Leras house, his sleeves seemed to flap in the wind indicating his arms were not present in them. He would stop after a few steps, turning around to check if she was following.* - Fri Nov 27 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) stepped into the house, probably behind Kiyoko since she would need to unlock the door and it was polite to do so anyway. Once he was inside he took a look around, noticing it was as clean as ever. The buttons on his coat starts to pop open one by one as he pushed his arms free. He took the coat off and folded it, chucking it onto the sofa. He then went and sat down next to Kiyoko, just staring at the wall.

After a few silent moments she would notice an arm go around the back of her, hooking her and pulling her in, his other arm would then go across her front, doing the same as the other. He pulled her in tightly for a second or two before letting such a tight grasp go, he still held her close however. "I'm sorry about Aza but what happened to him wasn't your fault, nor was any other death. You shouldn't be sad for doing your best, just as everyone else did."

She might notice a change in his demeanor, he barely looked at her as he said this and his facial expression was rather neutral, he didn't seem as recluse or sheltered as before.* - Fri Nov 27 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) gently rubs her arm with a hand as she cries, he knew exactly how she felt as he had been through this many times himself, he could just deal with it better both because of how he was becoming accustomed to it and how she herself had helped him. As he rubbed her arm he would pull his other hand up to wipe the tears from her face, he would now be looking directly at her as he pulled her face up slightly.

"It's ok to cry for the fallen but don't become stuck on their death. Aza died so you could live, marry Lera, love her, start a family and help other like him and myself. He died so you didn't have to, just as everyone else that died did. It's ok to be sad Kiyoko, but remember why they fell. It's not your fault and it never will be."

He stopped rubbing her arm and wiping her tears away, returning both arms to just holding onto her. He would squeeze her tightly and let silence fall over them, letting his body language do the talking for him.* - Fri Nov 27 19:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) slumped down a little as she just sort of fell into him, both for comfort and for a better angle to hug her from. He stayed silent as he squeezed her tightly every so often to remind her he was there for her, just as she had been for him when he needed it. He didn't mind the wetness that would probably start to build up on his shirt, he simply pulled her in tighter. "Let it out Kiyoko...let it out and let it all go..." He said in a soft tone, lowering his head down closer to her so he could speak softer.

"You're going to be fine Kiyoko...it hurts now but eventually you'll fill that pain with love. You're lucky that you have so many people to help you with that...including a lover. Don't let this overcome you Kiyoko...rise up and become stronger from it, I know you can."

He would then lower his head further as he hunched over a little, turning his head and resting it against her. He wanted to comfort her and be as close as possible to show he was here for her and he meant what he said, he felt she just needed that right now, a hug and comforting words.* - Fri Nov 27 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) moved back a little, giving her some space. He eased up on the hugging, going back to just a light grip around her. "See, That's the Kiyoko I know."* - Fri Nov 27 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I didn't exactly come here to do this...but I felt this was more important than what I had to say. - Fri Nov 27 19:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) stops off at the gate with Kiyoko, paying for a caravan before saying his final goodbyes. He would walk up to her and push his arms through his sleeves, extending each arm out to wrap them around her and pull her in for one last goodbye hug. "Thank you for everything Kiyoko...you have no idea how much you mean to me...stay safe." He said, a hint of worry and anxiety present in his voice.* - Fri Nov 27 20:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm going to go train, Find me at the training field if you need me. - Sat Nov 28 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) came to Konohas training field for the first time in a long while. He took a deep breath in and looked around, appreciating the atmosphere, it was quite and peaceful, just how he liked it while training. He moved over to a corner, building up his chakra as he walked. Once he was in position he would clap his hands and take a knee, placing his hands flat against the ground as he did. He would send his built up chakra into the ground, splitting it into four points as he did. He would focus those points and start drawing the earth into them, condensing it down and hardening it. With a push of his chakra he send the earth out of the ground, shaping it into a spike for each point, forming four spikes.

He transitions his body into a seated position and starts meditating as he focuses on his chakra, building it up. He started meditating a lot lately, it really helped calm himself and his chakra. After a few seconds he would clap his hands together and place them on the ground again. He would start to funnel his chakra down his arms and into the ground, first amassing it and then sending it off in four parts. He would then focus these four parts of his chakra into four points, using these points as focal points to draw in earth to condense it. He would send this earth off, forming it into four spikes. As he formed the spikes he would try and apply more of the ground into the spikes, further hardening them while also forming large spikes.

He turned to the right to give himself a fresh field to work with, closing his eyes and clapping his hands together as he built his chakra up while he meditated. After a few more moments he would place his hands on the ground again, pumping more of his chakra into the earth as he did. As before he would split his chakra into four and create four focal points with it, drawing in and condensing the ground with his chakra. He would then manipulate this condensed earth, pushing each focal point outwards and forming them into spikes. He would gather more and more of the earth as he did this, forming larger and more durable spikes.

After that was finished he would pull his hands back and clap them back together, looking over the newest set of spikes he had made, inspecting them to make sure he was doing this correctly. After he was happy with what he was doing he would close his eyes and focus fully on his chakra, then place his hands back on the ground. His chakra would once again be poured into the ground, splitting into four like always. It would then draw in as much earth as his control would allow, pushing it forward and forming it into a spike as he did. He would condense the earth as he formed the spikes, allowing for longer and more durable spikes to be formed.

Once again he would turn on the spot to face a new direction, giving himself space and fresh earth to work with. He sat and focused his mind before concentrating on his chakra. It took a few seconds but he was back on track again. Once he felt he was ready to try again he would clap his hands together once, lean over and then place them flat against the floor. He would channel his chakra down his arms and into the ground, first concentrating it and then splitting it into four. He would then make four focal points and start drawing the earth into these points, condensing it. As he did that he would push this condensed earth out of the ground, forming them into four spikes. He concentrated on strengthening and lengthening these spikes.

When those four spikes had been adequately formed he would pull his hands back and return his focus onto his chakra, building it up as he meditated and focused his mind and body together. Within a few short moments his hands would come back together with a clap, then hit the ground. His chakra would then be kneaded into the ground. He would focus on this chakra, splitting it into four, positioning the four points a little ways away from himself. These four points would then draw the earth into them and condense that earth as they shot out of the ground, forming four large hardened spikes. Once those spikes were formed he would sit back and exhale a little, giving himself a moments rest.* - Sat Nov 28 23:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) took a short breather before getting back on track, it wasn't that the jutsu was overly draining, it was just he hadn't trained hard in a while and he wanted to start off slow before going at it for real. In any case he would move to a new position, sit down, focus himself and start building up his chakra. With a clap of his hands he would be ready, placing them against the ground and pumping his chakra into the earth. He would then manipulate his chakra to draw the sand in and condense it. This time he would form the spike as he did this, allowing for the four spikes to be formed faster.

Once those spikes were formed he would draw his hands back and refocus on his chakra, centering himself totally on his chakra. Once he was ready to begin again he clapped his hands and pressed them against the ground, quickly funneling his chakra down his arms and into the ground. He would then control his chakra as before, splitting it into four and drawing the earth into each point. He would condense the earth faster and faster as he quickly began forming the four spikes with it, drawing in the earth as fast as he could too. Each spike would quickly emerge out of the ground, but not fast enough.

He turned around again as his field of view became crowded with spikes, he needed a fresh amount of earth to work with. Once he got settled he spent a few moments first focusing himself, then returning focus to his chakra. Once an ample amout of chakra was prepared he would clap his hands and place them flat against the ground. His chakra would then begin pouring into the ground like it had many times before. He would manipulate it into four and then start drawing in and condensing the earth. As he did this he would start forming the four spikes, using his chakra control to increase the speed at which the ground was drawn in and condensed. The spikes would start to form faster and faster as he increased the speed.

When those spikes were formed he would waste no time to take a breather, pulling his arms back and focusing on moulding his chakra. When his chakra was adequately built up his hands would meet with a clap, then hit the floor immediately after. His chakra would then pour through his hands into the ground. This chakra would then split into four and focus into four points. Those points would then draw in and condense the earth as he immediately began forming the four spikes. The spikes would shoot out of the ground fast he he manipulated his chakra to draw in the earth and condense it down as fast as he possibly could. The four spikes would form in a second or two, completing the jutsu.* - Sun Nov 29 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: 32.3 - Sun Nov 29 02:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) would have been forming hand seals as she walked towards him. Just as he was about to execute a jutsu her fist would be punched straight into his stomach. The impact rocked him hard, knocking him a considerable distance back. He would fall to his knees and spit out a mass of blood and stomach fluids. He could barely look up at her from the amount of pain he was in, he was pretty sure that was the hardest he had ever been hit in his life. Currently he would just be on his knees, gasping for air as he spat up more blood and bile.* - Sun Nov 29 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) realised what was going on as she dipped a finger in his blood and tasted it, as she grabbed his head and lifted him up he would wince in pain a little before looking her square in the eye. He would spit a blotch of blood onto her coat. "A-and you're depraved." He would let out breathlessly.* - Sun Nov 29 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Depraved? - Sun Nov 29 02:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) is knocked out, probably falling to the floor unless caught.* - Sun Nov 29 02:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: What to do first.. - Sun Nov 29 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: I don't want to waste him all yet.. - Sun Nov 29 02:51:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) would wake up, arms and legs bound to a chair. He looked around, a little fuzzy and disorientated at first. Then he would see he was stripped down to his underwear. He bit his lip hard, drawing a little blood in the process. He'd look around for Baylea and once he saw her he'd give her a small smirk. "Y-You know, if you're into this kind of stuff you could have just asked...and bought me a drink first." He said this in a cocky and sarcastic tone, clearly to test her patience.* - Sun Nov 29 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Male. - Sun Nov 29 02:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Depends. - Sun Nov 29 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: You are testing my patience, male. - Sun Nov 29 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Which one is your dominant? - Sun Nov 29 02:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was currently full of fear, but he wouldn't show it, not to the likes of her. "D-Depends..." is all he would let out.* - Sun Nov 29 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I see. - Sun Nov 29 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: You will be my playmate for now. - Sun Nov 29 02:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: I wonder how loud their voices can reach.. - Sun Nov 29 03:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) grits his teeth and lets out a small moan in pain. His hand would grip the arm rest on the seat as he winced in pain. "F-Fuck..." is all he could let out as he looked down at his finger.* - Sun Nov 29 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Do you wish for a gag now? - Sun Nov 29 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) tried to look down at them through the blindfold slit, not being able to see much of anything.* - Sun Nov 29 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Or shall I continue? - Sun Nov 29 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Depends... - Sun Nov 29 03:03:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Be a great...playtoy... - Sun Nov 29 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Babe... - Sun Nov 29 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Mm? - Sun Nov 29 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) cries out a muffled cry as he grips the chair in pain again. "FUCK!" He would shout out before going into a bit of a laugh to try and take him mind off the pain. "I-I wish...I could see your body...babe..."* - Sun Nov 29 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I see. - Sun Nov 29 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: You are going to be a very fun toy. - Sun Nov 29 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I've learned some things after watching the villagers of different villages. - Sun Nov 29 03:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just you and me... - Sun Nov 29 03:07:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) shouts out a mix of 'fucks' and 'no's' as she continues to rip his nails off. He would start to shake the chair around as he body reacted to the pain. When she went near his genetalia his legs would close slightly at the thought of it. After he had stopped shouting and moaning in pain he would respond with, "I wouldn't...know about that vital point of the living...Y-You'd need to ask someone t-that's actually had sex...babe..." She would probably notice a small leak from either side of the blindfold as he had now started weeping a little.* - Sun Nov 29 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Ohh.. - Sun Nov 29 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to scream out in agonizing pain as each of his finger and toe nails were torn out one by one. The chair would rock and move as his body shook and tried to fight the pain. His wrists and ankles would strain, bruise and cut as he struggled in vain to get free. More tears would roll down his face as his audible screams turned inaudible. After it was finished his head would drop as he gasped for breath, he was starting to have one of his anxiety attacks that he got under stressful situations.

As she laughed to herself about what she was doing and made a comment about eating his finger his head would pop up, looking directly at her, or what he thought would be her direction anyway. He looked paniced and distraught but he still put a small smirk on. "I-If...you're getting p-pleasure from this...at...least let me...get some too...b-babe..." His head would then drop back down slightly again, showing his fatigue from all this pain.* - Sun Nov 29 03:32:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: You shinobi drink water. - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Heh, yeah. - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I shall get you some. - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sake might be nice too... - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Water. - Sun Nov 29 03:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) opened his mouth up, drinking the water at whatever rate she poured it down his throat. He'd probably choak a little in the process.* - Sun Nov 29 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Depends...which hand does the job better for you..? - Sun Nov 29 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Either. - Sun Nov 29 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Pick or I get both. - Sun Nov 29 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Sun Nov 29 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Probably my right. - Sun Nov 29 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That one just got fixed. - Sun Nov 29 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) lets out a mighty scream as his index finger was taken straight from his right hand. He would scream and scream until he ran out of breath, then he screamed some more. He sucked in a deep breath and began hyperventilating, his mind was in denial about what had just happened. As she took the blindfold off his eyes would dart down to the missing appendage, it was at this point he would start to crack. His panic attack would start to set in as his heart started going into overdrive. He shook and rocked the chair as he became irritated and detached from the world, not really aware of his surroundings anymore.

As he watched her devour his finger it only set him off further, his chest would be pushing back and forth violently as he struggled for breath in his pain induced panic attack. He shook his head, body, wrists and ankles, trying his best to get free and out of here. He didn't even register what she had said to him after, his body and mind being too far gone in the panic attack to register what was happening.* - Sun Nov 29 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Awe.. - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Can my playtoy not function anymore? - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) says: I'll just have one more bite, then I'll end your pain. - Sun Nov 29 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: Mmm...Juicy... - Sun Nov 29 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) started to panic even more as she licked at his eyeball, he screamed at the top of his voice as he sucked his eyeball straight out of his head, then as she bit down on whatever attachment it had to his head, his body and mind went into overdrive. He would shake around violently as his breathing became as audible as he screams. His left eye would roll back and show it's white. His body would seemingly go limp yet somehow it continued shaking, throwing his neck and head around in all directions. He was having a seizure.

At the same time his heart would probably be going a mile a minute, it was probably only a matter of time before he slipped into cardiac arrest.* - Sun Nov 29 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) probably wouldn't have even felt his throat get ripped out as he was in his unconcious seizure state. His body would react however, jumping to the pain while still shaking about violently. As she continued to feat upon him his body it would slowly start to shut down, first stopping shaking, then stopping moving. He would start to see white as his brain became devoid of oxygen, his organs now shutting down.

He would go limp in a mutilated and humilitated state, his death so quick that he didn't even have time to think about how his life had gone. If there was one thing he would have regretted, it would be that he never got to say goodbye to his friends and that he died so easily...just when he got his life back on track. Thus ends the story of Akira.* - Sun Nov 29 04:13:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) kept in the same position, not even opening his eyes as he states, "Bored."* - Sun Nov 29 16:30:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 29 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head.* - Sun Nov 29 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Begin. - Sun Nov 29 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) raises both fists up, taking a boxer like stance. His onyx eyes dead set on Angou. He didn't move an inch, simply stating, "Come."* - Sun Nov 29 16:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would take the kick to the knee, not even moving or flinching an inch. A small smirk would form on his face, hidden by his facemask. His body would arch back slightly before as he pulled his right arm and tightened his fist, the leather squeeking a little at how hard he was gripping his fist. His body would then arch forward to the right as he stepped his right leg forward. His arm and fist shot forward, aiming to punch Anguo straight in the face as hard as he could.* - Sun Nov 29 16:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: New Genin? - Sun Nov 29 17:09:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) thinks: He has a basic usage of fuinjutsu but even so, the technique used is advanced. Hmmm . . For a child, impressive. - Sun Nov 29 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would take the hit again, probably having his clothing cut in the process. He would use this time to help him land a solid strike on Anguo. His left foot would twist to help steady him. He would turn his body to the left and moved down a little, bending his knees. He would then spring his legs straight and push himself forward, pulling his left fist in and then punching it forward. He was aiming to drive it straight into Anguo's chest and hopefully knock the wind out of him.* - Sun Nov 29 17:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: .................. - Sun Nov 29 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) took in a breath as he cut the chakra flow to his feet. He would sink into the water, the fireball passing above him. He would then start to swim forward in an attempt to get closer to Anguo under the cover of the water.* - Sun Nov 29 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) started flowing chakra through his body again as he swam to the surface. His hands would emerge first, along with his body. He placed his hands on the water and used his chakra to keep himself up. He would then push himself up to his feet, looking around to where his opponent was. He let out a breath of air as he crossed his arms over his chest, closing his eyes briefly as he thought.

He would open his onyx eyes and turn to the right, facing Kana. "Done."* - Sun Nov 29 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) thinks: Huh... - Sun Nov 29 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turned on the spot again, half closing his eyes in an uninterested type of way. He wasn't here to help Anguo pass, he was just there to fight because he was bored. As he walked onto dry land he would simply state one word again. "Bored."* - Sun Nov 29 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 18:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) opens his eyes, turning his body slightly to look left and right. He let out a small sigh, bored as ever. "Boring."* - Sun Nov 29 18:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: We're going on a mission. - Sun Nov 29 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Where's the Mizukage? - Sun Nov 29 19:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Be sure to protect the place while we're off. - Sun Nov 29 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Urm. . Alright. - Sun Nov 29 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: So long as they don't tell them to buy them time to charge up some super attack which takes five minutes and by the time it hits five minutes I am already dead, then they have nothing to worry about. - Sun Nov 29 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: I mean, tell me. Damnit brain. - Sun Nov 29 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) glances over to Nori. <She probably can't even protect herself.> He would then glance over to Kana. "Ready."* - Sun Nov 29 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Alright. - Sun Nov 29 19:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would start to flow chakra to his legs and feet as Kana instructed. He would then wait until she had finished her preparation. As the water formed underneath them he would step onto it, using suimen to keep himself in place. As the dragon was formed he would be dragged along with it, not even being phased by it physically or emotionally. Inside he was quite impressed by the ninjutsu display, but he wasn't going to show such an emotion on the outside.

He folded his arms over his chest and walked forward, probably forming up behind Kana and Anguo. Once she had finished speaking and they had started moving, all he would reply with is, "Understood." He would look around for anyone he spotted, not seeing much other than who Anguo had engaged. <Interesting.>* - Sun Nov 29 20:25:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(Hezo Sezumi) thinks: But I don't think I'll be able to.. - Sun Nov 29 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) jumped off the water dragon as it plunged into Baylea, probably somewhere near Anguo. He stayed near him like he had been instructed to by Kana, as much as it annoyed him to do so. He would fold his arms over his chest again and keep on look out for people. He was half paying attention to the engagement between Kana and Baylea, he wondered how a person was managing to stay alive after having her legs cut off.* - Sun Nov 29 21:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) just stood there, staring at the naked, cut in half woman as she was burned and mutilated. He kept his arms folded his he shifted his onxy eyes from his surroundings and the woman. He would spot the red-head that was standing behind them, he took precaution to remember he was there but took no mind of him for now, in his mind if he was there to kill them...well they'd be dead already.

He would shift his gaze over to Kana. "Red-head to the south-east. Clear in all others." His tone sounding as bored and as dull as ever.* - Sun Nov 29 21:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks over to the top half of Baylea's body. He would grab her arm and start dragging it behind her. Walking over to her legs he would do the same, grabbing hold of one and dragging it behind him, probably leaving a large trail of blood behind him as he did. He would stop as he came close to Kana, body parts in toe. "Ready."* - Sun Nov 29 22:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns around, both parts of the body in toe. He would walk off, stopping off at the river. He would tie a few rocks around both the body parts before chucking each part into the river. He would wash his hands off returning moments later. Folding his arms across his chest he would glance over to Kana. "Done."* - Sun Nov 29 22:21:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks over to the side, unfolding his arms and balling his fists. He would raise his arms up boxer style. "Come."* - Sun Nov 29 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) begins his advance towards Kyubishu. He would move at an average pace. Once he was close enough his body would arch back slightly before being thrown forward, his foot going forward a step in an attempt to balance himself. Using said balance his body would then pivot forward and to the right as he swung his right fist straight at Kyubishu, aiming to punch him directly in the face.* - Sun Nov 29 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) was confident in his own bodies durability. He would take the punch Kyubishu had thrown at him directly to the face, the amount of damage done would be dependant on Kyubishu's abilities, if he could even damage him. As Ryo's fist collided with Kyubishu's face, he would follow up with a second punch, bringing his left fist down slightly before thrusting it directly at Kyubishu's face again. This punch was aimed directly as his chin in an attempt to disorientate him and knock him back/off balance.* - Sun Nov 29 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) stepped forward again, his footwork was very much like you would see from a boxer. Each foot following up his punches to make sure he was balanced as much as possible. His right arm would be pulled back, twisting as it did. He would then bring his right arm down and around before punching it back at Kyubishu again. His right fist would be aimed directly at his stomach.* - Mon Nov 30 00:00:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) was a little surprised by bones popping out of someones knee, though he wouldn't show such surprise on his face it did still intrigue him. His hand would probably be knocked away by the knee but it was not impaled on the bone. Instead he would use this time to pull his left arm back. His left arm would then swing in a wide arc, it's target was Kyubhishu's knee. Should this punch connect, he would have effectively haymakered his knee with all his strength.* - Mon Nov 30 00:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) had no fear. He continued with his punch, clashing his fist straight into Kyubishu's. All that was left now was to see the aftermath of their two punches connecting.* - Mon Nov 30 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) shook his hand off after he had probably broken Kyubishu's weird bone with his fist. He would probably watch as Kyubishu left for the hospital or to go home. He would swivel his shoulders slightly, a small crack being emmited from both as he stretched them out. He would then make his way over to Anguo's side, folding his arms over his chest as he stood by him. "Interesting." is all he would say, as usual his speech consisted of one to three words at most.* - Mon Nov 30 00:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hey, Yumiko.~ - Mon Nov 30 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) opens his eyes and glances around to Yumiko, sizing her up. He would turn back a few moments later, closing his eyes again.* - Mon Nov 30 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hi.~ - Mon Nov 30 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: This place is boring, no one strong to fight. - Mon Nov 30 01:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Bored. - Mon Nov 30 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yep. - Mon Nov 30 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Shockingly it's been quiet. - Mon Nov 30 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. It has. Heard any word of the Mizukage lately? - Mon Nov 30 03:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He's dead. - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
