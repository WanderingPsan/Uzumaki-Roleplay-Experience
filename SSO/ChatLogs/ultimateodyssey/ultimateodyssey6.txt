<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks around himself, he didn't see Koji around and once again Marrisa is no where to be seen. As he thinks back on what he saw his hands start to shake, along with his body. He was 15 and that was the third body he had seen in two weeks, he came to Suna to get away from all that. He started to feel like it was just him, he was cursed with bad luck. He felt unsafe here now again, especially after being named a suspect too. He spotted Rias and as much as he didn't want to stand next to her, she was the only one he trusted right now.

He moved next to her and didn't say another, pulling out a pack of smokes and a lighter. His hands were visibly shaking and it took him some time to light the cigarette. He took a long drag of it and exhaled, his breath also sounding shaking. For the moment he didn't say anything, his mind was on other things.* - Sun Nov 15 02:53:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to squeeze Rias's hand even tighter as he stared on over at the body, it didn't matter if it was covered up from public view since he had already seen the state of the body. He really wished he could smoke right now.* - Sun Nov 15 03:09:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Just pick up the body together straight up and then set it down into the bag and zip it up, if you have other things to do, Aza can carry the body easily enough. - Sun Nov 15 03:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: That technique especially. - Sun Nov 15 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Took out a scroll and kunai, the scroll was the usual one he trained with when he trained his fuuinjutsunot that he had much else to train. In any case he wanted a little warm up first since he hadn't trained this in a while and it was good to have warm up anyway. He set the scroll out on the floor as he sat down, putting the kunai in the middle of the seal on the scroll. He would then form the ram hand seal to help him focus his chakra as he built it up, staying silent and still as he did. When he was ready he went through a few hand seals and slapped his hand onto the ground, kneading his chakra from his hand, into the scroll and seal. The seal would then react, causing a puff of smoke. Once the smoke had cleared the kunai would be gone, having been sealed into the scroll.

He would unseal the kunai, preparing it and the scroll for further use. Once everything was prepared he would form the ram hand seal again to help his concentrate and focus his chakra. As he did this he went over the last bit of training that he did in his head. He remembered he was trying to refine his chakra use, he figured he might as well continue with that. With that in mind he went through a few hand seals and placed a hand on the ground again, pouring his chakra into his hand and then kneading it through the ground and into the scroll. The seal and kunai would then react to his chakra, sealing the kunai away again.

He proceeded with another few hand seals, unsealing the kunai from the scroll. After the smoke had cleared he would readjust everything and make sure it was all prepared again for his next practise. Once everything was proper he sat up, straightening his back. He began moulding up chakra, using the ram hand seal like before to help himself focus and refine his chakra. Within a few moments he slapped his hand onto the ground and began sending his chakra through the ground, kneading it through the scroll and into the seal. As he kneaded his chakra he concentrated on it, refining his use of it to make it efficient and effective as possible. With that the kunai would be sealed away again, marking the end of the technique.

For a fourth time he would unseal the kunai, it was kind of repetitive to him but he liked watching it be sealed and unsealed. He would form his hands together into the ram hand seal just as he did before, helping him build up his chakra quickly and efficiently. Once he was ready to go he would zip through a few hand seals and slap his hand on the ground, sending his chakra through his hand and into the seal. He would refine the chakra he expelled from his body and how he made it react with the seal, taking his time to go through this process. Once it was done the seal would react and seal the kunai inside it, a small puff of smoke accompanying such an action.

After the smoke cleared he would unseal the kunai and put it away, taking out a shuriken to practise with instead just so he could familiarise himself with sealing different things. He placed the shuriken on the seal and then began building up chakra to use with the technique. After a few moments of silence had passed he would bring each hand up and form a few hand seals before slapping a hand down onto the ground. His chakra would then surge from his hand and into the ground, being kneaded into the scroll and seal. He concentrated as he kneaded his chakra to react with the seal, trying to make sure he was doing everything to the best of his ability. With that the shuriken would be sealed away, ending the sealing process.

He gave himself a few seconds to recover from chakra loss and chakra fatigue before unsealing the shuriken and preparing it to be sealed again. Once everything was ready he would hold up a half ram hand seal to help his focus and refine his chakra as he moulded it within his body. After a few moments he would then bring up his other hand and form a few hand seals, slamming a single hand on the ground after he did. His chakra would then go through the ground and into the scroll. He concentrated on his chakra as he kneaded it into the seal to activate it, taking his time with it so he could refine how he used his chakra with seals. Once the shuriken was sealed away he would roll the scroll up and put it away, walking off afterwards.* - Sun Nov 15 04:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Um...I just need to talk to you privately...doesn't really matter where... - Sun Nov 15 11:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Guessing you probably don't want the ramen guy to hear then. Let's go to my office at the hospital. - Sun Nov 15 11:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) stumbles around the room a little, eventually finding the bed. He turns and sits down, hitting the bed quite hard, being a doctor she would probably notice he was drunk. The smell of cigarettes and alcohol would soon start permeating the room. As he sat down both his arms rested on each leg, his hands still visibly shaking, even his body was shaking quite a bit. He looked across to Kiyoko, "I..." was all he said before looking at the ground, unsure on how to start.* - Sun Nov 15 11:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So I just...started all this. - Sun Nov 15 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It was harder in konoha because of the legal age but...its easier here... - Sun Nov 15 11:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just need you to give me something to help me stop...then i'll be ok... - Sun Nov 15 11:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well hun.... - Sun Nov 15 11:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But as for the drinking? - Sun Nov 15 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: That's going to be harder. - Sun Nov 15 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We don't have anything for that. - Sun Nov 15 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: You just have to have the willpower. - Sun Nov 15 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Even the patch is just an aid, you have to -want- to stop. - Sun Nov 15 11:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: But if you are here that means you do. - Sun Nov 15 11:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Lera helps me train so I can't smoke. - Sun Nov 15 11:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So do you want to stop then? Or did she make you come here. - Sun Nov 15 11:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And...I don't want Rias to see me like this... - Sun Nov 15 11:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thats the main reason why i'm here... - Sun Nov 15 11:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Rias? - Sun Nov 15 11:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: And I saw holding hands with Tetsumi... literally in front of this boy. - Sun Nov 15 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you need to make a choice, -you-, not anyone else. - Sun Nov 15 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Do you want to make a change. - Sun Nov 15 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not sure... - Sun Nov 15 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The smoking takes the shakes away... - Sun Nov 15 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Why do you get the shakes? - Sun Nov 15 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And the drinking keeps me away until I pass out... - Sun Nov 15 11:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't know...I guess i'm scared... - Sun Nov 15 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Scared of what? - Sun Nov 15 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks away from Kiyoko, again not sure how to answer...or maybe he just didn't want to.* - Sun Nov 15 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Take your time. - Sun Nov 15 11:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm scared...of myself... - Sun Nov 15 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then does that mean you want to change? - Sun Nov 15 11:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yes...but i'm not sure how. - Sun Nov 15 11:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: This never used to be this bad until a few weeks ago... - Sun Nov 15 11:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just don't know how to take the nightmares away without the drink... - Sun Nov 15 11:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) held out a shakey hand, moving forward to take the box. He stopped and hesitated for a few seconds before taking hold of it, opening it and then applying one of the patches to his arm.* - Sun Nov 15 11:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I uh...I can't... - Sun Nov 15 11:46:59 2015
