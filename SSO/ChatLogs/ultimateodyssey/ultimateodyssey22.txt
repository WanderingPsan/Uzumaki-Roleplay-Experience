<br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wait. - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, or the new Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...What do you mean he's dead? - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What happened? - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Lou died. - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Liu* - Mon Nov 30 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Do I have to ask again..? - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What happened? - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: We went on a mission to Konoha. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tried to harass a woman. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ended up punching a defense mechanism type of thing. - Mon Nov 30 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: And it broke into shard and pierced him all over his body. - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ... - Mon Nov 30 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What was the mission about? Why were there no guards brought with him? - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Because to be frank, he was being stupid. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: No offense. - Mon Nov 30 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Suicidal coot. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Who's this 'new mizukage'? - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Don't know. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Never seen 'em. - Mon Nov 30 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Are you sure the spot has been even filled? - Mon Nov 30 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Not too sure. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Just a rumor I heard. - Mon Nov 30 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: And the power vacuum starts again. There are only two candidates Liu would have in mind. - Mon Nov 30 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I cou - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I wouldn't have been able to react fast enough to pull him out before the shars got him. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then again, it was only a jutsu used to defend the woman, not harm the Godaime. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He decided to punch through it, and then the crystals shattered. - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: *sigh* - Mon Nov 30 03:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...Crystal? Was the one who used said technique - did they have purple hair? - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If I recall correctly, yes. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: I was just thinking the samething. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I think he was originally from this village as well. - Mon Nov 30 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If it's that person he wasn't originally from Kirigakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He's from Konohagakure. - Mon Nov 30 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He did reside here at one point or another, correct? - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: It's odd. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Liu offered him a transfer to the village on temporary probation. - Mon Nov 30 03:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He lost a fight and was criticized for his fighting style. Reacting negatively he stormed off - he was thereafter exiled from the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I see... - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: From the sounds of that he made a new technique, however. Finally took the advice I gave him to heart..in order to kill the Mizukage. - Mon Nov 30 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Though I must say. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It seems as if that man never meant to kill Lord Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Liu put himself in that situation. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: That's much easier to say than Lord Liu, or Lord Mizukage, or the Godaime. But that's disrespectful. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Regardless I should have killed him. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lord Liu, excuse me. - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Why do you say that? - Mon Nov 30 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Because if I did then it might not have happen and he might be alive today. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The thing is, Yumiko, it's not quite Abraxes's fault. - Mon Nov 30 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Besides - Liu was unfit for the job. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori can attest to that. - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A few months prior he handed us his hat and mentioned he was going to 'walk off into the woods and die.' - Mon Nov 30 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And then there is the matter of how he became Mizukage to begin with. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I still can't believe it though. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He tells me to scout Konohagakure, and get a "feel" for it. - Mon Nov 30 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A feel for it? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Was he..intending to attack Konoha? - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Then he transforms into me, and waltzes right into the villages, trying to feel a woman's knockers. - Mon Nov 30 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah, like the type of people, the environment. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's presence, whatever you may call it. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: He was -very- unfit. - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: To think he made -me- his "bodyguard." - Mon Nov 30 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I'm too weak for that type of stuff. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: ...I see. - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Regardless of how unfit he was, he at least prepared for the future.  - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I guess... - Mon Nov 30 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fighting over who the Mizukage is won't be necessary. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: There are two candidates. One of which is the captain of the general military of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How come? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ah. - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The other? - Mon Nov 30 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: The other is the captain of the binding and genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The other is the captain of the binding and the genjutsu corps. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The two highest ranks made by the Mizukage before his death. - Mon Nov 30 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How will either of them be chosen? - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: More by whomever fully chooses the title than anything.  - Mon Nov 30 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: After that - well it depends on various other factors.  - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I predict it will go to the military captain - Kana. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Kana, I've heard of her. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: The name sounds familiar. - Mon Nov 30 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's a chunnin of the village. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: A strong fighter too. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I imagine she is, at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov 30 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: She might be able to teach me a trick or two. - Mon Nov 30 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: From Chuunin, to Captain of the General Military, to Mizukage? - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's quite the jump. - Mon Nov 30 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Not nearly as large of a jump as some kages in the past. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Including Liu. - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Where did he start? - Mon Nov 30 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Fresh from the academy basically. - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: What!? - Mon Nov 30 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Tha-That's crazy. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Kirigakure has not been in strong straits for the last couple of months.. - Mon Nov 30 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I doubt Liu made much of an announcement of my rank. Beyond Yumiko and Nori at least. - Mon Nov 30 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That, I know. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: It's about time that we fix it, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. The people in Kiri deserve better than what we've had. - Mon Nov 30 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Agreed. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Tengoku, right? - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You are correct. - Mon Nov 30 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Heiwa? - Mon Nov 30 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Wait, I'm probably wrong. - Mon Nov 30 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hewai? - Mon Nov 30 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That sounds right. - Mon Nov 30 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: You had it right the first time. - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Oi, that's embarrassing.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Excuse me, Heiwa. - Mon Nov 30 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'm bad with names.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Nick names are best for that then. - Mon Nov 30 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Right Tenny?~ - Mon Nov 30 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Yeah--Yumi!~ - Mon Nov 30 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Oi.~ - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Someone's woken up from a slumber. - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Morning. . .Or night. . I forget..  - Mon Nov 30 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: How was your sleep? - Mon Nov 30 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Good! Was tired. - Mon Nov 30 04:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Tenny? Yumi? - Mon Nov 30 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Awesome! - Mon Nov 30 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Up late researching again, Nori? - Mon Nov 30 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Researching? - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Yeah. . Sure. . - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Research. .  - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: That's what I've been doing. - Mon Nov 30 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ..? - Mon Nov 30 04:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Nori is a medic. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: She's often up late studying plants and herbs. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Or chaining herself up.. - Mon Nov 30 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Or doing both.~ *omit* - Mon Nov 30 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's pretty cool. - Mon Nov 30 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've got to admit, Nori, I thought you were training to be an expert in chained weapons. - Mon Nov 30 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Or rather, chains in general. - Mon Nov 30 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hmmm .. I should try containment after medical works, to be honest. . - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Containment?  - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Fuuinjutsu. Sealing stuff. - Mon Nov 30 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) thinks: Then after being full on white mage I could go and get some offense stuff. - Mon Nov 30 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hrm, I might detach from my scouting ways for a brief period. - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Possibly learn some new things. - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. You're a scout?  - Mon Nov 30 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He's better at shunshin than me. - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Really?  - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How much better? - Mon Nov 30 04:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: He's faster than me and doesn't get disoriented. - Mon Nov 30 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I fell in the water once. - Mon Nov 30 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I see - fell in the water? - Mon Nov 30 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov 30 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: What water? - Mon Nov 30 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Someone went a bit to far with their shunshin and an accident happen. - Mon Nov 30 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Ah - she's still having trouble with it? - Mon Nov 30 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: I was .. tired at the time. - Mon Nov 30 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) whispers: Nommy. - Mon Nov 30 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Anyway, yeah. I'm a scout. - Mon Nov 30 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That's probably the only thing I'm good at. - Mon Nov 30 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: How good are you at it? - Mon Nov 30 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Depends. - Mon Nov 30 05:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would have done his usual when someone was aiming to use any sort of Taijutsu on him, he stood there and took it. The chop to his throat knocked his head down a little and pushed him back. The elbow to his face would then make him stumble back a few steps. As his recovered his onyx eyes flicked to Kana, giving her a fierce look. His nostrils flare as he inhaled a deep breath to compensate for the throat strike.

His fists would clentch and raise up, forming up into a boxer like stance. His eyes would dead set on Kana, searching every part of her body for a place to strike. His fists clentched tighter, handwraps squeeking a little. His eyes would then dull a little, his fists dropping instantly. He took in another deep breath through his nose, building up phlegm at the back of his throat. He coughed a little and then turned his head to the side, spitting onto the ground to clear his throat.

He continued to stare at Kana, though his gaze was less fierce now. She would notice that while her hits knocked him back, he was not visibly damaged. "Interesting."* - Mon Nov 30 21:23:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) braces himself for impact, immediately he was swept away by the water as it crashed against his body. He was taken off his feet, being knocked about against the floor as the water carried him away. By the time the water passed him he would be behind Anguo, face down against the floor. He struggled to his feet as he gripped his hands tightly into two fists. He gritted his teeth slightly as he glared over to Kana. <I'm weak...> He thought, disappointed in his own performance.

He glanced at each person in the area, gauging their reaction to him being knocked about so easily, probably making him more annoyed in the process. He stepped forward slightly as she taunted everyone in the area to annoy her further. He stopped in his tracks though, knowing it wasn't worth it in the long run. "Apologies." is all he would say.* - Mon Nov 30 22:05:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sits on the ground again, a little blood present within it. He would start walking forward, directly at Kana. He was still staring at her, onyx eyes looking fierce once again. As he got close his eyes would dull down and he would cross his arms over his chest, turning to his right as he did. He would move over to the wall of the building and lean his back against it, half closing his eyes as he became disinterested in what was happening again.* - Mon Nov 30 22:24:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) opens his eyes and unfolds his arms. He would begin walking off without saying a word as to where he was going.* - Mon Nov 30 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks through the village, heading north to the waterfall area as it was his and probably many others place to go when they wanted to train. He balls both hands into fists as he walks, annoyed at his own display of weakness infront of the Mizukage. He was annoyed at how easily he had been knocked over, how easily he had been injured, even if she did have to resort to ninjutsu. As he got to the waterfall he would walk around the edge of the water, all the way over to the watefall itelf. He looked up at the rocky mass, then focused on the wall dead ahead of himself. He stared at the wall and remembered the pain and embarrasment the Mizukage had caused him, as well as his own weakness. In a fit of anger he threw his right fist forward, punching the wall as hard as he could. "Weak..." He stated.

He retracted his right fist and brought up his left, punching that into the surface of the rock too. "Weak..." He would state again in his usual robotic voice, though emotion was starting to shine through. His face was now showing anger which was uncommon for him, in fact it was uncommon for him to show any emotion really. He retracted his left fist and brought his right fist up, "I am..." He said before punching the wall with his right fist again. "Weak..." He would say as his wrapped up fist hit the wall. He would then retract his fist and follow suit with his left once again. As his fist hit the wall he would say "Weak." Once more.

He continued on like this for a while, his eyes set dead center of where he was punching. Each time his fist hit the wall he would say 'weak' to remind himself off his weakness. The punches were quite slow at first because he was hitting the wall as hard as he could but with time he would start to pick up the pace. After the first few minutes, small patches of red would grow on his handwraps, indicating that his continued abuse of the wall with his fists was now causing him pain and injury, yet still he went on, punching over and over. A few more minutes of straight punching would go by as he worked up a sweat. Two small blood smudges would form on the stone wall, both where he had been punching.

His hand wraps would started to get quite wet with blood now as he continued to assault the wall with punch after punch. He continued to state the same word over and over as he punched the wall, not slipping up a single time. As he continued on his hand would start to pain him quite a bit, eah time his knuckle hit the wall his eyes would twitch and his face would visibly wince in pain. The wall would start to gain a large formation of blood smudged as he punched the wall with bloodied fists. Pained, bleeding and injured you think he would give up...yet he continued to punch the wall while saying, "Weak" Each time. His punches started to slow as fatigue and pain took over, determination, anger and frustration would continue to spur him on still.

It would be clear he was coming to the end of his punches as the had slowed significantly by now. The whole knuckle wrappings and part of the hand wrapping would now be pretty much soiled in blood, as well as the wall showing a thick mass of blood smudges from each time he punched with a bloodied fist. His last few punches were considerable tired and weak, one could see that fatigue and pain had taken over at this point. His last two punches found him leaning against the wall on his fists which must have been painful considering the blood and the amount of times he had punched the wall. He took in a deep breath and pushed off the wall his with knuckles, letting his arms fall heavy at his sides. His hands were shaking from the pain.

He turned and saw Tengoku staring at him as he did this, it angered him quite a bit since he didn't like to be observed as he trained, part of the reason why he also didn't want to be in a squad. He stopped and stared at Tengoku for a moment or two before carrying on, not even bothering to speak to him or recognie him as he walked on past.* - Tue Dec  1 00:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turned his head slightly as Tengoku spoke but it wouldn't stop his movement. After Tengoku had finished speaking his head would returned to a forward position as he continued walking on. He said nothing in return to Tengoku, quiet as usual.* - Tue Dec  1 00:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks up to Kana, she would probably notice both his handwraps were bloodied and occasionally dripped a small drop of blood. His face also showed a little more emotion than usual, namely anger and annoyance. "Medic."* - Tue Dec  1 00:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Good, you're learning. - Tue Dec  1 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I still need a medic. - Tue Dec  1 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs a little. He would bring his right hand up to his face, it was noticably shaking and spasming from the pain. He bit into the handwraps on his hand and pulled, ripping a few of them away. He swiveled his hand as the handwraps unwrapped and fell to the floor, he would do the same to his left hand too. He looked over each hand, they were both bruised, grazed and cut up from the amount of times he punched the wall over and over. He would reach a hand behind himself and push it into his backpouch, grabbing new handwraps as best he could.

His hands would continue to shake as he tried to wrap both his hands, yet he found himself unable to get a proper grip on the bandages as they were. Eventually they slipped from his hand and hit the floor with his other handwraps. He sighed and looked up at Kana, then to the handwraps. He picked the fresh ones up as bet he could and shoved them back into his backpouch, leaving the dirty ones on the floor.

He just sort of stood there staring at his hands, wondering how he was going to treat them. Not only could he not grip his bandages, he was also pretty horrible with first-aid.* - Tue Dec  1 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'll just leave them as is, they'll probably heal. - Tue Dec  1 00:44:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm. Thank you. My squad is overlooking 'Sekitsui, Nori, and Geo Dude' right? - Tue Dec  1 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why are children my age overseeing squads? Illogical. - Tue Dec  1 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I don't know the profession of Miss Sekitsui, but I do know Geo Dude's. A taijutsu - and from the look of his stature a taijutsu specialist focused on hard hitting. - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Taijutsu.~ - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Blunt impact damage - a different style than my own. Which, in itself, is also weak. - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: He called taijutsu weak! - Tue Dec  1 01:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yes? - Tue Dec  1 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Squads are suppose to have different skills, which would help in completing missions. - Tue Dec  1 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: I realize, but they're also meant to synergize. - Tue Dec  1 01:06:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And not be too cumbersome. - Tue Dec  1 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It's also intended to be a learning experience. I'm already overseeing some of the training of Nori and Yumiko. They will likely be coming to me for aid more than to their squad leader. - Tue Dec  1 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: And I presume Geo Dude will be going to members of Anguo's squad more for aid than to me. - Tue Dec  1 01:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Guess I won't be interacting with my squad at all. - Tue Dec  1 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It'll take at least a month for any sort of 'grouping' to happen.  - Tue Dec  1 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Squads reduce your own efficiency. - Tue Dec  1 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: In which case the switch may already come interrupting that. - Tue Dec  1 01:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks up to Kana, stopping a short distance away from. He folded his arms over his chest, she would notice his handwraps would be re-applied and not soiled with blood this time. "Mizukage. Speak. Private."* - Tue Dec  1 17:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: That's the Mizukage? - Tue Dec  1 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mikaelson, Mystic(Mammon Monomyth) says: So she is Kana? - Tue Dec  1 17:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns on the spot, taking his attention away from the Mizukage. "Later."* - Tue Dec  1 17:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) glances over to Kana. "Soldier. Not boy. Speak. Private."* - Tue Dec  1 18:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) stays on his feet instead of sitting down, he would move the middle seat to the side with his foot so he could step forward. "Apologies." is all he would say, instantly going back to his one worded ways.* - Tue Dec  1 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) has a small eyes twitch. "Soldier...Apologies for disobedience."* - Tue Dec  1 18:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Is that all, we can leave the situation behind us? - Tue Dec  1 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yes. - Tue Dec  1 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) follows.* - Tue Dec  1 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: It's too quiet. - Tue Dec  1 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Ryo. - Tue Dec  1 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: I want you to spar Geo Dude. - Tue Dec  1 19:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) unflods his arms and opens his eyes. He walks towards Kana, then turns as he gets in line with Geo dude. Once he was within distance to him he would make two fists and hold them up, near his upper body and face. "Come."* - Tue Dec  1 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Huh? - Tue Dec  1 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to walk forward, quickly speeding up into a run. As he got within punching range his left foot would extend forward and hit the ground hard, it would be used for balance. His body would then pivot forward slightly and tilt to the left. He brought his right fist back, then threw it forward as his body tilted from left to right, putting power behind his punch. His fist was aimed directly at Geo Dudes face.* - Tue Dec  1 20:09:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) stops dead in his tracks as his fist connects with Geo Dude, he knew he did no damage simply from the fact that his fist had been met and stopped so easily. He tenses his midsection as he notices a kick being brought up to his side. It would connect, causing him to wretch slightly, though it wouldn't knock the wind from him because of his trained body there would be bruising all around that area for quite a while. He would shake his head a little and attempt to throw his left fist into Geo dude, only to notice the knee coming his way.

The second kick would connect to him, knocking him into the air. He probably would barely notice Geo Dude come up behind him and even a he did notice, it wouldn't do him any good as he couldn't very well counter attack while mid-air.* - Tue Dec  1 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) couldn't help but let it all happen, his arms would be grabbed and they would start spinning in a barrel roll like motion. He would then be kicked off of, pushing his faster towards the ground. He would bring both arms up and hold them infront his face and upper body, using them as a shield. As he got quite close to the ground he would feel a foot press againt his back, slamming him into the ground hard. As he hit the ground he would cough out some blood onto the ground and his arms, signifying that he was indeed quite hurt.

He would lay there for a while as both his mind and boy recovered, not even the Mizukage had hit him that hard, infact this stupid looking person was probably the first person to cause such damage to him. He grew angry at his own weakness, he was weaker, less skilled and slower than this person in everyway. He coughed out again, spitting out a little more blood. He would then slowly get to his feet and turn away from his opponent. "Done." Is all he would say as he walked off towards the wall of the building.

He hobbled slightly from the back and side pain, breathing was a little hard too. He placed his back against the wall of the building and slowly slid down to a sit. He looked each arm over, both seeming to be bleeding slightly as he used them to cushion the impact. <Weak...> He thought to himself as he sat there in silence.* - Tue Dec  1 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Why not? - Tue Dec  1 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Pointless. - Tue Dec  1 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: What is pointless? Sparring me? - Tue Dec  1 20:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yes. - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Why would you feel that way? - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Weak. - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Who? Me? I wasn't even fighting at full power... - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Me. - Tue Dec  1 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: ...That's why you should spar me..To get stronger. - Tue Dec  1 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: I could even help you. You fight similarly to me..So I'm sure I could give you some pointers. - Tue Dec  1 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Tue Dec  1 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't need help. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You clearly do if you think -I'm- too strong. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sparring someone that outmatches me doesn't make me stronger, it makes me weaker. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just need to train harder. - Tue Dec  1 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Hmm..Unless you can break your limits you'll never be on par with me....You think you can fight without assistance...You'll never defeat me that way. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You need allies to grow. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I do not. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Whatever you say... - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Allies make you weak, they make you rely on them. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you have to rely on them, you can't rely on yourself. - Tue Dec  1 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: That's so backwards.... - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You've clearly been hurt in the past..I'm sorry. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If that happens, you're weak. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Well you're alone and weak. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: What's your excuse? - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I haven't trained enough. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I like being alone. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: A spar -is- training. - Tue Dec  1 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It isn't. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: It is though...I fought you wearing weights the entire time....Had I fought you with them off. The fight would have been much shorter. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Exactly, that isn't training. - Tue Dec  1 21:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But I fought you -with- weights. So that I can increase my speed and stamina. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: If you train with weights on...You get stronger. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't have anyway. - Tue Dec  1 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: You can get them in the training area. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Inside the academy. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Whatever, I'll train the way I want to train. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't need you or anyone else. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Very well...Would you like to see the results of my training? That is..Training the way I train? I don't intend on causing you distress...But I'd really like to show you the benefits of it... - Tue Dec  1 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. Go away. - Tue Dec  1 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: Very Well. Where is Lady Mizukage? - Tue Dec  1 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Gone. - Tue Dec  1 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) glances to his right, noticing a black german shepard puppy sitting in place. While he wasn't too fond of people, he didn't mind animals all that much, infact he liked animals a lot. He found they weren't as stupid or annoying as humans for the most part, simply lovable.

He would extend his right arm out, holding his right hands wrapped palm to the dog. He flicked his fingers a little to coax it over, wondering whether it would come over or not. Should it come closer, he would hold his hand still as to not frighten the puppy.* - Tue Dec  1 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Sure. - Tue Dec  1 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You can begin. - Tue Dec  1 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) extended his hand out a little further ever so slowly as the puppy got a little closer. As it sniffed at his hand it would probably smell a faint mix of sweat and blood since he had just sparred. Once his hand was close enough to the dog he would attempt to use two or three fingers to lightly scratch the fur under its mouth region. Should that attempt at first physical contact be successful, he would bring his hand around the puppies head and stroke the puppy from its ear to his neck, repeating this stroke a few times should the puppy let him.* - Tue Dec  1 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) continued to stroke the puppies head. As he did he would pull his face mask down and smile faintly at the dog in an attempt to look friendly...even if he did have his own blood smudged against his face slightly in the process. He would then bring his other hand down to the puppies head too, now stroking either side of it's head with both hands in unison. He would stop stroking his head and instead started to lightly ruffle it's fur from side to side, probably shaking it a little in the process.

He did that for a second or two before going back to stroking it. He would pull one hand away and pat the puppies back lightly, ruffling its fur further. "You got any friends either?"* - Tue Dec  1 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) pats the puppies belly lightly before giving it a rub with his right hand. He would alternate between belly rubs and light scratches as he looked up and listened to Meinu as she spoke. "Oh...I see...Sorry if I did something wrong, I just like dogs." He replied, unusually lengthy with his response. He continued to rub at the dogs belly during and after he spoke.* - Tue Dec  1 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) eased up on the affection he was giving puppy, opting for long and slow belly strokes as it neared sleep, he seemed to have a good understanding of animals which might seem weird considering his horrible teamwork and social skills. He looked to Meinu again as she continued reading her book, something clicking in his brain as he did. "My apologies for before...I shouldn't threaten comrades..." He spoke in a rather calm manner, almost a polar opposite of what people would be used to from him, it seemed the puppy was having the same effect on him as he was on it.* - Tue Dec  1 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) slowly grinds down the pace of his strokes, simply resting his hand on the belly of the puppy lightly. "I only apologize when i'm in the wrong, as it stands I let my anger get the best of me and lashed out because of it. That is why I apologi-" He coughs hard, spitting out a little blood onto himself, the floor and his lips. His hand that resided on the belly of the puppy was jolted as he coughed, potentially waking him up. With his free hand he would wipe his mouth, smearing a small amount of blood onto his handwraps. "Apologize...Sorry about that." He said, finishing his sentence.* - Tue Dec  1 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked down at the blood he wiped onto his wrappings, shaking his head a little. "I'll be fine, doctors have more important things to take care of." He would let his left arm drop into his lap, extending his right out towards the puppy again. He would attempt to stroke its head lightly again, "Sorry little guy."* - Tue Dec  1 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ...W-What?! - Tue Dec  1 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: You have the nerve to come back here, Ichiro?! - Tue Dec  1 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head again. "Theres no ne-" He would stop mid sentence as he heard and saw the puppies concern for him, something he had never really seen from a dog before. With a sigh he gave the puppy one last stroke before standing up and dusting himself off. "Fine. I'll be back in a little while." He replied, sounding a little less than impressed he was being forced to go to the hospital.

He would tart walking off slowly, exiting the courtyard area as quickly as he could. He started to hobble as he went out of sight of the others, the pain setting in. He grunted a little as he hobbled all the way to the hospital, practically stumbling through the doors of the place. Much to his annoyance he had nurses all over him, carrying him to a wheelchair and then wheeling him on over to a doctor.

The doctor examined him over, particularly his side and back. He would apply basic medical ninjutsu to his side, easing up the pain and bruising. He then examined his back, noticed someone was slightly irregular. He would stretch his back out while applying pressure to the area. With a small click his back would almost instantly feel better. The doctor would then apply basic medical ninjutsu to that area too, easing up the pain and bruising by a small amount. The doctor then confirmed he didn't have internal bleeding, the area around his lungs was merely bruised, causing the coughing and small amount of blood.

Being that he was a child, the doctor would not administer any pain relief...that and he had refused it. He would however wrap his side and back up, even re-wrapping his handwraps for him as a gesture of kindness, much to Ryo's annoyance. The doctor told him no sparring for now, but light training would be ok. With a heavy sigh he left the hospital, annoyed that hus weakness had caused this. He would return to the courtyard and sit back down next to the puppy, giving it a stroke again. He didn't say anything this time, he was still annoyed with his lack of strength.* - Tue Dec  1 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Get it all sorted? - Tue Dec  1 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...it's all fine. - Tue Dec  1 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls the puppy in closer to himself as it tries to snuggle up to him. He would repeat his previous affection of it, giving it long and slow strokes from it's head and down to his back. "What's his name?"* - Tue Dec  1 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: Makkuro. - Tue Dec  1 22:57:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: He's a puppy still so he misbehaves sometimes but not often. - Tue Dec  1 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to lightly scratch the puppies ears. "I guess that's only normal though."* - Tue Dec  1 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks up to Geo, "I don't care. Don't be sorry."* - Tue Dec  1 23:08:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs at two things, one Geo was annoying him and two, his animal company had gone. He sat back a little and sighed again. "Why is everyone here strange." he asked rhetorically.* - Tue Dec  1 23:49:45 2015
