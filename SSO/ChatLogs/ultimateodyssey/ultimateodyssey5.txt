<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks around, noticing Rias and Tetsumi together once again. He gritted his teeth somewhat, cutting into the filter of his cigarette. The fag was burnt out mostly anyway so he spat it into the sand and stood on it, putting it out. He would pull out another and light it, inhaling and then exhaling a puff of smoke. He watched Lera walk away, another oppertunity for training he had missed. As he started to walk away he took one last look at Rias and Tetsumi before shrugging his shoulders, he was done. * - Sat Nov 14 08:56:44 2015

He sighed and took it out, placing the fag in his mouth and the pack in the bin. He lights the fag and takes a short drag of it, wanting to savour his last one. He looked around and saw a few people he didn't see. Once he was done looking around he slouched over in his seat and lowers he head, not really wanting to be seen.* - Sat Nov 14 09:24:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thats a little hard to understand at times. - Sat Nov 14 19:44:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A generic interpretation and correct yes. - Sat Nov 14 19:46:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So I guess I haven't really grasped that yet. - Sat Nov 14 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: When it comes right down to it. Doton is the ability to manipulate entities tied to the earth. If you take it as an abstract, then you can even manipulate gravity. - Sat Nov 14 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That manipulation works both ways... - Sat Nov 14 19:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So as you see. Doton is one of the freeist elements. - Sat Nov 14 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Above it has diversity and...in my opinion, can do much more than any other element. - Sat Nov 14 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, I like it more than the others. - Sat Nov 14 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think it's more diverse. - Sat Nov 14 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Right. We'll start with a common technique. Common but useful. - Sat Nov 14 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm, Alright. - Sat Nov 14 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) stands up from his crudely made seat, dusting himself off. He had seen this technique before so it shouldn't be too hard right? He formed the ram hand seal to help focus his chakra as he began moulding it up. He didn't see Lera form any hand seals which was a bonus in his mind. As he built his chakra up he focused on what Lera had taught him, remembering that doton is diverse, both free flowing and solid. He started migrating his chakra down his legs, kneading it through his feet and into the ground. He stood there for a few seconds, concentrating as hard as he could. He softened the ground up a little but for the most part, he stood in place.

He shook his head and arms off and stepped to the side, forming the ram hand seal as he began building up his chakra and focusing it again. He thought about how he could 'soften' the ground up, could he really just pass through it or was there a trick to it? He had a small idea and started to put it into practise, sending his chakra down his legs and into the ground. He figured if he could make the ground into a fine quick sand type texture, he should pass right through. Luckily the ground was already sand so this was easier to accomplish. After a few seconds he feet sank into the ground but got stuck in place. His eyes sprung open from his deep concentration as he knew he was stuck.

With a few tugs and pulls from each leg he yanked himself free of the spot and shook the sand from his shoes. He stepped to a new spot and formed the hand seal like before, focusing on his chakra as he moulded it within his stomach. He replicated what he did last time, sending his chakra down his feet and then into the ground, using said chakra to turn the ground into a fine sandy texture to pass through. As he sank again he began coating his body in chakra so that the same affect occurred as he continued to sink. Once he was fully submerged he could feel a certain vibration all around him, must have been what Lera was referencing. He 'swam' a couple of feet forward before emerging and pulling himself out of the ground, turning to Lera. "That was pretty fun."* - Sat Nov 14 20:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Not bad. - Sat Nov 14 20:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So thats a defensive jutsu and you already know a support jutsu. - Sat Nov 14 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: An offensive jutsu then. - Sat Nov 14 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: p -fun-  - Sat Nov 14 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: -omit- - Sat Nov 14 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) followed each hand seal carefully, memorizing them one by one. He had seen Marrisa use this technique before and Leras explanation of it only confirmed the spears were indeed formed through compacting the ground. He closed his eyes as he began to mould up chakra, slowly practising each hand seal for a few moments. Once he was ready his eyes would open and he would take a readied stance, bringing his hands up. He went through each hand seal fairly quickly and place his hands on the ground, sending his chakra down the ground and into the sand. He split the chakra into four and tried to spike it up from the ground, all this really accomplished was sending a load of sand flying through the air in four separate spots.

He straightened up and placed his hands together, focusing on his chakra again. He was a little impatient last time, he knew he needed to condense the sand and compact it together but for some reason he was in a rushperhaps it was just because he was tired. In any case he would go through the hand seals of the jutsu again, forming them a little faster than before. He bent down and slapped his hands on the ground, sending his chakra down his arms and kneading it through his hands, into the ground. He would again split his chakra off into four, focusing it into four points near each other in the ground. He would then start to draw in sand, compacting it and condensing it. After a few seconds he would attempt to shoot each spike off. The spikes would indeed shoot off but once they got about half way he would lose control, the spikes collapsing under their own weight.

He cracked his neck to the side a little and rubbed his hands together as he straightened his stance again. He formed a hand seal and closed his eyes, concentrating solely on his chakra. Within a few moments he had built up enough chakra and began to quickly form each hand seal for the jutsu. Once the hand seals were done he would kneel down and slap both hands against the ground, kneading his chakra down his arms and into the ground in the process. Like before he focused on four points in the ground, concentrating and condensing sand to those points. Then as he released the spikes he would continue to compact and condense sand up the spike, allowing it to hold its own weight. Once he was done, four sharp spikes would be standing out of the ground.* - Sat Nov 14 20:46:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: Well...Hows about you show me what you can do? I don't intend to spar you -- As I myself am not that good. Or...Maybe I am, but I wouldn't know. I'm quite a pacifist.....Sigh-- Sorry, I'm a little strange. Not used to having a student or anything, you know? Anyway...The cost would be a one time fee of two thousand. Is that okay, or should we both find a more reasonable price? - Sat Nov 14 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure, two thousand is fine. Let's head out to the arena. YOu want me to show you what I can do by sparrin someone else, or by just doin Kata or somethin? - Sat Nov 14 22:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kami, Ryuu(Legendary_Darkness) says: They're not really good for sword practice...Maybe a ceremony at best. But---Your weapon, I guess. But if I see you having some sort of struggle with it, or the Katana is better suited or WHATEVER other weapon, you're changing to the said weapon. - Sat Nov 14 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh.... I guess I'll show you what I meant, when it comes to the fight. Still... anyway. Now I need someone to spar? - Sat Nov 14 22:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) slowly but silently walks over to the body of Kyushiki. He recognised it as Kyushiki as he has spent some time with him both in Konoha and in Shinkogakure. He walks over to near his head, kneeling down beside it. He would turn his head and probe his neck with two fingers for a few moments, checking for a pulse. Once he didn't find one he would close Kyushiki's eyes, if they were open and look towards Shokutsu, shaking his head. "Look I don't know who you are but I need you to stay here with the body and watch out for anyone. I'll go get the Kazekage or a Jounin. My name is Akira, Can you do this for me?"* - Sun Nov 15 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) stands up and nods his head, "Don't let anyone near the body, they could be the killer. I'll be back in a few minutes." He said, about to pace off a few seconds later. He would turn as Kuro emerged onto the scene and started asking questions. "I don't know any medics, we shouldn't move the body from the scene of the crime yet and I'm not aware of any females he has been around lately." He said quickly, turning and restarting his journey to the courtyard.* - Sun Nov 15 01:47:05 2015
