<br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Walks into the mansion of Konoha, looking over the body of the now former Hokage. He would walk up to him and look him over, he had obviously been kept by a select few medical members that would keep his death quiet. Being only one of the few that knew about the Hokages he knew that whether the village could handle this or not, it was time to announce his death. He would place a hand on the forehead of the Hokage and give him a small smile, at least now he would be at peace. He would then turn and walk away, searching the mansion for the village radio announcement station, he knew most villages had them for emergencies and announcements from the Hokage.

After a few minutes of searching he would have found the room the equipment resided in, walking in and closing the door behind him. He would set the equipment up as best he could, it wasn't too difficult anyway, simply a large radio. With a few switch flicks, button clicks and cable connects…all that was left was one last button, the one to turn the mic on. He went to press it yet hesitated at first…was he really going to have to be the one to announce the Hokages death...? Should he even do such a thing while the village has only just got back on its feet? He shook his head, took a deep breath…and pushed the button.

"Hello my fellow shinobi and villagers…I am Akira, a simple genin come to relay a message. I wish I could say the message was a cheerful one, but I would be lying." He paused for a second, unsure how to continue. "The message I bring to you today is one that hurts me to even think about, let alone even say out loud to you, but it must be said." He would pause again, taking in a deep breath. "The Hokage has been found dead. He was found strung up on the fire emblem of the mansion by his coat, a silver sword buried into his chest. We do not know who the killer is or why he killed the Hokage. We need a medical team to come to the mansion and collect his body, both to prepare it for burial and to examine his body…" He would say, trailing off towards the end.

"The Hokage may have died, but his will of fire has been passed down into the wood, bricks and people that have helped rebuild this village. We may be leaderless now, but I believe the village is stronger than ever. Konoha will recover, Konoha will get stronger. Talks will be held to decide a new Hokage." Is what he ended with, he didn't want to say 'goodbye' or 'sorry' at the end, the people needed hope, not mourning. With that he turned the equipment off and left the room, making sure the medical team he requested arrived before leaving the mansion.* - Tue Nov 10 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) || Note, Ziare and Aden would probably see a medical team remove the Hokages body from the mansion, probably taking it off to the hospital for inspection.* - Tue Nov 10 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Uh, Sorry to bother again. Could the RP flag in front of the mansion be deleted? It was only meant to be there to stop entry but thats not neccessary anymore.* - Tue Nov 10 02:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Why would you need more jutsu - Wed Nov 11 02:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because i'm uselss physically. - Wed Nov 11 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'm pretty useless physically. - Wed Nov 11 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And the only jutsu I have is barely offensive. - Wed Nov 11 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. That sucsk. - Wed Nov 11 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hey? - Wed Nov 11 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns his head at the sound of someone yawning, noticing Rias was the cause. "Oh...Hey Rias..." he said in an unusually timid tone.* - Wed Nov 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hi, Akira whats up? - Wed Nov 11 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm? Not much... - Wed Nov 11 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh, ok cool - Wed Nov 11 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: How are you? - Wed Nov 11 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh...Sorry. - Wed Nov 11 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: For what? - Wed Nov 11 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...it kinda felt like I was annoying you. - Wed Nov 11 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Oh not at all - Wed Nov 11 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I guess i'm sorry for before as well. - Wed Nov 11 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: When we were going to the tea shop but I had to bail...I feel kinda bad for that. - Wed Nov 11 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Its ok, we can go whenever - Wed Nov 11 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I'm not doing much now so...we can go now if you're not busy? - Wed Nov 11 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure~ - Wed Nov 11 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) push off the wall, turning to face Rias. "Follow me then." he'd say, waiting for her to begin moving before walking off himself.* - Wed Nov 11 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walked into his favorite tea shop or as it were, cafe. He would receive a nod from one of the waiters, both to show he knew him and he'd be over to serve them soon. He would stop and give a nod back, turning to Rias after he did. "Where do you want to sit?"* - Wed Nov 11 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked a little surprised by her reply, "Oh..." was all he would say before leading her to a table. He would sit opposite to her.* - Wed Nov 11 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked around for a bit, noticing no one had come to serve them yet. He looked at Rais, "So what d-" was all he said before noticing the look on her face. He put an arm out on the table and tapped for a few moments as an awkward silence brushed over the two. Eventually he would stop the tapping and work up the courage to say something, "Are you ok Rias? You seem a little...distant."* - Wed Nov 11 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) returned his arm to his side and sat a little forward to show he was paying attention. "Do you want to talk about it..? It looks like it's bothering you..."* - Wed Nov 11 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: If you want to - Wed Nov 11 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Of course I want to, I don't want to see you upset. - Wed Nov 11 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Well...im thinking I might have to leave soon... to follow my dreams - Wed Nov 11 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks down as she said that, he could feel a lump start to develop in his throat. He would look back up within a few second, though his facial expression wasn't as happy as before. "I-I see...well if thats what you want...then I hope you accomplish all your dreams." he said, trying to sound as supportive as he could.* - Wed Nov 11 05:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But um...I want to tell you something too...but i'm not quite sure how to say it. - Wed Nov 11 05:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Whats up? - Wed Nov 11 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I just... - Wed Nov 11 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not really sure how to put this... - Wed Nov 11 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Whats ok up? - Wed Nov 11 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I... - Wed Nov 11 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Oh god please dont say what I think your going to say... - Wed Nov 11 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) placed both hands on the table and stared at each of them, too timid to look Rias in the eye. Eventually he worked up the courage to speak up. "I like you ok..? Its stupid I know because we haven't known each other long but...I like you...I wouldn't be telling you this yet but I want you to know in case you leave."* - Wed Nov 11 06:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) smiled as she comforted him, though her words did bring slight heart ache to him. "Its just...I like talking to you and being around you more than anyone else..." he would reply to her as he looked her in the eyes, trailing off towards the end. He would put a hand out and attempt to hold her hand in turn, giving it a small squeeze if she'd let him.

"I'd leave Konoha behind and go with you if you'd have me...its not like there is a lot here for me in the first place. But if you truly just want to be friends and go alone...i'll respect your wishes." he'd reply with again, leaning in a little closer to her as he did so he could speak a little softer.* - Wed Nov 11 06:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) squeezed her hand even tighter than before, mostly because he didn't want to let her go. This was the first time he had felt like this about anyone...yet it was being cut so short for him. Eventually though he would ease his grip up to simply holding her hand, she would be able to retract it from him should she wish to do so. "Well...I understand if that is what you truly want. I'm not really sure what my own goals are and wanted to spend time with you to discover that but since you feel this way...i'll have to just work things out I guess." he would say as he shifted his body to sit facing her, unintentionally moving a little closer in the process.* - Wed Nov 11 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*GUNDAM(ZenoKuthric) says: gr - Wed Nov 11 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) nodded his head and shuffled back, putting distance between the two. He didn't want to come of desperate. She was right after all, it was her choice and he needed to let go. "You're right...I'm sorry." he'd say, taking a short pause just after. "And i'm sorry for all this too, this was supposed to be about you but i've made it all about me...probably making it harder for you to leave too. I just...i'm sorry for all this." he'd reply again, looking down at the bench they were sitting on for a few short moments.

"Can I at least write to you when you're gone to check up on you? I still want to keep you as a friend." he'd say, changing his tone from a less intimate one to a more formal one.* - Wed Nov 11 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure you can write me - Wed Nov 11 08:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thanks. - Wed Nov 11 08:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But uh, What's all this about though? - Wed Nov 11 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why the need to leave, to get stronger? - Wed Nov 11 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Its just something I need to do... - Wed Nov 11 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I see well...I understand. - Wed Nov 11 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Heh...this isn't how I expected our trip to the tea shop to turn out. - Wed Nov 11 08:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not too sure what to do now... - Wed Nov 11 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Just enjoy it while it lasts... - Wed Nov 11 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Thats kind of hard... - Wed Nov 11 08:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well uh...Since we're here. - Wed Nov 11 08:25:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No its fine...Don't be sorry. - Wed Nov 11 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's more my fault than anything...I think I should have just stayed quiet. - Wed Nov 11 08:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But anyway since we're here... - Wed Nov 11 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Is there anything you wanted to do..? - Wed Nov 11 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Im not in the mood for anything - Wed Nov 11 08:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right... - Wed Nov 11 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I really fucked up here... - Wed Nov 11 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I will just go... - Wed Nov 11 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...want me to walk you home or..? - Wed Nov 11 08:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) shook his head, "You don't have to be...this is my fault. Just uh...be safe." He'd say as he turned to sit properly, it didn't seem like she wanted to be walked home but he was ready to go with her if she did indeed want that. He would probably leave a few minutes after she had gone, but for now he would just sit in silence unless she had any more to say.* - Wed Nov 11 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) paid for some tea but left before it had even arrived to his table, mostly just to pay the shop for his time there.* - Wed Nov 11 08:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Z.... - Wed Nov 11 08:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Wed Nov 11 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Shit... - Wed Nov 11 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns away and paces off quickly.* - Wed Nov 11 08:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: For you see the errors of your ways and repent for your sins..To give your self over to Jashen. - Wed Nov 11 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: Jashin* - Wed Nov 11 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Who? - Wed Nov 11 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: Jashin! - Wed Nov 11 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Who is that? A god? - Wed Nov 11 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: The one nd only god of this world! - Wed Nov 11 09:17:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: Yes jasin is just right..He welcomes all those who join him with open arms. - Wed Nov 11 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: Oh you should. - Wed Nov 11 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Like I said man, I don't really care for religion. - Wed Nov 11 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: This can very much save your soul Akira. - Wed Nov 11 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You can worship whatever but i'm good thanks. - Wed Nov 11 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: So you refuse to step into circle. - Wed Nov 11 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I do, Sorry. - Wed Nov 11 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiji(Prehensile Tendrils) says: That's a shame really. - Wed Nov 11 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was not having this shit today, he just had to go through a pseudo break up/rejection and now this religious nut rolls up on him with a bow and arrow? As soon as he saw the bow and arrow pointed at him he would clap his hands together once, taking a knee and placing both hands on the ground. He would knead chakra into the ground as fast as he could and before you knew it, the ground would turn into a large river of mud.

He would then push this mud towards Keiji in the form of a small mud tidal wave. Hopefully this would both block him from view and stop any arrows being fired at him.* - Wed Nov 11 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) felt an arrow cut past the top of his right shoulder, it was no matter though since his surprise attack seemed to do the trick. Without a seconds more thought he would transition to a stance as he began running forward, placing both hands behind himself and into his backpouch. He would pull out two kunai, each with a explosive tag on them and throw them at Keiji, aiming to detonate them together once their either hit him or got close.* - Wed Nov 11 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) saw that the tags didn't seem to have much of an effect on Keiji, perhaps he was using a jutsu or his body was just quite durable? In any case he would clap his hands together again, kneeling down and placing them on the floor just after. He would initiate the same jutsu as before, building up a large river of mud. This time he would manipulate the mud slowly, gathering it around Keiji as he laid there. He would aim to bury him deep within the mud and suffocate him, he wasn't going to take any chances by getting near him to finish the job. * - Wed Nov 11 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) kept the mud in place for a few minutes, at least long enough that he knew no one would be able to live through by holding their breath. He decided to let the mud retract and reveal the supposedly lifeless body of Keiji, laided out on the ground in a muddy mess. He would walk over to the body and find either a wrist or his neck to check for a pulse. Once he confirmed he was dead he'd stand back up and shake his head. <Fuck...That was...Shit...> he thought to himself as he just looked at the body, unsure of his next move.* - Wed Nov 11 10:02:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Take his clothes and weapons. - Wed Nov 11 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Pawn them off. - Wed Nov 11 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You'll turn a pretty profit. - Wed Nov 11 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Wed Nov 11 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not going to take his clothes...but i'll see if he had any money. - Wed Nov 11 10:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) knelt down once again, patting his hands across the mans body to see if he could find anything. Any money he did find he would take for himself, stuffing it into any pocket or backpouch of his. He would also pick up his bow, might be worth something. He would then stand back up, looking over to Ziare. "What should we do with the body?"* - Wed Nov 11 10:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just bury it somewhere out of the way. - Wed Nov 11 10:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine... - Wed Nov 11 10:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Keep it out of the way. - Wed Nov 11 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) drags the body off into the forest of trees to the side of the mansion. He would use mud silhouette to dig up enough of the ground for there to be a decent grave. He would drag the body into the grave, putting it into a respectful position before once again using mud silhouette to manipualte the mud and bury the body. He would come into view a few minutes later, leaning against the tree as he stared a cold stare into the ground. He might have seen bodies before but that was the first person he ever killed. "Fuck..." he would mutter under his breath.* - Wed Nov 11 10:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So you knew before hand, huh? - Wed Nov 11 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...not long before you though. - Wed Nov 11 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I saw signs of it. - Wed Nov 11 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's why I left quickly when I saw you talking to her. - Wed Nov 11 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If I told you I knew it was going to happen the whole time, I wouldn't be lying. - Wed Nov 11 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But I didn't want to beleive it. - Wed Nov 11 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The worse part is I told her how I felt about her. - Wed Nov 11 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It didn't really help things...i'm not sure she wants to talk to me for a while...if ever. - Wed Nov 11 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not even sure if she felt the same way about me... - Wed Nov 11 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Mmm.. - Wed Nov 11 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Did she hug you or kiss you before leaving? - Wed Nov 11 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah...but she only kissed me on the forehead. - Wed Nov 11 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And she left really quickly too... - Wed Nov 11 10:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That runs both clans. - Wed Nov 11 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thats rough... - Wed Nov 11 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So we will never be ogether. - Wed Nov 11 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I learned that at a young age. - Wed Nov 11 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She's made advanced at me before, and I have too. - Wed Nov 11 10:27:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm...maybe thats part of the reason why she left then. - Wed Nov 11 10:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That doesn't change the fact i'll still always have her back. - Wed Nov 11 10:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can't help but hate Suna a bit.. - Wed Nov 11 10:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I might do that too... - Wed Nov 11 10:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It took her from me, y'know? - Wed Nov 11 10:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I need a teacher...or teachers... - Wed Nov 11 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, I understand. - Wed Nov 11 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Now that I know she's going to Suna...I should probably stay away from there. - Wed Nov 11 10:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't think i'll talk to another girl for a little while. - Wed Nov 11 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That kinda hurt... - Wed Nov 11 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hah.. - Wed Nov 11 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: At least she's safe. - Wed Nov 11 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah. - Wed Nov 11 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...if you could Ziare. - Wed Nov 11 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Wed Nov 11 10:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Could you try and get that woman you sparred with to talk to me? - Wed Nov 11 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll try. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She used a doton jutsu. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Next time I see her. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thanks...I should probably get stronger too... - Wed Nov 11 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I need to get stronger. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can't keep holding everyone back. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Come on Ziare. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You're the strongest in the village. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If anyone is holding someone back, it's me. - Wed Nov 11 10:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean, at least you could hold your own against that woman. - Wed Nov 11 10:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm far from it. - Wed Nov 11 10:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I couldve beaten her. - Wed Nov 11 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Even though I get her in check mate... - Wed Nov 11 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I have one jutsu, decent chakra control and can seal a kunai into a scroll. - Wed Nov 11 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She could have killed me 6 times. - Wed Nov 11 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm the definition of useless. - Wed Nov 11 10:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just plan out your techniques. - Wed Nov 11 10:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That's a little difficult when I don't have much to work with. - Wed Nov 11 10:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: If you think 3 moves ahead you will win most fights. - Wed Nov 11 10:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I try to think 4 or 5. - Wed Nov 11 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Everything is like a game of chess to me. - Wed Nov 11 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah but, you're a lot smarter than me. - Wed Nov 11 10:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I guess... - Wed Nov 11 10:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I think you just have an inferiority complex. - Wed Nov 11 10:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Maybe. - Wed Nov 11 10:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm just feeling kind of shitty right now I guess. - Wed Nov 11 10:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So am I. - Wed Nov 11 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But i'm planning my next moves as well. - Wed Nov 11 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just kep rping, ur chaacter will develop it eventually - Wed Nov 11 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean the only place for me to really go would be Suna...but I can't go there. - Wed Nov 11 10:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Everywhere else is either unsafe or dead. - Wed Nov 11 10:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: True. - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll off that Kazekage one day. - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I hear he's old as dust. - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He probably won't see me past his cataracts. - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Heh, yeah. - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think I might just go lay down for a while... - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: See you around man... - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) places his hands in his pockets, walking off slowly as he kept his head down and his eyes to the ground.* - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Wed Nov 11 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Uh, Who are you..? - Wed Nov 11 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You wiped out an entire village? - Wed Nov 11 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Riiiiight. - Wed Nov 11 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Which village did you destroy? - Wed Nov 11 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I target population, not structure. - Wed Nov 11 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: That's what people think at least, sometimes. - Wed Nov 11 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine, Which village did you target? - Wed Nov 11 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: It was so long ago. - Wed Nov 11 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I just showed up, did some practice people died, i left. - Wed Nov 11 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: The village hidden in the mist. - Wed Nov 11 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Ok, sounds fun. - Wed Nov 11 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: Wan't a present? - Wed Nov 11 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Depends what kind of present it is. - Wed Nov 11 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) ducks a little as the pebble was thrown at him, his body and head would turn as the pebble zoomed behind him. Once the pebble hit the ground and exploded he would start jumping back to try and avoid the gas. "What the hell is that?" he would ask Naoya.* - Wed Nov 11 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) didn't have a lot of time to react, Naoya was clearly faster than he was. The speed of his punch however was not much to be marveled at, allowing him just enough time to transition his body to the side and out of the way of the punch, though it would be more of a side step than an actual movement. As he did this he would reach into his backpouch and pull out a kunai, holding it in a reverse grip. As he side stepped the punch of Naoya he would attempt to move himself around the side of him and stab him in the back with the kunai.* - Wed Nov 11 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) felt his kunai cut into Naoya slightly, though he knew it wasn't enough to take him down, more of a 'grazing hit' per say. Due to the position he was in, the sweeping kick would most likely knock him off his feet and onto his ass with a thud. He'd shake his head and flick the kunai around in his hand, now holding it correctly. He would then pull his arm back a little before throwing it forward and releasing the kunai, launching it towards Naoya. After that he would simply attempt to get to his feet and move back, well aware of the incoming red gas.* - Wed Nov 11 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) would have indeed inhaled at least some of the gas as he got up and moved as quickly as he could to the back of the room, surely it couldn't progress this far. He would pull out another kunai, holding it in the reverse position as before in one hand while making a fist with the other. He got into a readied stance and faced Naoya, completely silent. In his mind he would be attempting to calm both his heartbeat and in breathing down, both to focus himself and at least prolong any poisoness effects.

As he stared at Naoya, waiting for his move, he would start to become dizzy, a weird feeling growing at the pit of his stomach, like he was going to be sick. He shook his head and concentrated as much as he could on Naoya, trying his best to fight off any poisoness effects.* - Wed Nov 11 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) did his best to move out of the way of this incoming Kunai while under the rapidly increasing effects of the poison. He would twist his body to the side as best he could, the kunai striking him in the shoulder most likely. He would attempt to throw another Kunai at Naoya but obviously being dizzy and unwell meant that it would probably be easily dodged. He would attempt to charge after Naoya, stopping a few seconds after he paced forward to kneel down and throw up.* - Thu Nov 12 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) gets back onto his feet as he wipes sick away from his mouth, he would attempt to half chase Naoya as he exited the building, though in reality he was just trying to get out of the building and escape the poison cloud. By now he would have probably been fully submerged in the red mist. He would hold his breath as best he could as he tried to make his way out of the hole in the building Naoya had made.* - Thu Nov 12 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) stumbled out of the mansion, taking in a deep breath of clean air. His body would still be reacting to the poison though, he would fall onto his hands and knees and throw up again as he body tried to rid his system of the drug that plagued it. He looked up at Naoya as he spoke to him, wondering what all this was about and why he was doing it. Secretly he would be feeding his chakra into the ground, albeit at a much slower rate because of the poison. "W-What price..?" he said slowly, trying to buy himself time to put his plan into action.* - Thu Nov 12 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) continued pushing more chakra into the ground as they conversed. He pulled a less than impressed face as he only gave a simple one worded response. He came here and did all this just for knowledge? In any case he was nearly ready by now. A small smirk appeared on his face as he replied, "S-study this..."
In that moment the ground would start to move, breaking down and mixing up into a viscous mud. The mud would then be sent towards Naoya in the form of a small tidal wave, aiming to either wash him away or bury him under the mud.* - Thu Nov 12 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sat back from being on his hands and knees, he would shuffle back and sit against the wall of the mansion, not having enough strength left to keep himself up. Sick permeated his taste buds, filling his mouth and nostrils with the scent of his own stomach bile. He pulled out a shuriken and launched it as best he could at Naoya, he didn't have a big arsenal of jutsu and he didn't have the strength to keep fighting. He kept completely silent throughout all of this, he wouldn't care for the threats of Naoya.* - Thu Nov 12 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulled out two more shuriken, one in each hand. He focused as best he could on Naoyas body before throwing each shuriken at his upper and lower body, whether they hit though would be pretty much up to Naoya at this point as he could probably easily dodge them. He slumped down a bit unintentionally after throwing those two shuriken, his body becoming limp and his eyesight becoming fuzzier. He looked up at an intercom as it came to life with a voice, in his mind this attack and that propaganda type speech were connected. He'd raise a middle finger up to the intercom for a few seconds before lowering his hand and returning his gaze to Naoya.* - Thu Nov 12 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Eh.... - Thu Nov 12 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) pushed himself up to his previous sitting position, his eyes widening as he saw Naoya hit the ground. <Come on Akira...nows your chance...COME ON!> he thought to himself as he brought both hands together with a clap, building up his chakra as he did. He parted his legs and began applying more of his chakra into the ground as quickly as he could. His body strained under the increasing effect of the poison. <More time...I just need more time...> he continued to think to himself as he kneaded more and more chakra into the ground as quickly as he could. Usually it wouldn't take him this long but the effects of the poison were really taking effect.* - Thu Nov 12 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) knew that this would be his last move, he had to really make this count. With one big push he started the same reaction as before, turning a large chunk of the ground into mud. The mud would move towards Naoya as fast as Akira could manipulate it. The mud would aim to surround Naoya first and then bury him, instead of washing him away. Akira knew that since he was laying on the ground he could potentially bury him as deep under the mud as possible and suffocate him.

Whether his last ditch effort worked or not he would inevitably slump back against the wall, his arms falling limp either side of him. His eyes would be half open as he looked on towards Naoya, his breathing heavy and laboured. This fight would be over for him at least.* - Thu Nov 12 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) is now just sitting there, the poison fatiguing him to the point of him not being able to fight for now.* - Thu Nov 12 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) wouldn't take the hand of Naoya for two reasons, one he didn't have the strength and two they were fighting to the death just a few seconds ago. He shuffles up a little and looks up to Naoya, "Why..?" he would say in a breathless voice.* - Thu Nov 12 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) turned his head and leaned over, spitting out a glob of spit to help clear his mouth of the taste of spit. "You're an idiot...what is a simple genin like me going to know..?" he said, shaking his head in the process. "You're going to be hunted for what you've done...all for something so stupid..."* - Thu Nov 12 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Naoya(Solobb-) says: I'm immortal, why should i care? - Thu Nov 12 01:37:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) watched the red mist of poison slowly start exiting the building, floating off with the wind and hopefully dissipating into the air. "Yeah...I only inhaled some of it thankfully." he'd say, sitting down on the ground. He'd pull out a few snack bars, mostly chocolate, and eat them quickly to help regain a bit of strength. "I could have had him if it wasn't for that damn poison..."* - Thu Nov 12 02:13:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Someone uses guerilla warfare on konoha, some shady guy attacks me in the mansion. - Thu Nov 12 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Then some propaganda bullshit comes on the intercoms? - Thu Nov 12 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Plus I need to wait for a friend before I do anything. - Thu Nov 12 02:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) comes back a few minutes later, looking a little better as he eats through two chocolate bars. He stares at the mansion while eating his second chocolate bar. "Hm...That should be clear by now." he said, finishing the chocolate bar off soon after.* - Thu Nov 12 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) says: Mm... how did he use the posion? - Thu Nov 12 02:42:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls his shirt up over his nose, using it as a pseudo mask. He'd give a thumbs up to Ishi before walking inside.* - Thu Nov 12 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks about the room, moving over to where they fought. He would find the scroll left behind by Naoya, picking it up and opening it to read.* - Thu Nov 12 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) exits the building, pulling his shirt down from his face. "Yeah it's a little hazy in there but it should be all good in another half hour or so. I found a scroll he dropped too, it's just something stupid." he'd say, holding the scroll up.* - Thu Nov 12 02:48:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'll get him back. - Thu Nov 12 02:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm... - Thu Nov 12 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) had rested a while and now felt better. He wanted to wait for Ziare but then again he didn't want to endanger him. With that he packed up some food for the road and made his way out of konoha. He would follow the same route as before to get to Shinogakure, it wasn't too far anyway. He had to stop occasionally, mostly due to long lasting side effects of the poison he was given a while back. Eventually he found himself standing at the gates of Shinogakure, looking for a guard to speak to.* - Thu Nov 12 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: C'mon man. . .this is your settlement right? Help me out here. . . - Thu Nov 12 03:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) strolls up on the scene, recognising Ishi in the distance. He didn't mind that he left without him, people had to keep themselves safe after all. He saw what looked like Ortho, but he couldn't quite make out who it was, mostly because of the poison still troubling his body. He looked at the other twom not taking much notice of them besides any features like headbands. <Seems a few people from Konoha are here...> He thought to himself before stepping forward to be a little more noticable.

"I've come to see the owner of this settlement." he would state firmly, though he sounded somewhat breathless. If one looked closely enough they would see he looked visibly pale and tired, another side effect of the poison he had been exposed too a while ago.* - Thu Nov 12 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Dude. . .I'm not you. I'm a walking thread monster. I don't know 'comfortable'. - Thu Nov 12 03:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Don't joke like that man. - Thu Nov 12 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: Damn, I'm going. - Thu Nov 12 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ishi(Prince122) thinks: Damn.... - Thu Nov 12 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was a little surprised that Ortho was the one to step up, and also a little worried since he knew some real heavy stuff about him. He looked around himself briefly, making sure nothing of danger was around him or coming close to him. "I see, we've met before. This is Shinogakure correct?" he'd ask, going silent to wait for a reply.* - Thu Nov 12 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: psssst. - Thu Nov 12 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I see, Sorry. - Thu Nov 12 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I was poisoned when I heard that announcement. - Thu Nov 12 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Anyway, I came to enquire about this place. - Thu Nov 12 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm listening. - Thu Nov 12 03:52:06 2015
