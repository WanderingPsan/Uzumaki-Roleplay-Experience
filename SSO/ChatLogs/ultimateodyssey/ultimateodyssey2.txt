<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Very well. - Sun Nov  8 12:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Came to the training field, it was finally empty for the most part. It wasn't really the fact he didn't like training; it was more he didn't like training around others for fear of being judged or analysed. He looked around to make sure no one was around, seeing one person in the distance but not caring much. He would begin building up his chakra within his body, taking a little time to do so due to his lack of practise and chakra control. He would then kneel down and push his chakra through his body and down his arms, feeding it into the ground. When that had been accomplished he would bring his hands off the ground and clap them once, the ground effected by his chakra would then start to move and churn into a muddy pool, though it was relatively small and slow.

He knew a few things were wrong with what he was doing and he'd need to focus on each point to gain a better understanding and mastery of the jutsu. First things first he felt like his chakra was being received into the ground that well, he would begin building up chakra to practise this very thing. With enough time he would have built up an ample amount of chakra to work with. He would then kneel down again and begin feeding his chakra into the ground, taking his time with kneading his chakra piece by piece. He could feel how his chakra was being rejected or lost due to his own inability, though he pressed on nonetheless. Once he felt he was ready he would clap his hands once again to initiate the jutsu, forming a small muddy pool again.

He stood up and dusted his hands off, placing them together flat and closing his eyes to concentrate on moulding up more chakra. Even with his mediocre chakra control, he would now be building up his chakra at a much faster pace, mostly due to him getting into a training groove. Once his chakra was ready he would kneel down again and place his hands flat onto the ground, pushing his chakra out through his palms to knead chakra into the ground. He would continue from before, focusing as hard as he could on his chakra as kneaded it into the ground. He could still tell his chakra wasn't really having much of an effect but it seemed to be a little better than before. With one more clap he would initiate the jutsu, churning and moving the earth into mud.

He kept knelt down this time, it was a bother transitioning from standing to kneeling every few minutes. Once again he placed his hands together and closed his eyes to focus on moulding up his chakra. When he felt ready to begin again he wouldn't even open his eyes, simply bending over slightly and placing his hands on the ground. He would send his chakra down his arms and began kneading into the earth once more, trying his hardest to make sure nothing was being wasted so he was using his chakra efficiently and effectively. He still felt like his chakra wasn't getting into the ground how he wanted, though he certainly noticed that with time, more chakra was being kneading into the ground than before. He opened his eyes and clapped his hands once, as he did the ground would start to move about again, mixing itself into mud…though still on quite a small scale.

Once again he would rub and bash his hands together lightly to dust them off of mud and dirt. He liked doton jutsu but they did make a mess at times. With a shrug he would place his hands together and close his eyes to focus his mind and his body on his chakra again. It would only take a few moments to build up the chakra needed for the jutsu. Once again his hands would be on the ground and he would be focusing as hard as he could on kneading every bit of chakra he could into the ground, trying not to waste anything. He lifted his hands of the ground after a little while had passed and clapped them again, causing the earth to once again break apart and form into a muddy puddle.

He would stand up again, mostly because his back was hurting a little and he wanted to stretch it out, once he had his hands we back together and his focus was back on his chakra, moulding it up as best as he could and as fast as he could. He would stretch his shoulder a little before kneeling down and placing his hands against the ground again. He continued his efforts on practising kneading his chakra into the ground for as long as he could. When he was ready he stood up again and clapped his hands together a single time, once more activating his chakra kneading into the ground to turn the earth into mud. He would note that the quality of mud was looking a lot better than before and he was even managing to generate a little more mud.* - Sun Nov  8 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) came back to the training field after having a longish rest, it wasn't great to have long rests while you were training but then again, not only had he used up quite a bit of chakra, he also hadn't trained in a long while. Now that his body was pretty limber and his chakra reserved had recovered he found himself a nice spot to begin building chakra up. As he built his chakra up he thought about where he had last left off, remembering he was working on his chakra control with the technique. With his memory being refreshed he knelt down and placed his hand on the ground, pushing his chakra down his arms and through his hands, beginning the process of kneading his chakra into the ground. He focused as best as he could on his chakra, though it was still quite sub-par. Still he would clap his hands together once to active the jutsu, churning the ground up into mud.

He shook his arms off and breathed out deeply, with that first practise out of the way he would try and focus himself into some real concentration now. He zoned out of everything besides his chakra, placing his hands together to help focus his chakra. He focused on the composition of his chakra, trying to give it an earthier kind of composition, he thought it would help knead it into the ground easier. Once his chakra was ready he would again kneel down and place his hands on the ground, closing his eyes as he focused on pushing his chakra down his arms and kneading it into the ground through his hands. He found the chakra becoming more and more receptive to the ground, as well as his ability to knead it becoming better too. Within a few moments he would clap his hands to complete the jutsu, the ground turning into mud as he did albeit a small mud pool.

He was getting better over time and he knew it, over half his moulded up chakra was getting into the ground perfectly now, he just needed to keep working at time. With that in mind he would start moulding up more chakra after he dusted off his hands, moulding up his chakra was becoming easier to him as he familiarised himself with it again. When he was ready he would place his hands flat on the ground again and start pouring his chakra down his arms, kneading as much of it as he could into the ground. It was taking less and less time to do this process as he was becoming not only faster, but more skilled at doing so. Once he had done all he could he would bring his hands off the ground, then bring them together with a clap, finalising the jutsu and turning the earth he had affected into mud.

Wasting no time to rest he would keep his hands together from the previous clap to help his focus on building up more chakra, he noticed he wasn't getting as fatigued as before, a testament to his progression. He would focus back on his chakra though, not wanting to waste any more time on thinking about the progress he had already made, he knew there was still progress to be made yet. Once he felt he was ready he would place his hands against the floor again, funnelling his chakra down his arms and into the ground once again. As always he kept focused on only his chakra from this point on, even holding his breath for a few seconds so it didn't distract him. He would note that over 2/3s of the chakra he was using was now being correctly kneaded into the ground. As he clapped his hands and the ground started to change into mud he would again not that the affected area was getting bigger and bigger.

Seeing the fruits of his labour only help spur him on to practising more, he wasn't sure what was up with him lately, before he barely trained and was honestly barely a shinobi but recently…he just couldn't help but be more active as a shinobi. That same feeling was affecting him now as he built up more chakra to perform the jutsu with again. With each practise he was improving with his chakra somewhat, now building it up quite quickly. As he placed his hands on the ground and started kneading his chakra into the earth, he would once more keep absolute concentration on his chakra, kneading more and more of it into the ground effectively as time passed. With a single clap it would again show him how his training was paying off, the amount of mud produced and the quality of it clearly being much better than what he first did.

He was starting to get fatigued now but he was glad with both his results and the fact he was practising again, being that it was slowly but surely bringing him back into the swing of things. With a short breather he would bring his hands back together and began moulding up chakra for what he wanted to be the final time before another break, this time hopefully being shorter than the last. Once his chakra had been properly prepared he would place his hands against the ground and focus on his built up chakra, slowly pushing it down each arm and then carefully kneading it bit by bit into the ground as best as he possibly could. By the time he had finished he was getting most of his chakra into the ground now, with a clap of his hands the ground would move and mix around into a decently sized muddle pool. While his kneading of his chakra into the ground still wasn't perfect, he knew he needed to move onto practising other aspects of the jutsu and in doing so, his kneading would get naturally better.* - Sun Nov  8 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Took out some snacks as he sat down in the training field, he would eat the food he had brought with him as he rested, making sure not to take too long yet long enough to rest and replenish some chakra. Once he was ready to begin training again he would stand up and start building up his chakra once more. Now that he had the initial control of the technique under control he could focus on the next part, refinement. Once his chakra was fully prepared he would kneel down and place his hands on the ground, beginning the kneading process. As he would knead his chakra he would make sure not only to be refining how he kneaded his chakra, but also how much chakra he pushed into the ground. Once he felt he could do no more he would pull his hands back and clap them, completing the jutsu as the ground shifted into mud.

He noticed that by adding slightly more chakra while refining his use of his chakra, he was able to increase the amount of mud produced while keeping the chakra consumption low. He would begin building up his chakra again as he stood up straight, keeping his hands held together to help focus his chakra. It took him a little while as he built up a little more chakra then usual but he eventually got there. Like last time he would start to push his chakra down his arms as he knelt down and placed his hands on the ground. He would then focus on kneading his chakra as best he could while also refining how he kneading it, hopefully dragging the chakra consumption back bit by bit. As he clapped his hands the earth would mix into a small muddy pool again, though it seemed to be improving in size.

He was doing ok so far; chakra consumption was still a problem for trying to increase the size of the mud pool but at least he was getting the refinement down somewhat. Without a moment more thought he would start moulding up more chakra to practise with. When his chakra was ready for use again he would place his hands on the ground and begin pouring his chakra into the earth, concentrating on refining the chakra and kneading it at a fast pace. This time he would try and focus on spreading his chakra outward slowly to increase the area of influence. Once he was again ready he would take his hands off the ground and clap them once, finishing off the jutsu as the mud churned into a muddy pool.

He moved from his current spot as the one he was previously in was now quite a muddy mess, it was no matter though, the training field was large enough. Once he had found another spot he would stand still as he began building up chakra again in preparation for his next practise. It didn't take long for him to build his chakra up now that he had got some practise in first. With his chakra prepared he placed his hands on the ground again and started pumping his chakra into the earth as best he could, making sure to try and increase its range as he refined the chakra while kneading it. He was starting to make good progress now as when he clapped his hands to initiate the change into mud, he noticed the amount of mud generated was much larger than before.

He would let out a deep breath as he turned to face a different direction as the earth he had been working with before was now unusable for the time being. He closed his eyes and pressed his hands flat together, doing so to help him focus his chakra. He would mould up his chakra as quickly as he could and once it was done, his hands would be flat against the floor again, chakra pumping down his arms and through his hands as he kneaded it carefully into the dirt. He would do as before, pushing his chakra out to further lengths to increase the effective range of the jutsu and generate more mud. Once he felt he had done enough he would bring his hands back and together with a single clap, the earth he had kneaded his chakra into would then change into a medium sized muddy pool.

He would turn again to practise the jutsu for a final time before taking another rest, despite his work on refining the chakra to decrease chakra consumption, which had been effective, the jutsu was still taking quite a lot out of him. In any case once he was done building up his chakra he hands would once again meet the floor as he kneaded more chakra into the earth, focusing all his efforts into refining it as it passed from his hand and into the ground, he would also make sure to extend the chakra outwards to increase Its area of effectiveness. Once he was ready he would then bring his hands back for the final time in this training session and clap them together once, causing the chakra in the earth to active and change the earth into a muddy-liquid like pool.* - Sun Nov  8 22:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Stood up and dusted himself off, he looked around and saw quite a few people at the training field but it didn't really matter to him at this point, it's not like he had amazing skills to show off in the first place. With that he would place his hands together and start building up chakra quickly, utilising his chakra control that he was slowly re-familiarising himself with to help in this process. Once he had enough chakra built up he would stretch his arms out and kneel down, placing his hands on the ground and sending his chakra to his palms as he began kneading the chakra from his hand into the earth. After a few moments had passed he would stand back up and clap his hands together once, initiating the jutsu. The earth that had his chakra kneaded into it would begin to move and mix up into a viscous mud, though it wasn't on the grandest of scales he was clearly getting better at this.* - Mon Nov  9 01:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Finnnnna - Mon Nov  9 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Cracked his neck from side to side as he finished his initial practise, now started the real training. He remembered that previously he had been working on refining the jutsu and increasing its range. He had managed to get it to a decent range, but he knew he could take it further. With that he placed his hands together to help him focus on moulding up chakra. Once he was done with moulding up his chakra he placed his hands on the ground and began kneading his chakra into the earth, concentrating as much as he possibly could on refining the chakra he was passing into the ground. He would also use his control over his chakra to extend its range as much as he possibly could before pulling away and clapping his hands together once, forcing the ground to shift and change into a viscous mud.

He walked a short distance to a different spot and began building up chakra again, the last spot was too muddy to work with. He was now building up chakra faster and faster, his ability with ninjutsu and chakra was clearly coming back to him now, all he needed was a jump start. When his chakra had been properly prepared he would kneel down and place his hands on the ground, beginning the process of funnelling his chakra down his arms and into the ground. He would take extra care as he kneaded his chakra into the earth, making sure to refine it down to get the most out of it. He would then spread said kneaded chakra as far as he could possibly get it, hoping to extend the range of the mud. He would then bring his hands back and together with a clap. The earth would then start to churn and mix up into a muddy pool.

He stood up and did a 180 degree turn as he did so that he would have fresh earth to work with. He would return to his usual stance when he built up chakra, placing both hands together as a pseudo hand seal to help focus his chakra. Once he felt he was ready to practise again he would part his hands as he knelt down. He would place his hands flat against the ground and pump his chakra down each arm, focusing as hard as he could on refining the chakra as it left his hands and entered the ground. As his chakra was entering the ground he would manipulate it to extend it outwards from himself as far as he could. Once everything was set he clapped his hands together once and as he did, a large part of the earth would move and shift, sloshing around and mixing itself into mud.

He wasted no time in moving to another spot again, seeing as this spot had been well and truly used up in terms of fresh earth. It didn't take him long to find another spot to use and with that, he began moulding up chakra once again. Once he had prepared an ample amount of chakra to practise with he would again kneel down and place his hands against the ground, pushing his chakra down his arms and into the ground. He would continue to strive towards extending the range as much as possible, all the while refining the chakra as he kneaded it into the earth. Once he was ready he would stand up and clap his hands together, causing the earth effected by his chakra to start breaking down and mixing up into a large muddy pool, almost comparable to a river.

He turned around and figured he would make this his last practise before going to rest, he wasn't feeling particularly fatigued but he wanted to go do something else, namely socialise with the people at the training field. With that he placed his hands together and focused on his chakra as he began moulding it up. Once he felt ready he would kneel down and place his hands on the ground, sending his chakra down each arm as he did. He would focus as carefully as possible on his chakra, making sure to refine as much as he could while kneading it into the ground. Once he had spent some time on that he would begin spreading his chakra outwards from himself, extending it as far and wide as he could get it. When he felt ready he would stand up and place his hands together once, holding them there. The chakra kneaded into the ground would then start to break a part a large chunk of the ground, breaking it down and churning it up into a viscous river of mud.* - Mon Nov  9 02:49:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Sits down to rest a little while, pulling out a scroll and a single kunai. He would place the kunai down beside him and unroll the scroll, laying it out in front of himself. He would then place the kunai on the scroll, most likely towards the middle of it. He held up the seal of confrontation and closed his eyes, moulding up his chakra and using the seal to help focus it. Once he had enough chakra built up he would bring his hands together and string together a few hand seals. He would then place his hand down on the ground, extending his chakra out to the scroll and kunai and trying his best to seal the kunai within the scroll. Within a puff of smoke a few scribbles would be written across the scroll, there would be no sign of Kunai. It was apparent he was new to this technique, it took him a while to go through the hand seals and seal the kunai, plus the seal markings looked sloppy, though it was still good practise.* - Mon Nov  9 03:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) moved back a bit to get a better view of what they were doing. <How odd...Rias falls limp...then stands back up like nothing happened...maybe it's a faint tactic..?> he thinks to himself as he watches on.* - Mon Nov  9 03:48:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sort of just stared at the two as the passed by, he wouldn't try to make contact because he didn't know them...and he didn't do so well in a big group of people.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs as he looks around, everyone seemed to have someone and yet here he is just standing in the middle like a lost lamb. He would walk off to the side and pull a book out, sitting against the fence as he opened it and began reading. It seemed to be a book ninjutsu and chakra, just to keep his mind off of things really.* - Mon Nov  9 05:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to tuck into his ramen, chewing and swallowing a few chunks of all kind of meat with the noodles. After he would peer around the front of Rias to look at Ziare, "Mind if I ask those questions now?"* - Mon Nov  9 05:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Stepped a little way away from Rias, he didn't want to get mud all over her as he practised this jutsu since the range of it was quite large now. Once he was a good enough distance away he would take in a deep breath and begin building up his chakra, starting off slowly at first. After a little while his chakra would have been prepared to the point of use. With that he would kneel down and place his hands on the ground, sending his built up chakra down each arm and into his hands. He would then start kneading his chakra through his palms and into the earth, spreading it over as large a distance as he could possibly manage. With everything prepared he would clap his hands together and focus on the chakra, using it to change the earth into a muddier substance.

He would turn on the spot, all the way around to a 180-degree angle so that he was now facing what would have been his backside. He held up the seal of confrontation to help his focus his chakra as he moulded it up as quickly as he could. Once his chakra was properly prepared he would begin kneading it into the ground again, once more spreading it over a large distance. As he clapped his hands and converted the earth into mud he would continue to focus on his chakra in the mud, using it to manipulate the mud back and forth, left and right. It occurred to him he hadn't yet practised with manipulating the mud which is why he was doing so now to get a feel for it.

He would stop what he was doing after a little while and moved to a new area, one with fresh earth and soil. He held up the seal of confrontation to help him concentrate his chakra as he began moulding up more of it. He was now building up his chakra a lot quicker which it why it took no time at all to finish with moulding his chakra up. With his chakra ready he would place his hands on the ground and focus his efforts on refining the chakra as he kneaded it into the ground, the dispersing it as far and as wide as he could. Once all that was done he would stand hand place his hands together with a small clap, manipulating his chakra to turn the chakra affected area into mud. He would then start manipulating this mud, slipping and sliding it around as best he could.

Once the quality of mud had worn out he would again turn around to face and new patch of land, ready to be turned into mud with his jutsu. With his hands already together he would just use this as a medium to help focus his chakra, quickly amassing it and moulding it up. He would then kneel down and put his hands against the ground, quickly and efficiently kneading and spreading his chakra through the ground. With another small clap to bring his hands together the earth would break down into a viscous mud which he would then use his chakra to move around, testing his limits with what he could do with the mud by making it move in various ways including a small tidal wave type movement which interested him.

Again he moved onto a final area, believing that in this area he would pretty much attain mastery over mud silhouette. Now that he had the movement down all he needed to do was increase the speed of the mud to as fast as he could make it go. With that in mind he formed the seal of confrontation and began quickly moulding up his chakra to practise with. In no time at all he would be on his knees again, hands flat against the ground as he pumped and kneaded more and more chakra into the ground. When he was once again ready it would take a single clap to bring his hands together, combined with some small manipulation to turn the earth into a muddy river. He would then amass this mud together and force it to move as one, trying his hardest to get it to move as fast as possible.

When the quality of the mud had started to degrade he would settle it as best he could and turn again, focusing on building his chakra for another shot at practising this jutsu. By now it only took him a few seconds to mould his chakra up and once that was done, he would be kneading chakra into the ground through his hands. Once he had kneaded enough into the ground he would clap his hands together once lightly, forcing the earth to change into a large river of mud. With the mud now under his control he would simply amass it all together again so it moved as one, then started testing the speed he could push it forth. By the time he was done he figured he wasn't going to get much faster with his current control over chakra but with that, he knew he had learned pretty much all he could for this jutsu.* - Mon Nov  9 07:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Came to the training field and oddly sat down rather than standing up. He would pull out a scroll, a kunai and a Shuriken. He would unroll the scroll and place it on the floor in front of himself. He would then place the kunai on the scroll and the shuriken just above it on the ground. He would then sit back and start moulding up chakra to use with the technique. Once his chakra was ready he would bring his hands together and go through a string of hand seals and slam his hand on the ground just below the scroll. As his hand hit the floor he would send his chakra across the ground and to the scroll and kunai, small seals would probably be seen moving towards the scroll as he did. With a puff of smoke, the kunai would be gone, a small seal would be all that was left behind on the scroll.

He would form a single seal and release the seal on the scroll, the kunai would then appear after another puff of some. He would readjust the kunai and begin building up chakra again. He wanted to work on the refinement of the seals to help strengthen it. With that in mind he would bring his hands up and together, going through a string of hand seals at quite a fast speed. He would then bring a hand down to the ground, releasing his chakra and sending it forward towards the kunai. As he did this he would focus on his chakra as much as possible, refining the chakra he was sending through his hand and into the scroll and kunai. Once again within a puff of smoke, the kunai would be sealed.

He would release the seal again, the kunai popping back into existence in a puff of smoke. He would then hold up the seal of confrontation as he began moulding his chakra up to help him concentrate and focus it. The thing he liked about Fuuinjutsu was, you didn't need to apply any nature changes to your chakra. Once he was ready he would again go through a string of hand seals before slamming his hand down on the ground, kneading his chakra through the ground and into the kunai and scroll to form a seal. Again he would focus on his chakra as he released it, refining the chakra he was using as best he could. With another puff of smoke, the kunai would be sealed away, the seal looking a little better than before.

Unsealing the kunai, he would pick it up and place it to the side, replacing it with the shuriken. He wanted to use different objects to get a better feel for the many different things he knew he would have to seal in the future. With everything ready he would begin building up his chakra to try again, making sure his chakra was of the highest quality. When his chakra was ready he would bring his hands close and begin forming hand seals as fast as he could, getting through them within a few seconds. He would then funnel his chakra down one arm and slam that hand down onto the ground, forcing his chakra out of his body and into the shuriken to seal it. As he did this he made sure to continue refining the chakra he was kneading into the seal and shuriken, making sure his chakra was being used correctly and efficiently.

He unsealed the shuriken with another puff of smoke and a half hand seal, readjusting it to make sure it was in position to seal again. When preparations had been completed he would start building up more chakra to use in the seal again. When he felt ready he would motion through a few hand seals as quick as he could form them and place his hand on the ground once more, sending his chakra down his arm, through his hand and into the shuriken and seal on the scroll. He closed his eyes and concentrated on the chakra he was expelling into the seal, trying to focus and refine it as best he could to produce a better quality of seal. Another puff of smoke would appear and once it cleared, the seal would be all that remained.

He let out a heavy breath just after he had finished that last seal, he forgot how much sealing took out of him, even with his high levels of chakra. He would take in a deep breath and sit up straight however, unsealing the shuriken from the scroll. He sat quietly as he slowly and carefully built up chakra, not wanting to over-exert his body and its chakra reserves. When he finally felt ready he would go through a mix of hand seals before slamming his hand on the ground near the scroll, feeding his chakra into the seal on the scroll and focusing it on the shuriken, all the while refining his use of the chakra. Once the smoke arose, signalling the shuriken had been sealed, he slumped over and exhaled deeply. He had to sit like that for a few moments before sitting up straight, his chakra reserves being not that great right now. Still, he looked upon the seal and would see that it looked a little less sloppy than before and despite the chakra cost, this was proving to be worth it.* - Mon Nov  9 20:42:01 2015
