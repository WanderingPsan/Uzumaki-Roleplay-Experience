<br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That's how strong I ne- want to be. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Then work with us. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Don't just push us away. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't become that strong by doing silly missions and occasional training with a squad that hates me. - Sun Dec  6 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hates you? - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Who hates you? - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Geo threatened to kill me. - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Around four times. - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Or three, I don't really remember. - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Geo... - Sun Dec  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: I've never really talked to him. - Sun Dec  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: This squad will never work because of that reason. - Sun Dec  6 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ..... - Sun Dec  6 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not working with someone that told me to kill myself and threatened to kill me. - Sun Dec  6 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Just because he is stronger than me. - Sun Dec  6 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can try talking to him. - Sun Dec  6 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Screw him. - Sun Dec  6 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You can't give up. - Sun Dec  6 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Look, Ryo. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Give up on what? - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've seen you train before. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You...you have this passion in your eyes, this passion to get stronger. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: You look like you don't want to give up. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: So don't give up, not even on this squad. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Please. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I didn't give up. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just don't want to participate. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Also stop spying on me while I train. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I -really- -hate- that. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Spying? I put myself out in the open on purpose. - Sun Dec  6 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh...that time. - Sun Dec  6 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: That wasn't training. - Sun Dec  6 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Either way, my statement still stands. - Sun Dec  6 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs as he turned around on the spot, giving both Anguo and Tengoku a slightly aggitated look. He would start walking towards the both of them, seating himself a few metres from the two, much to his inner protest of course. "Fine. I'll humour you two this once."* - Sun Dec  6 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Good... - Sun Dec  6 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: So, we left off on strengths and weaknesses... - Sun Dec  6 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why...is he jumping...like an idiot... - Sun Dec  6 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Who wants to share theirs? - Sun Dec  6 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'll go, since mine is fairly quick. - Sun Dec  6 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've taken up the path of the scout. - Sun Dec  6 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: My strengths include looking for things and people, and travelling very fast! - Sun Dec  6 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I've developed a method of using Shunshin in combat, and I do pack a little strength in my hits. - Sun Dec  6 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: This is killing me already. - Sun Dec  6 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'm fairly weak in Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, though I can utilize them in a basic fashion. - Sun Dec  6 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: My weaknesses include, just about everything else. I am a weak little boy. - Sun Dec  6 00:51:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighs and rubs the back of his neck with a hand, looking down at the reflections off the water as he did. He held like that for a moment or two before dropping his hand into his lap and looking up, glancing first to Tengoku and then to Anguo with his dark onyx eyes. "I have no strengths and my weaknesses are people and teamwork." His tone was quite dull and sounds like he was rapidly losing interest.* - Sun Dec  6 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....You have to have some strength. Don't you focus in taijutsu? - Sun Dec  6 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 00:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Then I guess this will be a little difficult starting out.... - Sun Dec  6 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: We'll have to find a role that fits you. - Sun Dec  6 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) thinks: What would a squad leader normally do... - Sun Dec  6 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I can't really reccomend anything...any ideas Tengoku? - Sun Dec  6 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Erm. - Sun Dec  6 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: What are we defining as "roles?" - Sun Dec  6 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Oh man...this is so dull... - Sun Dec  6 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: The amount of training I could have done by now... - Sun Dec  6 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Like front-line fighter, support...Things like that. From there we can figure out what to recommend as specialization... - Sun Dec  6 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Let's see. - Sun Dec  6 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Well, Geo is definitely our close-quarters engagement guy. - Sun Dec  6 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: If this water was solid, i'd knock myself cold on it by now... - Sun Dec  6 01:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I assume you, Anguo-sensei, can be our mid-long range fighter. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ryo, I'm not entirely sure about your role. I do kind of get a taijutsu-vibe from you. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Sensei..? - Sun Dec  6 01:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: He better not want me to call him that...so rediculous. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I have a little taijutsu and ninjutsu skill. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can probably float, or maybe serve as a distraction. - Sun Dec  6 01:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: After all, who dosn't fall for this cute face? - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: That was the line. - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: and he just crossed it. - Sun Dec  6 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) stands up and turns, starting to walk off again.* - Sun Dec  6 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ..... - Sun Dec  6 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Just leave...just leave...just...ugh... - Sun Dec  6 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns back again, sitting down in his previous spot. "Taijutsu." he said grudgingly.* - Sun Dec  6 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Huh? - Sun Dec  6 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: So it's Taijutsu? - Sun Dec  6 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: My strength is Taijutsu. - Sun Dec  6 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: There you go, Anguo. - Sun Dec  6 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: .....Alright then. - Sun Dec  6 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why did I stay..? - Sun Dec  6 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I guess now we can start to think up some combos from there. - Sun Dec  6 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) slowly closes his eyes and folds his arms over his chest, deciding to simply listen from here on out.* - Sun Dec  6 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Most of my techniques are pretty wide-scale and would probably endanger you two...So I'll try and learn some ninjutsu that I could use with you guys. My fuuinjutsu, I can use for support. - Sun Dec  6 01:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Well, I can use my scout abilities to check surrounding areas for traps and such, and maybe set up some. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I can use Shunshin and taijutsu to overwhelm while Geo and Ryo handle the resr. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yeah, sounds good. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: If need be, I can also do a little ninjutsu. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Pretty much all for me. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't do anything, i'd just sit back and watch, - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You wouldn't need me. - Sun Dec  6 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....We will. - Sun Dec  6 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ---Oh. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Before I forget. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I have a technique I could share. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hrm? - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: It'll be useful if we need to avoid sensory-nin. - Sun Dec  6 01:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: It'll take some decent chakra control, but it should be simple enough. If you guys want to learn it that is. - Sun Dec  6 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Of course. - Sun Dec  6 01:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yeah, it'll take a bit. Just sort of...relax your chakra pathways. Focus on keeping it down, almost like a voice. - Sun Dec  6 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) lets out a sigh through his nostrils, his facial expression showing he was slightly irritated. <He barely explained how to use that technique. I don't even know what the Kai technique is either.> He stayed in the same position and focused on his chakra as much has possible, his own chakra control being barely above a normal genins meant this was quite difficult for him. Once he had a semi-decent grasp on his chakra he would begin...uh...trying to reduce it..? He sat there, silent as ever as he just kept focused on his chakra, pretty unsure on what he had to do. After a few moments had passed he would glance over to Anguo. "This is stupid."* - Sun Dec  6 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....Sorry for trying to teach something I'd thought would be useful. - Sun Dec  6 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You didn't teach anything... - Sun Dec  6 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: I'm -trying- to teach it... - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You're not explaining anything. - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: There's not really a good way to explain it other than to focus on reducing your chakra... - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: If there was, I'd say it. - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: If I could show you, I'd do it. - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you didn't notice, I have terrible chakra control. - Sun Dec  6 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So when you say, 'Reduce your chakra'. - Sun Dec  6 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I have no idea what you mean. - Sun Dec  6 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: This is dull. - Sun Dec  6 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why is my squad leader also my age? - Sun Dec  6 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: So many things are weird... - Sun Dec  6 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ...................... - Sun Dec  6 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked away from Anguo, staring straight at the water. At times he was sad he couldn't use water, it was so peaceful and tranquil, yet it could also be lethal and dangerous. In a few seconds he would slowly close his eyes and refocus on his chakra again, wondering how he was going to 'reduce his chakra'. He sat there for a good long while, keeping absolutely focused on his chakra. He would attept to thin his chakra out as that was the only idea he had at this point, yet even that was quite difficult. With a sigh he let up on what he was doing, which was practically nothing at this point.

He looked into the water again as he silently mulled over how to do what Anguo said...which was quite difficult because he couldn't sense chakra and the only thing close to this that he had done before was suimen practise. In that moment a small lightbulb would go off in his head, sparking an idea. He focused on his chakra and imagined it to be like water rushing around his body, his stomach being the sea that produced the chakra rivers. He would slowly start to reduce the flow of these rivers and in doing so, had started to slow the rate of his chakra flow. He let up after a few moments, letting out a deep breath from fatigue.

Once he had taken a moment to recover he would refocus on his chakra, first imagining the 'sea' in his stomach, then the 'rivers' and 'streams' that flowed around his body. Again he would start to slow and reduce the 'water' or as it were, chakra, around his body. It was a taxing and slow process but slowly he had managed to reduce the chakra flow around his body to one that was low, stealthy and subtle...not that he himself was totally aware of this. Without opening his eyes or moving his head he would say. "I guess I feel it...though i'm not really sure."* - Sun Dec  6 02:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: The better you get at it, the more obvious the feeling will be. - Sun Dec  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: And the harder it is for you to be detected. - Sun Dec  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Is there anything specific we should know about this technique? - Sun Dec  6 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: When you use it, you won't really be able to use anything but taijutsu until you stop using it. - Sun Dec  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I'm not sure whether to be grateful or bored... - Sun Dec  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I mean...this technique is only useful for not getting detected by sensor types...when will I ever fight one of those? - Sun Dec  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: They stay out of sight and combat so...this technique is only really useful if I know the enemy is a sensor...but then they can still see me easily... - Sun Dec  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm... - Sun Dec  6 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Any other questions? - Sun Dec  6 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I see. - Sun Dec  6 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head.* - Sun Dec  6 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....Right, well...I'll probably think up some squad formations and plans...See if we can get a few missions soon. - Sun Dec  6 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: That'll be cool. - Sun Dec  6 02:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Next session I'll probably have us spar each other, unless you guys want to go at it right now. - Sun Dec  6 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Of course, I only mean one on ones though. - Sun Dec  6 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe we can do thst next session. - Sun Dec  6 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Ryo must probably want to leave. - Sun Dec  6 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Yeah...Next session is fine. - Sun Dec  6 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Cool. - Sun Dec  6 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Thanks a bunch, Anguo-Sensei. - Sun Dec  6 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ....No problem... - Sun Dec  6 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: More than you think. - Sun Dec  6 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: You get more used to it as you use it more. - Sun Dec  6 11:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Begins become second nature to deal with the chakra flow. - Sun Dec  6 11:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I see. - Sun Dec  6 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: How are your reserves holding up? - Sun Dec  6 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Still okay for more training? - Sun Dec  6 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I am yes. - Sun Dec  6 11:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. Up for a spar?  - Sun Dec  6 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 12:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. Taijutsu? Ninjutsu? - Sun Dec  6 12:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) ignored everyone else at the waterfall, or at least he tried his best, he really did hate people seeing him train but it was becoming too bothersome to find decent places to train that people didn't already go to. With that he began building up a mass of his chakra in his stomach, moulding it up for use. Once he had built up a decent amount of his chakra he would begin to heat it within his stomach, slowly practising and refining how he did this. When his chakra was ready for use he would slowly go through a set of hand seals and take in a deep breath. His chakra would be pushed up to his chest and lungs as he kneaded it into the air he had previously taken in. He would work on how it was kneaded in, getting in general practise. Once everyone was ready he would pucker his lips and pivot his body forward, exhaling his chakra infused breath. The result would be a large and wide flamethrower bursting from his mouth, covering a large portion of the waterfall from view. He held this up for a moment or two before cutting the chakra supply off and dropping to a knee, tired and fatigued he would struggle to stay ontop of the water.* - Sun Dec  6 12:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Ninjutsu. - Sun Dec  6 12:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) slowly stands up and makes his way off of the water sitting down a little ways away from the two that were about to spar, for some reason he wanted to watch...perhaps it was because he didn't know what either of these two were capable of?* - Sun Dec  6 12:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Morning. - Sun Dec  6 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Morning. - Sun Dec  6 15:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hello. - Sun Dec  6 15:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) glances over to Yumiko. "How was your fight with Heiwa?"* - Sun Dec  6 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I need a squad. - Sun Dec  6 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: It was okay. - Sun Dec  6 16:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Also I suggest speaking to lady Kana. - Sun Dec  6 16:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: She's asleep right now, obviously. - Sun Dec  6 16:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) lets out a long breath through his facemask, bringing a hand up to his neck to massage it a little. He looked around as he did this, glancing briefly at everyone in the courtyard. His focus fell on Tengoku, instantly remembering the first squad training session they had. He remembered that he was so bored he fell asleep during it, only furthering his his opinion of squads being pointless. It made him slightly angry that everyone had pleaded him to give it a try and when he finally did? It was just as he imagined, dull, uninteresting and annoying. He started to wonder if things would get worse from here, knowing that he truly didn't want to go through another 'session' like that.

His focus slowly dropped off of Tengoku and flicked back to Yumiko, wondering how her, Heiwa and Nori got along so well. Was it because of their age? Their personalities? What made it so they could work in a team so well yet he struggled so much with it? He let out another sigh as his hand dropped from his neck to his side, he would now basically be staring at Yumiko as his mind wandered on the subjects he had previously been thinking about, his main thought being <How will I manage with this squad..?>* - Sun Dec  6 16:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Well then tell me what can you do? - Sun Dec  6 16:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Who, me? - Sun Dec  6 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I'm a strategist, I fight mid-to close. - Sun Dec  6 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: I wouldn't mind seeing that. - Sun Dec  6 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Uhh..Hi there. - Sun Dec  6 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Hey, Gravel. And in a little, Yumiko. - Sun Dec  6 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I just finished training. - Sun Dec  6 17:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: I never got your name? I guess you already know mines Gravel. - Sun Dec  6 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) whips his attention from Yumiko, straight ober to Gravel. "Hello."* - Sun Dec  6 17:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: It's Kyubishu. - Sun Dec  6 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Does much go on around here? Place seems pretty dull at the moment. - Sun Dec  6 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: We were attacked not to long ago. - Sun Dec  6 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Why would somebody want that to happen again, though? - Sun Dec  6 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: I don't mean it in that way though. It's just..Place is very empty. - Sun Dec  6 17:09:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm... - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Hey everyone. How's it going? - Sun Dec  6 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Hi. - Sun Dec  6 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Good, you? - Sun Dec  6 17:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Awesome, thanks. - Sun Dec  6 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Does anyone wish to spar?  - Sun Dec  6 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: It's strange. I've met Kana when she was a Genin, and to see her Mizukage now. It's amazing. - Sun Dec  6 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Kyu...bishu, correct? - Sun Dec  6 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Yup. - Sun Dec  6 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Why? - Sun Dec  6 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I'd like to spar with you. - Sun Dec  6 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: I need to get stronger. - Sun Dec  6 17:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gravel Dude(S3an) says: Ohh..You guys are going to fight? - Sun Dec  6 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Lady Mizukage, how you feeling? - Sun Dec  6 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: So. Shall we begin, Tengoku? - Sun Dec  6 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: . . . . . - Sun Dec  6 18:55:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Go ahead and start. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Maybe we should move away from this area first. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: It's fine, we spar over here all the time. It's an open area. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Alright, then. - Sun Dec  6 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Whelp... - Sun Dec  6 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: Seems like that wasn't finished. - Sun Dec  6 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) glanced towards the newcomer with his dark onyx eyes, then around the area to see if anyone was responding. His eyes would then lock onto Lera as he stepped up to the task. "Perhaps." is all he would reply with.* - Sun Dec  6 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Why is this clown standing beside me..? - Sun Dec  6 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) steps forward again, both to make an impression and to step away from Tengoku. "Business?" He questioned, giving his usual one worded replies to people.* - Sun Dec  6 20:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Sort of, He's an old friend. I'm checking to see if he's still alive. - Sun Dec  6 20:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I see. A shame... - Sun Dec  6 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Maybe he left the village after all.. - Sun Dec  6 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: How is Kirigakure doing? Its nice to see my home town filling up again. - Sun Dec  6 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mediocre. - Sun Dec  6 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I see. - Sun Dec  6 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Trouble? - Sun Dec  6 20:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Such an odd way of speaking. - Sun Dec  6 20:08:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: None of your concern. - Sun Dec  6 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Funny kid. - Sun Dec  6 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What is the favour. - Sun Dec  6 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I need a message to be passed along to the highest rank you can manage. - Sun Dec  6 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm sure someone is bound to remember me here. - Sun Dec  6 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I mean...I -was- a kirigakure shinobi once. - Sun Dec  6 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What message. - Sun Dec  6 20:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: To ask if Jirun Lanzi still lives. - Sun Dec  6 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And to send that message to Lera Hassan. - Sun Dec  6 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I assume that is you. - Sun Dec  6 20:15:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Understood. - Sun Dec  6 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Hassan? That sounds familiar. - Sun Dec  6 20:16:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'll make sure a message is sent to Sunagakure as soon as possible. - Sun Dec  6 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) caught whatever it was the money was being contained in, placing it away until further notice. "Appreciated."* - Sun Dec  6 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. Thanks for you help. - Sun Dec  6 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) watched the strange woman literally fly off into the air. He had a mental pause for a second before just shaking his head and letting out a sigh. <People are so weird.>

He turned around and moved to his original spot, pulling out the money given to him. He searched its contents, counting it out and making sure it wasn't trapped. Once he was done he placed it away again, wondering whether he should go find the Mizukage...not that she would really care in his mind.* - Sun Dec  6 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Ugh...Better go find Kana. - Sun Dec  6 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) pushes off of the post, walking out of the courtyard.* - Sun Dec  6 20:37:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: When isn't she? - Sun Dec  6 21:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: Kida?! - Sun Dec  6 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: 'Sup. - Sun Dec  6 21:08:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) steps up to greet the second stranger of the day seeing as everyone had gone quite...again. Once he was within adequate range of the masked man he would take a proper look at him, sizing him up as best he could. He folded his arms over his chest and stood to attention, a man that walks around with a mask on is not a man that should be trusted afterall.

"Business." He states.* - Sun Dec  6 21:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Business? - Sun Dec  6 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Business here. - Sun Dec  6 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Odd. - Sun Dec  6 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: What is? - Sun Dec  6 21:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: May I ask, how am I odd? Is it because of the mask? - Sun Dec  6 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Three things. - Sun Dec  6 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The mask, the clothing and the fact I have never seen you before. - Sun Dec  6 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: If you're wonder why I have one, it's because I suffered severe burns on my face. I don't like to show people them. I'm self conscious about it. - Sun Dec  6 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: My clothing? What's so weird about my fashion sense? - Sun Dec  6 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: And you realize how large a village we are? You won't meet everyone. - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's very...masking. - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Isn't that the purpose of clothes? To hide your nude self? - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And other things. - Sun Dec  6 21:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It matters not, I just have a hard time trusting those I cannot judge. - Sun Dec  6 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Hopefully we can get over that. - Sun Dec  6 21:34:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Spearman. - Mon Dec  7 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Roman(DagonWarhead) says: Hm? - Mon Dec  7 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Roman(DagonWarhead) says: What does thou want? - Mon Dec  7 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Wish to engage in combat? - Mon Dec  7 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Roman(DagonWarhead) says: I do. - Mon Dec  7 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) moves away from the general area of people. Once he was in position he would turn on the spot and look at Roman. "Come." He would state. He puts up both hand and clentches them into fists, the way he held both arms up gave him easy access to switch between attacking and defending, showing he had training in some form of taijutsu. His right foot went forward of his left, providing balance and stability to himself, he was ready to fight.

His eyes were set on Roman, mind, body and soul ready to fight.* - Mon Dec  7 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) cracks his neck from left to right, then circles his shoulders forwards and backwards to loosen them up. He would begin his movement forward as his opponent gave him the first move, not that it would do him much good considering his speed. He took his first step forward, walking at a quick but cautious pace. His upper body was limber for the most part, ready for that incredibly long spear Roman carried. For the most part he just moved forward cautiously, being mindful of his own footing to make sure he was providing himself with the best balance as he advanced.* - Mon Dec  7 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) thinks: This is the person I'm looking for. - Mon Dec  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: I've got next. - Mon Dec  7 02:46:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Heiwa, do me a favor. - Mon Dec  7 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Pull out this spear from me? - Mon Dec  7 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Does he not see we are in the middle of something? - Mon Dec  7 02:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns his body to the right, bending his left arm and pulling it in close to his body. His shoulder would be pushed forward and as he did this, he stepped off his left foot as hard as he could, effectively counter charging the shield with a shoulder bash. He would use his right leg for stability and balance, twisting his foot to the side to give himself friction resistance on the ground.

Should this succeed he would clash into Roman, both being held there. Should this not, he would probably be bashed back.* - Mon Dec  7 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Why does Nori -want- to do it? - Mon Dec  7 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: But who? - Mon Dec  7 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: .......But why? - Mon Dec  7 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) feels himself be partially lifted as the shield he intended to bash into, knocks him off course. His body and left arm would be knocked up and left, twisting his torso too. His head zipped down to his foot as he felt another slam against it. The spear would then come down and smash against his leg, yet have no affect. It would be like Roman had just smacked the shaft of his spear off the side of a tree, his leg shook a little but it appeared to have no affect.

Once the spear had made contact with his leg, he knew now was his time. As his body had been pushed away to the left by the shield, his right arm and shoulder would pivot back. Then in one swift motion his right shoulder pivoted forward and his arm extended directly around. His arm would sweep aroun in a wide arm, then bend as it neared Romans head. Should everything go to plan, Ryo would punch Roman right around the side of the head, effectively giving him a haymaker.* - Mon Dec  7 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) felt his hit connect, though like most of his opponents they took what he could dish out sadly, something he definately needed to work on. He would pull back his fist and tighten in his left arm again, putting up his boxer like stance. As he felt the spear hit his side he would grab the shaft of it tightly. His eyes would then flick from Roman to Heiwa, noticing something important was going on. He loosened his grip on Romans spear and extending his right arm, showing his palm in an attempt to both block the shield and stop his opponent "Stop. We're interupting something important." He would then nod in the direction behind Roman, shifiting his gaze over to the execution about to take place. He hoped Roman would follow his lead and stop their match.* - Mon Dec  7 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) moves over to join the crowd, giving Roman a nod just before he did.* - Mon Dec  7 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) whispers: Can you teach me how to use a spear? - Mon Dec  7 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: They're just going to execute that man as he is? A poor death. - Mon Dec  7 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: If he should die, he should do so on his feet, not grovelling on the floor. - Mon Dec  7 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) thinks: Lame. - Mon Dec  7 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) whispers: I'll have to first, get this spear out my stomach. - Mon Dec  7 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ..... - Mon Dec  7 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Squad one doesn't look very happy to be doing this. - Mon Dec  7 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ..... - Mon Dec  7 03:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Death. - Mon Dec  7 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Too common. People do stupid things to deserve it. - Mon Dec  7 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Then again, shinobi encounter death way too many times. - Mon Dec  7 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Guess that makes me stupid, heh. - Mon Dec  7 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) watched Nori plunge the blade into the man, he showed now emotion as it happened, this was his second time seeing death afterall. He looked at the body as it slumped against Nori, devoid of life. He was unhappy with how the death had been performed, to die in such a way is something he would never want to experience first hand. He wanted to die on his feet in combat, a soldier, a shinobi. He shook his head slightly and then pulled a hand up and around his neck, giving it a slight rub.

<What a way to go, and performed by a child too.>* - Mon Dec  7 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) says: ..... - Mon Dec  7 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Meinu, Sekitsui(TheButtNekkidBandit) thinks: Since when did we not bury the dead...even if they were terrorists...this is so disrespectful. - Mon Dec  7 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Looks like i'm going to be getting rid of a third corpse. - Mon Dec  7 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Mon Dec  7 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks over to Heiwa. "Are you going to clean up?"* - Mon Dec  7 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: ..How.. am I here..? - Mon Dec  7 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Thought I was done with this world... - Mon Dec  7 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Is this the newer generation of Kirigakure shinobi..? - Mon Dec  7 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: ..I can't even.. talk out loud.. - Mon Dec  7 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: What.. is going on..? - Mon Dec  7 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ... - Mon Dec  7 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: .... - Mon Dec  7 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: The..what was that even about? - Mon Dec  7 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) glances over at Tethys. He couldn't quite make out if he knew him or not and frankly he didn't really care. He didn't even acknowledge the current Mizukage, let alone a previous one. His focus would drift towards the body currently laid on the floor, he would start walking over to it as his hands met and began to unravel the wrappings around them. He didn't really want to do this since he was self concious of the scars on his hands but at least it would be respectful. If people did happen to take note of his hands, they would see quite a loose amount of scar tissue, particularly around his knuckles.

By the time his right hand was devoid of all hand wraps he would have knelt down next to the body. He brought it's hands together and tied them with the wraps, placing them into a respectful position. He would then do the same with his left hand, tying the feet together. He didn't say anything as he did this, nor did he say anything once he was finished. He simply stood back up and left the body as it was, odd for someone that supposedly hates people.

This of course would only happen should squad one have allowed him.* - Mon Dec  7 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes his eyes off the body, directing them to the caravan that just strolled into the area. He would walk forward a few paces to gauge who they were and why they were here. He kept quiet for now though, but that was usual for him anyway.* - Mon Dec  7 05:24:41 2015
