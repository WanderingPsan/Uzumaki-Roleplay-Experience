<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulled his arms up above himself, pushing them together to form a pseudo shield to block the kicks. His body would twist to the  As the kicks started he would immediately jump to the left. A few kicks would smash into his arms before he was knocked off to the left by the force of the kicks, hopefully pushing him out of the way of the full barrage of kicks. Though of course, he would have probably been caught at least half of them.* - Mon Dec  7 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would turn his head to look at the hands placed on his shoulders. Before he was even able to do so though, gravity would seemingly get one hundred times heavier, as if Yamcha had just turned on Vegeta's gravity setting. His back would instantly be smashing into the ground, specifically his shoulders. Pain would rock through his entire body as he knew instantly, damage had been done, perhaps even permanent. As he laid there he would attempt to move, it would only be met with severe, intense pain. He shouted out a scream, likely high-pitched because he was only a child of eight though it was not a scream anyone would likely expect to hear from a child of his age, a scream of pure pain.

His brain and body would be in a simultaneous spasm right now as if everyone pain receptor down his back had just been lit on fire. His arms would instantly drop back, almost as if he had passed out, though that wouldn't be the case. While the pain was so intense it stopped all movement, he wouldn't pass out infront of the enemy, not like this. If he was to die here and now, he'd do it staring death in the eye, not asleep on the ground.

Both his scapula would most likely be broken, the true extent of the damage obviously being unclear to him at the time but he knew something was definately wrong. He could barely focus on anything right now though, even tensing his muscles in pain severely hurt him. He tried to focus as best he could, scanning around furiously with his onyx eyes, he couldn't focus, breathing was hard, his mind in a total state of distress and disarray. He could do nothing but moan and shudder in pain from this moment on, his fight was done.* - Mon Dec  7 08:26:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) tries to shift his head around to get a view of what was going on, only to be met be an incredible amount of pain shooting down his entire left side. His body was in a state of shock, unable to do much except shake and shudder from the pain. He had to bite down hard as moaning in pain was causing his chest to inflate and deflate, causing him eve more discomfort, at this point even breathing hurt just from the simple movement of his chest doing up and down. He looked toward Yumiko with sorry and defeated eyes, he got in over his head and he paid the price for it, not just him but nearly him comrades too. In that moment he had a complete attitude flip, he -wanted- Yumiko to help him, he wanted it, more than he needed it.

He started to shake more as Rymei put a blade to Yumiko's throat, the swordswomans just being in view despite his rapidly blurring vision his pain was causing him. His right arm flipped out a little to reach out and stop Rymei, only to flop back down instant, a scream of pain following his movement. The pain attacked his brain, vision,  lungs, heart and entire left side of his body. It was even deafening his left ear, all his senses basically going haywire at this point.* - Mon Dec  7 09:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dagu(Dazzer) says: Hmmm? - Mon Dec  7 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would start to scream out in agony as his left shoulder was moved even slightly. Shooting pains spiking out into his body, head and arm as they continued to move him.* - Mon Dec  7 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) could only let himself be lifted...or dragged away. They would no his left arm would probably be flopping around and bending unusually by the shoulder, causing him even more pain and discomfort. Tears would finally start to stream down his face as his enemy left, he didn't want the enemy to see him cry but he didn't care if his comrades did...that and he could barely hold back from doing so, he was just a child after all. Inside, past all the pain, a dark feeling was developing within himself, this was his fault and he knew it, he knew the way he was, the way he acted, was killing him slowly...and this was just physical reinforcement to that fact.

He bit down on his lip hard, drawing a little blood. He sucked in a deep breath, "J-Just...do it!" He shouted at them through the pain, emotion and tears, commanding them to move him quickly.* - Mon Dec  7 09:46:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would have been taken away and examined by doctors. They would put his arm in a sling and give him some pain killers but other than that they couldn't do much for him, they weren't skilled after all. They gave him a room and sat him down in it, his new home for now. Even with the pain killers they gave him, the pain he was in was immense. His body shook and his head spun. His right arm would move slowly and wipe his face of tears and sweat. "I'm worthless..." He whispered to himself.* - Mon Dec  7 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) told the nurses he didn't want to see anyone, well he would attempt to tell them though all the pain and mental trauma he was going through right now. He sat upright in his bed, unable to lay down. There were four or five pillows all stacked in a certain way to make him as comfortable as possible, not that it helped. The amount of pain he was in constantly aggitated him mentally and physically. He couldn't sit in a certain way too long or breath too heavily because it would hurt too much. His mind had this constant 'pulse' or 'bang' of pain every few seconds, reminding him of how badly injured he was and how worthless he was, not that he needed reminding.

What hurt him the most was despite all his training, despite all that he was worth, he was nothing in the face of those opponents. They smacked him around harder and faster than he could have returned back to them, and they were more durable too. He couldn't do anything and in the end it only got him hurt, potentially killed. Shinobi that he barely knew had to put their lives on the line for him, all because he got way in over his head. What was he thinking trying to take all three of them on, provoking them, was he mad?

He endangered the lives of those that could potentially be his friends, yet he shuns them away for a reason he never fully understood. He understood that reason all too well now though. He shunned others because of his own weakness, because of his own fear. He wanted to protect others while that stayed out of his way so that they would never get hurt in the event of his failure...yet look what happened...the very thing he had tried his hardest to avoid was the very thing that happened. Now because of his weakness to people? He nearly died, potentially a cripple for life. Who was he going to protect now?

He slowly got out of bed, wincing and moaning as he did. He made his way over to the sink and reached out for it with his right hand, his arm flopping to his side as the pain in his right shoulder overtook his actions. He looked down at his right hand and gritted his teeth, reaching out ever so slowly and carefully again. He turned the cold tap and cupped a bit off water, splashing his face as best he could, getting his clothes wet in the process because of his limited movement, he let out a low moan of pain with every splash he attempted. After a few splashest he turned the tap off and just stared at himself in the mirror, his onyx eyes eternally reflecting back into each other over and over.

He pulled his facemask down, his mouth twitching in pain, letting out another low groan of pain. As he started into the mirror he looked not as his features but at himself, what and who he was. He swam in self pity for a moment or two, cursing his own stupidity and powerlessness. His eyes would then look up to his headband, the only shread of decency he had left. He attempted to take it off, yet his arm wouldn't let him, he was rapidly losing energy. He continued to stare at it, taking in what it symbolised. It meant he was apart of something, a village, a community, a squad.

His eyes fell back down to staring into each other in the mirror. He promised himself then and there that he would still be a shinobi, even if it pained him for the rest of his life. He would put aside his stupid, childish and petty ideals about teamwork and squads, none of that mattered now. He wanted to get stronger and make friends...friends that he could protect and inturn, they could protect him. He promised himself he would get over this injury one way or another, this wasn't going to beat him, he had years ahead of him yet and he would find a way to function as a shinobi again.

His vision would start to blur as he became weary and tired. He took his focus off the mirror and turned to the bed, slowly walking over to it as he kept his back and shoulders as straight as possible to relieve some of the pain. As he sat back down he would let out a slightly loud groan of pain, biting his lip half way through to keep himself quiet. He rested up against the pillows and stared down at his half limp left arm. He was tired but he knew that with such pain, he wouldn't be sleeping much. He just stared down at his arm and got as comfortable as possible. While this was a painful and debilitating lesson for him, it was one he took to heart, a most humbling experience for the young Shinobi.* - Mon Dec  7 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns his head at the sound of his door knocking, he would quickly wipe his face of any tears and pulls his facemask up with his right arm, causing a small amount of pain to shoot from his left shoulder. "C-Come in..." He said, raising his voice as best he could.* - Mon Dec  7 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head slowly, being cautious to not move to fast in any way as the slightest sudden movement caused pain and discomfort. His dark onyx eyes locked onto Heiwa, they looked sore and red, a clear indication of his upset and state of mind. He looked pretty awful, quite unlike a child of his age should look. His face, what you could see of it, was incredibly pale and tired. His left arm was also pretty limp and devoid of movement in its sling.

"P-Pain...so much...pa-" He started to get upset, choking on his words slightly. He took in a deep breath and cleared his throat with a heavy cough, causing him to shift in his seat from pain and discomfort. "Just...painful. What do you need H-Heiwa..?"* - Mon Dec  7 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) shifts to his right, continually causing him pain. "O-Of course I can." He states, though he wasn't totally sure he could. His legs would slip off the right side of the bed and tap onto the ground lightly. He took in a deep breath and squinted his eyes as he pushed off the bed, standing on his own to feet. He let out a low groan of pain, staggering on his feet a little. He put his right arm out in an attempt to balance himself, holding like that until he was stable. His right arm would then drop to his side, easing up the discomfort all around the top half of his back.

"I-is there a problem..? Do you need me to f-fight..?" He wondered if they were under attack. In a show of good faith and to make himself seem better than he was, he foolishly would offer his assistance, even if the state he was in.* - Mon Dec  7 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks over Heiwa, noticing Yumiko standing in the doorway. He noted and appreciated her concern but shook his head at her, his focus then directed back to Heiwa, taking in what he said.

He nodded his head after Heiwa had finished his sentance. "T-Then...what are we waiting for..? Let's...go as soon as possible." His eyes would squint in pain again but he was trying to put it off as much as possible.* - Mon Dec  7 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) starting to move forward slowly, being cautious of his steps. His body was kept as straight as possible to prevent movement of his shoulder. For the most part though, he was ok to walk for now.* - Mon Dec  7 20:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) steps out of the caravan incredibly slowly, holding onto whatever railing it had fiercely with his right hand to steady himself. He really wasn't ready to travel and the various bumps along the way caused him great pain. He tried to adjust his left arm in the sling but even the slightest movement of it sent a shockwave of pain through his body. He just had to tough it out and tried to keep up with Heiwa and Yumiko.* - Mon Dec  7 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm. - Mon Dec  7 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: A priest more or less, perhaps I could find Kiyoko. - Mon Dec  7 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Come. - Mon Dec  7 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) tries his best to keep up, letting out the occasional low groan of pain.* - Mon Dec  7 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Uh, we need a medic to help this guy out. - Mon Dec  7 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Which guy?..Oh what's wrong? - Mon Dec  7 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Is Kiyoko-san around? - Mon Dec  7 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) has his left arm in a sling, facially he looks incredibly unwell and in a lot of stress. It one looked closely at his left arm, they would notice how limp it seemed to be, especially from his shoulder.* - Mon Dec  7 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: WEll. A bit agitating sometimes, though. Since people always need ya. - Mon Dec  7 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Who are these guys anywho. . ? - Mon Dec  7 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) says: Hey guys Wahts going on here. - Mon Dec  7 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: Kirigakure Shinobi. - Mon Dec  7 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Dunno. Anywho, get them to a hospital or something? I can't exactly heal. - Mon Dec  7 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'll talk to them after. - Mon Dec  7 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: For? - Mon Dec  7 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I can heal but to an extent.. - Mon Dec  7 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Things aren't going to well back in their home village.  - Mon Dec  7 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: Of course. - Mon Dec  7 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: They have a corrupt leader. - Mon Dec  7 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: They also don't have the balls to stand up to her. - Mon Dec  7 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: .... - Mon Dec  7 21:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. .Yeah. I heard Kana ain't doing a bang up job. - Mon Dec  7 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Did she just say that? - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Icould really go give her a wedgie if it's that bad. - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: They watched her throw me out for nothing! - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wedgies always set people straight. - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Watanabe, Fujiko(Lil Neicey) says: It's only a matter of time before you two are next. - Mon Dec  7 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls away as the stranger touches his shoulder. He would let out a loud, audible and childish scream of pain as he did. "D-Don't..." He said quickly and breathlessly, backing up a little as he did. It was clear his wound needed something a lot more than basic care.* - Mon Dec  7 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Iza. Can you take that dude to the hospital, though? - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Yeah. - Mon Dec  7 21:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Ah. Then what in Kirigakure made you all come here? - Mon Dec  7 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: L-Lack of...skilled...doctors... - Mon Dec  7 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The repeated invasions have lead to a lack of medical staff. - Mon Dec  7 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Our most skilled is missing. - Mon Dec  7 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Actually, Kiyoko san is great. - Mon Dec  7 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: @ fuji - Mon Dec  7 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well he'll have to sit in the hospital for now. - Mon Dec  7 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: For now. - Mon Dec  7 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would do as he was told, following Iza. He wasn't about to argue against medical treatment.* - Mon Dec  7 21:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Just choose a room. - Mon Dec  7 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'll let Kiyoko know you're here as soon as she comes around. - Mon Dec  7 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods to Izanami. "Th-Thank you..." He would then make his way to the room on his left.* - Mon Dec  7 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Here he is. - Mon Dec  7 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: And uh, thank you for defending me, Kiyoko-san.  - Mon Dec  7 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yes, of course Izanami-chan... course... I probably would have had my ass kicked had you not thrown that pebble at him. - Mon Dec  7 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Haha, you know I wouldn't let that happen. - Mon Dec  7 22:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns to face Kiyoko, taking his time in doing so. He brough his right arm around to his left and tried to pull it infront of himself, this obviously caused the child a great amount of pain and discomfort, enough for him to give a groan of pain. Once he was settled in position he would look at Kiyoko with his distress and emotion filled onyx eyes. His facemask and headband would probably look quite moist, sweat from the pain he was in. He also looked quite ill.

"H-Hello..." The child said in a weak voice.* - Mon Dec  7 22:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: -omit- - Mon Dec  7 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Why is it always children? - Mon Dec  7 23:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'm just gonna check you out okay hun? - Mon Dec  7 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: No need to be scared. - Mon Dec  7 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: D-Do...what you need... - Mon Dec  7 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) would let the doctor do what she needed to, gritting his teeth in pain if she were moving his arm around. At first she would see massive black and blue bruising all around his left shoulder, including the chest, shoulderblade and his neck left side neck region area also having extensive bruising. The two most prominent things she would notice would be his collar bone being out of place and his shoulder being dislocated at the joint.

On the inside however, the case was a little more advanced than he himself thought. While his shoulder was simply dislocated at the joint, the case would not be the same the higher up she examined. His collar bone was infact ripped straight off his shoulder, this would be known as Acromial Detatchment, a fancy name for the acromial muscle being ripped straight from the shoulder, effectively seperating his collar bone and shoulder bone.

The damage did not stop there however. Should she examine his back she would notice a severe amount of bruising and inflammation on his left shoulderblade area. Upon closer examination she would find out that his scapula bone was indeed broken. Basically his entire shoulder being in exterme pain and completely out of action. It should also be advised that his shoulder was -not- popped back into place because the [NPC] doctors did not know the full extent of the damage and therefore, would not risk damaging him further by doing anything with his shoulder.

Ryo would sit there, probably topless as Kiyoko examined him thoroughly, the sight of a child with such extensive damage and fierce bruising probably being quite surprising. Ryo would try to hold back his emotion as much as possible but all through the examination he would whimper, moan and groan from the pain as the damage was truly quite harrowing on both his mind and his body.* - Mon Dec  7 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head slowly, taking in everything Kiyoko was relaying to him as best he could. He could feel his head start to hurt as he took in the gravity and weight of the damage done to his body, it being a lot worse than he had originally imagined. A single tear started to run down his face, no longer being able to hold his emotions back. "I-I understand...J-Just do whatever you can...please." His voice was stricken with grief and distress. He started to break down a little, tears flooding down either of his cheeks. This might surprise Heiwa considering Ryo's usual hardened exterior.

What really hurt him the most inside was his own weakness, selfishness and pride. He had caused this, his weakness, his pride. Because of this, the only thing he was good at was nearly taken away and even if he had gotten lucky enough to still be a shinobi and use taijutsu...would it ever truly be the same for him again? He hung his head in shame for the moment, letting his tears drip down onto his legs and the bedding.* - Mon Dec  7 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Well, the first surgery. - Mon Dec  7 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Well.. unless I get permission from Sanoke to travel to Kirigakure... yes. - Tue Dec  8 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: We will have to work things out between the two kage's. - Tue Dec  8 00:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you probably need to go home then. - Tue Dec  8 00:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Sh-she's...uncaring of... - Tue Dec  8 00:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ... - Tue Dec  8 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) is starting to become quite disorientated because of the sedative. His words becoming slurred.* - Tue Dec  8 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Oh. - Tue Dec  8 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Right... - Tue Dec  8 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: He's probably not used to the drugs. - Tue Dec  8 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She is...the Mizukage... - Tue Dec  8 00:05:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Leave... - Tue Dec  8 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...Uh...someone want to translate? - Tue Dec  8 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: The Mizukage wouldn't really notice his disappearance. - Tue Dec  8 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: So you would leave him here then alone? - Tue Dec  8 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Heiwa go... - Tue Dec  8 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: ...I couldn't really stay in Suna myself. - Tue Dec  8 00:06:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I'll speak to Sanoke. - Tue Dec  8 00:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: I hope that's more of the sedatives talking.. - Tue Dec  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: A few hours from now. - Tue Dec  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Claiming rogue status isn't really smart. - Tue Dec  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Then we can transport you back to Kirigakure. - Tue Dec  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: My fiance is from Kirigakure originally so it shouldn't be a problem for me to enter the village yes? - Tue Dec  8 00:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls his right hand up to his face, giving it a rub as his body becomes limber and relaxed, he'd even start to sway a little. He would probably look like a child refusing to sleep even though he's tired.* - Tue Dec  8 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Can't...enter... - Tue Dec  8 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mizukage...mean... - Tue Dec  8 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I'm a special jounin of the village - like Izanami here, I can allow persons into the village. - Tue Dec  8 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: As long as you're in his care you'll be given full access. - Tue Dec  8 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: --Izanami is a chuunin...uh...yeah. - Tue Dec  8 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Anyhow. - Tue Dec  8 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Alright, that works.. we can go speak with Sanoke now? - Tue Dec  8 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) thinks: Lera is gonna be PISSED. - Tue Dec  8 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) thinks: I meant like Izanami in how she can give access as a chunnin. - Tue Dec  8 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  8 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: So Izanami it's been a while. - Tue Dec  8 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns around and lays back in the hospital bed, he would stare straight at Yumiko with a silly smirk on his face, unlike his usual self to say the least. Yumiko would note he has no clothing on his upper body right now, revealing the true extent of his injuries. The left side of his neck, left shoulder and upper left chest/arm area all had extensive black and blue bruising across it, looking quite painful. If she looked closer, she would also notice his left shoulder was hanging slightly out of place and his collar bone was also sticking out. His hands were also devoid of their usual wrappings, showing off the old small scars along his fingers and knuckles.

Despite all this though, he had a silly smirk on his face, aimed straight at Yumiko.* - Tue Dec  8 00:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: The Kazekage is going to send a letter to the Mizukage. - Tue Dec  8 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: In the mean time do you mind if he remains here? - Tue Dec  8 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Yeah he can stay here. - Tue Dec  8 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns his head towards Kiyoko, his facial expression being close to what you would expect from someone on a high. He just gave her a smirk and a slow nod.* - Tue Dec  8 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Very well - we'll need to return soon anyways.  - Tue Dec  8 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: ...right, it's understandable. I will send you updates via mail. - Tue Dec  8 00:46:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I'll try to visit when I can. - Tue Dec  8 00:52:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head at Heiwa, giving him a sleepy look and a silly smirk.* - Tue Dec  8 00:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Heiwa should we rest here before heading back? Get something to eat, drink, probably spend the night? - Tue Dec  8 00:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: I don't think so..We've spent enough time as is. - Tue Dec  8 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Besides, Nori is probably wondering where we are. - Tue Dec  8 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Right...well then. - Tue Dec  8 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Thank you for helping Ryo. We'll let you get to it. - Tue Dec  8 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: Come on, Yumiko. Let's go. - Tue Dec  8 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) slakes back into his bed a little, bending his right arm up and waving it casually to Heiwa and Yumiko. "Bye bye..." he slurred.* - Tue Dec  8 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Sekara) says: Get better. - Tue Dec  8 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: it seems like a waste of time - Tue Dec  8 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) was woken up from his slumber by one of the nurses, groggy but awake he sat up. He was offered a glass of water to help wake him up as they had something to tell him, he accepted the water and drank slowly, slightly worried with what they had to tell him. One nurse sat him down and told him to remain as calm as possible. They explained that as he slept, further research was done into the wounds he carried and the procedure that needed to be performed. They explained that with his injuries being so significant, not only was there a low rate of success, even if the surgery was a success he would still be quite debilitated as a fighter.

His heart grew heavy, a large weight pushing against his back and chest. He felt his whole life sink away. His career as a shinobi was over, hell...his life as a normal person was over...and he was only eight years old. It was at this point he truly fell into dispair, knowing that from this point on life was only going to be pointless, painful and debilitating for him. He fell into a downward spiral, simply looking at the nurses with cold and unfocused eyes. He barely took in the care they offered him, simply nodding his head over and over until they had no more to say.

Once they were done he said his thank you's and requested he be left alone for a few hours to think on his options, though in reality he already knew what he was going to do. As soon as he was left alone he walked up to the mirror in his room and just stared into it, uncaring of his pain right now. He stared into himself for a long time, taking in all that had happened. He grew angry and punched the mirror with his right hand, smashing it and spreading shards off glass all over the sink. There was a large piece of glass sticking out from the mirror, without a second thought he grabbed it and yanked it out, slicing his hand slightly.

He looked into the shard, taking one last look at what he had become. Tears started streaming down his face as he looked away. He lifted his limp left arm onto the counter of the sink, exposing the underside of it. He took the shard and stabbed it into his wrist, dragging up slowly, he could barely feel the pain from it anyway at this point. He placed his rapidly gushing arm into the sink and ran the water, quickening the pace at which he bled out. This is what he had become, this is how he would end.

Eventually he would grow too weak to stand, collapsing to the floor. His body started to shut down to conserve oxygen and blood, a futile effort to cling onto life. Inevitably his mind would slowly start shutting down as it became devoid of oxygen, prompting the start of his last few moments. He laid there with a great many regrets fluttering though his mind, silly things like never meeting a girl he liked or never getting to his tenth birthday. He took his last breath before his body finally shut down and his vision faded, he was gone from this world. At least perhaps now...he could see his family again.* - Tue Dec  8 02:46:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns around to Kuro. "I-It was nice meeting y-you mister monk K-Kuro sir..." With that, he would try to exit the the room.* - Tue Dec  8 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks into the room, unable to make eye contact with Rias for too long he would either look down at his feet or around the room. Once he had stopped moving forward though, his head would dart straight down, staring at the floor. He was shy. "Mm...M-miss H-Hokage...lady...c-can I...Mm..." He fell slient, his usual fumble of words not pointing towards what he wanted.* - Tue Dec  8 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) finds a nice spot at the training field to begin training in. He stands there and takes in the atmosphere of the area, readying his mind to begin training. His timid nature seems to instantly melt away as his true demeanor comes to light, the fighter within him. He brings both his fists up, holding them in a boxer like stance. His feet would then part, one moving infront of the other to give him balance and stability. As quick as a flash he would then set off from his position, rapidly gaining speed. He jumps off his left foot and pulls his body back, pivoting his lower body forward. His right leg would then swing up and bend at the knee, extending as soon as it was high enough which would mark him performing a flying kick, also known as Dynamic Entry. He brings his right leg down and extends his left leg out, bringing himself to an unsteady halt. <More tension, better timing, increased speed.> He though, going over his flaws in his own head.* - Tue Dec  8 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns around on the spot and brings his fists up near to his face, holding his right fist slightly above the other as it was his dominant arm, to others they could tell he has knowledge of boxing. His left leg went infront of his right and he tensed his body, taking in a deep breath. As he took in said breath he would begin his run, taking a few quick steps before slamming his left foot down and leaping off it. He would practise how he manuevered his body back and tucked his left leg in. His right leg would then be tucked in closely before extending out with all his strength. He would travel in the air for a second before extending his left leg out and bringing his right leg down to the ground, grinding him to a halt.

For now he knew he just needed more general practise with the technique before he actually started refining specifics of it. With that in mind he would turn around on the spot and raise his fists up as before, placing his footing in the same position too. He sucked in a deep breath and then set off, running as fast as he could within a second or two. He waited until his next step would be his left foot and then brought it down hard, bouncing himself into the air with said step. As he became airborne his body would pivot back and his left leg would bend at the knee, tucking itself close to him. His right leg would then bend at the knee too, raising up as it did before extending out with force.

As he landed back down he would take note of how unsteady on his feet he was, something to work on later. However, he was happy with his progress of the technique and knew that with a few more practises, he would be comfortable with trying to refine his use of the technique. With that, he turned around again and got into position. He left foot went forward as he right stayed back to provide stability and balance to his body. His fists then came up close to his face, held in a way that allowed for both blocking and striking. He set off on a run, taking a few steps before pushing off of his left leg hard and making himself airborne. His left leg would then bend and get pulled close to his body as his right leg did the opposite, extending out hard and fast. He traveled like that for a moment before both his legs hit the ground, skidding him across it until he came to a grinding halt.* - Tue Dec  8 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns around again, getting ready to practise dynamic entry again. He would spot Shin and instantly slide back into his usual recluse and timid nature. His proficient fighters stance would drop and the little nine year old boy persona would shine through. He would become noticably awkward and worried if Shin came closer to him, looking down at his feet or fiddling with his hands nervously.* - Tue Dec  8 19:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns on the spot, quickly leaving the area.* - Tue Dec  8 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) came back to the training field to continue his previous training session, at least those people turning up gave him a little time to rest. He needed to get back to training though so he resumed his previous position. He got into his stance and prepared himself, taking in a deep breath. He shot off, running for a few seconds before sending himself through the air with his left leg. As soon as he lifted off the ground his left leg would then arch back and bend at the knee. His right leg would then bend and pull in close to his body before being extended forward with all his strength. He would travel through the air for a second or two before his legs hit the ground, knocking him off balance as he skidded across the floor.

Once he came to a stop he stood and balanced himself, thinking about what he needed to improve. First he knew he needed to improve the timing of the technique and since this was the easiest to refine, he would start with that. He pulled his fists up and placed his left foot infront of his right, his fighting stance made for balance and stability. He would set off again, running for a few paces before leaping forth off his left leg. He would attempt to transition his left leg back and his right leg forward to perform the dynamic entry in the same motion to better the timing of the attack. It seemed slow at first but it was faster than doing one leg first, then the other.

Once he landed and steadied himself he would turn around take in a deep breath, readying his body for his next attempt at Dynamic Entry. His fists would go up and his feet would take the correct positions as if he were to be in the midst of battle already. He began his run, taking a few fast steps before leaping off his left foot once again. His body would lean back as he prepared to perform the flying kick. His left leg would bend at the knee and pivot inwards to hishis body as his right leg bent in and then extended out as hard as he could to fully perform the kick. The timing was still a little off but he knew that if he continued training it, he would get it down eventually.

With his progress being satisfactory he saw no reason to stop now. Once he had landed and got himself sorted he would turn around and exhale, letting out a large breath of air. He would then inhale an equally large breath of air, holding up his fists and sliding his feet into place. Once ready, his feet began to move as he made a sprint forward. Within a second or two he was leaping off his left leg and pivoting his entire body back as he went through the air. His left leg would then bend at the knee and be pulled into his body to provide defence while his right leg simultaneously bent at the knee and then extended forward with force, completing the dynamic entry yet again. He landed on his feet and ground to a halt, stumbling a little as he did as he wasn't the most graceful on his toes. <I'm progress well...I need to keep this up.>* - Tue Dec  8 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) would turn around immediately after thinking this, exhaling the breath he had previously taken in before. He limbered his body up and then sucked in a deep breath, his body standing to attention as he did by raising his fist up and stepping his feet into their correct positions. He ran forward and once he was ready and came to step off his left foot he would push off his leg hard, sending himself through the air. His left leg would then immediately bend at the knee and snap to protect his body as he right leg did the exact opposite, extending forward with as much force as he could muster to perform the flying kick. The timing of this was now very good and he practised it one last time to make sure he was doing everything right.* - Tue Dec  8 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) came to the training field to continue training Dynamic Entry. It had been a short while since he had trained this so he figured he'd start out with a preliminary practise just to get a feel for it. He quickly stretched his body out and then brought his fist up to his face, position his feet one infront of the other with his left being the forward foot. He would breath slowly and then take in a deep breath, sprinting off forward. After a few fast steps he would leap off his left leg and pull it in as his right leg bent in and then extended out with as much force as he could muster. After he landed he went over what he had practised in his head, remembering where he had last left off and what he needed to train.

He turned around and got into his basic fighting stance, fists up and feet in place. Now that he had the timing of the technique down he would need to focus on increasing the rate as which he could perform the technique. With  his next goal in mind he would start his run, taking a few well time steps before leaping off of his left foot as always. Once he was in the air he would bend his left leg at the knee and tuck it close to his body. At the same time he would then try to bend his right leg and extend it out forward as fast as he possibly could, trying to increase the speed he could perform the mid-air kick. He would land a second or two later, stumbling a little from momentum.

As he recovered and thought back on his last practise of the technique he would understand that he needed to balance between tension and flexibility. He turned and set his sights forward, raising his fists up and correcting his footing. He set off fast and leaped into the air even faster. His body would pivot and arch back as he bent and tucked his left leg close to him. In that same motion his right leg would be brought up and then as quickly as he possibly could, sprung it forward to perform the kick. As he did this he would try and keep his leg as loose as possible until the last moment, allowing for faster and more fluid movements.

Once he had landed he fumbled across the ground a bit, grinding himself to a halt. Without wasting anytime he would calm his breath as best he could and regain his posture, standing to attention by reforming his basic stance. Within a moment or two he would sprint off again, leaping off his left leg when the time was right. His body would move in conjunction with his legs, pivoting back to give his legs more range and set them up for a kick. His left leg would tuck in close to his body as his right leg did the same. His right leg would then twist slightly before extending out forward, straighten his leg into an air kick as fast as he possibly could.

When he next landed he had a small smirk on his face, his kick was gradually getting faster and faster as he worked harder and harder at it. Once he had properly stopped and regained his balance he would attempt to control his breath as much as possible while he formed his usual fighting posture. With everything set he took off for a fifth time, sprinting as fast as he could. Within a few steps he would be leaping off his left leg again, pushing himself forward into the air. His left leg would clamp shut close to his body as soon as it left the ground and as it did, his right leg would quickly follow. His right leg would then extend out as fast as he could make it in a kicking fashion, pivoting his body back as he did to perform the dynamic entry once again.* - Wed Dec  9 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) decided to switch thing up a little. He had been practising Dynamic Entry by leaping off his left foot and kicking with his right. He supposed that this may not always be possible so a change of pace was in order. He got into his usual stance and let out an exhale. He then took in a deep breath and set off. He had to run for a little further than usual but eventually he was able to leap off of his right leg. He got slightly confused as he went to get ready to kick with his right too. He got everything in order as quickly as possible though, tucking both legs in one after the other and then springing his left leg out to perform the mid-air kick.

He tripped and stumbled more than usual as his feet hit the ground because he was not used to landing on his right leg first. Once he got his balance back though, he would turn around and set off again. This time it was a little easier than before, having leaped off his right leg earlier than his previous attempt. He still got a little confused on which leg he was kicking with but he managed to get both under control quicker than before, tucking his right in first and then his left before he performed the kick with his left leg. Landing was a little better this time as he remembered he would be landing on his right leg first, rather than his left.

Letting out a deep exhale he would allow his body to calm first before continuing on. Once he was ready he held his fists up and got his feet in position, sticking out his right foot first rather than his left. It took him the usual amount of time to run and then leap off his right leg this time. Once he became airborne he would arch his body back and then tuck his right leg in. In the same motion his left leg would twist, raise up and then tuck in before being extended forward with as much force as he could muster. While the left kick was faster and forceful it wasn't as fast as his right kick, something he still needed to work on.

He landed soft but due to him not being the most sturdy and solid on his feet, he would trip and stumble as he hit the dirt. He dusted himself off and decided to give this one more try, knowing he was close to getting this down. He took in a deep breath and got into his basic stance, right foot forward instead of his left. He took off, running for a short distance before leaping off his right foot. Once in the air his right leg would tuck into his body with his left. His left leg would then twist before extending out, performing the Dynamic Entry perfectly with his left leg. He would hit the dirt again, stumbling around as he attempted to come to a full stop. Once he was stopped, he just stood there for the moment, thinking on what next to train.* - Wed Dec  9 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nearly jumps out of his own skin as the armored man shouts over to him. Instantly his stance would drop and the child would slump into a shy and timid state. He slowly turned around and was surprised by what he saw, slightly frightened actually. His eyes would look down at his shoes as he gave a worried facial expression. His right arm would move up to and cluntch onto his upper left arm, showing how shy the boy was.

"I um...Mm...I..." He replied back quietly.* - Wed Dec  9 02:34:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks over to Shin, the boy seemed a little more confident now that time had passed and he had been forcing himself to be a little more open towards people. "H-Hello...Shin..." His voice was still quite shakey but he tried his best to sound confident in himself.* - Wed Dec  9 16:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Without a teacher, I have struggled to learn and gain information. - Wed Dec  9 16:14:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks up to Shin cautiously, looking around the room with a slightly worried expression. His right hand would find its way to his upper left arm, rubbing it slightly. "M-Miss...Mm...Ho-...L-Lady Hokage..." His tone was tense and unsteady as he spoke.* - Wed Dec  9 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Hokage**(LionHunter) says: Yes my love? - Wed Dec  9 17:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks down at his feet, falling silent. His shyness and embarrasment around others still quite present even though he was ten years old now.* - Wed Dec  9 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Spit it out kid so I can go get my food - Wed Dec  9 17:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks up, quickly nodding his head to the Hokage. "Th-Thank you Miss...Lady...Hokage...Sir." He fumbled through words, not really sure what to call her without offending her. He would then turn to Shin and wait for him to leave, following behind him once he did.* - Wed Dec  9 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Lessgo - Wed Dec  9 17:27:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: F-food..? - Wed Dec  9 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Okay - Wed Dec  9 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: You use taijutsu so veges are probably best anyway - Wed Dec  9 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: So kid, what do you have planned as a ninja - Wed Dec  9 17:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What do you plan to specialize in - Wed Dec  9 17:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked down into his Ramen bowl, trying to avoid eye contact as much as he possibly could, he still hadn't got that down quite yet as he thought it was rude to stare into someones eyes. He nods his head slowly, "R-right..." he repondes with to the comment about vegetables being good for him.

When Shin asked about what kind of ninja he wanted to be he would become noticably more timid and distressed. Both of his hands started to tap against the table counter as he furiously thought of things to say. "I-I um...I would...I mean...I am...Mmmmmm." In truth he was aiming to become proficient in both Taijutsu and Kenjutsu.

An awkward silence would ensue as he grabbed at his thoughts, trying desperately to think of things to say, he didn't know what the right answer was and was afraid of making Shin angry with his answer. After a few silent moments had passed he would noticably become more worried as he stressed over the fact he thought he was being rude to Shin with his silence. "A-a good ninja..." He would blurt out, saying anything at this point.* - Wed Dec  9 17:50:30 2015
