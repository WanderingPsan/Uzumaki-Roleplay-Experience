He spat out a bit of spit and blood before dropping to the ground, awake but not moving.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) comes running up as quickly as he can, spotting Rias and Chikyu. They might notice a certain difference about him. He wasn't a recluse and laid back as usual, he seemed attentive and on edge. He approach Chikyu straight away, holding his right arm out to her. "Smash my cast. I'm going to the front lines."* - Mon Nov 23 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Front lines? - Mon Nov 23 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Edge is here. - Mon Nov 23 22:26:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: My arms all healed it's fine. - Mon Nov 23 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Akira you are not going any where... neither are you Chikyu - Mon Nov 23 22:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I won't sit here while others die for me. - Mon Nov 23 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) held out his right arm. "Just grab the top of the cast and rip it in half or something."* - Mon Nov 23 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Dont... - Mon Nov 23 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) fell to the floor, his left hand clutching at where she had punched him. He was dizzy and disorientated but he refused to give it, not at a time like this. He was determined more than ever that this would be his redeeming moment, whether he lived or died. He would stand back up, stumbling a little as he did. He reached his left hand forward and lightly grabbed onto Chikyus chin, pulling her in closer as he leaned in and planted a kiss on her forehead instead of the usual flick. "It's ok Chikyu. I became a Shinobi to protect the ones I love and care about. I couldn't protect my family when konoha was destroyed...and i'm not going to let that same thing happen with the ones I love now. Please." He said, holding his right arm out one more time.* - Mon Nov 23 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was punched in the stomach, causing him to bend over from the pain. He was then knocked back by the punch to his face, leaving him laying on his back. He struggled to sit up because of how hard Chikyu hit him, he understood why she was being like that though...she just couldn't understand his way of thinking either. He crawled over and took a seat next to Rias as he attempted to catch him breath and recover from three hits off Chikyu.

He looked over to Rias with sorry eyes. "All I wanted...was to protect you, Chikyu and the friends I made. In the end...i'm sat his groveling in the sand."* - Mon Nov 23 22:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) continued on. "What kind of man am I..?"* - Mon Nov 23 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) would by now probably have a forehead of steel since everyone decided to hit him there. His eyes widened when she pulled him closer though, it was strange to him seeing as they were at odd ends only hours ago. "I'm sure the Kazekage is fine, he's the strongest shinobi in the world backed up by the strongest and largest fighting force in the world, everyone will be fine." He said, trying to look her directly in the eyes to show he meant what he said.

He would then take his right arm and attempt to snake it around which ever arm of hers was closest to him, also attempting to hold onto her hand tightly as he could sense she needed comfort. That arm had a cast on it so it may have been uncomfortable on her skins but he caused she might not care right now. "I really am sorry about the pain I cause you Rias...truly." He would then pause and look up at her.

"When this is all over i'm going to cut the crap out, no more whining or getting in your way. I want to be your friend again Rias..." He would push himself all the more closer, using his body language to show he was here for comfort and meant what he said.* - Mon Nov 23 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Hey... - Mon Nov 23 23:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: We should probably move...we're a little exposed out here... - Mon Nov 23 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: No.... - Mon Nov 23 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: We are ok here - Mon Nov 23 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: You sure..? We're backed into a corner here...I think we'd be safer in the mansion or a house... - Mon Nov 23 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: No... here is fine, dont leave - Mon Nov 23 23:58:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: I know you can...but i'd rather fall dead for you than endure watching you protect me while I sit around. - Tue Nov 24 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) squeezes Rias's hand a little, he seemed anxious.* - Tue Nov 24 00:04:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Thanks for uh...intentionally taking me out quickly in that spar...I could see you felt bad about hurting me before. - Tue Nov 24 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: I'm not really mad about my arm though...if you ever feel the need to smack me around a little then feel free, knowing me I probably deserve it anyway. Heheh. - Tue Nov 24 00:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: Shh... dont talk anymore... - Tue Nov 24 00:36:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Alright...sorry I talk too much.... - Tue Nov 24 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls Rias in closer, turning his head to the side as he rests it on her shoulder. "You should take this armor off more...kinda hard to rest on this hard stuff..." He would whisper before finally going silent.* - Tue Nov 24 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: Its ok... focus on resting - Tue Nov 24 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: We'll be fine...don't worry. - Tue Nov 24 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Rias is acting a little unusual... - Tue Nov 24 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Hey Rias I know this is a little out of the blue but...when we first met in konoha did you feel anything for me at all..? - Tue Nov 24 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: You are cute, but... not really - Tue Nov 24 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Heh...yeah I thought so. I asked you out to that tea shop to see if you did but...obviously that didn't turn out as planned/ - Tue Nov 24 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Do you feel anything for me now..? Even if it's just friendship..? I'm not sure you'll ever see me how I see you but...I at least want us to remain friends. - Tue Nov 24 01:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) whispers: Look, I like you Akira... I really do, but Im not looking for a relationship at all - Tue Nov 24 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: That's not what I mean but I understand...I just want to know if you still consider a friend. - Tue Nov 24 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: still consider me a friend* - Tue Nov 24 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) whispers: Because honestly after our fight...I thought you wouldn't even want to be within ten feet of me. - Tue Nov 24 01:11:40 2015
