<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) walks into the ramen place to get some food and chill. He froze in place as he saw a fair few people seated. He considered turning and leaving, but then again...he needed to socialise more. With a sigh he walked further in and would ask, "Mind if I sit down..?" to the black haired male.* - Sat Nov  7 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) took note of the woman with similar hair to himself as he sat down, she looked a little older than him but hey, he'd still checked her out. He would then proceed to order himself a bowl of ramen, fit with all kinds of meat they served. He stayed quiet for now as he waited for his order, not wanting to interrupt their conversation.* - Sat Nov  7 02:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) slouched over in his seat, placing an elbow on the table and holding a palm out to rest his head in. He would tap the table with a finger lightly to not being annoying as he looked around the shop, just killing time waiting for his order. Once his order came he would tuck into his meal slowly to savor it, occasionally he would look at the male next to him, even attempting to speak at one point. He didn't mind talking to stangers, he just didn't like doing it around a group of people.

Around half way through his meal he would sit back and scratch the back of his head, "Todays a slow day am I right?" he would say outloud to no one in particular.* - Sat Nov  7 03:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes another mouthful of food, chewing and swallowing it before turning his head to look at Rias. "Hey, I'm Akira."* - Sat Nov  7 03:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Starts building up his chakra as he enters the training field, finding nowhere in particular to stand as he placed his hands flat together to help focus his chakra. It took some time to mould his chakra up as he honestly hadn't trained in a long while. Once he was eventually would he would part his hands and then bring them together quickly to clap them once. He would then crouch down and place his hands on the ground, feeding his chakra down his arms and into the ground. It was difficult at first seeing as he hadn't done this in a while but he got into the flow of it, feeding a little of his chakra into the ground. He would then use this chakra to mould the earth into a viscous muddy substance, though it wasn't all that impressive. He stood back up and panted, even doing that had fatigued him quite a bit.* - Sat Nov  7 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Let himself recover for a while, sitting down for a good few needed minutes. Once he felt ok again he would stay seated as be began building more chakra up. He would reach into his backpouch and pull out two things, a scroll and a Kunai. He would unravel the scroll across the ground and place the kunai onto its paper before placing both his hands together and closing his eyes as he focused solely on building up his chakra. Once he was ready he would form a few hand seals and hold his hand over the kunai, pressing it down onto it and pushing his chakra down his arm, then into the kunai and scroll. A few seals would spring out across the scroll, followed by a puff of smoke. The kunai would be gone and a seal would be all that remained, written across the scroll like handwriting.* - Sat Nov  7 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll catch him. - Sun Nov  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: How do I get up there..? - Sun Nov  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Climb. - Sun Nov  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why can't you climb up there..? - Sun Nov  8 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Becuase I don't feel like it.. - Sun Nov  8 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm...Fine... - Sun Nov  8 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks around the surface of the kage mansion, not seeing much in the way to push off or climb up. "Uh, Got any ideas..?" he would remark to Ziare.* - Sun Nov  8 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) caught both kunai, holding them backwards towards himself. He looks at each kunai in hand, the all the way up to the fire emblem. <How the hell am I going to do this..?> he thought as he looked back at Ziare. He got in position to begin scaling the wall, then dug a kunai into the stone. He would place a foot hard against the surface of the wall, then jump up to dig the second kunai into the wall. He placed his other foot against the wall to try and steady himself, then brought the first kunai out of the wall, stabbing it back in a little further up than the second kunai. He adjusted his feet again but as he pulled the second kunai to pull himself up again, his feet would slip and the first kunai would come out of the wall, causing him to fall straight onto his ass. "Yeah I can't do this..."* - Sun Nov  8 08:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: .... - Sun Nov  8 08:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov  8 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Don't give me that. - Sun Nov  8 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I didn't say nuthin.. - Sun Nov  8 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't pull myself all the way up there. - Sun Nov  8 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You try then. - Sun Nov  8 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We'll leave him then. - Sun Nov  8 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) holds the kunai out for Ziare.* - Sun Nov  8 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We can't leave him... - Sun Nov  8 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) was standing directly under the body, waiting to catch it. Unfortunately he didn't really know how heavy a body was so once it came down and he caught it, he would nearly keel over as the weight strained him. "A little warning next time..."* - Sun Nov  8 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Shut up, I had to get it.. - Sun Nov  8 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) kneels down, lowering the body to the ground. He would look him over, making sure the eyes were closed and he was in a respectful state. He saw the sword poking straight out of the body of Shinjin, it looked odd, made of a very shiny material. "I should probably remove this..." he would say, reaching out for the handle of the blade. His eyes would probably come across a word written on the hilt, 'Takeda'. "He retracted his hand and motioned Ziare over, "Hey...come look at this..."* - Sun Nov  8 08:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes his eyes off the sword, looking at Ziare. "Why does the sword have a name on it..?"* - Sun Nov  8 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Probably who it belongs to. - Sun Nov  8 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Takeda... - Sun Nov  8 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm... - Sun Nov  8 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Sounds familiar.. - Sun Nov  8 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't know anyone called Takeda... - Sun Nov  8 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hmmm.... - Sun Nov  8 08:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Neither do I. - Sun Nov  8 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Perhaps it was the killers sword..? Or maybe the one who made it..? - Sun Nov  8 08:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Whatever it is. - Sun Nov  8 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's annyoing. - Sun Nov  8 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm...Maybe we should just leave the body as it is... - Sun Nov  8 08:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Have an expert examine it... - Sun Nov  8 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  8 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Know any? - Sun Nov  8 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Not specifically... - Sun Nov  8 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We're kinda fucked here man... - Sun Nov  8 08:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What if we get invaded now..? - Sun Nov  8 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: This would be the perfect time... - Sun Nov  8 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We surrender immidietly. - Sun Nov  8 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Whoever puts up a fight will be killed on the spot. - Sun Nov  8 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Come on...grab his arms... - Sun Nov  8 08:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to lift the legs of Shinjin up."Lets take him inside and put him on the desk in there..."* - Sun Nov  8 08:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) helps Ziare with placing Shinjin on the table. He would move around the body to make sure it was presented in a respectful way. "Thanks..."* - Sun Nov  8 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Man... - Sun Nov  8 08:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: This is some shit... - Sun Nov  8 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah... - Sun Nov  8 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I just... - Sun Nov  8 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Konoha gets it so hard these days... - Sun Nov  8 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We just got back on our feet... - Sun Nov  8 09:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It won't be happening any time soon. - Sun Nov  8 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Unless a miracle happens and we get a leader. - Sun Nov  8 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Until then we need a proxy to train. - Sun Nov  8 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And become high ranking in the Gezo. - Sun Nov  8 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Like that will happen...we'd need to train for years... - Sun Nov  8 09:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Maybe even a decade, - Sun Nov  8 09:02:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We simply...don't have that time... - Sun Nov  8 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't think my shadows would fair well as they are now. - Sun Nov  8 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I've only been trained in fighting and leading in squads. - Sun Nov  8 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not too skilled alone. - Sun Nov  8 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Shadows..? - Sun Nov  8 09:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Dont dig too deep into it. - Sun Nov  8 09:04:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I may have to actually step up... - Sun Nov  8 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's a scary thought... - Sun Nov  8 09:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think everyone will... - Sun Nov  8 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Everyone can go a bit harder. - Sun Nov  8 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Pull some extra weight for me. - Sun Nov  8 09:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Guess we really need to up our training now...no more being lax... - Sun Nov  8 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That kinda life isn't for me. - Sun Nov  8 09:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It's going to have to be for now... - Sun Nov  8 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We need to assemble everyone and annouce this... - Sun Nov  8 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: How do you propose we do that? - Sun Nov  8 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Doesn't the village have an annoucement station..? - Sun Nov  8 09:10:24 2015
