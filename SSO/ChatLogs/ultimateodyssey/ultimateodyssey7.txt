<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes his first steps into another house in Suna, it was quite different from Marrisa's, while it was as clean it was a little more...decorated and homely. One thing he did enjoy about this house is the fact that he didn't see any ashtrays around, nor did he smell a potent smell of cigarette smoke. All in all it seemed to be a clean environment and it helped calm him a little. "You...have a nice place here..." he said, holding his hands together to try and stop the constant shakes he had experienced all day.* - Mon Nov 16 02:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) placed two tea spoons of sugar into his tea, leaving the cream behind. He pulled his cup closer to himself and just sat their stirring the liquid for a few moments, staring into the tea. He was quite silent like usual, talking to strangers wasn't his strong point and it was even worse that he was going to talk about private matters. After a few moments of stirring he would place the spoon down and pick up the cup with both hands, trying to steady it as much as possible since he was still suffering from the shakes he got.

He took a small sip before placing the cup back down, "Th-Thanks for this...I just don't have anyone else to talk to about this stuff..."* - Mon Nov 16 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head, "I got some sleep...couple of hours but not enough I guess.

"I've still got the patch on but...its not helping much. I smoked a few times today but I tried my hardest to stop, it's just really hard...with these shakes and everything."* - Mon Nov 16 03:52:57 2015
