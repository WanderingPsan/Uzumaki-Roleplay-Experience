<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) Steps off to the side of the training field to start training again, in truth he had been neglecting his training a lot, partly because of his problems and partly because of his lack of motivation and self-confidence. He figured he needed to start trying again though so he picked a quiet spot and began building up his chakra. He was just getting warmed up at this point and didn't want to focus on training anything specific, just feeling the technique out a bit. Once his chakra was ready he would clap his hands together once and then place them on the ground, sending his chakra don his arms and then kneading it through the ground. The chakra would split into four and concentrate at different point, drawing in sand and condensing it down at these points. Then with a small push for his chakra, four spikes shot out of the ground.

He stretched his shoulders, arms and back out after his initial practise, rubbing his hands together as he did. It was time to get started with the real practise. He pulled his hands a part and then brought them together with a clap, holding them in that position as he moulded up his chakra as quickly as he possibly could. When ready he would then place his hands against the ground and start pumping his chakra into the sand, making sure to try and refine his chakra as he manipulated it. He would create four focal points for his chakra which he would start drawing in and compacting as much sand as he possibly could. When he felt ready he would then use his chakra to form the sand into a spike as he shot it out of the ground.

He parted his hands and then clapped them back together, initiating the jutsu once more as he began building up his chakra as quickly as he could. Once he had built up an ample amount of chakra he would lean over and place his hands flat against the ground, sending his chakra to his hands where he would then knead it through his palms and into the ground, making sure to refine his use of the chakra. Once he had again separated his chakra into four points he would start drawing in the surrounding sand, compacting as much of it as possible to where he focused his chakra. The sand spike would then stab out of the ground and into the open air, more sand compact into it to form the body of the spike.

Wasting no time to admire his progress he would simply shut his eyes, clap his hands together again and start building up chakra. He was really taking a liking to this technique, not only was it quite deadly when used right it also barely put a dent into his chakra and stamina. With that in mind his hands would be back on the ground, kneading more chakra into it. He sent his chakra off away from his last few practises, then set up the four focal points which he drew in sand with. His main focus would be drawing in and compacting as much sand as he could possibly manage, knowing that by doing so, the spike will become a lot more reliable and sturdy. With a small push of his chakra, the spikes would then shoot off and stab into the air.

He took a few seconds to shake and dust his hands off, then limber up his shoulders some more, it had been a while since he trained after all. Once he had done that though, it was start back to building up his chakra, placing his hands together with a clap as he did. Once he had built up enough chakra to perform the jutsu with he would kneel down and place both hands on the ground, kneading his chakra into the sand as he did. Just as before he made four focus points with his chakra and then used that chakra to condense sand down at each point. Within a few seconds he would then spike the compacted sand out of the ground, forming four spikes with crossed each other diagonally as if he were skewering an enemy from all angles.

He figured one more practise would do before he went off and rested for a little bit, he didn't really need the rest but that didn't matter, he had some other stuff to do anyway. With his training nearing its end for now he placed his hands together and worked hard to build up his chakra as quickly as he could. Once his chakra was ready he then placed his hands on the ground and did as before, kneading his chakra through the sand and focusing it into four points. He would then use these points to draw in and compact the sand down. Within a few second this compacted sand would then start shooting out of the ground in the form of a sharp spike, more and more sand being compacted into it as the spike grew. Once all four spikes were fully formed he would stand up and dust himself off, walking away from his training sight a few moments later. The spikes would eventually crumble back into sand once his chakra had wore off.* - Thu Nov 19 02:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You will. - Thu Nov 19 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) began building up chakra as Rias threw three shuriken at him. He would clap his hands together once and kneel down quickly as he did, dodging the shurikens thrown at him. His hands would then hit the floor as his chakra travelled from his body and into the ground, moving all the way over to Rias's current position. Four spikes would then push out of the ground infront of Rias, two aiming to hit her stomach area and two aiming to hit her chest area. The spikes would be blunt rather than sharp so that he of course didn't impale her, being hit by them would be more akin to a heavy punch.* - Thu Nov 19 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) started to search around for Rias as she turned into a log with a poof of smoke, he thought she would attempt something like this. Quickly he would find her off to the left of himself. His hand would dive into his backpouch and pull out a kunai, the kunai also had a tag attached to it. His arm flicked forward and extended out as he attempted to throw the kunai towards her. He would notice she was holding up a hand seal he had never seen before.

Whether he threw the tagged kunai towards her would most likely be up to the speed of her jutsu, though in this case it's quite likely he would be caught, meaning his body would go stiff as soon as he attempted to throw the kunai at her.* - Thu Nov 19 04:37:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) felt and saw the kunai drop from his hands, a confused look growing on his face. He would attempt to pick it up only to notice he couldn't move his own body. Then for some reason he started marching forward against his will, he wasn't quite sure why but he assumed it had something to do with the odd hand seal Rias had formed. Once he was in position he would then be flicked on the forehead, sending him flying into the rockface.

He hit the wall hard, probably cracking a rib or two and maybe even cracking a bone in one of his arms, his face would also most likely have bruise on one side of it too, he wasn't the most durable after all. He would pick himself off the floor and wonder how Rias got this strong while he stayed behind and stayed weak...maybe thats why people took no notice of him. Either way he was determined not to be beaten quite yet. He clapped his hands and moulded up chakra, opening his mouth and spitting out a large amount of mud which filled a decent area. The mud would then race forth towards Rias, attempting to wash her away.* - Thu Nov 19 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I don't beleive so, Akira for example was a konoha shinobi and is not a member of the military at all - Thu Nov 19 05:14:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Come on, kid! - Thu Nov 19 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) zipped through a few hand seals as the mud crashed against her, he would then release chakra all over his body and by the time the wires had reached him, he would be gone. He sank into the ground and started to swim forward, trying to feel out where she was using the magnetic forces to guide him to her position. For now he stayed underground, just moving forward towards her. She might spot that he had entered the ground as the ground he was just standing on would be disturbed.* - Thu Nov 19 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: She's wide open! - Thu Nov 19 05:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) kept moving forward until he was in position. He would start moulding up chakra as he swam to the surface. He would half emerge from the ground just infront of her, clapping his hands together once quickly. His hands then slammed against the floor as he kneaded his chakra into the ground. Four spikes would then stab out of the ground towards Rias. The spikes would aim for her wrists, one above her wrist and below for each wrist. He did this in the hope that the spikes would 'wrap' around the top and bottom of her wrists tightly to constrict them and prevent movement and hand seals.* - Thu Nov 19 05:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Huh.. - Thu Nov 19 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) started to jump out of his tunnel hole when he saw a shadow growing around him. He looked up and saw a load of mud raining down towards him. His reflexes kicked in as he quickly jumped out of his tunnel and onto the sand. As he got to his feet though the mud would sweep the legs from under him, carrying him for a few feet as the mud bashed him around a bit. Once he was stopped moving he would get to his feet and stick a hand into his backpouch, pulling out a kunai.

He thought about his next move...but eventually sighed as he relaxed his stance. He put a hand up towards Hassan and Rias. "I lose, She wins." He would then casually walk towards Rias and use the kunai in his hands to break away the spikes, releasing her from their grip. As he placed his kunai away he looked towards Rias. "So you're not all just brains. You've become quite an exceptional shinobi Rias." He said, giving her a smile.* - Thu Nov 19 06:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) places his hurt arm into his hoodie pocket, using it as a pseudo arm sling since his arm now started to pain him quite a bit. As he walked forward he found himself wincing in pain, breathing seemed to a little difficult for him too. He used his good arm to hold his side with the cracked ribs. He didn't let his injury stop him though, he moved forward fast, aiming to push past Rias in all honesty. He himself was pissed off with how she was acting. "Be like that towards me again Rias...ungrateful as fucking always." he said as he attempted to pass by her.* - Thu Nov 19 06:40:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) had his right arm in his hoodie pocket, he didn't seem to be moving it much. His breathing was slightly laboured and could probably be heard by anyone near him, he sounded wheezy. His hoodie was up in an attempt to hide his face again, though for different reasons this time. He turned to Kiyoko, his face looking angry and distraught. "Not great..."* - Fri Nov 20 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) || His chakra was probably all over the place at the moment, pretty unfocused and dark. Depressing would probably be the word for it.* - Fri Nov 20 13:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) ignored Chikyu for the most part. He followed Kiyoko slowly, favouring one side as he walked.* - Fri Nov 20 13:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sat down in one of the two chairs infront of her desk, ignoring the coffee table for the most part. He slowly and carefully pulled his arm out of his hoodie pocket that he had been using as a pseudo arm sling. He pulled his sleeve back slowly and pointed out where some swelling would be, not much since he got this injury a while ago but there would be a noticable difference from normal. Upon closer inspection she would probably find the bone chipped or cracked at or around that point.

He would then lay his arm down to rest for a few seconds, turning to his side. He lifted part of his hoodie and shirt up, revealing black and blue bruising at the bottom half of his right ribs. Also upon closer inspection she would find two or three ribs broken or cracked and a few obviously bruised. After that he would readjust his clothing and then look properly at Kiyoko.

"This all happened because Hassan made me spar Rias...though these wounds are nothing compared to what happened after the spar..." he would then trail off and look down, his face becoming visibly distraught again.* - Fri Nov 20 13:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) kepts looking down the whole time Kiyoko did her thing, he trsuted her after all. Once she asked him a few more questioned he looked up and just sort of shrugged. "I don't know why the Kazekage made me spar her...I just did it because he asked me to and I wanted to help Rias progress. I fought her hard and had her on the defence for the most part but gave up and give the win to her once the pain from my injuries kicked in...thats when Rias and I-" he cut himself off again, looking down and rubbing his eyes with a thumb and finger.* - Fri Nov 20 13:30:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I had her bound but she had this clone protecting her...I thought that by the time I took the clone out she would have got out and prepared something which would have further injured me... - Fri Nov 20 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So I just cut my losses and gave the win to her...she wasn't happy about it... - Fri Nov 20 13:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She said something about me pitying her or something and then just started walking away... - Fri Nov 20 13:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She's always putting me down, saying I just slow her down and make her weaker. - Fri Nov 20 13:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You know I told her about her dead friend who I hate? I told her he died so she didn't find out from a fucking stranger. That's the lengths I go to and for what? to be cast off aside again. - Fri Nov 20 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: After that happened I wanted to go home and fucking drink myself to death once again but you know what? - Fri Nov 20 13:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: And, we'll sleep on the ground. - Fri Nov 20 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right... - Fri Nov 20 16:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...i'm kinda bored. - Fri Nov 20 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Want to go do something Chikyu? - Fri Nov 20 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Like, what? - Fri Nov 20 16:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I dunno, I'm kinda hungry. - Fri Nov 20 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We could go get some food and chill or a bit? - Fri Nov 20 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Sure, I love to go get a bite. - Fri Nov 20 16:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Alright, uh...where do you want to go? - Fri Nov 20 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Why not the hungry ant? - Fri Nov 20 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Ok then, Lets go. - Fri Nov 20 17:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) orders the same, bacon and eggs did sound pretty good right now...plus...what's better than bacon? He taps the table while Chikyu hums, a little stuck for words in all honesty. A thought did pop into his head though, "So um...We've talk about me a lot...like a whole lot...but we've never really talked about you. So uh...I don't know...what's your favourite colour or something..." Yes, He did just ask her favourite colour.* - Fri Nov 20 17:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) just realised how dumb his question was, then again he didn't just want to assume stuff with people. "Well um...So uh..." he trailed off and went silent for a few seconds, he honestly wasn't the best at talking to people. "So...are you into anyone right now..? Any girlfriends or whatever?" He said with a smirk, hoping that he could get her back for talking about his failure of a love life so much.* - Fri Nov 20 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) sort of just chuckles are her happy nature, most people wouldn't smile at that. "Yeah...think I might have to do the same honestly...not that I have any friends to watch..." He was about to say something else when their food arrived. He picked up a fork and then realised a problem...he couldn't use a knife and fork with one arm. Cutting his egg and bacon as best he could with a fork, he'd swallow a mouthful of food before continuing. "Guess I have time to make friends now that my arm is busted though...gonna be difficult since I suck talking to people...and don't have any friends here to introduce me to people."* - Fri Nov 20 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) chuckles again, watching Chikyu in general brought a smile to his face oddly, maybe it was because of her boy-ish demeanor. "I suppose you are my friend...I just didn't want to assume anything I guess." Continuing eating, he would scoop up and eat two more mouthfuls of food while he thought of something else to say. "I don't know...talking to people is hard at times. People in Suna can be really aggressive at times too."* - Fri Nov 20 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well.. you do seem to like that trait though... Marissa and Mitsunara.... you chose the two most agressive people in the villag.e - Fri Nov 20 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I guess. - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Theres not many single women in Suna either... - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: But, most are agressive because they have a dream or a goal to obtain. Which means you can rely on them. - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015
