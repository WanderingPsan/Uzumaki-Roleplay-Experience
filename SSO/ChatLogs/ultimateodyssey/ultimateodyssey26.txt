<br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) lets out a small sigh, apprently he answered correctly somehow. He remained quiet still for a while, tucking into his bowl of vegetable ramen.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) stops eating and looks the opposite direction of Shin. His demeanor would seem to change from distressed and timid to something quite serious and confident. "So how is your training going?" He said this without any sign of stutter or lack of confidence, in fact the way he said this would be regarded as perfectly normal.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Where else should we go? - Thu Dec 10 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) stepped into the training field, taking in a deep breath as he prepared himself for a session of training. Now that he had practically mastered Dynamic Entry it was time to start training his other technique, Leaf Whirlwind. He got into his standard fighting pose, raising his fists up and position his feet to give himself balance. He would then start to run forward, giving himself momentum. After a few steps he would use his left foot for balance as his right leg bent in, then extended out to perform a high kick. He brought his right leg down hard, twisting it slightly as he did. He would spin on his right foot a lower his body slightly, taking his left leg off the ground and bending it in as he did. As he came full circle his left leg would then extend out, performing a low kick. Once the entire manueuver was finished it was as if he had made a whirlwind with his body, hence the name.

Once he came to a stop he stood up straight and thought about what he needed to practise. He knew that he needed to increase the speed of both the low kick and the high kick, improve his balance and also practise the seconday version of this technique, a roundhouse kick but first he needed general practise with the technique. With that he resumed his stance and took in a deep breath as he cocked his right leg up and bent it in. His right leg would then extend out to perform the first high-kick of the technique. His body would then start to spin right as he brought his leg down to the ground and spun on his right foot. His left leg would then be brought up and bent in as he croutched down slightly, extending said leg out to perform the low-kick once he had gone full circle.

Standing up straight again he let out a deep breath as he relaxed his body and loosened it up a little. He then slid his feet back into position, left foot infront of his right, and raised both his fists up to get into his stance. His right leg would then lift up, bend at the knee and pull in close to his body. His right leg would then extend out, kicking upwards into the air. His left foot then twisted right as he spun his right leg down to the right, pushing himself into a spin.  As his right foot hit the ground he would start to croutch, lifting his left leg off the ground and tucking it close to his body. Once he came full circle his leg would then extend out to perform a low-kick.

As he stood back up and balanced himself he slowly started to understand the trick of this technique, the high-kick was a feint attack, knocking the opponent off guard and providing cover for the real attack, the low-kick. Finally understanding the technique better and having a better grasp on it he would get into position and prepare to apply what he was learning. His right leg cocked up and bent at the knee as before, tucking in close to his body. A swift kick would then be made towards the air with his right leg. As he brought said leg down he would use it to provide spin to himself, begining the 'whirlwind' rotation. His support leg would then change over from his left to his right as he brought his left foot off the ground, now bending that leg and tucking it close to his body. Once he had spun all the way around his left leg would extend out straight quickly, performing the low kick.

By now he was starting the feel the pace a little, his body becoming a little heavy and tired as he began working up a sweat. He refused to give up yet though, wanting to practise the technique one last time before he called it quits and went to rest a while. As such he got into his stance, positioning his feet correctly and putting both fists up. His right leg would then do as before, raising up and tucking in close to his body. It would then extend straight out as he performed a high-kick, using said right leg to spin his body to the right as he brought it down. As his right leg came down his would lower his own body and left his left leg from the ground, tucking it in close to his body like he had his right leg. Said left leg would then extend out to perform a low-kick as he came full circle, completing the leaf whirlwind once more. He would stop on that high note, knowing that he had the basics down by now. All that was left was to start refining his use of the technique.* - Thu Dec 10 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns to face the exit of the training area, about to exit the area as he had finished up here for now. His face and body would shrink back as his eyes met two strangers, weird how everytime he came to train people seemed to stop by. His right hand would grab hold oh his left upper arm, rubbing it as his whole body froze. His head would look down at the ground, looking up at the strangers occasionally to keep an eye on them but ultimately too nervous to engage in eye contact. His face held a seemingly worried or distressed feature on it as he switched from fighter to shy little boy mode within a matter of seconds.* - Thu Dec 10 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) was on the search for a new, more quiet place to train. While the 'official' training field was large and filling his training need, it attracted a lot of people to it. He found himself walking down a semi-familiar route, emerging into quite a tranquil looking area. He placed his hands in his pockets as he looked around the area, feeling quite relaxed by it...that was until his eyes fell on Shina. His hands would immediately jump out of his pockets and grip together, shaking slightly as he started to get anxious. <Come on me...you can do this...just talk to the person normally...they won't get upset at you or dislike you...> He thought to himself as he made his way slowly over to Shina.

He stopped a few feet away from her, already regretting not turning and running away as soon as he saw her. Too late now he figured. "H-H...H-Hello..." He said, trying to sound as confident as possible.* - Thu Dec 10 16:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) jumped back a little as she gave quite a lighthearted response to him, he really wasn't good with this kind of thing. His mind started swimming through a sea of responses that he could answer with, yet like water they all slipped out of his hands when he tried to grasp onto one. He squeezed his hands together tightly to work out some of the anxiety he was feeling, a common thing he did as he hated being this way. He resorted to first looking about the area, then looking Shina over to find something...-anything- to talk about since he had started this conversation.

He noticed the ripples in the water and how her clothing had spots of damp on it...it wasn't much to go off but it was better than standing there in silence and waiting for her to respond again. "A-A-Are y-you t-t-t-..." He cut himself off, not wanting to stutter and fumble with his works continously and embarras himself. <Pull it together...damnit me.> He thought to himself as he started again. "A-Are you...t-training with w-water..?"* - Thu Dec 10 16:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) also ignored the village annoucement, Chuunin exams? Leading a squad? He could barely talk to people normally. He also seemingly didn't wear a headband, it was merely hidden under his clothing because he believe people would treat him differently if they knew he was a shinobi...another one of of many odd social quirks. He noticed she had become quite quiet once he had started talking...was he weirding her out..?

He needed to apologize quickly, he didn't want another person hating him because he was socially inept. "S-Sorry...i-if I'm...b-bother you..."* - Thu Dec 10 17:08:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) sighed a little as she reassured him that he wasn't bothering her, though deep down he still felt like a bother. He tried to ease up a little, parting his hands and letting his left arm fall to his side. His right hand would then grip onto the upper part of his left arm, rubbing and squeezing it as he continued to try and work through his anxiousness. He looked over to what she was doing with the water, being quite impressed and calmed by it. He wanted to get a closer look but was afraid he'd upset her if he got any closer.

"T-That's v-very...n-nice..." He aimed to compliment, mostly because he couldn't think of what else to comment on.* - Thu Dec 10 17:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) tried to put on a small smile to make himself seem more friendly, things seemed to be going well and he didn't want to mess things up. "I-It's n-nice to meet you t-too. I-I'm Kai." His tone seemed a little more confident than before and he didn't fumble through his words as much. He was slightly disappointed that the water had dispersed, he wanted to see the finished product.

He gripped his left arm with his right hand again and decided to go for it. "D-Do you m-mind if I...g-get a closer look..?"* - Thu Dec 10 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) cautiously moved forward, walking over to stand next to her. He wasn't too fond of being this close to people so he tensed up a little more, gripping his arm tightly to work though some of his anxiety and worries. He watched her manipulate the water again, taking a small liking to it. His own chakra control was pretty poor and he couldn't really use and jutsu yet but watching other made him happy. He nodded his head at the comment about not telling anyone. "Mm...I-I won't...I-I promise..."

He kicked at the ground a little and looked around, wondering what to say next. He didn't want there to be an awkward silence so he blurted out the first thing that came to mind. "Y-you're...v-very good at that..."* - Thu Dec 10 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) started to worry again...had he said the wrong thing..? Did he offend her? Did she now hate him? He had to apologize quickly agai-...He was splashed in the face, completely unaware that she had made another figure because of how worried he was over upsetting her. He squeezed his arm really tightly as he thought she had done that to get back him for 'mocking' her about he chakra control.

He slumped down to a sit and brought his knees to his chest, wrapping both arms around them to hug he knees. He stared into the water, "I-I didn't m-mean...to offend you...Mmmm..."* - Thu Dec 10 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) felt stupid on the inside...how could he have not realised that was a prank? was he really this bad at talking to people? He looks up to Shina. "A-A p-p-prank..?" He puts on a small smile and nods his head. "Y-you got me g-good." He declares, showing he had been 'pranked'. He stands up and lets out a small laugh as he wipes his face and ruffles his wet hair.

"Y-You're f-funny..." He continues with, trying to lighten the mood a little, thankfully that had helped get rid of a lot of his worry and anxiety, now knowing Shina seemed to be a playful person.* - Thu Dec 10 18:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) was thankful for the towel...though he felt kind of bad for using something that was hers. He used it to wipe his face off, then dry his hair off with it quickly. He left his clothes alone, they'd dry on thier own for the most part. He folded the towel and then held it out for her to take. "H-Here's your towel back..." She might notice how as time went on, he was opening up a little more and fumbling with his wors less.

He kept an eye on what she was doing, impressed with her progress. "Y-you're getting quite g-good at that."* - Thu Dec 10 18:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) alternated betwen watching the water and Shina. "T-Try your best..." He commented, trying to sound supportive and friendly.* - Thu Dec 10 18:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) smiled at Shina, looking happy for her. The water clone was quite impressive, especially since it took on her own form which probably meant it was quite difficult to do. "W-Well done S-Shina...i-it looks lovely." He wasn't really sure why he used the word lovely...then again he was still pretty terrible at talking to people in general.* - Thu Dec 10 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nodded, it did feel pretty good to accomplish your own set goals, even if they were small. "I-It might have been taxing but...i-it feels worth it r-right..?"* - Thu Dec 10 18:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) puts on a small frown, shaking his head as he turned to her. "Y-You don't s-suck at it...y-you just need more practise i-is all...I-I think you did really good." He tried to reassure her, sounding as supportive as he could. He hated his own lack of confidence and hated to see it in others even more.* - Thu Dec 10 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head, the small frown still present but it would eventually fade into a neutral look. "Y-Yeah...D-Do you want to go g-get...Mm...Do you want to g-go get something to eat..?"* - Thu Dec 10 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: Yeah! Let's. - Thu Dec 10 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: R-Ramen..? - Thu Dec 10 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: Uhhhhhhhhh .. - Thu Dec 10 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: I don't like ramen, but they have other stuff I can eat at that shop. - Thu Dec 10 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: If you want ramen. - Thu Dec 10 18:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm...No...We can g-go some place e-else... - Thu Dec 10 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: They have good dumplings and stuff, so I don't miiiind.  - Thu Dec 10 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head. "Mmm...Well okay...l-let's get going then..." With that, he would start walking off slowly, expecting Shina to follow behind.* - Thu Dec 10 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) sits down next to Shina, usually he would sit one or two seats away from people but since he found her quite friendly, he didn't totally mind sitting next to her. He ordered a bowl of beef ramen, fit with extra meat and veg, he was a growing boy after all. Shina might notice he became quite shy and timid again, sitting slightly to the right of his seat and tapping lightly on the table with a finger to relieve some of his anxiety. He would just sit there waiting for his meal to arrive, unsure of what to say.* - Thu Dec 10 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) grabbed a set of chopsticks once his meal was set down infront of him. He parted the chopsticks and began digging into his food quite fast, it seemed he was quite a fast eater. After a few mouthfuls he would look over to Shina, "I-Is your food okay..?" He asked, trying not to build up a wall of silence between himself and her.* - Thu Dec 10 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) goes a little wide eye'd. Milkshake and fries? It sounded disgusting but it peaked his interest a little. He chewed and swallowed another few mouthfuls quickly before looking at Shina again. "I-I don't know if they d-do milkshakes here...b-but you'll have to...show me that sometime..."* - Thu Dec 10 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) picked up the pace at which he was eating, finishing his meal off quite quickly. He placed the chopsticks within the empty bowl and then push it back. Feeling a little more comfortable he would ease back in his seat, now sitting in it properly. He turned to face Shina a little since he had finished his own meal. All this talk of fries had made him quite hungry for them however. He stared down at any fries Shina had left on her plate with hungry eyes, his hand tempted to reach out and grab a few but of course...that would be rude and he didn't want to upset her.

He thought about asking for some but again, he was afraid of upsetting her. He would try to change the subject, "S-So uh...Mm...What's your favourite f-food..?"* - Thu Dec 10 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) was saddened by the fact there were no more fries...guess he would have to get some in his own time. He took his attention away from the plate and turned his focus to Shina, listened to the answer she gave. He was a little surprised when she asked him back, not many people wanted to hear what he had to say because of his social awkwardness.

He had to think quickly, not really having an answer to his own question. "I-I guess I like different kinds of r-ramen...and sweats. I-I also like to just have...a plate of s-salty fries s-sometimes..." He really couldn't get those fries off his mind. * - Thu Dec 10 19:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: I like salty foods...~ - Thu Dec 10 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Y-Yeah...I-I think I like them more t-than sweet stuff... - Thu Dec 10 20:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: I LOVE sweet stuff the most though! - Thu Dec 10 20:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm...They're n-nice but I-I like salty foods more...I-I think they have more flavour... - Thu Dec 10 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: Whaaaat? - Thu Dec 10 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: L-Like salted kinda of m-meat...th-that's really n-nice... - Thu Dec 10 20:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I-It's also...g-good for training t-too. - Thu Dec 10 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: Training, what? - Thu Dec 10 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I-It helps build muscle up...th-the meat that is... - Thu Dec 10 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: B-But sweet stuff is fun to have too... - Thu Dec 10 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Thu Dec 10 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: But sweet stuff can make you happy. - Thu Dec 10 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I guess... - Thu Dec 10 21:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I-It might seem w-weird because of h-how I am around you...a-and others b-but... - Thu Dec 10 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: J-just talking to p-people...m-makes me happy... - Thu Dec 10 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: Man, Dude ... You gotta have more confidence! - Thu Dec 10 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: You dun sound that happy.. - Thu Dec 10 21:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: I dunno what happened to you, if something happened to you .. - Thu Dec 10 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shina(Only Pandas) says: But you gotta y'know . - Thu Dec 10 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked at Shina as she gave him a serious expression, it wasn't often that he maintained eye contact with someone this long. Once she was finished talking he would hold out both of his hands and look down at them. "I-I know I-I need to be more confident b-but...b-but I just...Mm...Um...I just...Mm..." He was starting to get nervous and worked up again, she might notice his hands would start shaking slightly.* - Thu Dec 10 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks up at Shina, he seemed to be irritated by something. "I-I have to go...see you later..." He said, pulling out a load of cash and placing it on the table, enough money for his and her food. He would then step up fro his stool and quickly leave the ramen bar.* - Thu Dec 10 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I've turned into an observer here lately anyway. - Thu Dec 10 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Whoa, what's the rush? - Thu Dec 10 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Mhm. - Thu Dec 10 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Anyway...you mind if I come back later to teach you more? - Thu Dec 10 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Thu Dec 10 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Excuse me, kid.~ - Thu Dec 10 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm...S-Sorry.. - Thu Dec 10 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: That one woman from Sunagakure, eh? - Thu Dec 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure Hun I will train on what I have now - Thu Dec 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright thanks. - Thu Dec 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) timidly steps to the side, keeping his head down the entire time.* - Thu Dec 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: See you later. - Thu Dec 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Thanks. - Thu Dec 10 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Now to master this.. - Thu Dec 10 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks up once Nigen had passed, quickly making his way into the training field. He froze once he saw two more people here...including the Hokage. His right arm would immediately latch onto his left arm as he became anxious because of those around him. He tried to keep his head down as best as possible without being disrespectful. <Damnit...every time I come here to train...I can't train when people are around...> He thought to himself, being incredibly self concious of his own skills, or in his opinion...lack of skill.* - Thu Dec 10 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure I dont mind love - Thu Dec 10 22:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah..?  - Thu Dec 10 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks up at the mention of the Chuunin exams, he had forgotten all about them quite honestly. "Ch-Chuunin exams..?" He blurts out unintentionally.* - Thu Dec 10 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Wih your push ups - Thu Dec 10 22:15:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I just did a hundred... - Thu Dec 10 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: So I figured I would focus more on studying for a little bit, then do a hundred sit ups after a little rest. - Thu Dec 10 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Th-There a-are going to be...Ch-Chuunin exams..? - Thu Dec 10 22:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) thinks: I don't want to be a Chuunin, but someone had to sign me up for it.. - Thu Dec 10 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I-I'll just give our village s-support...Since I-I can't take part in the e-exam... - Thu Dec 10 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I'm too weak anyway...everyone would laugh at me and hate me when I make a fool out of myself. - Thu Dec 10 22:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Ok are you ready? - Thu Dec 10 22:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: I should just go off to the side and train...the Hokage won't hate me for being weak...right..? - Thu Dec 10 22:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns and walks off to the side, keeping out of the way of the Hokage and Akechi.* - Thu Dec 10 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes... actually would you like a scroll of it? Are you more of a reader? - Thu Dec 10 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) turns around as he was about to start his training of a specific technique, he looks at both the Hokage and Akechi, then shakes his head as he backs up. "N-No...I-I don't w-want to..." His head would turn towards the exit, tempted to run from this situation.* - Fri Dec 11 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: 3.... - Fri Dec 11 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes another step back as the red-head got close. "S-Stay back...I d-don't want to f-f-fight anyone..."* - Fri Dec 11 00:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to become a little irritated and afraid, he was really afraid of even talking to people and now he was being forced to fight..? No. His timid outer shell started to crack as his anger started to break though. "I-I said stay back..!" he shouts over to both Akechi and the Hokage, trying to get them to stop.* - Fri Dec 11 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Hmm should I heed this warning? - Fri Dec 11 00:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I don't know... I assume so, if Miss kage wanted me to spar him.. - Fri Dec 11 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) sits down on the ground, his knees being pulled in close to his chest. He head would then bury itself in between his legs in an attempt to hide himself from the world, a common thing he did when faced with stressful situations. His arms would wrap around his legs and hug them tightly, trying to block out the world.* - Fri Dec 11 00:27:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: .. No, I do want to spar.. - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: It's pointless if the other person can't or won't fight. - Fri Dec 11 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) does -not- like to be touched, that is his number one no no with human interaction. His arms would slip from his sides, dropping to the floor. His knees parted, letting his head rise up as he stared directly at Akechi. "I said..." He paused for a moment. In that moment his right hand would ball into a fist, his arm then lifting off the ground and pulling back...

"LEAVE ME ALONE!" He shouts directly at her, punching his fist directly at her face in an attempt to make her go away.* - Fri Dec 11 00:33:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Another one?... I swear, tho-Woah... those look tasty!!! - Fri Dec 11 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to look around as everything went dark. <Did I black out..?> He thinks to himself as he stands up, looking all around the darkness. Suddenly he would be...running though Konoha as a child..? He didn't understand it but...he knew it was happening...and he was happy, konoha was so beautiful. But what was that in the distance..? A fire...a fire in konoha. He turned away from the fire, scared of it. As he turned around there would be a huge monster in the distance, everywhere it looked a piece of the village seemed to be blown from existance, leaving nothing but fire and rubble in it's wake.

"M-Mum..? D-Dad..?" He would call out randomly, everyone in the area would probably hear this. In the illusion he would be running again, running for his life. He was desperately trying to find something he had lost...his parents. Faceless shinobi passed by him, each one he gripped onto, asking about where his parents where, they should have been helping these shinobi fight...why weren't they here? His pace would quicken as another explosion hit konoha, it knocked him off his feet and then everything went dark.

The illusion would continue as he woke up in a house, his house. He ran downstairs expecting to find his parents there, only to be met by more faceless shinobi. A voice played, "Come with us son. You need to see something." As much as he didn't want to, he nodded his head and was taken through the ruin of konoha once again...all the way to the hospital. They lead him through the hospital, walking past many a blank door. They stopped at one door in particular, a word he didn't quite understand as a child was present on it. 'Morgue'.

He heard whispers again, making out only two words which frightened him and caused him to sweat, 'Bodies...Confirm...' As much as he tried to resist he was pulled into the room by and unknown force. The room was pitch black, nothing in it was visible. A light turned on, pointing to two metal roller beds which had two sheets over them. He cautiously walked over to the roller beds, looking at each one of them. His hands would each reach for a sheet, gripping onto either one with shakey hands.

He pulled the sheets off and there they were, the mangled and barely recognisable bodies of his parents, the only one able to identify them would be him, like he was forced to do all those years ago. "M-mum..? D-Dad..?" He said softly as he began to cry, it didn't matter where he looked, the bodies followed his vision. "NOOOO! MUM! DAD! NOOO!" He screamed over and over again as he fists raised up. He began to last out in every direction he could, fumbling all over the place as he released a barrage of skillful punches and kicks...and it looked like he wasn't stopping anytime soon.* - Fri Dec 11 00:59:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) would feel a cold metallic substance snake it's way around his entire body. It would strap his arms down to his sides and hold him in place, forcing him to stare at the bodies of his parents. "NO NO NO!" He shouted at no direction in particular. His arms would then forcibly twist able for a moment, trying to move into a better position. Once they were he would then let out an angry cry as his entire body tensed on the spot, his arms were force the wire to snap through sheer strength. One would this would start to slice into his body but oddly enough it didn't.* - Fri Dec 11 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) would stop trying to break out of the wire as his surrounds changed significantly.The picture of his mum and dad would wash away as reality slipped back into his vision. He looked down at himself, seeing the wire binding his entire body, he stared to get frightened. "What's going on? Why am I binded...what's happening here!" He called out to everyone, half forgetting he had punched Akechi in the face. He was so distressed that he had completely ignored the words of the hokage, too caught up in his own confusion.* - Fri Dec 11 01:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looked over to Akechi, being surprised with what he saw. "I did that..? Genjutsu..? What genjuts-" <Mum...Dad...> He thought to himself as the memories of the genjutsu came flooding back. He looked down with sad eyes, hanging his head in shame. "I'm sorry Akechi...I didn't mean to do it, I didn't want to hurt you!" He called out to her, feeling truly terrible for what he did. Oddly enough his stutter and his fumble of words had completely faded from his speech momentarily.* - Fri Dec 11 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Fri Dec 11 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Everyone is going to hate me after this...why did they try and force me to fight... - Fri Dec 11 01:42:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah.. - Fri Dec 11 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Anyway... Think its time for a... trip. - Fri Dec 11 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head at Akechi, "No...i-it was just a s-silly s-spider related thing, d-don't worry about it." Obviously this was a complete lie but he didn't realise everyone had heard his cries for his mother and father. He looked at the Hokage as she threatened them all and loosened the wires on him. He stretched his limbs out as he shook his head, <You shouldn't have tried to force me...> He thought to himself before looking back at Akechi.

"A-Akechi I..." He trailed off as he started to walk over to her, stopping as he got quite close, an odd thing for him to do. He looked down for a moment before bringing his gaze up to Akechi's eyes. "I-I really am s-sorry Akechi..."* - Fri Dec 11 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Really.. - Fri Dec 11 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: This was something else. - Fri Dec 11 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head slowly, secretly he thought she was just saying that to be nice but he went with it anyway. "Y-Yeah...I um...Mm...um..." He fumbled through a few noises and words before falling silent and hanging his head down to the ground again. He right arm would then extend out to her, hand also extended out as if he wanted to shake hands. He did indeed hate being touched but he would bare it this once if it meant he was showing how sincere he was.* - Fri Dec 11 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes her hand once before quickly retracting his arm back to his side. He took note of how oddly caring her grip was, something he hadn't felt since...since a certain time. He would then turn away from Akechi and look at the hokage, making his way over to her. "P-Please forgive m-me..." He would say, as much as it irritated him to do so since he felt like she had caused this whole thing to happen.* - Fri Dec 11 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah... I already have, so don't worry, yeah?~ - Fri Dec 11 02:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head, giving her a slightly sad and irritated look. He would turn away from her and say, "You don't mean that..." as he did, though he didn't intentionally say it outloud. He would then attempt to walk a little ways away from the group of people.* - Fri Dec 11 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks over to Akechi with slightly red eyes. He wanted to say no and just sit on his own for a while but considering he had just broken her nose...he didn't want to be rude to her or upset her in anyway. He gave her a small nod, "O-Okay..." He said softly, waiting for her response.* - Fri Dec 11 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks at the hand she offered and again...didn't want to really take it. But then again...he also didn't want to offend her in anyway because of how he treated her. He stepped forward and reluctantly took her hand, she might notice how rough his skin felt and how shakey he was. "O-Okay...Mm...L-Lead the way..."* - Fri Dec 11 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..let's see..that was odd. - Fri Dec 11 02:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Fri Dec 11 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) got sat down next to Akechi, he didn't usually sit next to someone but again, he was still feeling pretty horrible. He still had that upset look on his face and he just stared into the wood of the serving table with red eyes. "Water..." he said in a low and slightly distressed voice.* - Fri Dec 11 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) grips the glass of water with both hands, staring into it. "No..."* - Fri Dec 11 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) grips the glass even tighter as she questioned on. "No..." He would say again in a low tone. His eyes would start to well up as he couldn't take his mind off of what he saw...his parents...that image that he had managed to push to the back of his mind and lock away was now running rampant through his thoughts. A single tear would drop from his eye, splashing into his glass of water.* - Fri Dec 11 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) grips onto the glass so tight that a small snap could be heard as faint cracks in the glass manifested. He would turn on his stool as he heard something being summoned. He looked at the dog and gave it a sad smile, then looked at Akechi, giving her a sad smile too.

She would notice one or two small tears fall down his face but he was still fighting back his emotions furiously. He would then turn back and stare into his glass again, appreciating the effort but not having the desired effect on him.* - Fri Dec 11 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh.. d-didn't expect people to be here... Garsh... - Fri Dec 11 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods slightly as she said to trust him, though he still didn't believe her words. How could he trust her after she had used that genjutsu on him? After she made him see his...his parents...

That was it, one last thought of his parents and the tears he had so desperately tried to keep back would now flow down his facelike a waterfall. He sat there and cried, letting out a few saddened breaths to accompany his tears.* - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: ..... - Fri Dec 11 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: He's crying again?... - Fri Dec 11 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) latches onto Akechi, hugging his emotion out onto her. He buried his face into her shoulder cried, trying tohide his face from the world. At the sound of a familiar voice he would pull back and look at the man in armor. His fist would then slam down hard onto the table to relieve some of his anger.

Without any notice he would rip himself away from Akechi and step away from hs stool, attempting to leave the ramen shop.* - Fri Dec 11 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks the Anbu agent dead in the eye. "Either leave or let me leave. I'm not in the mood." Both his hands would then ball into fists, his body slowly readying itself.* - Fri Dec 11 03:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) quickly brings up both his fists. His left leg would be brought back and then swing forward, aiming to kick the mans left knee right in the side, hopefully knocking him down a peg. His right arm would then be brought back before being swung around, aiming to punch the man right in the side of the head, effectively giving him a haymaker.* - Fri Dec 11 03:32:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: ...Anbu, you're just making him angrier... - Fri Dec 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Why not?..  - Fri Dec 11 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because me and Akechi were talking about something private. - Fri Dec 11 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I don't want you to hear, leave me alone. - Fri Dec 11 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Now, you use words. - Fri Dec 11 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Good. - Fri Dec 11 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Please move. - Fri Dec 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Let me have a word with you. - Fri Dec 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No. - Fri Dec 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: Even if its brief. - Fri Dec 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine, make it quick. - Fri Dec 11 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: You shouldn't be soo timid about things, another thing. If it weren't me, you'd be dead for trying to attack someone. I'm too nice~, but I really wanted to sit down with you.. and Akechi. Talk a little, joke a little. Never meant for this to become serious, you're a little red in the face too, ahaha. - Fri Dec 11 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Point taken. - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Can you let me go now? - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: *sigh* - Fri Dec 11 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Now I'm remembering why... I hated shinobi.. - Fri Dec 11 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: He needs to calm down... I-I just.. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm calm now, your words really helped me. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Please let me leave now. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: *voice* Why do you bother, leave the kid alone. He doesn't even want to bear the sight of you. - Fri Dec 11 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: *sigh*  - Fri Dec 11 03:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'll just leave him alone.. Why did I even try to help? - Fri Dec 11 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) quickly starts to exit the ramen bar, looking back briefly to see if Akechi would follow him but for the most part he continue on without a care. He just had to get out of there.* - Fri Dec 11 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: *sigh* - Fri Dec 11 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) would have grabbed Akechi by the hand as soon as she emerged from the ramen bar behind him. He would practically drag her along with him without saying or hinting to where he was taking her, he seemed quite angry as he walked, unintentionally pulling her along.

They moved into a tea shop and he sat down, leaning both his arms against the table as he hunched over. He seemed to be calming down a little but was still quite irritated. He stared at the wood of the table for a few moments before opening his mouth to speak. "I'm sorry about that..." Oddly enough his stutter and shyness seemed to have disappeared once again, perhaps it was his anger that did that?* - Fri Dec 11 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head. "Yeah I just...I already don't like him and...well you know..." He shakes his head and then looks at Akechi, "I'm sorry for attacking him too...I shouldn't have done that."Once he had said that, he wouldn't seemingly start to wind down from anger into sadness.

His eyes gave off quite a sad look. "And i'm sorry for crying...I shouldn't have p-put that on y-..." His eyes would start to well up again, causing him to close them and look away as he was embarrased about crying infront of her.* - Fri Dec 11 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks back with sore and wet eyes, he seemed to be reverting back to his timid state by the way he was being more cautious and shifty. "I-I just...Mm...I just..." He would say before going silent. He would slide along the bench, sitting quite close to her. "I-I just..." He whispers before sliding his arms around her and pulling himself into her body, starting to lightly sob as he did.* - Fri Dec 11 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to sob a bit harder as she comforts him. His arms latch onto her tightly, pressing his body and head against her. He stays like this in silence for a few moments, letting time pass as he appreciates the comfort. "I-I just...have no one...n-no one to talk to...o-or be with...i'm all alone..." He states, blurting out all his woes in his moment of weakness.* - Fri Dec 11 04:23:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head lightly, still continuing to sob.

"I-I do though...I-I don't know how to talk to p-people...a-and I-I don't want to lose a-anyone like I lost my-...l-like I lost my p-parents..." Once that last part was said, he would bury his face into her, crying quite hard at the mention of his parents.* - Fri Dec 11 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) continued to grip Akechi tightly, practically kneading himself into her. Infact he was hugging so hard that he had started to fingernails into her unintentionally, it had been a while since he had hugged anyone and he did have a lot of pent up anger afterall.

"I-I Just...Mm I don't...I don't know h-how to t-take those risks..." He replied, his speech probably muffled by the fact he had his face buried into her shoulder.* - Fri Dec 11 04:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) loosened the hug slightly, easing up on the grip he had on her. He pulled back a bit to look up at her.

"W-Why do you want...w-want to help me..? I hurt you...y-you should hate me..."* - Fri Dec 11 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) smiles a little, easing up on the sobbing he was doing. He would press himself against her again, though this time it was just a gentle hug for comfort. "Th-Thank you...A-Akechi..."* - Fri Dec 11 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) starts to give a bit of a worried look as a certain thought crosses his mind.

"Y-You...Mm...You won't t-tell anyone a-about this r-right..?"* - Fri Dec 11 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Of course not. I promise. - Fri Dec 11 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm...O-Okay... - Fri Dec 11 04:54:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: D-Do you think w-we could do this a-again..? - Fri Dec 11 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah. Sure. - Fri Dec 11 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Fri Dec 11 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) continues to hug onto Akechi, squeezing her tightly every so often to make sure she was still there. He really didn't want this to end...not yet at least.* - Fri Dec 11 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Y-you're a nice p-person Akechi...I-I wish I...Mm...I wish I had t-talked to you sooner. - Fri Dec 11 05:02:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) brightens up a little as he sees Akechi, he waves back. "H-Hello Akechi...h-h-how are you f-feeling?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head, stepping a little closer to her, it seemed he was a little more confident around her than others.

"Th-Thats good...a-are you a-all healed u-up now..?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks left and right, seeing if anyone was around. He'd lock his gaze back on Akechi, maintaining eye contact with her, another thing he usually didn't do with others.

"S-So...w-what were you u-up to..?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: M-Mind if I-I tag...Mm...M-Mind if I tag along... - Sat Dec 12 00:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Ah, I suppose so.. Mrm. - Sat Dec 12 00:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks down at the hand and puts his own hand out to take it. It would stop mid-way as he was reluctant to take her hand but eventually it would work her way into hers, holding it tightly. "Mm..." He would say nervously, not to sure whether he liked the contact or not.* - Sat Dec 12 00:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) sits down next to the robe she had set down. He would bring his knees up to his chest and wrap his arms around them, resting his head on his knees as he did. He watched Akechi as she trained, seemingly calming down from his usual timid state.

"Mm...well...I-I guess i-i'm okay..."* - Sat Dec 12 00:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) continues to watch Akechi as she seals a few small object or one large one away, it was quite fascinating to watch actually. He would tap his feet on the ground one ore twice as he looked around, then resumed his focus on Akechi.

"H-Hey A-Akechi...Mm..." He opened his mouth again as if he wanted to say something, but shut himself down and looked away before he did.* - Sat Dec 12 00:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks back as she inquires into what he was about to say. He stayed silent as he thought for a sec, his expression becoming slightly sad but she did seem to calm him somewhat.

"D-Don't...Mm...D-Don't laugh at m-me when I a-ask you th-this okay..?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks around again, making sure no one was around to hear their conversation, he seemed to be quite self-concious of that. He twists his feet a little, showing he might be a little discomforted by asking this.

"W-Well...Mm...D-Do Mm...Do y-you th-think i'm w-w-weird..?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) smirks a little bit, that had actually made him feel a bit lighter for once. The smirk would quickly fade though, he still didn't like showing too much emotion round others.

"I-I was just asking b-because...because I-I thought e-everyone th-thought I was weird...a-and that's why th-they didn't talk to me..."* - Sat Dec 12 01:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) nods his head, twisting his feet on the ground again. "Mm..." He would make again, signifying he was feeling a little uncomfortable.

"I-I just...um...I j-just find it h-hard to do that...E-Even talking t-to you i-is really hard..."* - Sat Dec 12 01:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head a little...it seemed he didn't agree with that..? Or maybe he was just not confident in himself, it wasn't too clear from his expression to be honest.

"I-I just...Mm...I don't w-want to say o-or do the wrong thing...I-I don't want to upset or hurt anyone, l-like I hurt you..." He looks away after saying that last part, closing his eyes slightly. He was still quite upset for punching her in the face.* - Sat Dec 12 01:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks back, nodding his head slightly.

"I-I guess...Y-You're probably right since...s-since i'm t-terrible at this stuff." He puts on a small smirk to look like he was joking, though he still looked a little sad. It seemed her gentle and soothing demeanor was having an impact on him once again.* - Sat Dec 12 01:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) watches Akechi as she places her Robe back on, then nods his head at her comment.

"I-I think...I-I already f-found that person..."* - Sat Dec 12 01:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) takes the hand, not being reluctant at all this time. "Mkay..." He said, following along behind Akechi.* - Sat Dec 12 01:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Guess she's still out.. - Sat Dec 12 01:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm... - Sat Dec 12 01:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) squeezes Akechi's hand tightly, pulling himself closer to her as he did. "I-it's always s-so...ominous i-in Konoha n-now..."* - Sat Dec 12 01:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) pulls himself even closer still, almost as if he were trying to hide behind her like a shy child would his mother.

"I-It's just so quiet...a-and some of the p-people here a-aren't that n-nice..."* - Sat Dec 12 01:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I-I wish there were m-more people l-like you around... - Sat Dec 12 01:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Aw... that's very sweet of you to say. - Sat Dec 12 01:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) squeezes her hand tightly again after that comment. "Mmmmm..." He would let out again, almost as if he were a little flustered by what she said. He really wasn't good with that kind of talk.* - Sat Dec 12 01:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Hrm? You okay? - Sat Dec 12 01:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm.... - Sat Dec 12 01:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) shakes his head a little, probably nudging Akechi with his head as he did considering how close he was to her.* - Sat Dec 12 01:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mmmmmm... - Sat Dec 12 01:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) looks down, continually squeezing Akechi's hand nervously, he was shaking a little too.

"Mmmmmm..." He would hum again, struggling for words. Something seemed to be bothering him.* - Sat Dec 12 01:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) squeezes Akechi's hand really hard as he begins to speak, this was obviously a touchy subject for him. His head was still looking down, too embarrased to look up at her.

"W-Why...Why do you...Mm...d-do you c-call me sweet a-a-and h-hold my hand..?"* - Sat Dec 12 01:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) eases up on the death grip he was giving her hand. He would then slowly look up at her, his eyes red and sore. A small smile would then appear on his face, showing that what she said really resonated with him. He would moves around the front of her, letting go of her hand. Instead he would bring up both of his arms and wrap them around her, just above her wait, pulling himself into her. He would shed a tear or two from each eye, unintentionally wiping them on her robe.

"Akechi..." he says, not really knowing what else to say.* - Sat Dec 12 01:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) grips onto her tightly, holding her in said hug. He couldn't put his finger on it but when he was around her he was so much more relaxed and loose, it was like she was already family to him...but he didn't know why.

He would nod his head lightly as she spoke, taking in what she was saying. "Okay...I'm don't feel like that when...i'm around you."* - Sat Dec 12 02:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) loosens his grip on Akechi, going for a more gentle approach when hugging her now.

"I-I appreciate it Akechi...I don't have anyone else..."* - Sat Dec 12 02:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akechi(SephirothMage) says: Well.. that's something we should work on, huh? MRm.. - Sat Dec 12 02:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) knocks on the door with a shakey hand. He didn't really want to have to resort to what he was planning to do but since the training field had been destroyed...he needed a new and quiet place to train.* - Sat Dec 12 21:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kai(Ultimate_Odyssey) would go wide eye'd as the door swung open, he didn't expect anyone to be home. His realy plan was actually to break into this house and use it as his own personal training ground since he had never seen anyone go near this place, let alone live here. Ziare would notice the now young teen would sink back a little, his head dropping down and his arms being pushed back nervously. His right hand would lift up and grab a hold of his upper left arm, gripping it tightly as he sunk into his usual shy and timid ways.

"H-H-H...Mm...H-H-Hello..." His voice was as quiet and shakey as ever.* - Sat Dec 12 21:33:10 2015
