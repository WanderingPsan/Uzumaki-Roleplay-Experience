<br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) pressed her back against the mansion, leaning toward the wall of the mansion. She peeked off in front of her from behind the post blocking most of her vision.* - Sun Aug 30 19:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) sipped on some Red Drank behind a tall cardboard with "ARMORSMITH" written on the front. The lavender headed girl stared half liddedly at the environment around her. Atop the cardboard rested materials key to making a sports cup reinforced with steel.* - Sun Aug 30 21:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) flinched slightly. She peeked her head from between the vending machine and the statue, looking up at the male with raised eyes, her burgundy orbs ascending then descending as she identified him from head to toe.* - Sun Aug 30 21:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) answered in a relatively dull manner. "Inaba, Suzuna."

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) conjured a jockstrap reinforced with steel from the small materials she had at her disposal. It definitely wasn't much, considering how impoverished she was as of recent time. She extended her arms upright toward the male, the jockstrap resting within her palms.

"Would you like this? I doubt anyone'd pay for it... though that was the point of me making this place.." She said, her burgundy orbs gliding along the perimeter of the cardboard box in front of her.* - Sun Aug 30 21:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) sunk her head, closing one of her palms over the jockstrap. She pocketed the small piece of equipment. Her eyes sunk to the ground, breaking any eye contact she had with the male.

"I apologize. I don't have enough materials, or resources, to make armor.."

She wasn't exactly shy, but she wasn't inclined to social interaction either. Her voice was soft all the time, so naturally it was hard to tell.* - Sun Aug 30 21:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) sat behind a small, steel-composed booth. She pounded away at a thick piece of iron, flattening it and broadening it's perimeter. Not a single aspect of her figure came in contact with the table in front of her, specifically because it was like an upsidedown kotatsu, serving heat to the area atop the table, instead of beneath it.

The iron was noticeably becoming more malleable. She slowly melted a series of highly fireproof, and heat-resistant materials. She melded the materials to the massive piece of iron. Utilizing a hammer, and a series of other tools she shaped the iron into what seemed to be a lightweight, easily fitting chestplate. Applying a very fine layer composed of plastic, rubber and wood. She a total of these three layers between the iron's thickness. Each layer of anti-conducting materials would have small air pockets in their form.

She'd allow the thin, impressively made chestplate to cool off. She cracked her knuckles, though it hurt because she was -extremely- flimsy, durability-wise.* - Fri Sep 11 16:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) peered at the iron chestplate. She'd mumble.

"So... it's super resistant to electricity. Very durable. The air pockets make the armor extra-durable. The way they're formed is to trap air in them."* - Fri Sep 11 16:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) tied her hair into a basic bun. She'd proceed to make herself comfortably behind her small booth, her tools and materials that she used hidden behind the metallic table she was seated behind. The lavender haired girl proceeded to take out a gathering of tools, in addition to a decent amount of steel. The table she was utilizing wasn't ordinary. She fumbled around with some things behind the booth, narrowing her eyes as the top of the table began to heat up. It was an upsidedown kotatsu, in a manner.

Instead of heating the area beneath the table, it heated the area above. She placed the large portion of steel atop the table, making it more malleable, before proceeding to halt the heat being conjured by the table's mechanisms. With the malleable metal in her possession, she'd begin to mold it to the shape she desired, by utilizing the hammer in her possession, as well as other tools she had at her disposal. Beween layers of the highly manipulatable piece of equipment she'd meld materials that were key to heat resistance, as well as electricity insulation. At the same time, the materials didn't weigh down the chestplate.

At that point, she practically sculpted out the chestplate's appearance after having taken care of the more important part. She kept an odd pair of gloves on that seemed to aid her in resisting the heat resonating from the hot steel as she thrashed her hammer against it in specified angles, properly formulating it's perimeter, size and features. With a simple glance toward Seisuke, she'd identified the perfect size for the armor she was creating for him.

She attempted to lift the armor, immediately knowing that it classified as lightweight, when her brittle self was capable of lifting it, of course with some difficultiies.

"Alright." She resonated. The steel chestplate was knight-like, and the quality was impressive.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) never heard of the Yukimura clan. She had small difficulty with holding the armor, but that was about it. She readjusted the armor within her grasp so that she could hold it with her arm coiled around it, while her other extended forth as she shook his hand.

"Inaba, Suzuna." She'd state, looking up to him. She was a little under five feet tall, and was at a sufficient weight for her age, maintaining a thin appearance.* - Sat Sep 12 18:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) didn't really acknowledge his compliment on her name. She coiled her arm around the armor once more, holding it with both of her arms after she'd shook his hand. She seemed to be the quiet-type. She'd attempt to hand over the chest plate to him, and if he'd accept she'd tuck her hands away within her pockets. Her burgundy eyes discerned his frame from head to toe, as she silently awaited for the money that he promised.

"Does that mean I will or won't be able to take other clients? I believe I didn't interpret that properly." She'd remark. Her voice had a natural hint of politeness to it's slightly low pitch.* - Sat Sep 12 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) felt some unease tug at her when she looked into his eyes, but otherwise she could easily identify that he was from the Gezo, confirming why he offered such a high price, and why there was no fault in his appearance. She nodded, pressing her fingertips to her chin, her burgundy irises narrowing at the light brown ground at her feet. She looked up at him, nodding slightly.

"Sure. I'll accept the position."

She pulled out the hair tie, undoing the bun she'd provided herself with. Suzuna would run her hand through her long, slightly curly, lavender hair. Her burgundy irises had a glint of passion to them, but they were otherwise bright. Her skin was pale, but had a minro, healthy glow to it. She wore an orange and white track jacket, as well as a pair of black skirt, as well as a shirt matching it beneath her track jacket.

A pair of black open-toed boots covered her feet. She always wore a dazed, nonchalant look on her face. A single, medium-length strand of hair stuck up, curling to the right on her head. Her hair was extremely smooth and shiny looking, suggesting that she appreciated it as much as she appreciated her occupation as an armor smith.* - Sat Sep 12 19:13:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) slowly began to fumble around with some materials. She melded them into a proper structure for what exactly she intended to make. She studied the shape and size of her inner ear, devising an equation that would accurately define how she could block off -all- aspects of hearing that she possessed, as long as the objects she planned on producing were within her inner ears. She produced a small rectangular object, melding steel with an immense amount of materials that made it damn-near impossible for sound to travel through. Shortly after doing such, Suzuna would allow the small rectangular objects, black in color, to cool off.

Once they'd cooled, the lavender haired girl slid the cubes of metal and other materials into her ear, successfully blocking her off from hearing anything in the vicinity. Of course, she fitted the small objects to maintain their position within her ear, and not fall out, or fall in. With little thought put in, she'd efficiently conjured a solution to her issue with hearing them whine back and forth.* - Sat Sep 12 22:51:31 2015

From beneath the table she revealed small ringlets of iron, produced by thin strips of the costly material. The lavender haired girl would proceed to link the ringlets in a defined pattern. Though the process took an incredibly long time, she was advancing at a decent rate, using time-saving methods that would preserve the amount of resources she had in her possession and decrease the overall time it took.

By utilizing her basic understanding of welding, pressing and riveting she linked the small ringlets into clothing, otherwise chainmail. Due to the thin, yet burly, as well as -extremely- efficient manner in which the chainmail was made, it was light to wear, as well as hold. In a few hours of time she had made a chainmail suit, which covered every aspect of anyone's body beneath their head. The chainmail suit was noticeably broad, limb-wise, crotch-wise and also torso-wise. An extra, inner layer lined with spandex made the suit of armor fittable to most people. Extra threads were located within the inside, and a complex system of wiring in the suit allowed it to recognize one's body shape, and 'squeeze' around it to the point that the suit was skintight.

Essentially, the armor was made to fit to whomever wore it. She didn't exactly have machines to aid her, nor anyone else of her intellectual capacity to help her create the chainmail suits. Thus, she started with the painful task of making these odd suits for the next week or so, intent on providing the military with something that'd hopefully aid them in the antagonist soon to come.* - Tue Sep 15 21:06:59 2015

The girl would seat herself behind the table she had within the courtyard, exhaling in relief. She'd worked intensely for the past few days.* - Thu Sep 17 17:31:05 2015
