<br><br><font color=yellow>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) frowned a little bit. The black-haired female would turn to her side. She began to form the handseals that she recalled him performing. After doing so, the girl would attempt to build up her chakra network for proper usage of the technique. She recalled his demonstration, and applied what she saw visually as what she wanted her results with attempting the technique to be.

The female would proceed to knead the chakra that she built up into flames. After doing so, she would expel a very thin stream consisting of high volume of flames at the vicinity in front of her. The stream itself was weak, and the user had no experience with performing Fire techniques, thus there was no harm in her actions. Amaterasu was displeased with the results, and she eagerly halted the flow of chakra out of her mouth. The stream thinned out until the flames exiting her mouth were no longer visible, and had completely stopped.

Her tongue hung out of her mouth, and dark puffs of smoke exited it. "Hot... hot... hot.." She'd murmur rather comically, panting like a dog while slightly hunched forth. The female would lean back a bit, forming the handsigns once more. This time, she was much more accurate, and her gloved digits didn't fumble over one another while forming them.

Amaterasu would allow a massive buildup of chakra to concentrate. She knew for a fact that she had a good understanding of releasing the flamethrower, but she was more captivated by shooting a fireball. With that being said, she added double the chakra, kneading the chakra into flames as it built up within her throat. Her cheeks and chest puffed up as she retracted her upper torso and head, her arms clenching at her sides. She threw her right arm up to her mouth, funneling the chakra through the small opening made by the area between her pressed together pointer and thumb.

A stream of fire flew from her mouth, progressing into what seemed to be an enormous, stationary, spherical inferno of flames.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) formed the Rat handsign, smirking.

"Hope this isn't an 'attack' in your eyes." Midora's own shadow stretched outward, bypassing it's own length and running along the ground quickly, before connecting itself with Mitsunara's own shadow.

Mitsunara would find herself being inadvertently aligned with Midora's own posture and of the like.

"Heh."

Midora jabbed her own right nipple with her index finger, causing Mitsunara to do the same to her own chest.

"Kekeke, cool huh?"* - Wed Nov 11 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Yeah, stop that. - Wed Nov 11 05:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) wiggled her arms in unison with Mitsunara, but only because she was practically forcing the female to do so. Their arms were like wild tidal waves.

"Leedle leedle leedle... heh."* - Wed Nov 11 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) frowned, then smirked again.

"Was fun while it lasted, heh."* - Wed Nov 11 05:28:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) attempted to form the Rat handsign and take control of Yan.

She'd start forcing him to slap himself.

"Kekeke! Stop slapping yourself!"* - Wed Nov 11 05:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) allowed her shadow to recde back to her. She stood up, only after snatching as much sushi as possible.

"Heh."* - Wed Nov 11 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ....Uhh huh. - Wed Nov 11 05:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) thinks: Kekeke. I'm such a ninja. - Wed Nov 11 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) quirked a brow at Yan subliminally.

She formed the Rat handsign.

Then she smiled a savage smile.

"Wanna see a trick?" She looked up at him.* - Wed Nov 11 05:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) thinks: Tetsumi sure is the popular one - Wed Nov 11 05:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) suddenly connected this nigga's shadow with her own, faster then he avoided child support for the girls he was accused of raping.

She took an accurate guess at the gap in their heights, then she proceeded to extend her arm downward, as Tetsumi did as well because she had control over his body via. his shadow.

"Heh."

She made a clutching motion at the air, and while she was clutching the air, Tetsumi would find himself uncontrollably clutching one of her breasts. Unless these niggas had really good eyes or were just plain smart, they may've not recognized she had control over his body.

After this little action of hers, she released his body and shadow from her clutches, while also allowing her breast to be released from his clutches as she unclenched her corresponding hand.

"I'm just joshin'. Don't drown me in a sand castle."

She scurried off.* - Wed Nov 11 05:53:42 2015

<He's... controlling the -sand-..?> She said with a lifting of her brow, blinking several times while looking at him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) formed the Rat handsign. She intended to take control of Shira's shadow, at which point she'd place her hand in the same area where a weapon-storaging garment resided on Shira's body, though she was doing this to her own body. Shira would do the same involuntarily, only because she had control over his body. While he grasped hold of a kunai, she only made the motion of grabbing one.

"Kekeke..."

She jabbed near the area between her buttocks, but didn't actually have her hand come in contact. Shira's hand didn't come in contact with his butt either. Instead, the tip of the kunai came in contact with the crevice between his butt cheeks, causing him to stab himself in the asshole.

She released his shadow, being as subtle as possible with the action she forced him to do.

"Whatcha doing? You aren't supposed to use kunai's to scratch your ass, kid."* - Wed Nov 11 22:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) tensed up slightly as she saw the palm coming her way. Luckily, the shadow caught the male just in time.

"Raucous one aren't you, heh?"

She made him draw a kunai knife from any storage garment on his person that wasn't on hers in the corresponding vicinity. She would then proceed to force him to shove a kunai up his asshole, while she was empty-handed.

By doing it like this, she was only making the gesture, rather then doing the same to herself.

She played off the action, releasing his shadow directly after knowing for a fact that the kunai was an inch or two up his butt. She'd know depending on his reaction.

"You don't use kunai knives for scratching your butt, kekeke."* - Wed Nov 11 22:50:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I haven't seen a prankster this good, since myself. I'll catch her! - Thu Nov 12 03:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) looked back again, smirking when she noticed that he came to a stop. She pivoted on her feet, tucking her hands in her pockets. The ginger laughed with an inclination of her head to the sky. Her torso was curved back a bit.

"Kekekekeke! Tired huh?"

She noticed that she somehow managed to drop all of the marijuana that she smuggled from Yan's home on the ground. And she noticed right as a weak breeze mixed it up even more amidst the grains of sand. Her mouth was that of a flat line.

"I'm not ready for this responsibility.... man I was ready to smoke for the first time in my life."

She maintained her carefree posture and look, as well as her small, arrogant smirk.* - Thu Nov 12 03:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) continued smirking.

"Just a little further."

<It'd be a real dick move to jump back... a real.. dick move..>

Her left leg began to slide back subtly, but instead of jumping back she moved forth, standing in front of him.

"I'm awaiting, sandy boy."

<Sandy boy sounds better.>* - Thu Nov 12 03:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) got crushed by his weight, and the weight of his armor. She squeezed her arms out to place her hands on his shoulders.

"Heh.. sandy boy. You're... kinda crushing.. me here.. or are you crushing -on- me.. ?"

Her smirk grew wider, though getting fallen on hurt like a -bitch-.* - Thu Nov 12 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) chuckled. She'd attempt to clasp his hand with her own. While he was helping her up, she'd attempt to tug on his hand a little bit, aiming to yank him forth to submerge his face in her bosom!

"Or have you?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) whispers: I am here for those Yams. .  - Thu Nov 12 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) 's eyes went agape as he did the unexpected.

"Hmf.. you're a formidable opponent." She remarked with a slightly smaller smirk.

Her hand remained clasped upon his.* - Thu Nov 12 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh well. - Thu Nov 12 03:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Oh? - Thu Nov 12 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: Obviously, heh. - Thu Nov 12 03:41:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) clasped his hand, pulling him forth and pressing her form against his.

"You're a daring one, huh?"* - Thu Nov 12 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) whispers: How daring... do you think I am? - Thu Nov 12 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) looked up at the male, her chin resting upon his chest mainly due to the gap in their heights. She agree'd with his response. "Yep, heh." She murmured a response to his utter.* - Thu Nov 12 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: T-This is.. actually nice.. - Thu Nov 12 04:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: What is this feeling?.. - Thu Nov 12 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) was dragged along, an eyebrow raising as he performed this action.* - Thu Nov 12 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Daring but.. What should I do?.. - Thu Nov 12 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: I'll follow Hassan's books!!! - Thu Nov 12 04:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) seemed to have thrown herself in a situation that she was surprisingly unable to handle. Mizora bit her lip, her gaze drifting up to him. The girl was pressed against the wall, and her arms hung in ease at her size. One of her arms guided itself to his shoulders, partially wrapping around them and pulling him closer.

"It seems we're both newbies at what we're trying to do here, no?" Midora would state, chuckling nervously and averting her gaze briefly, before it drifted back up to Tetsumi.* - Thu Nov 12 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: What.. was I even trying to do?... *sigh* - Thu Nov 12 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh no.. That happened... S-Shit. - Thu Nov 12 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) felt something poke her midsection. Her other arm latched out to grasp onto him, tugging him back from pulling away from the close-situation. She looked down, finding that it was apparent that he was more turned on then his look let on.

"Come on.. don't give up now.." She'd state, standing on her tippy toes but still unable to meet him face to face. She nestled her head into the side of his neck and upper shoulder.* - Thu Nov 12 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: I-I won't give up as yet... - Thu Nov 12 04:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) allowed him to do so. Her shoulders tensed, while her arms remained at her sides, her hands bundling into slightly clenched fists. "Nnnh.." She moaned, her knees growing weak. She was extremely sensitive physically, and that was demonstrated by her reaction to him fumbling around with her breasts. The petite girl's half-lidded gaze shifted down to him.

She was definitely intoxicated by his actions.

"S..Sandy... boy.."* - Thu Nov 12 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: She's really sensitive... - Thu Nov 12 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) embraced him tightly, partially declined into his lap. She threw her head back, slamming her eyes shut and biting her lower lip tightly. An immense amount of pleasure that she never experienced before immersed her, overwhelming her nerves. she pulled him closer with the tightening of her arms around the nape of his neck. He was good for a first-timer, in her eyes.* - Thu Nov 12 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) coiled her arms tightly around him, her head nestling up against his chest once more. "You... went a little further than I expected, heh." She'd murmur. Midora was slightly woozy from such an experience. "I was going to return the favor of pleasuring me... but.. I'm sort of.." A muffled yawn interrupted her mid-sentence.* - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: G'night.. - Thu Nov 12 05:20:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) fell asleep.* - Thu Nov 12 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Oh... She's still here?... - Fri Nov 13 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) was asleep at the table, her arms folded together with her face pressed to her forearms.* - Fri Nov 13 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) slowly lifted her head, shifting her gaze to the left, then to the right. Midora scooched over to him sloppily, latching onto his right arm.

"I'm using your arm for a pillow, sandy boy.." She murmured.* - Fri Nov 13 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: Sleepy. - Fri Nov 13 01:29:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: The life of a cat? I don't know if I should feel relieved or scared. - Fri Nov 13 01:32:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) thinks: Who the hell is Izanami? - Sat Nov 14 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) stayed quiet.

She formed the Rat handsign and listened very closely.* - Sat Nov 14 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) thinks: heh. - Sat Nov 14 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) decided not to do anything. She couldn't think of anything in a situation like this.* - Sat Nov 14 02:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) yelped lightly, quickly attempting to stifle her voice.

<Damn that was unexpected..> * - Sat Nov 14 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) simply sat there.* - Sat Nov 14 03:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) -finally- replied to Tetsumi's comment dryly.

"The ginger." She spoke dryly in reference to herself, remaining huddled up against the wall.* - Sat Nov 14 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: Why're you reacting so wildly? - Sat Nov 14 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Uhh.... - Sat Nov 14 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: N-Never seen a nakid female.. before... - Sat Nov 14 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: Haha. - Sat Nov 14 03:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) stood up, extending her arms out. She made a small twirl.

"Well. Now you have."* - Sat Nov 14 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *gulp* - Sat Nov 14 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) moved forth, aiming to embrace him.

"I need you for a body pillow, again."

She was soaking wet.* - Sat Nov 14 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) ascended onto her tippy toes until she was completely off of the ground, relying on their mutual embrace of one another to allow her to do so. The orange-haired girl intended to crane her head forth, with intentions of pressing her lips to his.* - Sat Nov 14 04:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) had initially performed this action to turn him on more and perhaps even entice him. However, she didn't expect the reaction that she received, nor did she expect the feeling that she got. It was like a mix of lust... something she was familiar with, and another fragment of sentiment that she was unfamiliar with. Her eyes went agape slightly, then they narrowed to their normal size as she returned the intimacy that he invested into the kiss. Her arms tightly coiled around his shoulders, her body pressing to his, with her breasts pressing against his chest.* - Sat Nov 14 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) felt something poke her stomach. The girl would lower her gaze to the bulge, before staring up at Tetsumi again. Her right arm removed itself from his shoulders, her left arm attempting to wrap around them completely. She tugged him closer, running her thin fingers across what she presumed to be the surface of the bulge that lie beneath the texture of his pants. She looked down at said bulge, then back up at him with a small, mischievous smile.

"I guess my lewdness rubbed off on you, huh, Mr. Innocent?"

She was toying around with him of course, at least with her dialogue. Her actions, on the otherhand, were out of affection for him.* - Sat Nov 14 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: This is... - Sat Nov 14 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) moaned lightly, her small hand continuing to fumble around with his shaft. She buried her face in his chest,  her breasts pressing against him as she pressed her torso to the male. She couldn't describe the latent feeling that she had for Tetsumi, but she knew for a fact that she never had it for anyone else. It seemed that he was the tranquilizer to her sadistic, humorous qualities. While it was slightly annoying to her that it was this way, it was also... calming.* - Sat Nov 14 04:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) felt her knees get weak. Her moans grew greater, as well as louder, even though she did her best to stifle them. The girl's stroking of his member slowed it's pace, her hand gliding upon his pants then slipping into them. She would coil her fingers around his shaft, surprised by it's immense warmth. Her knees were debillitated, but none the less, while she took this as a competition to see who could masturbate the other better, she was subconscious of the true meaning behind this exchange of actions.

"Nnnh..."* - Sat Nov 14 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) felt her fingers slip away. She'd -definitely- lost this battle. The girl threw her head back, pressing her chin to his chest as her fingernails ran down his back, clawing at it lightly as the wave of ecstasy and pleasure ran through her body when his digit dipped into her pink walls. She moaned loudly, her body quivering as she practically leaned onto Tetsumi for physical support.

"Nn... gh..."* - Sat Nov 14 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) continued to use him as support as she moaned loudly, beginning to orgasm as she coated his fingers in more of his juices. Her breathes were ragged, and while she remained in close proximity to him it seemed she was trying to squirm her way out of being forcefully masturbated by the male. All the while, her loud moans resonated continously.* - Sat Nov 14 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) coiled her arms around Tetsumi, pressing her face to his chest and simply laying on him.

"Mmmh..."* - Sat Nov 14 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) says: I'm sleepy.. - Sat Nov 14 05:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) snored lightly in his chest.* - Sat Nov 14 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) continued to sleep.* - Sat Nov 14 05:54:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Aza, have you found any music that works really well for you? - Sun Nov 15 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: Eh. . . - Sun Nov 15 04:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Grimfred, Aza(SS2015) says: I couldn't find one. . . - Sun Nov 15 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Midora(Tsundere-san) spoke in her normal tone, running her fingers through her ginger head. It was honestly unnecessary for a response to a murmur from Tetsumi.

"Yeah, still kind of tired though."* - Sun Nov 15 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Midora(Tsundere-san) thinks: nigga cant even see that this is a courtyard, gah'damn - Sun Nov 15 04:42:52 2015
