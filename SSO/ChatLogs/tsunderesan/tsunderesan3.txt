<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) took a rather large piece of steel. The girl would begin carving a section of it, forming the rather malleable piece of metal into what seemed to be a quite lengthy blade. She'd bang upon the metat, curving the shape of what she assumed to be it's blade. If anything, she was playing around and adjusting to weapon smithery rather than doing anything major.* - Fri Oct  2 23:15:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) exhaled. She ketp thrashing the hammer upon the surface of the steel. She evened out the shape of the blade, in addition to it's handle. The girl would look at the blade, proceeding to jab it into the ground in front of her. Clearly she hadn't sharpened the blade of the katana, because it couldn't pierce the compressed gravel at all.

"Insufficient.."* - Fri Oct  2 23:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) placed the katana back on the table. Using numerous tools she'd slowly begin to sharpe the blade. She would sharpen it as much as possible. The lavender haired female would test out the blade's sharpness by stabbing the tip of it into the ground. The katana didn't pierce whatsoever, proving that her ability to sharpen her weaponry was inefficient.* - Fri Oct  2 23:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) placed the katana back on the table. The lavender haired girl continued to serrate and sharpen the katana's blade with more knowledge on how to do so, now that she was more experienced with the action. Suzuna narrowed her pair of burgundy eyes down at the katana. She didn't even bother to test it's weight, because she knew that while she could craft weaponry and armor she couldn't wear or use it.* - Fri Oct  2 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) yawned lightly. He'd remove a black flute from the confines of his jacket. He'd wipe at it with a small handkerchief, before pressing his lips to the hole. The male would simply allow well-performed, soft notes to resonate from the small musical instrument. The black haired male would exhale, simply smiling lightly when he felt the hairs on his back stand up.

It was a reaction to the descending meteor of flames above him. He could literally feel his skin searing from the meteor as it made it's decent. "My genjutsu...." He'd state lightly, turning to face the direction where the meteor was descending. He'd simply gaze at it in it's entirety. "Is as proficient as ever." He'd state. Suddenly, the ball of flames descending to the earth would become a massive glacier of ice.

"Freeze."

The glacier of ice inside of the genjutsu would smash down upon him, breaking him out of it. Shivers immersed his frame. He was unfathomably cold. "Pff.... so chilly." He'd state, chuckling some. It seemed that he was rather laidback at the witness of his own genjutsu.* - Thu Oct  8 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) leaned against the fence behind him, his hands coiled around a small musical instrument. It appeared to be a saxophone, when inspected. His scarf, which typically concealed his mouth wasn't up for this occasion. He seemed to be playing the chorus to this song:

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) peered at Ayumi out of his peripheral, shifting his head entirely and removing his lips from the small instrument. "You're the first shinobi that I've seen around here." He'd state, a small smile forming. His personality seemed as pleasant as his musical gift.* - Fri Oct  9 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) thinks: I'm good with the saxophone and the flute. I want to get to playing guitar. - Fri Oct  9 01:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) lifted a single brow. It seemed that she wasn't interested in speaking to him. He'd shrug, an exhale escaping his mouth as he started practicing what little faults there were in his saxophone playing.* - Fri Oct  9 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) thinks: I should befriend the one person that I've seen for days.. shouldn't I? - Fri Oct  9 01:36:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) stopped allowing musical notes to resonate from his saxophone as he kept playing it. Isshin drifted his onyx-stare to her once more.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: I'm Isshin. Nice to meet you. - Fri Oct  9 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Yeah... - Fri Oct  9 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: If there're any restaurants left in this village, wanna go? Of course.. I doubt there's anyone to man the restaurant... not sure about fo---nevermind. - Fri Oct  9 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Sure? - Fri Oct  9 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Huh? - Fri Oct  9 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: I wish not to impose.. - Fri Oct  9 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: It is fine - Fri Oct  9 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: It is? - Fri Oct  9 02:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: I figured it wasn't.. considering your distant manner.. - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: No offense, it just seems that you're.. not really enthusiastic about talking to me. - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: It is just how I am. - Fri Oct  9 02:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: . . . . - Fri Oct  9 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ambrocio(XenoKuthric) says: ..Nnh. - Fri Oct  9 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) took a brief glance at the three in the vicinity. He didn't trust, or like either of them. He'd close the distance between himself and Ayumi, whispering to her faintly.* - Fri Oct  9 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) whispers: Should we go elsewhere..? I don't like their vibes. - Fri Oct  9 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Calm.. - Fri Oct  9 02:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Why are these people staring at us.. - Fri Oct  9 02:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Let's go. - Fri Oct  9 02:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) couldn't help but notice the symbol on Hideki's back. His eyes noticeably widened, then squinted once more as he maintained his casual gaze.

<I saw the same symbol near the rubble on the eastern part of the village... a Konoha native?> He'd think, before extending his hand out to Ayumi and whispering to her. Shortly after he would start giving a basic stare to the four males.

"Welcome to the village hidden in rubble, formerly Konoha." He'd state, a small smile forming. He assumed he could trust Hideki, but the others... he wasn't sure yet. His facial features didn't show off any of his opinions on them, though.* - Fri Oct  9 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) tucked his hand that he offered to Ayumi in his pocket. He exhaled lightly.* - Fri Oct  9 02:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) scanned Ayumi's features, trying to be discreet. He'd attempt making conversation.

"Are you interested in music?"* - Fri Oct  9 02:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Not really. - Fri Oct  9 02:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Huh.. - Fri Oct  9 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hm.. - Fri Oct  9 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Ayumi. Do you have a residence.. or was it destroyed? - Fri Oct  9 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: I don't think it was destroyed. - Fri Oct  9 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Think doesn't sound good... - Fri Oct  9 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: If you need a place to stay you can stay with me for awhile. There's plenty of space. It's actually meant for more than one person.. but.. I'm the only person living there. - Fri Oct  9 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Okay. - Fri Oct  9 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Thanks. - Fri Oct  9 02:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: So silent here. - Fri Oct  9 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: I assume so... - Fri Oct  9 02:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: I'd rather relax at my house.. but then I'd have no one to talk to..so.. - Fri Oct  9 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: It's a lose lose situation. - Fri Oct  9 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hm.. - Fri Oct  9 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Place always has something going on. - Fri Oct  9 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Why don't you two come to my house? There's nothing better to do. - Fri Oct  9 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Sure why not? - Fri Oct  9 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Alright.. how about you, red-haired one? - Fri Oct  9 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Me? - Fri Oct  9 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well...May as well.. - Fri Oct  9 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) would extend his hand out to Ayumi's, clasping hers whether she expected it or not, attempting to guide her in the direction that his house resided. He'd drift his onyx-gaze back to Zephira, smiling lightly and slowing down his pace so that she could follow without losing track of the male.* - Fri Oct  9 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Make yourself comfortable. - Fri Oct  9 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: You can sleep over if you want, doesn't matter to me. The bed in the upper right corner's mine. - Fri Oct  9 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Ok. - Fri Oct  9 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Sometimes I sleep in a futon too, but that doesn't matter. Either of you want to play a game or something..? - Fri Oct  9 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Cool. - Fri Oct  9 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Does that mean you don't want to play a game..or..? - Fri Oct  9 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Are you hungry? - Fri Oct  9 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: I am. - Fri Oct  9 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) thinks: Please say n---shit. - Fri Oct  9 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Alright... - Fri Oct  9 04:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Oh this is the place huh? - Fri Oct  9 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Uhuh. - Fri Oct  9 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Seems nice , big too. - Fri Oct  9 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I probably wont need to sleep over though...The game sounds fun.. - Fri Oct  9 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) underhand passed her a bag of sour onion chips. "Eat this while I try to cook something." He said, emphasizing 'try'. He'd approach the kitchen. He sauntered into the kitchen with nearly inaudible steps, as though he was approaching a monster that could bite his face off at a moment's notice. "Proficient at music and proficient at genjutsu... but no experience at cooking.." He'd exhale.

Isshin would slowly run his hands across the filled shelves, removing several ingredients. He'd fish throughout the fridge, getting ingredients from the appliance as well. Shortly after, he'd use said ingredients to make a meal and what not.

(w/e too sleepy for details.. there'd be five extra paragraphs in this paragraph if this included indepth cooking.)

Isshin would move away from the kitchen holding a big bowl of rice in one hand, and strips of saute'd and sauced up beef within a plate in the other. He'd set the two dishes down, returning to the kitchen and distancing himself from the kitchen soon after with fried vegetables drenched in the same sauce. The sauce seemed to be soy sauce with a few other ingredients. The food was set upon the dining table within the home.

His onyx-orbs would set themselves upon Ayumi as he drifted his gaze to across the room. "Food's ready." He'd state, smiling lightly then proceeding to look down at it. The food was colorful and almost glistening with deliciousness. <Did I really make this?> He'd wonder.* - Fri Oct  9 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) five extra paragraphs in this roleplay** - Fri Oct  9 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Uhuh. No problem. - Fri Oct  9 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) trotted to his bed, plopping down on it.

"I'm gonna try and get some sleep."* - Fri Oct  9 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Sleep? At this hour? - Fri Oct  9 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Yes. - Fri Oct  9 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well, is it fine if I cook something? - Fri Oct  9 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I'm starved. - Fri Oct  9 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: There's enough food for you and Ayumi, that I cooked. - Fri Oct  9 04:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Sigh... - Fri Oct  9 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Ayumi, how bad was the food on a scale from one to ten? - Fri Oct  9 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) thinks: It may've -looked- perfectly fine... but the taste matters. - Fri Oct  9 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: One. - Fri Oct  9 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Expected as much. - Fri Oct  9 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: It was good. - Fri Oct  9 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: One is good? - Fri Oct  9 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Yes. - Fri Oct  9 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Hm... - Fri Oct  9 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: What're your thoughts on relationships? - Fri Oct  9 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: They happen. - Fri Oct  9 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) thinks: Vague. - Fri Oct  9 23:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Why did you ask? - Fri Oct  9 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: I'm not sure. I've always wondered what it's like to be in a relationship, since I haven't experienced one myself. - Fri Oct  9 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Nor anything involved with them. - Fri Oct  9 23:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Cool. - Fri Oct  9 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Honestly, I'm envious of people who've been in them. - Fri Oct  9 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: How about you? - Fri Oct  9 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Not one to get in relationships. - Fri Oct  9 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: The guy would have to really wow me. - Fri Oct  9 23:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: How are you wow'd? - Fri Oct  9 23:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Fiind out. - Fri Oct  9 23:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: That makes it harder. - Fri Oct  9 23:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: It does. - Fri Oct  9 23:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Sigh... - Fri Oct  9 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: So. Wanna live here with me? I'll cook and all that good stuff. I've needed a roomate ever since I've got this place. - Fri Oct  9 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Sure. - Fri Oct  9 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: No weird stuff though. - Fri Oct  9 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: What do you mean by that? - Fri Oct  9 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: Don't try anything. - Fri Oct  9 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Ah.. alright. - Fri Oct  9 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Want to play a game or something? - Fri Oct  9 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Or... are you hungry, again? - Fri Oct  9 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ayumi(Jell0) says: I just want to sit. - Fri Oct  9 23:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  9 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Redhead, I never got your name. - Sat Oct 10 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Me? - Sat Oct 10 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well...It's Zephira.. - Sat Oct 10 00:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Zephira eh..? What're your living conditions? You could live here if you like; with me and Ayumi. - Sat Oct 10 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well..I have an apartment, but would it really be okay? - Sat Oct 10 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: It would. I have no problem with it. - Sat Oct 10 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I wouldn't want to leech or anything. - Sat Oct 10 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) thinks: He seems a bit welcoming.. - Sat Oct 10 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Honestly. It's alright. You wouldn't be intruding upon anything. - Sat Oct 10 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Really?...Hm.. - Sat Oct 10 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I'll take it into considering ..But I think I should head back to my apartment..My roomamtes a prick.. - Sat Oct 10 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: She's not a shinobi...So she cmplains about me coming back with people after me.. - Sat Oct 10 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) lifted a brow.

"Oh? Well. If you're comfortably with moving into here, I can go with you and help carry stuff."* - Sat Oct 10 01:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well..Sure if you'f like.. - Sat Oct 10 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) thinks: What if he tries something funny?... - Sat Oct 10 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) nodded, heading over to the door.

"C'mon then, beautiful." He'd state, drifting his gaze back to her and smiling genuinely. He'd unlock the door with his key.* - Sat Oct 10 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Alright, I'll wait inside, unless you're comfortable with me coming in. - Sat Oct 10 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) removed a flute from his back pocket. He'd lower his scarf from over his mouth, exposing the small mole, basically a beauty mark, near the area below the left side of his thin lips. He'd lean against the fence, beginning to play soothing notes, stringing them together efficiently. He wasn't playing anything in specific. He closed his eyes, seeming to fall into a state of ease.* - Sat Oct 10 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Hm.. - Sat Oct 10 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Well. - Sat Oct 10 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: You can come on in.. - Sat Oct 10 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: I wouldn't mind.. - Sat Oct 10 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Okay. - Sat Oct 10 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Just that, my roommate is not home right now..So don't mind the silence. - Sat Oct 10 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) would proceed to step into the apartment, once she'd unlock the door. He'd hold the door open for the girl, discreetly drifting his onyx stare to Zephira to take in her bodily assets and features. After completing this task he'd start looking around at the home, peering at it's interior furnishing and what not.* - Sat Oct 10 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) nodded. He'd gather up some boxes, heading to her room and beginning to place clothes within said boxes. He'd probably finish before she was out of the shower, so until she was he'd sit anywhere that would be deemed appropriate, simply practicing on the saxophone while waiting with the boxes near his feet. The male would practice the chorus to this song, of course playing the saxophone part to it:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGiBiHocSZM* - Sat Oct 10 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) nodded. He'd rest the saxophone within a small bag that was slung over his right shoulder. He'd tuck his arms beneath two boxes, one beneath each. "It's fine, I was just practicing my instrument. You have lots of clothes." He'd state, referencing to the six boxes he'd most likely try carrying back. He was too much of a gentleman to let her do the work for him.* - Sat Oct 10 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zephira(Demon4626) says: Yeah, from my travels.. We should go shall we? - Sat Oct 10 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) says: Uhuh. - Sat Oct 10 01:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) carried the boxes along and what not, along with the rest of her belongings. He'd settle down within his home once he arrived from his last trip to Zephira's former residence. "Welcome home." He'd state when she'd enter the doorway, whether she was right behind him. He was breathing lightly.* - Sat Oct 10 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) slid his scarf over the lower part of his face again.* - Sat Oct 10 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) sat down on the bed. He'd pull down his scarf from over his mouth, starting to practice the saxophone.* - Sat Oct 10 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Isshin(Tsundere-san) thinks: Maybe I should've been a -little- indecent and peered at her panties. It didn't cross my mind, though. I wouldn't have regardless, such a thing wouldn't be right. - Sat Oct 10 02:14:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) formed the Ram handsign. A swirling tempest of rapid-flowing leaves would immerse her frame, concealing it as she vanished from view. The red-eye'd female would reappear a sufficient distance from her original location. It seemed that she suffered no cases of dizziness from her usage of the technique, except for one minor delay.* - Fri Oct 23 21:51:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: But why don't you use it for combat..? - Fri Oct 23 21:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: Huh? I think the answer's obvious. - Fri Oct 23 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: Unless you didn't see it for yourself, there was a delay to my movements after I did it. - Fri Oct 23 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: That interval in time is insufficient if I wanna use a method of combat that involves the usage of Shunshin. - Fri Oct 23 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh...Thats a shame... - Fri Oct 23 21:56:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: Eh? - Mon Nov  2 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: She isn't new. - Mon Nov  2 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You look more friendly than the guy to my left though. - Mon Nov  2 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: It'll be hard expecting that moving faster will make me better at combat.. I mean... that Speed Comet guy did it.. but.. - Mon Nov  2 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: Hm.... - Mon Nov  2 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) drifted her hand to her chin,  her bright red eyes peering at the ground at her feet. She'd press her back to the tree trunk behind her, leaning against it's frame. It was at this moment that she'd finally begun to contemplate what road she'd go down as a shinobi. She'd already made subpar progress down one of the many, but... the interest was diminishing. Hopefully it'd be reattained.* - Mon Nov  2 03:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: Just one of each..? Eh.... - Mon Nov  2 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) thinks: I shouldn't be picky, though. It was his choice to help me out.. - Mon Nov  2 03:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, I can teach you some more later. - Mon Nov  2 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Those are just the ones i'm most experienced with. - Mon Nov  2 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Also, will your friend be coming too Totsuka? - Mon Nov  2 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) says: Who? - Mon Nov  2 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: The guy standing next to you. - Mon Nov  2 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) 

"Guy standing next to--"

She drifted her gaze to Yu, yelping as she moved numerous inches to her right, looking at him with an agape, red gaze.

"O-Oh... you should've said something.." Amaterasu said, laughing it off lightly.* - Mon Nov  2 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Mon Nov  2 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) thinks: That's the first time someone has ever called me a man. - Mon Nov  2 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) lifted her right brow. Maybe there was malice in her tone that had gone unnoticed on her part? Anyways, she found the apology unecessary. The seemingly carefree individual would respond with an exhale.

"Uh... it's alright. I'm Amaterasu.. unless you were already here to hear me introduce myself."* - Mon Nov  2 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Totsuka, Amaterasu(Tsundere-san) appeared to be wearing a skintight black body suit which covered all but her head, but still concealed her neck. She'd nod lightly to Yu, pressing her back to the tree and leaning against it.* - Mon Nov  2 03:54:40 2015
