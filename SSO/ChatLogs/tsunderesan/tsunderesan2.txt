<br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) lifted her right arm over her head, arching it slightly. She swung downward, thrashing the hammer against the metal. She continued attempting to craft a knife made out of pure steel. Utilizing other tools she'd begin to twist the blade to the knife, giving it a unique, twisted, screw-driver like shape. The handle itself was curved, and made out of a series of metals. The metals producing the handle were cloaked by a thin veil of smooth wood, simply for fanciness.* - Thu Sep 17 18:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: It's edge.. as well as tip... is too dull.. - Thu Sep 17 18:58:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: If he's as rash as you describe, he's probably already started. - Thu Sep 17 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: If he has, that means he did send forces out to do it. Which mean their weaker at the moment.  - Thu Sep 17 19:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: Use any defensive measures possible. Surely you have shinobi there. - Thu Sep 17 19:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) drove the knife against the table, angling it perfectly in a manner that would define the sharpness of the knife but not hamper the table's overall efficiency, as it served as a table. Suzuna found that -no- aspect of cutting ability was applied to the knife. She began to sharpen it, though she was beginning to find such a task pointless.* - Thu Sep 17 19:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) grumbled, narrowing her eyes. "This'd be better for an ornament in some old person's house than a weapon." The girl puffed her cheeks, whipping the knife behind her. Since it had no stabbing capabilities, and no one other than her had 0 Durability, it'd bring no harm to anyone it struck.* - Thu Sep 17 19:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: I've sent a reply. - Thu Sep 17 19:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) says: Like I said, I bet he's started. - Thu Sep 17 19:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Inaba, Suzuna(Tsundere-san) slowly exposed some more steel, as well as iron she had in her possession. The lavender haired girl would eagerly begin to slap at it, melding it into shape utilizing her nifty hammer, in addition to her other tools. This time she was making a knife with a slightly curved blade. The tip had a small crescent shape to it, as though Tetsujin munched on the edge for a snack. Her burgundy eyes narrowed, as she furthered her concentration. She made a handle composed of iron draped in smooth wood.* - Thu Sep 17 19:13:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: Maybe if we give them aerial attack.... Kunai with explosive tags, jutsus on their front, and so on. We can bring them to go support that side, and then we strike the back. - Fri Sep 18 16:13:52 2015

Suzuna would begin to form and shape the blade to the weaponry, curving said blade partially with the aid of tools such as her hammer. It seemed that her efficiency with weapon smithery was improving. She'd thrust into the table in front of her using the tip of the knife, lacerating it two inches deep.* - Fri Sep 18 16:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, if we out number them, and they are spread across the boundary of Kirigakure, it's safe to say wherever we go, we are out numbering them. What if we send a third of our troops out to attack a certain point. That'll draw Zetsumo to that area, at which point they will retreat. Meanwhile, the other two-thirds attack the opposite side. We can inflict the most casualties doing this, and Zetsumo won't risk attacking the village itself and facing the kunai launchers. - Fri Sep 18 17:11:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: But if we send all our attacks in, Zetsumo will eventually show up. We aren't risking as much separating the attacks. - Fri Sep 18 17:12:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The army will be able to retreat before Zetsumo shows up, that much is certain if we place the attack at the furthest point from him. - Fri Sep 18 17:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jin Karuzo(Crimson Cresent) says: I add to that by sending out a false attack on their troops through explosive tags and kunais. To make them think we'll go for there, and send the attack in the opposite way. - Fri Sep 18 17:14:27 2015
