<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) smashes her fists together, the loud clap of bone, muscle, and skin hitting each other was loud enough to be heard from quite aways. "Got it guess, I'll help you then. I'm going to try and swing them as fast as I can!" Chikyu quickly proclaimed to Momura. She then began to slowly stomp forward. She gave Momura a nod, the tan battle girl then reeled a right arm back. Chikyu's torso tilting back, before she shot forward giving her all into the punch. The first attack being a simple straight strike with her arm to start off the reflexive training.* - Sat Dec 12 18:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) kept her eyes trailing, as she watched the girl quickly shift to go behind Chikyu. The voice of the girl giving her position away with Chikyu actually needing to look. Chikyu then leaned forward, her back stretching all the way out flatly. It was then only for Chikyu to suddenly kick out her left leg at Momura. However, this wasn't the end. Chikyu then planted her left foot back to the ground quickly before kicking the dirt. 

Chikyu used her right foot as a pivot point, her left leg being the momentum that spun her body around. The girl flowing to Momura's right side. Her right arm was held out, and she tried to use it like a whip as she spun. The arm attempting to strike Momura while she still in movement trying to dodge or block the left leg. If Momura had simply back away, this at least put Chikyu back into a position to face her opponent.* - Sat Dec 12 18:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) jumped  up in place, as the leg sweep skid across the ground. The dirt and rocks poppoing off the ground underneath. The sound of Chikyu landing was a heavy thud, as she impacted a print of the soles of her boots in the earth. The girl then followed up with three quick punches at Momura. Chikyu then back off, her body beginning ot lean up. The toes of her feet beginning to stretch and lower bouncing Chikyu up and down. Chikyu trying to be light and reactive as possible.

"I'm in a really bad mood actually. But, I think is helping." She says flashing a smile to Momura.* - Sat Dec 12 19:02:59 2015

Her feet dancing left and right, until she finally stopped slidding to Momura's right. Chikyu then shoot out a left punch, before following it up with a right kick.* - Sat Dec 12 19:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) watched her hand get easily catched. Chikyu seeing her opponent was already reving up a returning punch. Chikyu just run right into it, trying to cancel out as much of the force of the blow to her shoulder as she could. The girl wouldn't stop after the hit to her shoulder. Instead, she countinued until she bumped chests against Momura trying to knock her off balance. If she was successful, she would in return grip the arm that Momura caught her fist with, and then pull trying to tug her on to the ground.* - Sat Dec 12 19:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) felt the punches on her back line down on her back. The girl letting out a quick cough as she felt the trembles of the impacts go down her. The girl shook it off, and pressed her hands on to the ground. Chikyu's fingers clenching into the baked dark earth. Her arms tensing, as she gathered strength all the way down her arms. Using those hands, she then lift her legs up and began to strike at Momura with several mixing high and low kicks. 

When Chikyu was finished, the girl would vault off her position on the earth. The tan girl's body going completely verticle, as she shot herself upwards. She then fell forward, before she stopped her feet on the ground. Her fingers prying themselves loose from the soil. She then stood straight up, one hand going to rub at the sore shoulder that Momura has been abusing in her attacks. * - Sat Dec 12 19:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) was suddenly grappled by her legs. Momura then pulling on to Chikyu until she suddenly was lifted up. Her head going to crash forward into the ground. The girl holding her arms up behind her ready to crash the ground to soften her landing. However, she was quickly pulled out of the action. The girl landing on top of her friend's body to cushion the fall. Chikyu let out a quick sigh, a hand coming over to cover the top of her chest.

She then leaned up, and stood on her own two feet. The girl though she didn't have a big smile she usual did kept a small one. She teased "Maybe next time, you don't do that move if this how you're going to end up to make it safe. If you want to practice that I'll make a bunshin or a Kawarimi for you.

She pauses leaning over, as she slightly twitches as sparring gets mentioned. She knew how Mitsunara could get with those. Though, Chikyu happily lets a sigh out to see her necromancer wasn't joining. She then takes a deep breathe, and then blurts out after Mitsunara finishes speaking. 

"Hey, Mitsu! I was wondering if you...you would like to go on a date with me later today or sometime soon." She pauses out of nervousness at first, but she takes another breathe. Her voice getting slightly more confident and firm in tone. She then tries to end with a wide smile trying to hide the worried thought she might be rejected. * - Sun Dec 13 04:27:53 2015

SHe then jumps on to Mitsunara with arms wrapped around her body. Chikyu pressing rubbing up her cheeks against Mitsunara's cheeks. "Oh I'm so happy!"

She pulls back, coughing for a moment to rein down her excitement. "Uh...well I just was thinking a simple date at one of the..more expensive restraunts in town."* - Sun Dec 13 04:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) blushed bright red, as Misunara wrapped her arms around Chiku. Chikyu then in return, wrapped her around Mitsu's waist. "I mean... I... there was a place called the Olives of Suna. It was a fancy place that I passed by a few times. Its pretty expensive..but... I would gladly pay it for us to spend time together."* - Sun Dec 13 04:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: I bet that's how Mirai expects me to treat her. . Hah. - Sun Dec 13 04:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) continues to grap and walk. When, she hears that shes the girl, Chikyu simply squeezes Mitsunara closer to the swordsgirl's side. "Oh yeah... I don't know about that~ But...if its true, why did you make the girl have to ask you out."

She smiles, and gives a happy grin. "I just woke up... but its going great so far." She says looking over to Mitsunara.* - Sun Dec 13 04:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) is once again, befuddled by the menu she sees before her. The whole list honestly made it sound so weird and foreign to her. She just quickly picked something that sounded delicious... well something that sounded delicious and gross. "Spha-ghetti...and Meatballs!" It was clear from her voice that she just wanted to eat the meat. She then order a salad and the usual water.

She then looked over to MItsunara letting out a few giggles herself, and then going into a full laughter herself. Though, she noticably was trying to keep her voice down in this establishment. "Hehehe...well you know... if you won't take initiative. I guess I will cover the slack~" She teases, looking over to MItsunara with a happy smile. * - Sun Dec 13 04:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) just calmly looks over the table, and answers in turn. "Well, I hope it ends well." She says bringing up a hand to rub at her left cheek, her eyes go to look over to Mitsunara face several times. However, she can't stop a giggle from coming up. So, she just simply looks a little bit away, a small happy smirk across her mouth. Her hand on her cheek, now toying with one of pink bangs she had. Her right hand, slowly drags out across the table in front of her.

"So... have you ever been on a date before. Guy or girl? I haven't it... its rather scary to be honest. Like, I'm afraid I'll screw up or... have nothing to say."* - Sun Dec 13 05:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "Oh! Well..you didn't have.. to say that...I mean..Ughh.." She plants a hand on her face feeling that she was making a fool of herself. She then looks up to Mitsunara. "I don't mind that at all." She says, giving MItsunara a nod. "Though, if you like to know I am a virgin." She lets out a small giggle "If it wasn't obvious already." 

She then looks up. "Well, I'm glad I get to be the honor of your first official date Mitsunara. Lets make it a good one." She says leaning back as their drinks arrive with both their salads. Chikyu takes one drink, before letting out a satsfied "Ahhh~" She then lightly slams it on the table top to signify the start of their date. She then begins to lightly pick and eat at her salad with the wrong type of fork, not that she cared for that kind of stuff anyways.* - Sun Dec 13 05:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) let out a smile, as she is given the honor. A little chuckle escaping from the corner of her mouth.

She then hears if she has anything to talk about. If it was any other scenario, Chikyu would've just shout 'NOPE!' but here. Chikyu immeaditly begins to stammer and look  "I ..I uh..the..weather..is uh no..." She then feels a small light bulb pop into her head.

"I .. I'm curious about all you magic and how it works. I... I mean as long as it isn't too prying." She says, stuffing her face full of the lettuce of the salad. Her face full of greens making her look like cattle grazing on grass.* - Sun Dec 13 05:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) shook her head. "I was just curious how it all works. I wouldn't want to take your techiniques. If you remember way back when we first met, I wouldn't want to steal anything of yours from you." She then makes motions with her hands. "I mean, it was just cool-" She then softens her tone going quiet so nobody else could hear. "All those spears appearing from no where, and the summoning swords. Its just so cool."

 She then sits back going back to talking more loudly. "So, your family must be pretty impressive then. If its lineage that gives birth to it."* - Sun Dec 13 05:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) shook her head with a smile. "You don't need to worry about telling me anything. Just say it when you feel like it." She says giving her nod.

However, her smile does fade when she hears the next statement. SHe then reaches a hand across the table.  Chikyu then attempt to  hold Mitsunara's hand. "Thats something you also don't have to speak about until you want to. I'm just glad that you made it through something like that...and now that your here with me." She says shyly at the end.* - Sun Dec 13 05:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) giggled at Mitsunara's laid back attitude. She then nods obliging. "Well... I don't remember much of my mother. She raised me until I was four all by herself. Then, my dad came back from some long trip. He never really told me about it, and well I just remember him raising me." She begins to reach the limits of her smile already, which was stretched across her cheeks teeth flashing often. 

"He first thought I was boy since my hair was short and well, I didn't have the most feminine figure back then. So, he trained me to become strong and tough like him. He take me out to long hikes in mountain, we wake up mornings and train just by swinging swrods, and go hunting together sometimes. Just..a lot of fun stuff. Like this one time, while my dad was turned around while making food. I stuffed a lizard into the pot. So, when he turned around to stir it popped out and well... I've never seen a guy that strong scared. HAhahaha!" She pauses, a little thinking about Mitsunara's family.

She keeps her smile. "He was a really good dad... hes a bit dense at times. He likes to tell me stories about my mom. He says she was the sweetest and loving girl he ever met...though to be honest. It sounded more like she had dad on a leash, and trained him like a dog."* - Sun Dec 13 05:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "Well...I guess I do have to thank my dad and mom for that." She says smiling. She then leans back, as their food is placed in front of them.

"Oh time to dig in!" She says, as she stabs her fork into her meal, she wraps the sphaghetti up and looks at it. It was much better looking she expected. She then took a bite of it.

However, there were a few noodles that slipped out of her mouth. So, she slurped them back up only for one to hit her forehead as it shot up. She quickly gasps in embarssment, and wipes the sauce mark on her forehead off. She hoped Mitsu didn't see that.* - Sun Dec 13 05:41:16 2015
