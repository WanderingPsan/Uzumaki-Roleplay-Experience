***
The user starting with their blade on the ground, either place or after a swing.  Immediately, the sword wielder reels back pulling up the sword swiftly cutting the mid-section of the body.  This can also be used to deflect a strike coming in from the front, or to knock away at the other person's weapon in attempt to disarm them.

The sword is raised above one's head.  The user moving their lead foot out, and then stepping forward.  The movement is done in such a way that the user then swings putting all their weight downwards to strike bringing forth the most power of their weapon.  The weight is then used to attempt to crush the defense of the opponent in front of them.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) Chikyu Kasanari pulled out a cut wooden shaft of wood. It extended to be around four foot long. A the handle nicely shaven and sanded so that it didn't have any spliters or marks. The girl waved it around with one hand several times, the rod swishing through the air as it made its cuts.  She nodded to herself, it felt so weird to having something this light in her hands. It felt pracitcally wegihtless at the moment, compared to her much larger broadsword that she left at home this night. She then brought her other hand, and clasped it directly under the other hand holding on to it.

The girl then raised her arms up the sword going way above her head. She then held her pose for a moment. She began to adjust her hips, her waist slipping back and forth at an angle trying to find the best placement of her weight. She then slid her feet together in the sand. Normally her Mirosen forced her feet to be far a part that way her body could hold the weight of the chunk of steel. Here, she felt more ease to keep her body tight knit. She was less of a target, she could also feel the ease it be to move at any pace.

The girl then began to swing the stick down in front of her. She began to use it like a katana. Her body slowly taking to using something far lighter then the cumbersome steel blade she normally kept on her person. Her torso at first leaned too far forward expecting she need it to lift the wooden copy of a katana. Chikyu then began to understand how she didn't have to commit so much to her swings. She could keep to her own body's balance, and adjust her swing with merely her arms and wrists alone.

Chikyus arms and legs began to lean in and go back like a well oiled machine. Her body began to balance, as she continued to only do vertical slashes. It began to remind her a lot of when she was six. Where, her father truly kicked in his need to give her the lessons in the arts of swords. She had spent so many days just doing this. She could remember all the frustation that came out of it. Though now she knew better, one can't learn an art by merely watching. You had to make it your body and soul.

The girl continued to do her practice swings. Her head began to bob with the motion, popping up and down in synch with the position of her 'blade'. Though, she was simply training. The girl smile couldn't be ignored, she truly had enjoyment for the art. She also began to appreciate all her fights with Mitsunara. It was no wonder she could move her blade so skillfully and deadly. This made her chops more fiercied, biting into the air as they came down. She continued the boiling of her blood for actual combat beginning to show. Her wooden sword substitue began to wobble with each one of her aggressive blows.

The shaft of the wood shook violently, as if it had been hit from the blow a fist. Still, the girl was still too concentrated with her awe of Mitsunara's blade work. Her tighting grasp began to choke what little life the wood had. The middle of the blade splintering as it was bent over and over. Soon, the minor wound ruptured violently the wooden pole now split into two pieces. The girl quickly dropped what she had been using as a hanlde.

She then walked out of the training grounds her grin nearly ear to ear. "I guess, I will try out training with those swords then. Maybe, I'll find it really enjoyable." She thought to herself with eyes closed, she then went off to go buy a tanto.* - Sat Dec  5 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stood still remembering the information from the scroll. She formed the tiger seal, and began to pour her chakra out through her body. She closed her eyes feeling her body concentrate on the task at hand. She first sent her body's energy down to her thighs going past to a more cocentrated area on her lower legs. It reminded her much of her training with Suimen. She took a moment regulating the charka, putting it where she thought it was supposed to be placed.


Chikyu's eyelids completely covered up her eyes, tightly closed to put her full cocentration inwards. Though, if her eyes could be seen the palelight of worry would be gleened off of them. Her face crumpled a sour grin to the side. She remembered the warnings given out by the jutsu scroll itself. It was extremely worrying to have to concern oneself with actually making you sick by doing a jutsu. However, she also knew there was no gain without loss. She couldn't be worried about the consequences if she wanted to learn something new.

Shaking off  that apprehension of even attempting Shunshin, the girl merely dipped her head lower. Brow curling downwards in frustration, as her eyes wrinkled in a tight shut. The girl then shoved her hands to form a shaky seal together.  The girl concentrated and spiked her chakra inside her body. She the buried her feet in the ground waiting to lauch herself. She could feel her chakra boil from the inside, not willing to cool down for a moment. She then activated the seal with a shout "SHUNSHIN NO JUTSU!" She then disappeared in a single huff of smoke.

Out of the smoke, the girl hadn't gone far. She landed a few paces away, she quickly fell to on her knees. The girls forehead burried into the top layer of the sand. She could feel her stomach resting at the back of her throat. She wondered if she could hold it in, as the stomach contents tried to push themselves out. She shook her head wildly, eyes watering before she managed to swallow down her breakfast. The girl laying on the sand chest expanding like a balloon, only to quickly breathe out deflating her chest till her ribs could be seen. 

A trembling arm reached out planting her hand next to her head in the dirt. The swordsman followed the quivering arm with another, and strived to pull herself off the ground. However, her joints were feeble at the moment still suffering from the shunshin, and incapable of holding her weight. The girl merely came to a thud on the ground, as the miniscule height she managed to raise herself caused her arms to collapse. Unable to quit, Chikyu did her best to continue moving her body struggling to finally manage to get her muscles to listen to her more competintly until she was able to gingerly stand on her own two feet.

The girl began to stood up, knees bent inward the only way to keep the structure of her body secure enough to hold herself up at the moment. Her arms held out to the side, as she takes another pumps of her lungs to flood her body with oxygen. She then slowly took control of herself, finally getting to a completely normal stance. She then held her hands together again once more. She then began to tighten the seal, and send chakra through her body. Yes, the first time was rough. However, she was willing to continue to pay the price until she had reached her limit.

The girls chakra once more began to arc through her body. The energy traveling down her chakra network passing into her legs. The girl outstretching her hands, and bending her knees as she supports her self. The flowing tension of the power being constrained in her legs. The energy slowly continued to increase in pressure by the passing moments. The energy began to build up her feet beginning to sink into the ground as it began to reach the entire peak she could handle.

The girl then nodded to herself, as a portion of chakra then traveled through both her arms.  The two moving energy's came together in one giant clash. The spark of energy being a chain reaction for the rest of the chakra in her body.  Smoke plumed out from underneath her feet covering her sudden burst of speed. When, she came out she was several feet away. However, she once again curled into a ball of agony.

The girl's stomach finally let go of her breakfast. The contents spilling out in front of her with explosive gag. She stood their sick through out her entire body. Her head suffering through an intense state of nausea. The girl continued to suffer for minutes that extended into far past the tens place. Her whole body shivering for warmth after the exercise, even though she was under the cooking sun of Sunagakure. * - Sat Dec  5 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) slowly leans up on her own shaking her head. Her voice letting out a few more empty gags from her stomach literally being completely emptied. Her throat sore and sour with the taste of her own acid.

She held out a hand to Mitsunara to signal her to calm down, as the girl slowly got back on her own two feet.

"No...No...its nobody fault by my own. Its this just I'm training, but I think I got the hang of it already." She says two fingers coiling around her throat, rubbing it around trying to ease the pain of the muscles.* - Sat Dec  5 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) unscrewed a water bottle from her satchel. She began to drink it down heavily. The water passing by her lips, and down the sides of her cheeks since she chugged it so messly.  

The girl then almost begins to gag again, as the girl begins to rub her back and stomach. "Oh...please st-..awp!" she says holding a hand over her mouth. Her eyes trying to focus forward, as her brain was still rattled by the shunshin jutsu.* - Sat Dec  5 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: And...alll I need is a few more drinks. The heat going to kill me first. - Sat Dec  5 23:01:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) follows limply along, her feet felt like dead weights at the moment. Chakra being compressed so much into them, that she exceeded her physical limits. She did her best not to be too much of a burden for Mitsunara.

When they got to the house, the girl simply let out a relieved sigh to be clsoe to rest.* - Sat Dec  5 23:09:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) kept her tanto on practically forgetting it was there in the first place. She did though reach up to grabe the handle of her usual giant sword, only to remember shes keeping it at home right now. 

Her body took to the seat, and she quickly slumped against the table. Her body taking a few slow tempo'd breathes. She gave a smile to Mitsunara, and gave her and Mizora a quick "Thank you..." She then leaned up stretching her back, and letting out a sigh. "I just realized we're neighbors, Mizora!"* - Sat Dec  5 23:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) shook her head. "I'm just kidding MItunara, you were feeling just fine." She flashes a smile, and pats her on the back with a little vigor to it. 

She then looked to Mizora as she slipped the bowl between the two, and let out a smile. She smiled bowing her head in a small forward tilt. "Thanks so very much." Chikyu said, already knowing the taste of the delicious recipe made up on the spot.

The aroma quickly went through her nose, and made Chikyu practically bend forward as she could just mentally taste the hearty broth. Her lips already forming a predetermined smile of delight, as she looked at the dark brown stew. Floating with colors, the greens and oranges of the vegetables. She then smiled quickly grabbing a utensil to dig into it. However, she is quickly halted from enjoying it fully as she hears Mizora call them a couple.

She coughs several times to clear her throat. "NO no, we haven't done anything." She agrees with Mitsunara. "Shes staying with me as a friend and roommate. Thats all. We have talked about dating and the such...but I'm not even sure and Mitsunara doesn't want to date someone young as me."* - Sat Dec  5 23:30:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) gets pulled closer to Mitsunara, though she didn't resist at all at this. Chikyu's eyes tilting to the corner of her eyes. Only to pop up, when Mitsunara mentions whats she seen her face gets even more red. 

She looks over to Mizora with a pout. "Nothing, nothing at all. Heck, I make sure I change alone and never have any accidental run ins whiles shes changing or showering."* - Sat Dec  5 23:34:24 2015

<Do..do I really like her.>* - Sun Dec  6 00:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) bites her lower lip, as she feels the arm wrapped around her body. She shivered for a moment, as her kimono brushed against her skin. The girl pauses for a moment, shakingly before taking a a breathe. She hold her hand out, sliding it across Mitsunara's back then to the opposite side of her waist. Her fingers would clench around it, and out of pure embarassment the girl gave a rough tug pulling Mitsunara into her side. 

"You wanted...to go study too. So, it seems important so I don't mind hearing it." She says her head tilted to the floor to her right, away from Mitsunara.* - Sun Dec  6 00:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would've chuckled at any time shearing the pur, but here it jsut put a closed lip smile across her face. She turned to Mitsunara and looked her in the eyes with Chikyu's almost burning maroon eyes. She continued hold her smile. 

"That sounds good, I agree with you. I don't want to do anything like...that... out the gate. I really like to get to know you, and ... well just hang out. Til, we both feel comfortable." She said a notable tone of her voice dropping to be more serious. Another hand reaches out, and goes over Mitsunara's neck. It then slowly pulls the purple hair'd girl head into Chikyu's neck andshoulder.

Chikyu's skin was soft and a notably high warmth from it being bare to the sun all day. "I wouldn't mind cuddling like this...it feel really good."* - Sun Dec  6 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) hadn't ever felt touching a person like this, as she felt her skin rub the hardened body of MItsunara's. Chikyu could feel the bumps and crevices made from marks in her skin, all those battles and history permantly written there in wounds. However, she could aslo feel the burning sensation of life still resting in there, that no wound could make cold.

Chikyu then lean back for a moment. She dropped her hands to touch Mitsunara's which probably just as rough as the rest of her body. Chikyu's smoother more gentle hands, slowly rubbed up Mitsunara's arms just a bit forward into the sleeves of her Kimono. Chikyu then gave Mitsunara a tight hug, pressing her cheek on the top of the samurai's collar bone. She slowly nuzzled against it. She didn't mind the coarse nature of it, and only gave an apporving smile. "Yeah... I really like to stick close to you."

She then pulls her back, and goes to kneeling. She flashes a smile to Mitsunara. "I mean... I like to use you as a teddy bear. But, I'm also old enough to put myself to bed. Just because, you like to think me still a child. Doesn't mean, I am one though. Hehe." she flashes a teasing smirk to Mitsu.* - Sun Dec  6 00:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Don't work over work yourself... Well if you do, I'll carry you back and cuddle you to full energy. Just like you did to me. - Sun Dec  6 00:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) slid out the tanto out of its sheathe, and held it out in front of her. The blade shimmered in the light of the slowly flaling moon. The air cool just perfect for a good training. The girl's arms extended holding the sword fully out, and her feet slid to their positions in the bluish midnight sand that looked dull as if the fading light of sun has made them lose their usual golden glow. Her legs slowly bend to get the perfect balance, she looked like she had already mastered how to hold the blade which is no surprise considering her usual size of blade she had to hold.

Even as people began to filter into the training grounds, the girl's focus didn't falter. Her mind was only focused on the edge of her blade and the posistioning of her own body, she was in her own world now. She then raised the tanto over head, and began to chop downwards. There was no angle, there was no change in speeds or directions. She just simply shifteed her feet and body back and forth following the constant vertical strikes. The grueling repetition unable to break her unwavering self oath to master this blade.* - Sun Dec  6 10:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It was a wild night. - Sun Dec  6 10:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Chikyu you've got to show me that technique some time. - Sun Dec  6 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What technique? - Sun Dec  6 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) paused looked over to Mirai and Sanoke.  She first chronologically answered to Sanoke. She smiled nodding her head a little "I want to work on it my self, but if I catch on any snags. I'll come tell you." She then stopped to look over to Mirai, a tilt on her head in confusion. "What techinique?"* - Sun Dec  6 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: The one you used on Mitsunara. - Sun Dec  6 10:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Still confused. - Sun Dec  6 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Uh. - Sun Dec  6 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Can you elaborate? - Sun Dec  6 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: When you changed the trajectory of her attack. - Sun Dec  6 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) began to continue after quickly answering those previous questions. Her arms curling up and bring the sword high over her head. Her fingers almost began to work around the handle of the tanto. They shift,slided, gripped, and released several times to find the perfect hold in her opinion. She then brought it down in front of her. Still, she only continued to slice the air. The movement of her foot in the sand only began to be dug deeper and deeper, as her continuious movement eroded the ground she stood on. 

The girl then paused again, being interupted with another question from Mirai. Not that she minded, she then held her sword out in front of her.  Grasped the back end of the blade, and then twisted it around in almost one-hundred and eighty degrees. "Thats what you mean right! I got that off of this trick." She said, holding out a arm. She then spun it what appeared to be a counter-clockwise circle. However to a fighter, the aim was clear to be a attempt to blow off an attack.* - Sun Dec  6 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What. . ? -- Oh. - Sun Dec  6 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. That thing. - Sun Dec  6 11:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: It's a pretty cool manuever for sure. - Sun Dec  6 11:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Sure, I can teach you it once I'm done with this. - Sun Dec  6 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mmm'kay. - Sun Dec  6 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sanoke give me a mission. - Sun Dec  6 11:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: A mission? Hrm. . . Let me see what I got. - Sun Dec  6 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Yes. - Sun Dec  6 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I want to do several missions. - Sun Dec  6 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Same here! - Sun Dec  6 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh, yeah. Chikyu can get in on it too. - Sun Dec  6 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Well only, if Mirai wants me too! I don't mind having several on my own though! - Sun Dec  6 11:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I can give a simple mission to help strengthen the lower ranked shinobi. Head to the academy's ground and give a less on taijutsu and kenjutsu. Essentially, I want you and Chikyu to give a mock battle. A-K-A, spar. - Sun Dec  6 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Simple, yes? - Sun Dec  6 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sounds simple enough. - Sun Dec  6 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Once that's done, I have another task to be completed. - Sun Dec  6 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: This one being a little more serious. - Sun Dec  6 11:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) swung the blade downward with another flick of her arms, cutting straight in half  the air. The sliced cut of the air quickly filled in a again, by the flooding air all around it. The girl's hands began to get more accustom to the handle. The fingers slipping in the appropriate grasping points. Her pinky wrapped around the handl to give it support and power. The blade began to also react better to her swings. The edge of her sword flowing down the gentle curving circular angle. 

She continued to keep this pace up of her slashes. Her head began to bob to the rhythm once more of her cuts. She didn't seemed to have a second thought about her cuts anymore. She began to slice more throughly, her blade wavering less as she stopped completely relying on strength and more of form. With her big sword, it was all about compensating for the off balance of a blade so heavy . Here, the true strength of the blade came out when one put effort to support the balance the blade already had. Matching ones body positioning and strength that way, one could have strength and speed all in one.

She the flicked the blade to the side. Her hard work showing off with the sweat beginning to pour down her forehead. Her other pores working their magic as well to cool off the teen. She then raises her sword, and pushes it down into her  sheath. Theres a small 'click' as the hilt hits the edge of the sheathe. She then smiles looking at Mirai and Sanoke. Ready to leave for her mission at any time.* - Sun Dec  6 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm going to gather up the paper work for the next mission.  - Sun Dec  6 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Come to the mansion once you've done the lesson. - Sun Dec  6 11:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would've been rather silent through the whole thing. She looked at the walls of the academy with despair and gloom. Her head was tilted downwards for most of their walk through the hallways, and the glance of the familiar faced employee led Chikyu to duck her head less she be recognized besides her attire that hasn't changed since she was eight. The girl then would walk to the class, where she take a starting breathe. Something to revitalize herself. A breathe of fresh air to start off right.

She the put on a smile to her face, as she looked over to Mirai with a nod. Though, Mirai probably wasn't as nervous as Chikyu. Chikyu wanted to share a confident 'this will go well' nod to her. She then entered the class, the loose smile slightly tensing in the corners to keep it up as they walked through the kids. Chikyu was glad it wasn't one of her teachers running the event, as the teacher then pointed to the two with opens arms and adressing the session to her class "These two are here for you today, to show you how a fight really goes between two shinobi. So please greet these two shinobi, and give them all your attention."

The kids then boomed with a "Hi there!"  while some were busy looking off or sleeping most seemed to really want to respond, excited even. Chikyu notably let out a single drop from apprehension but was able to respond back with a raised hand waving to them. "Good morning, everyone! N-nice to meet you, I'm Chikyu and this is..." She paused holding a hand over to Mirai lettinng her introduce herself.* - Sun Dec  6 11:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looked over to Mirai with somewhat raised eyes, surprised to hear why her friend focused in Taijutsu. The kids seemed to responding and paying attention. Chikyu was rather amazed how professional Mirai was overall. She didn't think she could do this anymore then just a mission.

 However, Chikyu quickly looked forward her eyes popping when the guest rang out what Taijutsu was. The kids answered out loudly almost all at once, saying a line that seemingly repeated several dozen times before. "Taijutsu, the shinobi art of close range hand-to-hand combat using several techinique focused on using the body's natural weapons." The voices were all releatively monotoned, and if Mirai looked over to Chikyu, she see that even Chikyu was lipping the words as well almost in a daze.

The swordswoman shook her head, and almost woke up from her trance. She realized it was her turn. She then held up her tanto. "I use... Kenjutsu. Kenjutsu is all about sword techiniques. I've been working with swords all my life so I never really thought about anything else.  Though again, this isn't the sword I normally us-" The girl was then interuptted by a raised a hand. Chikyu blinked for a moment "Yes?" The kid then asked loudly "What kind of sword do you use then?"

Chikyu then held out her hands "A really big swords. This is how wide it is." She then paused and held up a hand that stayed at the level of the two presenting kunochi's head. "And its about that tall!" The kid immeditatly responded "Thats impossible! Who could lift something that big!" Chikyu tried to respond but murmurs and whispers began to go about. She was being rather overwhelmed already.* - Sun Dec  6 12:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looked over to Mirai letting out a relived sigh, as she backed Chikyu up on the truth of her usual sword. Some kids began to let out a little bit of awe at the fact someone could wield something like that. Chikyu then stayed silent for Mirai's entire in depth explanation of the details in taijutsu. Only simply nodding, she agreed with everything she had to say about it.

When she was finished most of the kids looked up. Just staying silent themselves. Some looked over whispering they could come up with some cool techiniques on their own. Others mentioning, the last line was bogus and that they would have all the best flashiest taijutsus. The smartest kids in class basically nodded their heads and wrote down notes on this.

Chikyu then stepped forward with her own details on kenjutsu. "When you're using swords. Techiniques may seem limited, and they aren't always the flashiest moves around. However, they're effected even a single swing itself when done correctly is a techinique all its own just because of how effective it is. Not only that, but since you are also close combat. You might wish to look into taijutsu as well that way you can attack along with your sword, or defend when your sword is useless or not on hand."

She then leaned over no matter how the students responded to her talk of swords. She whispered to Mirai "Do...do you think we should do the mock battle now?"* - Sun Dec  6 12:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) leaned back rather surpised and well... overall just blown out he rmind by Mirai's sudden shift. Chikyu wasn't against giving things out like examples, but this...was a bit to flambouyant for someone down to earth like Chikyu. She let out a sigh, glad when it was over following the rest of them otuside to the arena.

She took a comfortable step on the sand, as she reached behind her grabbing her tanto. She slid it out in one smooth motion. She then held it out against Mirai. She had little experience with the sword so far, but she felt comfortable using it for demonstration purposes. Its just best nobody actually tries to immitate her actual movements though. She got into place balancing her self with sword held with both hands at Mirai. 

She then flashed a smile, able to finally concentrate on something other then teaching. She could get into a mock battle pretty easily. Her mind set in a enviroment far more comfortable. "I'm ready at any time!"* - Sun Dec  6 12:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looked rather surpised as Mirai began with that move. The girl quickly flipped the handle on her sword, so she had the dull side facing when they reall began.  She quickly ducked to the side from the attack, feeling much lighter and manueverable with the tanto then her normal massive blade. She then waited for Mirai to land and recover, since it was a mock battle. Chikyu would then run up, taking several shaky swipes to Mirai. Standing back a little, and just showing off the range and speed on gets out of using a sword.* - Sun Dec  6 13:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) began to smile, as she finally had a lay back fight with someone. Neither of themselves pushing too hard, it was just to demonstrate their current abilities. The clashing of iron was heard, as the large blade and the smaller kunai clashed several times. The kick was a nice change of pace hitting Chikyu in the stomach, which she mentally noted would be far worse if Mirai wasn't taking this all too seriously. She smile back and return with her own assaulty, quickly returning to clashing with Mirai's kunai.

However, she would stop during one of her strikes. She turn around planting the tanto on the ground. She then throw one swift kick at Mirai, almost like it was a serious hit. Only to pull it back, she then shoot another leg returning the strike to her stomach to one towards Mirai. Of course, she was holding back as well. Just, her merely returning the favor.* - Sun Dec  6 13:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) chuckeld at Mirai's over acting. Coming over, she held out a hand to lift Mirai back up on her feet. Not only should fighting be shown off, but good sportsmanship. She then turned around to bow to the kids that they were just showing off for. She then leaned up, and stretched glad that this was all over. * - Sun Dec  6 13:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) came in.* - Sun Dec  6 14:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hey Lera. - Sun Dec  6 14:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hey...Hm. Kidnappings? - Sun Dec  6 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stood still listening to what Sanoke had say, waving a greating to Lera as she came in. The girl simply nodded understandingly and grew nervous with Sanoke as he did. 

She then apused hearing how many were kidnapped, and the fact that they were all extremely wealthing was quite protrubbing. She wondered why this hasn't been stopped before. When he finished Chikyu bluttered out "Fourtyeight? How did so many disappear just like that!"* - Sun Dec  6 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: One other thing. - Sun Dec  6 14:18:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Thanks. - Sun Dec  6 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: Hey Lera, is it true that Mitsunara talked to you the other day? - Sun Dec  6 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Talked to me about? - Sun Dec  6 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: Maybe I was wrong then, she said she talked to you and felt better about something. So, I wanted to give you my thanks for that. But.. maybe I was wrong. Hmm...*face scrunched up in thought and frustartion thinking how she could make such a mistake* - Sun Dec  6 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Oh? I just gave her a bit of advice. She's a good friend. - Sun Dec  6 14:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: *broke out of it* Oh, well shes a good friend of mine. So, I still wanted to give you thanks for that! - Sun Dec  6 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Wonder what she would think when Mitsunara comes onto her... - Sun Dec  6 14:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: I wonder what she would think if she knew her advice made Mitsunara come on to me... - Sun Dec  6 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: ....... - Sun Dec  6 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Mhm, Treat her good. She's a nice girl, plenty attractive too. If you get my meaning. - Sun Dec  6 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: *quickly blushed* He-hey!... *she paused* Yeah, she is really attractive. - Sun Dec  6 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: I'll be back going to go get my real sword! *rushes off* - Sun Dec  6 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: You two will make a good couple. - Sun Dec  6 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Maybe we can do a double date sometime~ - Sun Dec  6 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: St-stop! don't say that! We're just cuddling for now! - Sun Dec  6 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Uh huh, Can't fool me~ - Sun Dec  6 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Cuddling...? - Sun Dec  6 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: You and Mizora! I promise all we did was hug...tightly..~ - Sun Dec  6 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Heh. I'm sure it'll progress quickly...maybe I should give her more...'advice' hehehe. - Sun Dec  6 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) thinks: Why does....This conversation...Sound so lewd? - Sun Dec  6 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Because we're hormonal teenage girls. - Sun Dec  6 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: God, I'm so hormonal right now! - Sun Dec  6 14:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Alrighty, time to go. - Sun Dec  6 14:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) turned around seeing Mirai was ready to leave. The girl simply nodded, and tagged along with the other two. Though, still rathered about the details of this mission.* - Sun Dec  6 14:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stood behind Lera and Mirai pracitaclly reaching on her tippy toes to see over the gate. Her hands waving up and down to keep her on balance to continue looking. A expression of astonishment was easily shown on the girl's face. She had only lived in the hicks of Sunagakure, she never thought of coming near this place. This was pretty interesting for her as the first time she was ever in Sunagakure's ritzy establishments. She had no clue about any dark past, simply just being marveled by its current state of affairs.* - Sun Dec  6 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Why does it look like they have more money than Sunagakure? - Sun Dec  6 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Similar to my neighbourhood...I better keep an eye on Kiyoko.. - Sun Dec  6 14:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) walked inside through the gates. Happy now to see the clean flawless streets of the richer north district. She smiled looking at this place, before frowning. "Guess even this kind of place has its troubles." She says, before looking over to Lera who already announced her plans.

"Well...you think the cops and guards of this place have already done that. I mean its... like we would need to catch them in the act of kidnapping a person. But, its no like theres anyways we be able to catch them in the act. Unless, Heheh they tried to kidnap one of us! Hahha... I can't see that in a million years."* - Sun Dec  6 15:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: What plan? - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: One of us could try to get kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Draw them out. - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 15:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We're rather well equipped, most would think twice in touching one of us - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: I...didn't actually think that was a plan. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So, one of us should use henge. If we're going with that plan. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Mhm. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: How is that a plan? - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Once you find out about the individuals who were kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: If we do that though - Sun Dec  6 15:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: One of us could dress the part. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We should get a good idea of who's been kidnapped. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Find a pattenr. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Of course. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Then we can make ourselves appear suitable. - Sun Dec  6 15:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Wait...well I mean why would they kidnap us anyway. Seems like they're going after rich wealthy targets anyways, like people of the Hotomi clans from what Sanoke said. We would have to be one of them to get any attention. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Uh...I am rich and wealthy you know.. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We said we were going to dress the part Chikyu. - Sun Dec  6 15:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That's why we are getting information on the victims. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Oh yeah you are rich! - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: And, I guess. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I live in a neighbourhood exactly like this, only with less defenses. - Sun Dec  6 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Did you ask any of the Hotomi guys? - Sun Dec  6 15:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: We should go to them together. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We can visit there next. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: That information can be used later. - Sun Dec  6 15:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'm going to send a clone back, see if I can get some information on those names. - Sun Dec  6 15:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I can see if my clan has connections as well...bound to be a few. - Sun Dec  6 15:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) followed along with Mirai not really disagreeing with the course of action. Her boots stomping on the pavement and the grass till they reached the residence of one of the Hitomi's. Her head still begin twisted left and right at how, grander everything was here.* - Sun Dec  6 15:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: So it was the father... - Sun Dec  6 15:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) seemed rather embarassed walking into the halls of the family's estate. Her eyes scrawled up and down the lines of their walls noting how much they had to spend in money. She rather felt like a street rat, and was dirtying up the place just by her mere presence. Their extreme tast in decoration and archetecture truly intimidated the girl, and did show off their level of living. When they met the family, Chikyu quickly took to look at them all but only from the safety of hiding partially behind Mirai's back.


The girl frowned hearing the girl let out a call for her dad. Her lower lip being bit upon, as she really wanted to help solve this case. Though, she was not someone suitable to be called a detective.* - Sun Dec  6 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Lily..hm - Sun Dec  6 16:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) whispers: Please let me deal with the child.. - Sun Dec  6 16:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stepped forward wanting to say something to the child. However, it seemed Lera had this handled. She then turned over to see how Mirai's questioning went. She wasn't really sure what the right questions were, and since nobody else seemed to know who else was kidnapped. It was quite the bother for her. Trying to wrap this mystery around in her head; however, she came to nothing but road blocks in her mental thoughts.* - Sun Dec  6 16:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Oddly suspicious... - Sun Dec  6 16:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looked over to her two compatreates as the woman had her sudden freak out. Even Chikyu was able to pick up the distress, she wonedered what in the world caused that response. Maybe, the family had accussed her of such before or possibly did the authorities do such. But, the question really didn't seem to have anything unusual in it to cause that outburst. "Hmm..." lowly vibrated out of her lips, as the girl tucked a hand under her chin in thought.* - Sun Dec  6 16:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 16:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: What time did you hear the noise? - Sun Dec  6 16:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: (Sanoke can you hear me?) - Sun Dec  6 16:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: Is it the fact the mother heard the noise, while the kid was playing music?) - Sun Dec  6 16:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Thank god she understood that... - Sun Dec  6 17:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Oh my god! - Sun Dec  6 17:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) jumps as well, hearing the scream come from the girl. "WHATS GOING ON!"* - Sun Dec  6 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I forgot that a sale is going on. - Sun Dec  6 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ...... - Sun Dec  6 17:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Seriously...? - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Can't it wait? - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: No. - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: .... - Sun Dec  6 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: There will be another sale. We've got a job to do... - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And I have a plan. - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Anyways let's all discuss this at the other relatives house. - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Then you all are free to go. - Sun Dec  6 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So which one of you wants to henge into the little girl. - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll do it - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: It'll be a shadow clone - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So, none of us are actually in danger. - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: That way, we can let them take my clone back to wherever they're keeping these people - Sun Dec  6 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I mean I saw something with my Byakugan. - Sun Dec  6 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: But wait, they said the guy attacked their father. You sure they won't accidently hurt the clone and disperse it? - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Wouldn't your clone just like poof. - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: My clone can at least take a couple of hits before its destroyed - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: But it can travel long distances. - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: And what did you see? - Sun Dec  6 17:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Some strange thing. - Sun Dec  6 17:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's very creepy. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I see.. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Anywho since they will be staying here. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: We will return as the family. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Your clone will go to the kitchen as if trying to get a cookie. - Sun Dec  6 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Right...are we using the clone or not? Either way, I would like to b- Right. - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sound good? - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: I'll know immediately if something happens to my clone. As well as where it was. - Sun Dec  6 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) followed Mirai's plan.* - Sun Dec  6 17:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Shit.. - Sun Dec  6 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Stay alert... - Sun Dec  6 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would hear the signal to come down over to the kitchen, where the Lily clone was supposed to be. Her form quickly shifting out of its henge, and to her normal self. She quickly pull out her sword reaching just a few steps behind Mirai. Chikyu would close her eyes, as Mirai called out the invisible man. She wondered if she coudl see it herself, as she took a moment to concentrate using her chakra sensing abilites to find it. If she couldn't, Chikyu would simply then use Mirai's directions as her follow up attacks and pontentiall any enviroment interactions that might give away his positioning.* - Sun Dec  6 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) grabbed the back of her sword. It was hard to sense them, only tiny blips on her radar announced that they were there. She could also feel them all begin to verge on Mirai's direction.


She grunted, as she reached behind her and grabbed the huge sword's handle. She pull it off and hold it out in front of her. She was glad she had left the tanto at home, because she needed the length. She then aimed to cut off the direction where most of the blurbs of chakra were coming from. She then pull her blade back, and then swing with an intense verocity three times back and forth.  She hoped its length and width would be good enough to score a hit on one of them, the other hope is that it gave Mirai enough time to see and denote the rest along with the real guy behind this.* - Sun Dec  6 18:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would hold out her sword the moment he appeared to be visible with her naked eye. She quickly run forward, as he began to charge this attack. The sword held out like a lance, and as the purple attack began to expand. She was already too deep to avoid it. If her attack couldn't penetrate it.* - Sun Dec  6 18:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Dammit! - Sun Dec  6 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would fall back shaking, as her body was taken in with the burns of the demonic snake attack. The girl laying on the floor feeling like the air had been knocked out her, and the stinging of her muscles after going through such an ordeal.* - Sun Dec  6 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: I'll need to find Chikyu and Mirai... - Sun Dec  6 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "Invisible clones....broke in took out the clone of Lily... Mirai could see them with her eyes...then one became visible,.." She said before she began to lay on the shoudler of Lera too exhausted to continue her explanation. Hopefully, Mirai would still be awake enough to tell what he looked like.* - Sun Dec  6 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It was just a mess. - Sun Dec  6 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I've come to find out that it's not a ghost. - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: It's simply someone using Ninjutsu. - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: A strange one. - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Yes I know... - Sun Dec  6 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Maintain a mountain. .  - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What? - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Who even maintains a mountain? - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hey Paine! - Sun Dec  6 19:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: The little girl, Lily. - Sun Dec  6 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: She was able to see the man, despite his invisibility. - Sun Dec  6 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Huh. . ? - Sun Dec  6 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: sounds nifty. - Sun Dec  6 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Maybe I should have gone there myself. - Sun Dec  6 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Maybe you would have been able to see him.. - Sun Dec  6 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Maybe she has incredible sensing ability? - Sun Dec  6 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Not sure what it is. - Sun Dec  6 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Possible. I had my own method of finding his presence, similar to sensing. - Sun Dec  6 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: In anycase. - Sun Dec  6 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: So it could be that - Sun Dec  6 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: All of the information will be considered. - Sun Dec  6 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Do you want me to have Kiyoko check this blood? - Sun Dec  6 19:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Mirai. Can you write up an official report for the force? - Sun Dec  6 19:46:59 2015
