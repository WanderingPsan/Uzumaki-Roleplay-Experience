She then began to do the all to familiar chops that she has been doing for the past two days. Her body falling into the formulic training with notable results. Her handle of the sword quickly swicing the air in a flash, as the blade was sent down in a blurred silver line.

Her head cocking to the side, as stretched out a hand fingers tightly gripping on his head where there was no escape. She then began to say something. "Of course! Always happy to help!" She shouted flashing the kid a smile! "Whatcha need?"* - Mon Dec  7 00:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) raised a hand, and then quickly chopped his head with her hand. It be painful, but nothing to cry or whine about if he was big boy. She then came over grabbing his arms. She quickly level them out at them, curling his arm to where they held the bokken just out from his torso. Her feet then kicked out his legs sending them farther a part, then two grabbed his waist rotated it til, he was pefectly balance with the sword in his grip.

"Dummy! Even though I haven't worked with it long, a blade like this must be handle with balance. You get your strength from speed and you must properly put force through careful strokes of your body. One only hampers themselves, if they try to just use their sword like a stick." She said getting into her own stance.

The girl mimicking what she did with the boy with her own body. Feet slowly shifting outwards apart from each other. Her torso kept mostly straight, as her waist was kept in the center. Her arms were shoved out, as she then slowly pulled the sword back. She held it over her head, and sent a silent swing downwards in front of her. The blade stopping when her hands just the level at the bottom of abdomen. "Any farther, and you lose yourself and make yourself vulnerable."

She then turned to him. "The second but still important thing!" She then held held her blade up, she then swung it down with a "WWRRHHHAAAA!"  shouting it even louder then the boy. "Thats a proper battle cry!"* - Mon Dec  7 00:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) pointed to his feet focused on the true kenjutsu aspect first. She then show him, on ones feet were to move. She then began to do another chop. Her front foot sliding forward with the attack before it slowly pulled back to its original position. She then did it several times before switching stances. "It doesn't matter what attack you take. You can't let yourself lose its power." She said now bringing the blade over her right shoulder. She then diagonally cut downwards to the left. The attack was shaky but nothing someone who wasn't proficent with the katana already could spot. She then did several times, with each time causing her to push out her torso and her foot. However, she always came back to rebalance and structure her body.

She then looked over to the kid once more. She then held her blade and did a signle chop again. "ARRRGGHHH! Is the only cool one. You're little 'Hyaa!' sounds more like a scared little girl." She proclaimed doing several chops with a loud "RHHAAA!" echoing behind them.* - Mon Dec  7 00:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looks over to his diagonal slashes, and shakes a head. "Keep working on one slash, just keep going up and down. When, you master the one. The rest are soon to follow. I'm still no good at diagonal's either, but I made sure to keep doing vertical's til I felt satsfied." She said, as she took one breath. She then brought the sword back over her right shoulder. She then brings her hands down slowly this time, going frame by frame of one of her cuts. She then stops half way, and points to her left arm. "See, if you look at it. Its curling too much, its slacking off. My cut like that is going to be shaky." She says, as the other arm is notable bent awkwardly into the handle. She wiggles her arms, and notes how much her left continues to move. She then pulls back, and readjusts the strike once more. Going downwards, and doing a mostly proper diagonal slash.

"Practice is what makes perfect, trying to master everything at once is just a sloppy mess. So, work on your vertical, then go to your diagonal, and then your horozontal. Then, you will have most of it done already." She said, as then held up her sword then began choppng. "You'll also stop going Whyaa! Whaaa! Whaaa! Like a big baby!

Then, she slide back to her position. She didn't say much aftewards, she just continued with her own training. The girl's head bobbing going down with each of her slashes, and then raising up aftwards. It seemed to be one of the habits she formed when doing this kind of training meticulously for years. The girl's body slowly to find that right balance of rigidness and at the same time relaxation to her strikes. Another form of balance,  it was something one had to truly obtain when becoming a swordsman. There is no difference between a body and a sword, because both weights come together to form one's balance.* - Mon Dec  7 01:07:50 2015

Chikyu herself had even changed as well. She had a light pink hair now, instead of the usual white. At the back of her hair, a small red piece of twine held a pony tail that was slowly growing at the moment only being a few inches long <unlike the icon itself.> She also had a rose neatly tucked behind her ear in her hair.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) suddenly grabs Tsukinomi, and pulls out his eyes. Her hands are sprayed iwth blood as she does so. She then holds up the two white orbs. "Finally! I have what I need." She then shoves them into her own eyes. A almost harmonic hymn comes out, as the eyes almost begin to merge together. "Mwhahahahaha! Finally, you fools all took the bait!" She then opens her eyes, pupils now white surrounded by blue irsis. Her body begins to glow as visible chakra spurts out from her.

Soon, she is covered in a green charka cloak. One by one, giant black balls of pure chakra of all elements and balances pop on to her back. The charka flames around her, but still keeps consistant to her robes. "I can finally wipe, you all off the face of the earth!" Her truth seeking balls, began to float out shooting down numerous black spikes on to the group.* - Mon Dec  7 02:52:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing)  comes out feeling slight dry in the eyes at the moment. She then looks at the two. She then groans looking over to the two, instantl noting from Kinami's style whats happened to her. "Oh god not again! Hasn't Sanoke made it illegal for you to drink! Gah, I'm going to go get Paine, you big idiot." She then turned to Mitsunara "Don't get hurt Mitsu! I know you don't want help, but this isn't safe for you or her!"* - Mon Dec  7 06:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) quickly came back unable to find anyone. She looked at the two visously still fighting with one another. She paused looking to the two wondering what to do. She didn't want to join in the fight, but on the other hand she didn't want it to continue at all. The girl paused for a moment wondering what could stop Kinami. She, then tried another tactic of distracting her since Chikyu knew she wouldn't be too hurt and enranged by Mitsunara's attack. 

"KIN-" She began to shout, but quickly stopped as she saw the girl fall down. She then quickly ran over to Mitsunara, two hands wrapping around her back and chest giving her a hug. One to embrace her with the happy fact she was safe, and to keep her back if she wished to continue to fight Kinami.* - Mon Dec  7 06:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) squeezes Mitsu. "Glad you're okay."* - Mon Dec  7 06:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) smiles, pressing her head before peeling off. 

"Lets go get Kinami a better place to rest then on the ground. Maybe she can stay on our couch."* - Mon Dec  7 06:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) gives a warm smile to Mitsunara. She then leans over patting Kinami on the head, unable to give her a hug herself. "We'll take good care of you."* - Mon Dec  7 06:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: I can have that 3-way I always dreamed of - Mon Dec  7 06:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) still wearing her maid outfit, rand over to Kinami. She then gave the purple-hair'd girl another hug. Her small but muscular arms pulling the samurai closer to her. A cheek quickly cuddling up to her shoulder. A soft curling smile was raised by both corners of her lips. She felt Mitsunara's increadibly warm but rough skin, accepting all of what she felt with her touch. 

"Hehe... I hope I'm not getting too clingy."* - Mon Dec  7 06:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) fingers ran along Mitsunara's back interlocking behind her, while she continued the embrace. The layers of the frilly dress Chikyu wore began to get pressed in layers, as she continued to hold tightly. The girl looked up the Necromancer, and simply nodded to what she had to say. "You might regret those words soon enough. I heard some let out a sleepy yawn, you exhausted?"* - Mon Dec  7 07:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) returned with a devious smile, as she pulled Mitsunara down on to one of the cushions. A hand came up to rub a hand through her hair, as she nodded. "Then you won't mind, taking a seat to rest up~" She says with her normal happy tone; however, the ending note was a notable chirp. She begins to slowly rub her hands down Mitsunara's sides and arms. Hands squeezing when they feel the bumps of her muscles through the kimono. "Doesn't sound bad right?" She returns a smile to her "Get something you earned." She teases to the necomancer of their previous talk about earning.* - Mon Dec  7 07:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) jumps slightly, as she feels the feeling of the lower hand on lower body. She, lightly pats Mitusnara on the side as she does such. A look flashing over to the dozing Kinami on the bed. Chikyu looks at the girl in her arms, before leaning and whispering.

"Well, as a teddy bear I'll definatly keep you comfortable and give you good dreams." She says placing a hand on top of the Necromancer's head rubbing it gently, and letting Mitsuna slump as much as she wants into her lap. * - Mon Dec  7 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: You're the one who said waiting til I'm older... besides not in front of Kinami. - Mon Dec  7 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Hrm? I'm just cuddling, you know.~ - Mon Dec  7 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: What a naughty teddy bear I'm hugging. You can't cup that spot, until you're sure you want all of it. - Mon Dec  7 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Mrnah... z.. z.. z.. - Mon Dec  7 07:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) smiles, and just happly continues to rub Mitsunara on the head and back. Chikyu wished the slowly drifting girl wasn't on the floor while she slept. She just kind of wanted to lug her to the bed, but she wouldn't do that to her. She just kept still being the best pillow, a Chikyu's lap could be. When it seemed Mitsunara had finally really passed out. She looked over to Kinami, and then back to Mitsunara. She waited a bit longer, biting herself in the lip for doing this.

She then leaned over and gave Mitsunara peck on the back of the head. She then quickly covered her mouth with her own hand. <She surely won't mind.> Chikyu then began to slip out, and drop Mitsunara's head on to the cushion's below.* - Mon Dec  7 07:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stood out in the open sands of the training grounds. Her feet spread apart the all too familiar tanto still stuck in between the holds of her fingers. Right now, she was pausing taking the time to adjust the position of her hands. The pressures of her fingers, as they wrapped around the finely woven handle. She gave a smile feeling she had a good grasp, she then began to give fifty frontal chops of her blade. She didn't mind the number or the fact that she probably had reach near perfect levels with the maneuver. She just did it because she wanted it to be perfect.

She then cracked her neck side to side. The sound of her bones rubbing and snapping with the pressure was loud enough to echo. She then let out a smile, as she brought the sword over her right shoulder. Once again, she began to do the moves she just did yesterday. Doing sets of ten, and inbetween those tens. She would stop, slowly go over her self. The way she held the sword, and how her arms were placed. Her body slowly growing more limber and controlled, able to really adjust herself to the weight of the blade.

The smile on her face stayed as if carved in to stone. The swordswoman finally changing pace, only to switch to the blade over her left shoulder this time. The girl took a breathe, and began with slow chops. Here she was notably the most crude with techiniques. Her left side never being the best at physical arts. Still, she only took in quick huffs the frustration of it building up. Only for her to release that anger and self hatred in a bundle, the pressed swirl of emotions coming out with growing number of strikes from her blade. 

The girl continuied to swat at the air. It was here she began to wish that Suna had some more proper equipment to take on training. Still, she could make due with soley her own body. She just took time to concentrate, gather a mental image all for herself. Chikyu saw the shadow of an opponent. She then mentally thought out what a slash of her swould do. Several times she halted, it was there she felt like she failed the cut. Which she answer with a pulled back and readjusted strike afterwards. Her eyes closed at the moment all her mental focus built on making her resulsts accurate as possible. 

Her body began to slow and drag itself. The heat of the rising morning beginning to sting her overworked flesh. Even the cooling sweat, was boiled off off of her before it help lower her tempature down. She began to notice her own swings were getting sloppy, as she already began to misjudge the length of her blade. She knew how to do it, but the length difference between her normal huge sword and this shorter smaller one was still lost in usual habbit. When she got tired, her lack of experience with the tanto really showed.* - Mon Dec  7 10:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hi hi, Kyu~. You're doing more sword stuff hm? - Mon Dec  7 10:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: So what happen to the super big sword anyways? - Mon Dec  7 10:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: At home, in wait for me to pull it out again. - Mon Dec  7 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Coo. Thought itmightof broke or something. - Mon Dec  7 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Thats why I'm trianing with the katana... I don't want my in experience to damage my sword ever again. - Mon Dec  7 10:52:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: What does that mean anyways? You try to cut a super stong jutsu or something? - Mon Dec  7 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: No, I want to get more skilled. I want to become better, so I don't rely on jutsu. - Mon Dec  7 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: But they're cool. - Mon Dec  7 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: You can be al like zap zap zuuuum~ - Mon Dec  7 11:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: But, what if your jutsu don't work, and even then if you find a library big enough to have answer to every challange. You still need to be good enough to use it, and be able to get into the fight for practical use. - Mon Dec  7 11:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: But think of all the combos~. Plus if your jutsu doesn't work then you should of practice with it more before using it in a fight *nods* - Mon Dec  7 11:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Lets say you mastered all your jutsu right? - Mon Dec  7 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Mhm - Mon Dec  7 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Lets say you were slow as a snail though, and you were sent to be the first attack force of an army. You have to save up your chakra for the fight, but only to find out the enemy was attacking another place. How would you get there in time and shape to fight them. - Mon Dec  7 11:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hmmm.... well... with the jutsus I have now... I don't think I could... but with another jutsu I'm going to learn later and a bit of doton training I would pretty much swim there underground. Chakra isn't really a think I have to worry about very much. - Mon Dec  7 11:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: So you swim underground for god knows how long. You come up surely slightly tired from using a jutsu that long no matter how much it takes out of you. You then fight a guy faster then you and able to avoid your attacks since your so slow. - Mon Dec  7 11:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Uh.. I'd think of something? I'm sorta crafty... I get that I can't exactl depend on only my jutsus whihc is why I'm learning kenjutsu but~ even if my opponent was six times faster than me... I'd think of something...maybe... at least I hope so, heheh. - Mon Dec  7 11:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: So now your focused on dealing with the opponent. What about the rest of the army surrounding you. They'll surely interfere with your fight, and if you aren't able to keep up with one of them. How would you craftly take care of one more, or two, and so on and on.  - Mon Dec  7 11:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: I wouldn't be there alone. No way I'm going to go fight a bunch of guys alone. - Mon Dec  7 11:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Besides if you only use kenjutsu then you're at a disadvantage too. If they're as fast as you, they can stay out of yor range and attack from a far. - Mon Dec  7 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: And they're you go, you have to cover plenty of spaces by yourself. As a shinobi if you want to die, its overconfidence and belief that mastering one area will make you truly the best. I know many great ninjutsu users that have died, don't think too highly of yourself even when you become someone credible. - Mon Dec  7 11:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Well I don't really plan on being all that great honestly. Having a big head will probably never really be a problem cause it's not like I think I'm the best but yeah that's true. - Mon Dec  7 11:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: But yeah, I can dodge, I can reach my friend, I have the strength to fight. Of course, I should add jutsu more later. But, I like to be competent on my own without the need of relying on something that can only cover what you know. - Mon Dec  7 11:32:28 2015

She sorely wished those two would just get along already, but it seems things wouldn't be so easy for that to come true.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) wasn't a person to stick to one crowd, instead she had adhere to practically every person in town besides a very small sum of a few. She was the perfect person to break away from her usual cast, and come over to the boy. The girl wore bits and pieces of metal. A shoulder guard on her right arm, a small chest plate, and pauldrons hanging around the side of her pants. She barely wore anything else to cover up her top, and only a small strap for the tanto on her back covered some pointless skin.


Her hand quickly grasping the male's hand entirely. She then began to squeeze tightly though it was no aim to hurt him, it was just her usual grip. She then shake violently, and nodded smiling all the while. "A pleasure to meet you, Asin. Always nice to meet a new face around here." She then looks over hearing Sanoke.

"Hey! Sanoke, I was hoping I could get a mission off you. If you would be so kind." She said just a small minor diversion from their greetings to one another.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "Thats nice..." She says knowing what was going on with her and Paine, and simply decided not to press on the matter. She then gave Momura a quick friendly hug, before turning back to Asin. "Well, I'm sure Sanoke would mind. Though, I go ask him quickly about joining me." She then nodded hearing Momura's question.

She then pulled out the scroll, and read it throughly. "Apprently the mansion of the Kazekage just needs cleaned out. Not much of a mission."* - Tue Dec  8 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: LETS GO ASIN! - Tue Dec  8 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) comes inside of the Kage's mansion with Asin being dragged along, inside walking around without any inhibition as she quickly stamps all over the place. She look upwards at the ceiling, and then noticed a square cut out. At the southern end of the cut out there was a handle to grasp on too; however, instead of getting a ladder. The girl merely took a leap several feet in the air. She pulled down the trap door, which suddenly let out the ladder that quickly bonked on to Chikyu's head. "OWawwachuu!" She shook and rubbed the sore spot. She then held a hand out "Ladies first, hehehe!" She says teasing Asin to go in first.* - Tue Dec  8 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nodded her head, she was just teasing the boy. "Hehe, fine I'll go in first if you're too scarred."  She jokes again, grabbing the sides of the ladder. She then began to crawl up the steps. Her white boots stomping on each bar of the ladder as they get up here. She looked at the dusky place, and light up one of the lanterns.

She then called down "Its safe to come up!"* - Tue Dec  8 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "Oh just my friend's husband, and the Kazekage." stated simply, as she points to one side of the spider webbed space. "I'll take this side." She then points to the other, which notably has a lot more book shelves and file folders then Chikyu's side. "You take that one." She says, as she already began to trample through the dust. Pulling out a broom, and then swiping away the taruntula covered mess.* - Tue Dec  8 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) continued to tear down the spinned silver structures of the cob webs. Her broom began to look more like a cotton candy stick then anything else. She went down the ladder several times to shake it off. The webs being a handful to actually peel off the stick substance shot out of the acrachnid's rear ends. She then climb back up, and heard the question directed at her. She was already now seeping up dust into a pan, the floor noticably growing bright with each swipe of the bristles across the floor.

"I actually wouldn't wear a chest plate at all if I had the choice. But, I'm a girl you know, so I have to cover it anyways." She says dumping the dust into a bag. "The rest is used so I can survive attacks from my dad more then anything else."* - Tue Dec  8 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) continued to sweep fine to continue the conversation even without looking over to the boy. Her head and eyes tilted down to thte ground, as she continued to swat the dust into a pile. She simply gave a nod to his question "Yep, my dad trains me all the time. Though, sometimes he gets too caught up and beats me up pretty badly! Hahahaha!"  she says clearly having no qualms with the fact shes been more then bruised by her father's spars. Her side of the floor was already looking a lot bright, and more suitable for human feet then before. Leaning the broom, she let out a sigh then went over to the book shelve s and files she had to do.* - Tue Dec  8 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) turned her head around, letting out a "Huh?" She asked, before chuckling. "What you don't think I have fun when we spar! Its super fun. Hahaha, my dad such a cry baby. When ever he hits me too hard with his training staff. He gets super worried. Not like, I die by a stick though I've gotten close! Hehehe...  He was also super worried when I moved out to Sunagakure. He keeps remindding me to pay the bills and make sure I eat right. Guess since my mom's dead, he has to be over protective! Hahaha." She said honestly laughing out loud in joy and cheer.

She then began to lay out the the files in front of her, and stared hard at them all. She then let out a sigh of frustration. A hand coming to rub at her temple, as she shook her head widly. "Ugh... I always have trouble with this stuff." She then slowly began to alphabetically sort the files in front of her doing just one at a time. Her multiple breaks in between were hilarious, as she had to spend many time slooking through the folders to make sure she did it all correctly.* - Tue Dec  8 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "I  always get a chuckle when my dad starts crying, when he doesn't think I'm watching. Even if its a small bruise!" She let out another group of laughs, before going back to her work. When he asked to help, she throw hand up in a motion to stop. "No its my side, I promised to do it." She says eyes widening as she did her best to focus on the task at hand. It didn't take too long, but would've been far short if Chikyu would've even let Asin help a little bit. But if he offered, she simply tell him that he did his work she could do hers. When she finished, she clap her hands together happily. "Finally, all done! Lets get back to Sanoke to tell him we're done."* - Tue Dec  8 04:52:41 2015

(*Chikyu Kasanari wasn't a person to stick to one crowd, instead she had adhere to practically every person in town besides a very small sum of a few. She was the perfect person to break away from her usual cast, and come over to the boy. The girl wore bits and pieces of metal. A shoulder guard on her right arm, a small chest plate, and pauldrons hanging around the side of her pants. She barely wore anything else to cover up her top, and only a small strap for the tanto on her back covered some pointless skin.


Her hand quickly grasping the male's hand entirely. She then began to squeeze tightly though it was no aim to hurt him, it was just her usual grip. She then shake violently, and nodded smiling all the while. "A pleasure to meet you, Asin. Always nice to meet a new face around here." She then looks over hearing Sanoke.

"Hey! Sanoke, I was hoping I could get a mission off you. If you would be so kind." She said just a small minor diversion from their greetings to one another.

*)
Chikyu Kasanari says: Thanks Sanoke, *she then turned to Momu* hey where you been!


(*Chikyu Kasanari "Thats nice..." She says knowing what was going on with her and Paine, and simply decided not to press on the matter. She then gave Momura a quick friendly hug, before turning back to Asin. "Well, I'm sure Sanoke would mind. Though, I go ask him quickly about joining me." She then nodded hearing Momura's question.

She then pulled out the scroll, and read it throughly. "Apprently the mansion of the Kazekage just needs cleaned out. Not much of a mission."*)

(*Chikyu Kasanari paused for a moment thinking about it. "I'll spar you later. I'm bit busy at the moment... And I'm sure hes at the mansion waiting for us."*)

Chikyu Kasanari says: Asin here, would like to help on that mission to clean up your filthy attic, if you don't mind.

Chikyu Kasanari says: LETS GO ASIN!


(*Chikyu Kasanari comes inside of the Kage's mansion with Asin being dragged along, inside walking around without any inhibition as she quickly stamps all over the place. She look upwards at the ceiling, and then noticed a square cut out. At the southern end of the cut out there was a handle to grasp on too; however, instead of getting a ladder. The girl merely took a leap several feet in the air. She pulled down the trap door, which suddenly let out the ladder that quickly bonked on to Chikyu's head. "OWawwachuu!" She shook and rubbed the sore spot. She then held a hand out "Ladies first, hehehe!" She says teasing Asin to go in first.*)

(*Chikyu Kasanari nodded her head, she was just teasing the boy. "Hehe, fine I'll go in first if you're too scarred."  She jokes again, grabbing the sides of the ladder. She then began to crawl up the steps. Her white boots stomping on each bar of the ladder as they get up here. She looked at the dusky place, and light up one of the lanterns.

She then called down "Its safe to come up!"*)



(*Chikyu Kasanari "Oh just my friend's husband, and the Kazekage." stated simply, as she points to one side of the spider webbed space. "I'll take this side." She then points to the other, which notably has a lot more book shelves and file folders then Chikyu's side. "You take that one." She says, as she already began to trample through the dust. Pulling out a broom, and then swiping away the taruntula covered mess.*)

(*Chikyu Kasanari continued to tear down the spinned silver structures of the cob webs. Her broom began to look more like a cotton candy stick then anything else. She went down the ladder several times to shake it off. The webs being a handful to actually peel off the stick substance shot out of the acrachnid's rear ends. She then climb back up, and heard the question directed at her. She was already now seeping up dust into a pan, the floor noticably growing bright with each swipe of the bristles across the floor.

"I actually wouldn't wear a chest plate at all if I had the choice. But, I'm a girl you know, so I have to cover it anyways." She says dumping the dust into a bag. "The rest is used so I can survive attacks from my dad more then anything else."*)

(*Chikyu Kasanari continued to sweep fine to continue the conversation even without looking over to the boy. Her head and eyes tilted down to thte ground, as she continued to swat the dust into a pile. She simply gave a nod to his question "Yep, my dad trains me all the time. Though, sometimes he gets too caught up and beats me up pretty badly! Hahahaha!"  she says clearly having no qualms with the fact shes been more then bruised by her father's spars. Her side of the floor was already looking a lot bright, and more suitable for human feet then before. Leaning the broom, she let out a sigh then went over to the book shelve s and files she had to do.*)


(*Chikyu Kasanari turned her head around, letting out a "Huh?" She asked, before chuckling. "What you don't think I have fun when we spar! Its super fun. Hahaha, my dad such a cry baby. When ever he hits me too hard with his training staff. He gets super worried. Not like, I die by a stick though I've gotten close! Hehehe...  He was also super worried when I moved out to Sunagakure. He keeps remindding me to pay the bills and make sure I eat right. Guess since my mom's dead, he has to be over protective! Hahaha." She said honestly laughing out loud in joy and cheer.

She then began to lay out the the files in front of her, and stared hard at them all. She then let out a sigh of frustration. A hand coming to rub at her temple, as she shook her head widly. "Ugh... I always have trouble with this stuff." She then slowly began to alphabetically sort the files in front of her doing just one at a time. Her multiple breaks in between were hilarious, as she had to spend many time slooking through the folders to make sure she did it all correctly.*)

(*Chikyu Kasanari "I  always get a chuckle when my dad starts crying, when he doesn't think I'm watching. Even if its a small bruise!" She let out another group of laughs, before going back to her work. When he asked to help, she throw hand up in a motion to stop. "No its my side, I promised to do it." She says eyes widening as she did her best to focus on the task at hand. It didn't take too long, but would've been far short if Chikyu would've even let Asin help a little bit. But if he offered, she simply tell him that he did his work she could do hers. When she finished, she clap her hands together happily. "Finally, all done! Lets get back to Sanoke to tell him we're done."*)

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) comes over after announcing her completed mission. She then ran over to the baby, that was now crying in one of the strollers. She ran over to its side, probably helping some of the protection from the wind with her body, and her hunched over self giving shade from that blistering sun.


 "Ohwhwhwhwooo! They're so adorable!" She says, holding a hand out with a single finger extended near the baby. "Look at it, its so cute." She then gently rubs Babi's soft cheek. The other hand going to grab the bottle, and hold it up for the baby to once enjoy partaking in what was inside of it. She then held it for the baby easing up every so often so it could enjoy a breathe and not a solid flowing stream of milk into its mouth.
