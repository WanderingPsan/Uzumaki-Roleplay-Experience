<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . .  - Wed Dec  9 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stabbed her giant Mirosen in the ground. The blade practically buried half way under the earth. She then walks off boots stomping a trail in the sand, she comes back with a tanto strapped on to her back. She quickly pulls the blade out of its sheathe. She stands next to Mirosen, as she begans to train herself.

The girl starts with her usual swings. The tanto swiping through the air; however, she was not in the best of moods at the moment. Her swings just filled with tense frustration. The blade barely able to hold itself still thanks to the shaking grip that Chikyu herself had on it. The girls chest huffing in an almost rough grunt. She clearly was upset, and not really able to focus fully on her training. The ugly imperfect swings continued to come from her.

However, she stopped mid swing looking over to the spar that ended with a single stroke. Mitsunara being charged to from Kinami. The girl shouted in horror, she had never seen anything like that before... especially done to one of her own friends. The girl was paused for a moment, before she quickly dropped her tanto on the ground. "Hiroshi go get someone!" she says pushing past him.


She then ran up to Mitsunara, completely ignoring anything that happened to Kinami. She quickly stand next to the girl reaching to pull her out of the hole in the wall that was made. "Oh g-god, are you okay!" She call Mitsunara names several times, trying to lightly pull her out without making the injuries worse.* - Wed Dec  9 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would quickly take to support Mitsunara in her arms. Both hands slipping underneather her shoulders and one at her lower back. That way, Chikyu could keep her laying straight without having more pain go to her chest. Thankfully, Chikyu had the ability to carry giant swords and people with ease. She slowly raised Mitsunara up.

"Oh...shes awake oh good... Just give me a second, Mitsu. I'm going to get you help." She says, taking her steps with caution already carrying her in the direction towards the hospital.  She tried to keep her arms still, just like her heart right now that had nearly stopped beating at the sight of this. Chikyu's eyes were full of worried, and her mouth was crumpled into a frown. She looked like she was about to burst into tears.* - Wed Dec  9 12:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: ....Fuck.... - Wed Dec  9 12:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) quickly kicked open the doors, and led Mitsunara inside the hospital. She then handed her off on to a moving strecher that was led to her. She let the medical personal take to giving care to Mitsunara, as she just simply was forced to sit and wait to hear on how her friend was doing.* - Wed Dec  9 12:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) pats her, and would actually stay a lot longer. She wouldn't leave Mitsu side til she was sure she was in a good state.* - Wed Dec  9 12:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) After all that mind numbing mess with Kinami and Mitsunara's spar. Chikyu had recovered enough mental fortitude to continue her training. Her face was completely neutral, her face flat while she was training. Those eyes that once blazed red with energy and optimiism have gone dull. The small glow there was more like the few embers on top of the last remanents of coal.  Still, the girl kept on training. She was more of robot then ever now doing the usual slashes. Her body just doing it out of habit less then out of enthusiasm. 

The tanned girl began to do cross shaped slashes. Her arms flinging over each shoulder, switching side to side after each single cut. The vicious follow up cuts seemed to be helping remove her worry and anger. The girl continued to thrash out at the air front of her. The blade cutting back and forth with loud swishes of the air it displaced. The blades chopping was getting smoother though slowy. The cuts becoming more accurate and stronger, even if the training did come from a burst of rage. 

She then started to work on what she had left to the end the other day. She dropped the sword closer to her thighs. She then began to cut the blade side to side. Her arms ripping side to side, and she never seemed to stop. The blade was growing in its ability to make fine slash, thanks to the help of Chikyus growing skilled hands. The handle of the blade was being more fine tunned by the normal giant sword wield girl. She had worked for this it be no surpise she had fine tuned her skills to this point.

The girl then held the sword back for a moment, as she took a few heavy breathes. The girl burst of energy while given her enough energy to do a large portion of her training quickly, had also began to work on her stamina. Still, she continued biting through the stinging straing of her muscles. Her feet this time began to move. She began to take steps, and along with those steps slashes. She began to work on her speed and reflexes with the blade. Chikyu's feet stamping one after another in powerful steps. Her blade ringing out after each one, as she went through various cuts.

The girl was practically now dancing with her thin blade. Her steps followed with a cut began to come with a certain beat. The swords silver arcs followed her spins and lines of movement. Her direction only revolving in circles, as her feet literred the sands with the trails of her footsteps. All the while, the girl was merely silent. Her concentration all on the blade the flew through the air. The sharp edges cutting through friction, as it was led by Chikyu's arm. However, all things must come to end as the girl stopped mid swing and step. She let out a sigh, and then slid the blade back in its sheath.* - Wed Dec  9 13:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) turns to Marco, as she pulls out a piece of paper its folded neatly into a small square piece thats palm sized. However, if one should unfold it stretch to a good 8 by 8 piece of paper. "I told my dad about some of the weapons you made, and so he handed me this paper. It has a concept for a sword my dad thought up. I was curious if you could possible make it, and if you could take some time figure out how much it cost." She says offering him to take the piece of paper.

If he did and opened it up, he see a massive steel blade design. It only be slightly shorter then the one Chikyu carried currently did. The creation would make the blade a glowing pure white. Markings of red outlined the inside of the blade, and ended up in a center core of maroon red with a cheap jewel core as the center of the bottom of the blade. The sword had several spiked protusion at the base, and two small ones at the top that gave the sword an almost cross shaped end. These protusions could easily be used as a pick axe to poke through opponents armor. It also a rather thick blade giving it some defensive measures. * - Wed Dec  9 15:51:53 2015

She was slightly disappointed she didn't get to use that new sword she was getting made by Marco. However, she quickly shrugged it off since she could finally have some fun with Mitsunara. She the nraises the massive blade in front of herself, the hulking piece of metal weightless in her hands.

"Lets dance then..." she then comes running out to Mitsunara. Chikyu swung her sword over the side of her shoulder, as she rampaged forward through the sand. She then came to swing the blade down on Mitsunara all with a smile, as she watched to see how much her opponent had really recovered.* - Thu Dec 10 08:15:47 2015

Chikyu then with one hand pulls back the sword quickly rearing it out of the ground. Her fingers then grip on to the steel, as she uses the bottom of the handle of her blade along with the pommel to strike away at the flat side of the nodachi to deflect attack on her arms. She then loosens the grip on the blade.

Her fingers and wrist twist rotating the blade clock wise until the whole blade had been lifted straight into the air once more. She then once again brings the blade down vertically on Mitsunara. "I'm geeting used to your sneaky strikes."* - Thu Dec 10 09:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nods and begins to watch her opopnent effortly catch her blade even if it did some damage to the sword. Mitsunara could clearly handle it, as she gegan to alread start her counter attack. "Hehe, keep showing me how skilled you are..." She then side stepped the attack almost gracefully, and if not a shadow of Mitsunara's own graceful movements. It seemed Chikyu was beginning to copy her peer. 

She then pulled back her blade. She slide the handle out of the crossguard lock, and she then go for a series of stabs at Mitsunara.  Her blade being thrusted at a rather fast pace. All the while she manages to balance these attacks in all in one spot.* - Thu Dec 10 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) keeps her eyes keen on to her opponent. Watching how she was able to easily track all of Chikyu's thrusts with ease, and then simply find the simple path to dodging. The way she adjusted her self with her blade as well in mid fight was all impressive to Chikyu.

Then, she notices as Mitsunara's found a opening to attack. The girl held out one of her arms to use an armguard to protect from the strike. The girl then grunted, as her arm was easily blown away. The sounds of her cheap iron guards crack and nearly shattering under the weight of Mitsunara's strength. Chikyu barely managing to stop the blow just before it gives a light cut to her side. She then pushes off the attack, and takes a few steps to the right.

Here she lifts up her left arm, and takes off the broken armguard. Her forearm slightly bruised on the top. She then holds out her sword again, this time letting Mitsunara attack.* - Thu Dec 10 09:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looked over her sword, with a raised eye  brow. She didn't know what the heck was Mitsunara even saying. Before, the girl began to speak in some foul demoic language. The darkness of her being leaking out, as it formed under the words she chanted. It was here then Chikyu remembered. <Oh yeah shes a magician!> 

She then immediatly brought up her sword holding it out like a barrier. One hand on the handle, as the other support the body of the blade. She then began to tilt her blade rapidly back and forth. The rain of these dark javelins shattered like glass as they impacted. Each shot of the spears led to a notable thunk, that pushed Chikyu backwards with each hit.

However, the ending smoke that surrounded the girl was quickly blown away with one might swing of her sword, revealing she was perfectly okay. She then began to take charge, and hold her sword behind her. Stopping in front of Mitsunara, as Chikyu then did a large horozontal sweep with her blade.* - Thu Dec 10 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) can't help but grin herself a wide smile, as once again another one of her attacks is held off by the woman. The two pressing back against one another, as the blades both shake in front of Chikyu's eyes. 

Chikyu quickly shoves off the attack just for a minor moment to get the chance to swing her blade again. The girl gripping her blade, as she gives several light swings that could easily be deflected. She was just simply looking for a moment of a mistake by Mitsunara to abuse.

"Don't let up, Mitsu!"* - Thu Dec 10 10:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) watched the good old trick Mitsunara has used before, as she reaches for the blade. Her blade was quickly pushed aside, and when she saw what Mitsuanra was going for Chikyu simply shouted a response in turn. "Neither was I!" 

She then raised a foot, and attempted to Kick Mitsunara, in return as the punch quickly knocked her in the stomach. The girl leaning back realling for a few moments from the pain, before she was able to recover. A noticable circle of purple on her abdomen now.* - Thu Dec 10 10:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) holds her sword to the side for a moment, as her left hand rubs her stomach at the moment. One eye closing and twiching at the feeling of the tense knotted pain in her gut at the moment. However with one open eye, she spotted that Mitsunara was still revving to go. Chikyu returned standing straight up holding her sword back upwards, like a gallatn warrior with too much pride to go down from one or two blows.

She then swings her sword several times just cement the fact she was going to go at it.  "Glad your enjoying your time out of the hopsital." She says, before she goes over to Mitsunara. 

She starts out with a surprisingly fast kick out the gate, one she put her all into. Her whole body leaning into it, as her sword hung back behind too slow to keep up. However, it was clear she was doing the moment she recoiled back from the kick. Her extended foot stomping down, and her whole body pulling itself up. The sword flowing with the entire motion came up, and smashed the ground in front of her.* - Thu Dec 10 10:27:12 2015
