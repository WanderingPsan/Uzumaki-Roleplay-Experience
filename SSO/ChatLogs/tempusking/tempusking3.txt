<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) pulls out her tanto, and holds it out in front of her. She gave it a few waves several times. She was still rather new to the thing, and even with training she hadn't actually put it to test in an actual spar. She looked over to Mitsunara, and gave her a little hesistant smile and chuckle. "You won't mind if I use this right? I'm not holding back or anything. I just like to get a chance to really rest it out, without worry." She says not wanting to lower the fun of all this for her room mate.* - Tue Dec  8 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) quickly prepares herself at the moment. "Maybe not today, but when ever you want. I'll always be willing to give you a good spar. We both do love testing ourselves don't we." She says giving Mitsunara notable smile holding the blade in front of her. 

She was actually rather concerned. She knew the power of Mitsunara, and she certainly didn't have the body to stand up to it. Still, this would be the perfect trial by fire for her and how far shes progressed with the smaller blade.* - Tue Dec  8 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) took a moment to step back feeling Mitsunara's pressure. Her sudden momentum making the girl step back, and good thing that she did as she tried to deflect the blade with her tanto. However, the heavier Nodachi easily brushed aside the tanto. Chikyu only managing to avoid the blow purely by back pettling. She quickly stammers for a moment to regain a hold on her sword, that shook from being struck with the nodachi. 

Chikyu not willing to play coward; however, charged forward to strike back. Her arms holding up and doing a basic strike at Mitsunara before trying to use the lightness of her blade to step back from the attack. Hopefully, she could keep pace and avoid most of Mitsunara's attack by using the light nature of the tanto to Chikyu's advantage.* - Tue Dec  8 06:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) attack only ringed on the metal steel, as she struck the nodachi. The girl smiled,   she almost seemed to stop to admire her opponents movements. The way she stepped the way she gently guided herself and her weapons across the battlefield. She smiled leaping back from the sweep Mitsunara made.

The tanned swordsman began to slowly lift the back of her feeet up and down. Chikyu was seemingly preparing herself for something. She then began to travel forward, and began to almost immitate her opponent in style. Her feet taking gentle steps left and right. She then stops hearing the announcment. She then walks over to Mitsu.

She shakes her head, and puts down her blade. "You want to fight more."* - Tue Dec  8 06:58:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) spread her feet across the sand. She glued herself to the spot she stood on, feet digging into place.  She pulled the blade, and did the usual first set of  frontal chops.  The steel blade being held high above her head, her bices flexing as she began to start. She then brought the blade down out in front of her, a whisk of the flashing steel glittering in through the cut of the air. She continued to raise the blad back up over her head. She cut almost fifty silver arcs in front of her for this set of training. 

She then quickly brings the blade upwards after the very last fiftieth strike, this time having the blade curl over her right shoulder. She then started to cut the air diagonally. Her body begining to rock back and forth. Her arms snapping at an angle, the blade slicing from the side all the way until it nearly touch the dirt to her left. Again, she continued her cuts another fifty times in a row. Feet rocking back and forth, slowly slipping her deeper and disrupting the leveled sand. She seemed like she soon meld in the spot that she stood.

The girl switch to the diagonal cut starting from her left side. Again, she showed a noticable amount of rigidness to her movement. Slow jerks in her movement, as her arms criss crossed to bring the blade down in front of her. The girl's torso leaning in and then back up with each of the cuts. It took nearly twenty slashes before she began to get a smoother motion to the cut. The fluidity of her blade coming out more once her arms began to adjust coming from that side.

The girl stopped, putting ten more extra slashes out of her diagonal cut. She thought she needed the extra practiece before holding her blade down close to the center of her waist. Chikyu then pressed the pommel of her sword on top of her muscular abdomen. She then dragged it across her skin till the square end of the handle was making a ninety degree angel with her body. 

She then held it out several inches. She then began to do a slow movement outwards. The blade just slowly inching across, as Chikyu imagined how the cut would come out. The swordsman then began to adjust the cut raising, lowering, outwards, and inwards til she felt that it was in a natural way for the sword to travel. 


Chikyu then started to actually swing the blade from right to left. She aimed to have the blade travel across in a flat one-hundred and eighty degress plane. However, the first slash proved how hard that would actually be. The movement of her arms naturally wanting to curve closer to her shoulders. The blade shifting up the entire time. She continued to work on this, her arms acting like a pendulum for most of the time she spent training it. They just slowly went back and forth, going one way for a moment only to slide back the opposite direction. However through all her cuts, she only ended up keeping some straight cuts near the last ten.

After wards, she was rather exhausted. Doing a total of two-hundred and sixty slashes in all just for this one training. The real stressful part was watching her own moves over and over, and trying to correct in such tiny ways. The true challenge through out was mental fatigue. She was satsfied, and wish to give her mind some peaceful rest.* - Wed Dec  9 03:25:13 2015
