<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Thu Dec 10 15:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) made sure to bring along Mirosen, knowing the fact they could come across plenty of trouble along the way. She didn't want to come unprepared. Though, she did have a sense of confidence, as she marched along with two people she had total faith in. Not only that, she had some pride in all the growth she has had. She felt she could handle helping her teammates and not be beaten out right like last time.

The girl idly continued her march. She didn't feel even a slight hint of exhaustion or heat. At best, she pull out one of her many water bottles and guzzle down a quater of it before placing it back into her pack. The trail of foot prints in the sand marked each step the group had taken. Though slowly, the trail began to get lighter and light as they finally escaped the sands of Suna and began reaching the outskirts. Where dry dead wastelands became slowly metamorphized into patchy fields of green.* - Thu Dec 10 15:53:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) pressed her foot on top of the grass, that quickly compressed under the weight of Chikyu's foot. Her head was almost always tilted upwards starring at the trees with wonderment. She had always hated the dry and dreaded state of Sunagakure when it came to plants and wildlife. Chikyu's eyes were peeled wide open so she could concentrate on the sights.

Though, her visual focus was on the flora of the land. She was able to responde to Mirai's conversation. "Yeah, I haven't been to Konoha either. I'm sure its going to be great. I remember how beautiful Kirigakure was, when we got a chance to see it from the outside. Though, they didn't let us go inside. Hopefully, it will be different here." She states with a cheerful smile.

 "I can't wait to see it, together with you guys."

She paused hearing Paine mutter something, though she didn't hear it until Mirai stated it again. She took a moment to wonder what Paine's house looked like. She tried to imagine it, but could only see some form of giant fighting dojo. Paine just sitting in a small bedroom, before waking up every morning to begin training. The floor stained with blood, tears, and dreams... Chikyu hoped she could see it... It be so cool!* - Thu Dec 10 16:07:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) reached behind her, grabbing the handle of the tanto tightly with one hand. She then slid it out, the sound of the steel rubbing against the inside of its container could be heard the entire time. Once, its length had been fully purged from the sheath the girl flung the blade forward in front of her. Her hands quickly began to flare the sword out in front of her. The edge of the blade slashing several times over from different directions. The girl suddenly stopped her numerous slashes then pulled back.

She still had the blade firmly in her grasp, but she simply stood for a moment looking at ease not too tense at the moment. Chikyu then pointed her blade out in front of her. Her arm and the spine of the tanto all completely on level. She then pulled back, her foot sliding in the sand the sole pushing apart the sand. Her arm began rear the blade back, the muscles in her forearm compressing like a spring. She then took a quick step forward letting out a quick jab. The silver line jutting forward a good foot, as it was pressed forward. This stabbing motion only the beginning of a river of attacks.

Taking a step forward, the girl brought her blade up then crossed a slash out in front of her. The girl then brrought her blade quickly up towards a sixty degree angle holding it abdomen level.  She then did a horozontal cut that had her right arm with the sword wrap all the way around her body. Right hand pressed at the side of her left waist. She the took a step to the far right. Switching sides of the blade, the girl unravled her body with a snap slashing while she moved.

Chikyu's movements were completely different from anything before. She was fully trying to utilize the work of the Katana. Her feet taking several steps, through the sand practically skipping across the surface. Her feet barely disturbing where she landed as she took to only minor surfaces indents of her foot prints in the sand. While she moved, she began to start attacking again. One arm flailing outwards with the light sword in hand. The sword disappearing several times only for a glint of reflecting light to reveal its location and path.

Chikyu then slid across the sand turning completely around to go the opposite direction. This time, her blows became far more forceful then the gracious movement she kept so far. The attacks never stopping, her movements coming more from straight lines outwards from her body. Speed and attack power being the true keys to her stance. The girl blazed lines across the sand that zig-zagged across the training grounds. The girl's blade traveling left, right, up, and down with all the other directions in between. Each one, she let out a gritted grunt swinging her full force.

The blade chopped and skewered the air in front of her. The girl's sweat dripping from her temples and forehead. She didn't seem to stop even as her muscles strained to keep up these constant belows. However it couldn't last, the last of her energy storages dipping lower and lower. She slowed herself to a stop letting out a final sigh, and then slid her tanto on to the sheath on her back.* - Thu Dec 10 22:54:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looks rather unhappy at the moment, she appeared rather flustered with her hair beginning to spike up in anger. The girl grabbed her sword, and flung it out in front of her. She then waved it back and forth, the blade swiping in front of her. She was rather quite about the whole thing, as she then stopped from her few practice swings. The steel notable letting out a hollow call, as it was stretched upwards over head where she then grasped the handle finally with both hands. She then brought it down to her chest, the wind coming off the small movement blowing away the sand.

"Shall we begin?"* - Sat Dec 12 07:35:12 2015

She came running the blade hanging by her side as she sped along her forward path. The girl's feet beginning to swell with chakra actually, as she came around to Kinami. Chikyu then stopped her feet glueing themselves to the ground with suimen to give her a better ability to lever her power. She then gave a huge swing, a very wide horizontal blow at Kinami's side.* - Sat Dec 12 07:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would hold on to the blade actually wanting to get closer to the girl. However, she was prepared for some form of an attack. However, the one she received was something she didn't expect. Chikyu's lips quickly pressed on to by the girl, that made her eyes pop open wide for a moment. However, she quickly pulled back. She lean back then kick Kinami on the fore leg. However, Kinami quickly note this wasn't done at full strength. If she managed to hit, and Kinami tried to move it. She note that Chikyu's foot was stuck to it with Suimen. Chikyu would then pull her leg back with full strength, aiming to pull Kinami off her foot and have her fall backwards.* - Sat Dec 12 07:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) cheeks burned bright red, though it was mostly out of embarassment. She then grabbed her sword holding it out sideways. She then use both hands to begin trying to smash the steel on to Kinami. "THAT WAS MY FIRST KISS! I'M NOT MY FRIEND'S PERSONAL DOLL TO PRACTICE THEIR LIPS ON"  She says rather yelling in anger, each word coming out with every single attack. If she was calm, she know this would work and had another idea on to pin Kinami down. Here though, she was just too angered and infurated with this betrayal of trust that she was berserking out on Kinami while she could.* - Sat Dec 12 07:59:56 2015

The sword leaving several noticable cracks and breaks on the ground from her attack. She clearly wasn't holding back, as she finally halted her assault though she looked no less upset. She then swung the sword up over her should, and then down on her back. Her face still crumpled into a grunt as she began to walk away.* - Sat Dec 12 08:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) would try and move her arms, but they clearly be halted by Kinami's supperior strength. The girl then gave Kinami a look in the eye, one that was cold and dead. She then jumped up, her knees curled up near Kinami's chest height. Chikyu then shot both her legs out smacking Kinami in the chest with both her feet. She knew it probably wouldn't hurt or even make Kinami let her go. It just made her feel better.* - Sat Dec 12 08:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) continued to struggle out of it only pausing when Avrian finally spoke up about the matters. "Seems someone has figured it out." She states rather bluntly and looking angerly at Kinami.* - Sat Dec 12 08:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) let her go off to do whatever she wished, she was going to head out. But, she was going to let Kinami get as far away as possible before she left.* - Sat Dec 12 08:22:59 2015
