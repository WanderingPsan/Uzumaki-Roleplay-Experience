<br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) takes a moment to bite down one of her meatballs, letting out her own humm from doing such. She then nods to Mitsunara. "Yeah... " she pauses taking another bite from her meal. "So, what you think about all of the people in the village having kids?" She says going back to taking a bite of meal.* - Sun Dec 13 05:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) almost chokes on her own bite of food after hearing that.

She waves a hand of surrender, as she takes a drink to clear her throat. "Heheh, calm down tiger..." She then gives a smile. "We'll kill them, before they have even the chance to harm one hair on their little heads."* - Sun Dec 13 05:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looks over to the sake. "Hope you can hold your drinks better then Kinami, hehe."  

She chuckles, before letting out a happy chomp on her sphaghetti. "Its really good, I see why Lera always comes here." She says cheerfully with a hand on her cheek.* - Sun Dec 13 05:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) takes another chomp of one of those packed meat balls. "Hehe, I guess I'll see for myself."

She then pauses to look over to Kiyoko, and waving back. A slight blush glowing just even being so open about their date. She was battlehardened, but that apparently didn't help with her bashful nature of romance.* - Sun Dec 13 06:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nods agreeing with her statement. 

"I didn't even think she like me in the first place, so when she told me that she be willing in a few years. I didn't mind to wait and think about it." She smiles brightly though with her head tilted down looking at her lap. "I'm glad I did wait." She says glancing back up to Mitsunara.* - Sun Dec 13 06:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Hahh.... To think, anyone'd be concerned about me.. - Sun Dec 13 06:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nodded  (Yeah TS shenanigans!) "I care about her too." She says with a happy smirk. "Though,  it is a handful when she throws herself into danger." She lets out a tiny teasing laugh.* - Sun Dec 13 06:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hehe... I guess thats a part I love about you too. - Sun Dec 13 06:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Don't you think, Chikyu? - Sun Dec 13 06:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) looks over seeing the jump kiss. She imagines for a moment replacing Lera and Kiyoko with herself and Mitsunara. She literally jumps when Mitsunara asks her. 

Her eyes shift for a moment. "Of..of course!" She then takes a drink to calm her nerves.* - Sun Dec 13 06:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mrm... - Sun Dec 13 06:17:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) thinks: Kawai.. - Sun Dec 13 06:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stayed quiet for a moment. A wavy smile one her lips was sucked into hold her voice. She just looked rather heated and red.* - Sun Dec 13 06:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: See you later guys~ - Sun Dec 13 06:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: You to! - Sun Dec 13 06:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Bye...-she eeps out after they already left- - Sun Dec 13 06:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: So...uh yeah... I'm pretty much done eating. - Sun Dec 13 06:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Yeah? Mrm.. I guess I finished my plate, too.. Heh. - Sun Dec 13 06:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: So.. I guess thats the end of the date... was it good? - Sun Dec 13 06:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Mrm... Did you enjoy it? - Sun Dec 13 06:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: A lot... - Sun Dec 13 06:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) says: Then it was a good date! - Sun Dec 13 06:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) gets out of her chair, and holds a hand out to Mitsunara. "So...shall we go?"* - Sun Dec 13 06:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) stops by the doorway just before they leave. "Umm...I.. I heard from my dad that if a date goes well. A good way to end it is a kiss...so if you wouldn't mind me taking the initiative again." She weakly wraps her arms around, Mitsunara's shoulders. She then leans up though completely slow enough for Mitsunara to react or reject the response.* - Sun Dec 13 06:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) arms wrap Mitsunara in return. The girl's eyes closed as she felt both of their soft lips touch. The warmth of both their bodies spiking for a moment, as Chikyu takes in one noticable breathe. She pulls back, her lips parting for a moment in almost shock what just happened. She then puckers them back, before curling them into a smile towards the necormancer.

She then nods, a arm slipping around Mitsunara's waist. Chikyu resting her head on her shoulders, as they left the building. "This...was a really...really good date. I'm glad I had you for my first one."* - Sun Dec 13 06:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) takes a seat on the bench, arm still wrapped around Mitsunara. The other hand rubbing down the sleeve of her Kimono. Chikyu then leans over chuckling, and whispers something in Mitsunara's ear.* - Sun Dec 13 06:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: I actually had a dress I wanted to wear for you...but you accepted so happily... I didn't want to ruin the tempo. Guess, I'll save it for next time. - Sun Dec 13 06:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: Hah.. I see, I see. - Sun Dec 13 06:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nods for a moment, on Momura's shoulder. "You better~"* - Sun Dec 13 06:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) eyes open wide as she taken for a kiss so suddenly, though it really should've been expected from her.

However, she quickly enjoys the taste of Mitsunara's lips. A hand clinging to the Necromancer's shoulder for a moment.

When, she parts Chikyu left slightly dazed then nods. "Hehe... I'll be sure to get used to that as well."* - Sun Dec 13 06:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) whispers: Also the floor pretty cold to sleep on don't ya think? - Sun Dec 13 06:43:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hiroshi if you want to get better with Kenjutsu. Do you want to go try and spar with me? - Sun Dec 13 08:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Uh... sure? But pretty sure you can send me to the stars with one swing so take it easy on me? - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Can I watch? - Sun Dec 13 08:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nods. "Of course, I never go all out. Especially, when I be fighting someone like you. And, sure you can Claudette. Come along."* - Sun Dec 13 08:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hey~ what does that mean " Someone like me~" - Sun Dec 13 08:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Oh nothing lets go now. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Hey Lera. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hrm? - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Hey Auntie Lera - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: Hey thee - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Just saying hi. - Sun Dec 13 08:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: So want me to use my real sword or bokken? - Sun Dec 13 08:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) pulled out her sword, as she held it out single handly with one hand. The massive blade was the first time she ever held it against Hiroshi. Chikyu then began to rev up one of her arms by spinning it in circles. "Wheeew! This is first time I picked this up after all that katana training. And yeah, you should use your real sword." She says, before she then swung the sword in front of her. The attack was so fast that it was probably hard to see for someone with low reflexes. A cloud of dust blew across the sandy training grounds hitting Hiroshi across the bottom of his pants legs.

"Whew! This sure does wonders on the body. I guess I'll take it half strength." She stated, as she then grabbed the sword with both hands. A notable crack coming out of her neck and shoulders, as she loosened them for a moment. The pink hair girl then let out a smile over to Hiroshi. "Well, how bout you come at me."* - Sun Dec 13 08:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) turned as the boy showed his excitement over the spar made Chikyu chuckle being instantly reminded of herself. The boy coming over rushing at her side, and bringing up his blade showed he did improve last she saw him. However, she simply shifts her blade to block the attack. She smiled holding his attack off with one hand on the blade "You'll have to d-..." She stopped her ears perking up and her chakra sensors blazing even without her normal concentration. She then pushed away Hiroshi's attack.

She then grabbed Hiroshi by the waist with one arm, she then jumped over to Claudette as well wrapping an arm around her. She then began to carry them up the mountain as water flooded the training grounds. She wouldn't stop until they were hopefully safe on the roof of the flat plateaus that surrounded the training area. "Oh no... its her... shit and Sanoke and Ai aren't around... Oh Mitsunara you better be safe." She says looking over at the raging torrens beneath.* - Sun Dec 13 08:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "Dangit...both of you we're under an attack by a force that we can't compete with. Ai and Sanoke are probably our two bests, especially if they could work with Koji. So...for now... we" She paused going silent for moment before letting out sigh. We'll retreat closer to the higher cliffs to the south on top of here and we're going to stay out of the fight." 

"We'll be able to get to the cliffs down there, and get to higher ground if needed."* - Sun Dec 13 08:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) "For now, lets just take it easy. Keep an eye out for anymore jutsu." She says taking a seat at the edge of the cliff face they were on. She wasn't too worried about falling in the water with her Suimen.  She then lets out a small sigh, she was concerned for Mitsunara. It was just something she have to blow off, she knew Mitsunara was exteremely tough. She wouldn't be taken out by this, but Rias on the other hand was being focused. She didn't want her love or one of her best friends to die.

However, she decided to be tough for the two next to her. She then turned around giving them a smile. "So, how bout we just treat it as a picnic. I got some water and food in my bag. You two want some?"* - Sun Dec 13 09:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) pulled out from her bag, some water for herself. She takes a quick drink, and then pulls out a honey bun. She began to start nibbling on the piece of bread. She shook her head, and scoffed at the two. Her smile showing that she was just enjoing their two personalities.

"Well, hope we can all get along while we're here."* - Sun Dec 13 09:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: So should we begin? - Sun Dec 13 14:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: I'll lock her in the Turtle Oasis.. - Sun Dec 13 14:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: You can't date turtles. - Sun Dec 13 14:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) thinks: Thats what you think -omit- - Sun Dec 13 14:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) thinks: Sanoke is a pervy turtle sage. - Sun Dec 13 14:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nodded her head. "Yeah lets begin." She says, as she extends a foot out in front of her. She then followed with an extended arm. "So, you seen it. Its pretty simple you know." She then holds her spot with a steeled left leg behind her. Her right leg shifts with the movement, as her arm begins to rotate outwards away from herself. "You use your movement to simply bump away the opponent's attack from you. You don't have to force them out of it unless they are exteremly strong. Just, control the motion of your opponent with a light touch."

She then leans and steps back, and holds her hands out. "Now you try it, I'm sure you'll get it on the first or second try."* - Sun Dec 13 14:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? Your mother is busy. Let her handle a little training. - Sun Dec 13 14:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) chuckled at the family dynamics going on with Miaka, Sanoke, and Mirai. The conversation making her smile. The two protective parents were quite cute, it showed they cared for their kid.

She then lean back and watch Mirai accomplish the techinique with ease. Chikyu smiled and nodded happily, as she watched and commented "That was almost perfect, I couldn't do better then that myself." She then leaned back, and arm curling to her side. "Do you want to try and perform it on an actual attack?"* - Sun Dec 13 14:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Sun Dec 13 14:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) took one breathe, as she did hold back for Mirai. It was merely just a test of the techinique. She then shot her arm forward, shooting for just a simple straight punch. The attack not only shown, but going half of Chikyu's real attack speed. So, it was predictable for someone as experienced as Mirai.* - Sun Dec 13 14:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) nodded to her self, as she felt her arms bent outwards flying completely away from Mirai. Chikyu would be completely open for the attack, if this was a serious fight. Chikyu then took one notable step backwards, as she then took in a breathe. "Okay just one last one, something a bit more stiffer then an arm." She then leans back perched on leg. Chikyu curling up her right leg,and then stared at Mirai giving her a quick nod that she really was going to do this. She then kicked at Mirai a little bit faster and stronger. Though again, it was understandable levels of power.* - Sun Dec 13 15:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'm going to go show her that technique really fast, Mirai! - Sun Dec 13 15:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Sure. - Sun Dec 13 15:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) snickered, as her leg was quickly swatted to the side. Chikyu pulled back her leg, and then looked over to Mirai. She hit her fists togethers and bowed to Mirai. "I, Sensei Chikyu, have nothing left to teach you my young student. Heheheh..." She said, before patting Mirai on the shoulder. 

"You go have fun."* - Sun Dec 13 15:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Where are you going? - Sun Dec 13 15:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Oh? Well, I wouldn't want to take up space in your house. Since, you have what...five people living here already. I assume you just be busy. - Sun Dec 13 15:19:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Miaka(Ninask115) says: Mhm! Wanna climb!! - Sun Dec 13 15:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) begins to chuckle. "Wait til you get older, and then one day you can climb as high as me." She says using suimen to begin climbing up the house just a few feet.* - Sun Dec 13 15:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She takes after her ol' man. - Sun Dec 13 15:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You see that, Miaka? - Sun Dec 13 15:34:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: That's possible due to chakra. Cool ain't it? - Sun Dec 13 15:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Miaka(Ninask115) says: Chakra! - Sun Dec 13 15:35:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: SHe's so young. - Sun Dec 13 15:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: So, Chikyu. You should see Koji about continuing those ideas you gave me all of those months ago. - Sun Dec 13 15:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: They coulda been real fun. - Sun Dec 13 15:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Imagine a the swimsuit competition? Man! Mirai would win that so hard. Or hrm. . Maybe me. - Sun Dec 13 15:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You? - Sun Dec 13 15:39:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: You don't think I could? - Sun Dec 13 15:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) hops off the side of the building landing next to Mirai. She the lets out a shaking head. "I'm already busy to continue those ideas. I need to get to working on my missions and my swordsmanship." She says with a noticable tinge of defeat. 

She perks up hearing the swimsuit competitioin, and casually nods to Mirai. She then gags for a moment thinking about Sanoke in a swimsuit.

"Nah, sorry Mirai. But, Mitsunara would take the victory."* - Sun Dec 13 15:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: You're so in love. - Sun Dec 13 15:43:44 2015
