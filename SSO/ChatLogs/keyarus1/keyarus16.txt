<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ This is really a basic attack. ]
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: There is a shuriken coming from all directions, except from behind, right?)
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Yes. ]
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Coo.)
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ And except from in front of you. ]
<br><font color=green>*Hayate(Deeksixx) says: notes that naruto was using sage mode strengtgh_
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ There's also a smoke  bomb impairing vision. ]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I said that.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Monstorous Strength would be similar to what he had.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Since, Naruto wasn't really known for physical strength outside of Sage Mode.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) smirks as the cloud of smoke appears, he'd exclaim, "Fire Style!: Misty Flames Dance! Ninja Art: Fire Run!". Each of the slugs resting on his shoulder would inhale deeply, channeling the recieved Fire Chakra into their lungs, the first Slug would exhale a mist-like highly flammable gas out into the open, enveloping most of the area, mostly focused around Mizuki and Irui, the other slug would exhale a bright flame in the shape of a funnel, as it collided with the gas, it'd explode into an enormous raging flame headed toward Irui.  He'd then leap forward, evading the shuriken coming from the sky, also the one soaring toward him from the front as they approached. Mizuki would use the distraction of the giant flame and smoke to form the handseals for his next jutsu.*
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Lawl.)
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Slugs are using fire style? ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ I thought YOU used the Fire Style. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Holy SHIT. ]
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: They are using my chakra.)
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Those are some MONSTROUS Slugs. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Oh. ]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ RPing. ]
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) smiled. Well of course Mizuki wasn't slacking. This huge Fireball greatly resembled the one he had faced from Narusegawa's opposition. Her Goukakyuu was quite the fearsome opponent, yes it was. But, he had developed a way to avoid it. He clasped both of his hands together, pointing towards the ground. "GALE PALM!" He jumped RIGHT before he used it, allowing what you would name as a 'Super Jump' to happen. He avoided the humongous flame, although his legs were inflicted with a raging heat, and it burned the back his pants slightly. Backflipping in mid air, he executed his hand seals.

"Rat. Ox. Ram. Monkey. Horse!" 

He lodged chakra in the middle of his throat, accollecting his chakra in an amass. He took a deep breathe. The oxygen, instead of entering his respiratory system though, transfused with the chakra inside of his throat. He compressed the oxygen balls that formed in his throat with his experience of compression. This chakra held tthe balls in smaller balls than usual, greatly decreasing their volume. However, when this chakra was let go, aka when he released the balls, the bursts would grow right back into their full size.

"FUUUUUUUUUUUUTON. AAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRR BULLLLLLLLEEEEET."

And like Shukaku, he began to rain down Air Bullets. Two in total. About the size of Katon Goukakyuus.*

<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ But not before jumping. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ So that I didn't have solid rest, and could fly backwards easily. ]

<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) widens his eyes as the enormous orbs of pressurized wind soared toward him, He'd dash toward safety as the two orbs collided with the ground, but the pressure of the impact would send him crashing into the wall, he'd slow slide down the wall as he said, "Not bad...guess it's my turn..". He'd then dash toward Irui, leaping into the air, channeling his chakra into the slug on his left shoulder, the other would begin channeling it's own. Mizuki would then form a chain of handseals exclaiming, "Prepared Needle Shot!". He'd slick back his sleeve revealing his senbon shooter, and the left slug would open it's mouth, each launching 10 senbon at a nearly point blank range, the other launching a pressurized stream of acid toward Irui's chest.*

<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Lol.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) had dropped onto the ground by the time the two Air Bullets had made contact. Now Mizuki was moving to the offensive, the initative. Multitasking was not his best sport, but since the slugs were so small and compact, he could tell what they were doing in conjunction with Mizuki. A mid-ranged combination of acid and nearly-invisible senbon. He could tell Mizuki was shooting some kind of tool, for his mouth formed strange shapes over and over as if blowing outward. Utilizing his reflexes, he snapped his knees, bending them, and kicking off the ground to the right, avoiding the acid. The senbon was aiming at him though, and knowing that it was Mizuki, his head would be tilted in the direction that Irui was moving. He jumped to the side, avoiding a few senbon, although taking one right into the thigh. He held in a yelp, before taking another in his shoulder. Prying them out of his body, he ran over to Mizuki, sweeping through the ground. With the kunai he still had in his hand, he flung it at Mizuki's knee, trying to land a clean mark. With his spare hand, he took a smoke bomb out of his holster, slamming it against the ground. After sending the kunai point-blank range, he could expect opposition. He tried a hit-and-run strategy.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) groans in excrutiating pain. He was unable to move his body, he felt like he was being stabbed everywhere, wherever he had found himself, he didn't like it. He let out many groans and exclamations each time he was pierced.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) begins a chain of handseals, swiftly summoning his favorite small slug, Katyusa. Mizuki would smile as the slug said, "More Strength and chakra control training then?". Mizuki then smirked as he walked to a nearby boulder, which was obviously larger than him. He'd wrap his arms around it, bending at the knees slightly before lifting it up, causing small pebbles to fall from under it. Mizuki would then step onto the surface of the lake, channeling his chakra into his feet, as he did squats on top of the water's surface, doing chakra control and strength training.*
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Then sign meh up)

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Hm, so, you're a taijutsu specialist too, I presume?
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Both of you perhaps?
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: *Huff* ....*Puff*...no...
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Not exactly.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Well, I'm not exactly a taijutsu specialist either.

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm almost done actually.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) threw his bag on the ground, the weight of it racketing the bridge.  Smirking, he turned to them and said, "I've got something in here that will help you guys build speed, and reflexes.  But, you've got to work hard with them."  Opening the sack, he looked in to find a certain pair of items for his students.

Reaching in, he grabs a pair of ankle weights, weighing roughly five hundred pounds a piece.  He turned to face Gin, and threw them on the ground at his feet and said, "Put those on."  Reaching in a few more times, he repeated such process for Mizuki and Tachi.

Finally, he pulled out a pair of weights, this time weighing one thousand pounds a piece.  Clipping them on to his ankles, he smiled at the others and said, "Alright!  We'll start by sparring, but, I'll have to pick who spars who..."*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You all has a pair of weights now.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I've got an extra ton on my body.]

<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) sighs before lifting up his sleeves slightly. He'd smile as Katsyusa, his favorite slug would crawl from under his cloak, letting out a deep yawn. Mizuki'd then giggle slightly before he'd begin to channel his chakra into his feet, and his arms as he wrapped them around the boulder. He'd bend at the knees slightly before letting out a loud  heave and lifting the boulder, he'd then proceed to walk on the surface of the water. He'd walk on the large lake for a longer period of time than his previous attempts, a whole twelve minutes before becoming exhausted. He'd proceed toward land, dropping the boulder.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Izuchi, Sachu(Keyarus1) wanders through the desert, a tear almost falling from his eye as he looks at a devestated Sunagakure, his old homeland. He'd look at the large craters formed from large explosions which launched dirt and rocks into the air. He'd look at the blood staining the sand, he'd even look at a devestated academy, what's left of it, a dusty, unkempt pile of rubble.

Sachu's eyes would begin to water as he looked toward the village. He'd form a chain of handseals, barely able to keep from crying he'd inhale deeply, channeling his chakra into his mouth in the form of clay. He'd poke out his chest some as he continued to inhale. 

He'd let out a deep sigh as he exhaled an enormous mass of clay, aimed first toward the village gate, forming over it, molding into the shape that the gate once possesed, He'd then leap atop the gigantic mass of clay, spitting out large spheres, molding into the shapes the houses once had. He'd then sigh as he said, "I'll need more clay to finish rebuilding the village...".


He'd then begin his chain of handseals again, kneading his Water natured chakra into the clay, for emegency uses, he'd then emmit a second barrage of large globs of clay which he used to repair the village's walls, homes, and even the Kazekage mansion. The Hidden Sand village was rebuilt, and in time, it will be restored to it's former glory.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Izuchi, Sachu(Keyarus1) wanders through the desert, a tear almost falling from his eye as he looks at a devestated Sunagakure, his old homeland.

The Hidden Sand village was rebuilt, and in time, it will be restored to it's former glory.

Sachu would then let out a deep sigh as he said, "Hm...now...to search for survivors of this tragedy.". He'd then form another chain of handseals as he slammed the palm of his hand down onto the ground, unleashing his clay from the mouth located on his hand, out of this mouth would spew clay, the clay taking the form of a large bird.

 Sachu would ride atop of this bird, traveling off in the night sky, in search of survivors of the attack that took place on the village. He'd ride atop of the large bird, in search of any signs of Human activity, he'd notice, a bright fire, a large mass of tents.

A smile would stretch across his face as his bird soared toward the ground. He'd leap off, explaining the situation to the ex-Suna shinobi. They were a little sketchy at first, but eventually, they began to accept the idea of returning to the village, about 230 in all. They'd all tread back through the desert, heading toward the re-vamped Sunagakure.

Upon arrival, the new squad system, housing quarters, and even academy were discussed. Soon, life was almost as it was before the attack on Sunagakure. The village seemed to almost be fully recovered, although their numbers were still low. The future of the Hidden Sand looked bright.

<br><font color=yellow>*Izuchi, Sachu(Keyarus1) wanders through the desert, a tear almost falling from his eye as he looks at a devestated Sunagakure, his old homeland. He'd look at the large craters formed from large explosions which launched dirt and rocks into the air. He'd look at the blood staining the sand, he'd even look at a devestated academy, what's left of it, a dusty, unkempt pile of rubble.

Sachu's eyes would begin to water as he looked toward the village. He'd form a chain of handseals, barely able to keep from crying he'd inhale deeply, channeling his chakra into his mouth in the form of clay. He'd poke out his chest some as he continued to inhale. 

He'd let out a deep sigh as he exhaled an enormous mass of clay, aimed first toward the village gate, forming over it, molding into the shape that the gate once possesed, He'd then leap atop the gigantic mass of clay, spitting out large spheres, molding into the shapes the houses once had. He'd then sigh as he said, "I'll need more clay to finish rebuilding the village...".


He'd then begin his chain of handseals again, kneading his Water natured chakra into the clay, for emegency uses, he'd then emmit a second barrage of large globs of clay which he used to repair the village's walls, homes, and even the Kazekage mansion. The Hidden Sand village was rebuilt, and in time, it will be restored to it's former glory.

Sachu would then let out a deep sigh as he said, "Hm...now...to search for survivors of this tragedy.". He'd then form another chain of handseals as he slammed the palm of his hand down onto the ground, unleashing his clay from the mouth located on his hand, out of this mouth would spew clay, the clay taking the form of a large bird.

 Sachu would ride atop of this bird, traveling off in the night sky, in search of survivors of the attack that took place on the village. He'd ride atop of the large bird, in search of any signs of Human activity, he'd notice, a bright fire, a large mass of tents.

A smile would stretch across his face as his bird soared toward the ground. He'd leap off, explaining the situation to the ex-Suna shinobi. They were a little sketchy at first, but eventually, they began to accept the idea of returning to the village, about 230 in all. They'd all tread back through the desert, heading toward the re-vamped Sunagakure.

Upon arrival, the new squad system, housing quarters, and even academy were discussed. Soon, life was almost as it was before the attack on Sunagakure. The village seemed to almost be fully recovered, although their numbers were still low. The future of the Hidden Sand looked bright.*
