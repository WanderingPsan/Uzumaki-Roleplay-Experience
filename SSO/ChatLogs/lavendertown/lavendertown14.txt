<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) just appeared. "Hi, where did you two lovebirds run off to last time?" he said giving a soft laugh, his senses keen on all three of them. He wanted to see if this brought a rise out of Ichiro, to gauge his interest in his own sister. Mizumi would place both hands on each hip as if waiting for them to answer. "Hmmm?"* - Wed Dec  2 05:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at the girl's odd form of clothing. "Hey Kariudo. Where did you get that comfy looking clothing?" he asked plucking at the collar of his soft blue polo.* - Wed Dec  2 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) internally shivvered at the sight of her mutated body, putting up a facade of normality to those around him. "Yeah but I've never seen that type of hood in the shops...at least not the ones I've been to.." he said kicking at the tufts of grass at his feet, his gaze still on the girl. "You must have gotten that special, maybe even shipped here through NinjaEx." he said nonchalantly as his hands went from being on his hips to being placed behind his back.

"So what have you all been up to? Hmm?" he asked completely bored out of his mind.* - Wed Dec  2 05:43:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had seemingly just appeared as if by magic, just like the several other times he had done this. He didn't know what the two were talking about, but he sure as heck didn't want to get in the middle. He stood idle, his gaze fixated on the vending machine while his senses remained attuned to his surroundings. "hmmm" he hummed softly.* - Wed Dec  2 19:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's eyes squinted as he tried to decipher what in the world that was. If it was anything related to Amegakure, he wouldn't know seeing as how for the past year, under the rule of Asteroth, there was no issuing or actual need of headbands or shinobi clothing. "Ugh...Okay...Headband? You think you're better than me?" he asked as if he had been insulted, but really hadn't.* - Wed Dec  2 19:43:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) continued to look at the boy, his right hand slowly crawling up towards his hair before submerging itself in the blackness. "My problem is......I lost my kunai....Do you have one I can have?" he asked giving a polite smile to the boy.* - Wed Dec  2 19:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) watched Ichiro readying to strike, something that seemed off-character, at least in Mizumi's eyes. Forming a single handseal, a jet of water flew from his mouth towards the defenseless girl. Its speed more than likely quicker than the throw of the spear, hopefully making up for the distance he was to her. If successful, she would be pushed away from the toss, possibly allowing the weapon to only graze her rather than pierce her head.* - Wed Dec  2 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) allowed his senses to open, his mind's eye revealing his surroundings.* - Wed Dec  2 23:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Had already felt the boy's presence miles away. "Right. I can sense you are Trilliam. It's a pleasure to meet you." he said a smile on his face. "I hope I didn't take you away from something important." he said appologetically.

"I have just been looking for someone who is a true master of their element."* - Wed Dec  2 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a small chuckle. "I can't do any lightning style techniques...haha" he said his hands extending out a bit showing that no electricty could be formed. "That's why I needed a skilled shinobi."* - Wed Dec  2 23:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) extended his hands outwards, expecting his chakra to flow along with him. It seemed to spread evenly throughout his body. He attempted to tap into the element of lightning but to no avail. There were no sparks, there were no electrical current. "Right...I'm terrible." he said, realizing he couldn't perform the most basic of attacks.* - Wed Dec  2 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmmm. - Wed Dec  2 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) willingly takes the paper, holding it flat on his hand. He allowed some of his chakra to pour into the paper causing the paper to react. One corner of the paper caught on fire, another corner turned damp and wet. Another corner began to wrinkle up while the last corner turned to dust. 

"huh...What does that mean..." he muttered allowing the paper to fall out of his hand and into the water.* - Wed Dec  2 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Maybe...if you had the jutsu in a scroll. - Wed Dec  2 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) took in the man's wisdom before catching the scroll. "Oh I never knew that." he stated, giving the man a smile. "I'll try and learn and train on this. Do...Do you have anything I could train after this? Just in case we can't meet frequently?:"* - Wed Dec  2 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) took the scroll and nodded. "Right. Will do." he said before starting to turn around. "Although....here. Until we meet again." he said, pulling out a small pouch with a small amount of money. "Here."* - Thu Dec  3 00:01:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) closed his eyes for a bit, enough to let his mind flood the area. "He...He is down south..." he said, the words flowing through his lips. "I can take you to him."* - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: So he's still in the village? - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Correct. - Thu Dec  3 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Alright. - Thu Dec  3 00:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Right, alone, follow me. - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Yo. - Thu Dec  3 00:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Seen Shiro? - Thu Dec  3 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: No. - Thu Dec  3 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: So...what is there to do? - Thu Dec  3 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Stuff. - Thu Dec  3 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Well... - Thu Dec  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I was going to train... - Thu Dec  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: I need to acquire a sturdier stance. - Thu Dec  3 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) pulled out a scroll from within his robes, unraveling the string that seemed to hold it in place. As he pulled the scroll open, he began to read the information that had been scibbled onto the parchment.

"Train? Yeah lets train...I haven't done that in forever.." he stated looking back down at the sheet of paper, memorizing the instructions on how to perform the technique.* - Thu Dec  3 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Hm... - Thu Dec  3 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Here. - Thu Dec  3 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: If you've got anything that can help me train my balance. - Thu Dec  3 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: That'd be useful. - Thu Dec  3 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Nothing I can think of. Maybe Mizumi, since I'm sure he trained with Tethys, or Hassan, or one of the other Kiri shinobi back then. - Thu Dec  3 00:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Well, I should train too. I can't let you two leave me in the dust. - Thu Dec  3 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Balance....balance... - Thu Dec  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: balance..... - Thu Dec  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Why don't you break a tree down, and try to walk across the trunk? - Thu Dec  3 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: That doesn't sound so bad. - Thu Dec  3 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) formed a few handseals before concluding the required chain of three. His mouth opened slightly allowing a small blast of fire to be sent towards a neighboring tree. The trunk was lit, the fires crackling and weakening its structural integrity. "Ugh...You can punch that or...you know....I don't want to tell u what to do with your life so..."* - Thu Dec  3 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) While the tree remained on fire, he put away the scroll he had been reading, seeing as how he had already learned the contents. He now brought out a second scroll, unravelling it and reading its contents. "Don't let the forest burn okay?" he mentioned as he began to focus on reading the scroll he had in his hands. *Unusual technique indeed....* he thought as he began to memorize what was required.* - Thu Dec  3 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Thu Dec  3 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: Leg strength and balance...This is what I need. - Thu Dec  3 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) wasted no time, his eyes plastered onto the scroll he held. His eyes investigating the detail of each word. "So you ju-....and then....seems about right." he muttered, his body allowing his chakra to flow through his frame. Within no time, he was ready to perform the technique, at least at a basic level of understanding.* - Thu Dec  3 01:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: What assholes, and Mizumi said I wouldn't see him for a few days. - Thu Dec  3 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked over towards Ichiro's attempts at balancing along the wooden beam. "Surprise test!" he shouted before spitting out a single needle made of water from his mouth. It flew across the sky, aimed at Ichiro's left foot. If hit successfully, who knows what would happen to his balance; if he did get hit, it would feel as if someone punched him.* - Thu Dec  3 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: My business ended rather prematurely.... - Thu Dec  3 02:22:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) zips his pants back up.* - Thu Dec  3 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had been spying on the duo when suddenly, the girl crashed into the tree he was hiding in. Unable to grab onto a branch fast enough, he flopped down, landing onto the girl, that is if she didn't move out of the way in time.* - Thu Dec  3 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: What is on top of me? - Thu Dec  3 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Did I knock the tree over ontop of myself? - Thu Dec  3 04:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would be lifted up off of the defenseless girl by the gentle giant, Kida, a pool of drool having managed to escape his mouth in time to possibly land onto the girl. If she hadn't turned away in time, the drool would surely land on her face.* - Thu Dec  3 05:07:37 2015
