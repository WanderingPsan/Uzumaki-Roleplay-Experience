<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) shrugged slightly, lifting his hands upwards in the typical fashion of someone who says, "I don't know"  This was a farse as when his hands began to lower, they quickly took the shape of guns quickly channeling chakra to the tips of his fingers. He released a small ball of fire from his right hand before releasing another ball of fire from his left hand in near unison, aimed at the back of the boy. If the attack was a success, the boy would be smacked by heat and more than likely singed if he wasn't defensive enough.* - Tue Oct 20 05:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) was quickly pushed back before watching Kuro perform a spin, releasing a swirling shield of chakra. *oOoOOOoOo* he thought quickly comparing it to his own technique. *He stole my technique! He stole it! I'm telling the getzo.* he thought as he furrowed his eyebrows behind his mask. 

"I just want to hug him...Look at him! He's so adorable it's unbearable! Let me hugggg him! PLEASE!" he shouted at the end, extending his arms out, hands wide open. His hands would close and open several times like a child would do.* - Tue Oct 20 05:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) turned, looking at his new partner. Bowing towards the fair lady before disappearing towards whichever direction Ichiro had gone to.* - Thu Oct 22 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) stayed a bit behind his new partner, not really sure where they were suppose to go; it was a new place for him only having been through these forests when he left Kirigakure long ago. The small holes on his mask allowed his vision to focus on him without fail as they traversed the forest. "Do you know where you're going?" he asked, desiring not to be lost.

As he watched the several leaves and trees pass him by with each forward leap, he began to get bored and more bored. *This is taking too long..* he thought, pulling out a candybar from his pocket. It was a bit melted, squishy to the touch, but he peeled the wrapper and devoured it nonetheless. "Are we there yet?" he asked, as a chain of questions began to bombard Ichiro. They were all the same question, ' Are we there yet' and he asked frequently.

As they arrived at the sea-port village, he noticed its rather scenic view. Rushing towards a nearby cliff, ignoring Ichiro almost completely, he gazed out into the distance. The ocean seemed a deep blue, the sun shining down just right. *Woah, wish I had a camera, would snap this bitch up good..* he thought turning back towards his partner. He was the carrier of the scroll, that was apparent.

As he returned to Ichiro's side, he stood quietly, waiting for him to lead the duo towards the desired location, or the drop-off zone. He wasn't sure if Ichiro even knew where we needed to deliver the scroll to, prompting Zero to begin asking the rather pleasant villagers if they knew something. The conversation was rather short, Zero ignoring or shutting people up before they could even give an answer.

Taking a closer look at the village, one could notice that there were several bushes and plants located in patches, almost like a farm. They were producing some time of herb or drug; but Zero didn't really care or have any urge to find out. Because of this, he pulled out another chocolate bar, peeling off its cold foil before causing it to disappear. 

Deciding to explore more of the village while Ichiro handled more serious matters, he ventured off towards who knows where. It seemed to be a rather small Quarry, the several piles of rock and rubble amptly there. Looking closer, it could be seen that they appeared to harbor a few shimmering stones. As he got closer, he pulled out a kunai before checking to see if anyone was watching.

Once he knew he was in the clear, he stabbed his kunai into the stone, plopping out a few precious stones the size of a Peach Pit. He managed to pluck out what appeared to be a diamond, a sapphire, and a ruby, before putting away his kunai. He thought he had heard someone, but it was nothing.

Making his way back towards Ichiro, he waited for him to give the scroll over to the man so they can get home.* - Thu Oct 22 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) approached slowly towards the duo, waiting to be noticed, or rather addressed. His hands were behind his pack, but his body was steadily, yet slowly, moving around regardless of how still he wanted to be. He was fighting every urge he had to remain still.

It had been quite a long time since he had been given missions.* - Fri Oct 23 21:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) seemed to be partnered up with Ichiro again, something about the boy seemed to calm him down from his rather over-energetic personality. From behind the mask, his crystal blue eyes stared at his partner's back, trying to figure out why he seemed to be affecting him so. He didn't want to ask, no never ask, simply remaining silent as they left the village.

The forest seemed rather peacful, the lack of rogues roaming this land making it a lot easier to travel than before. The bright red leaves nearly blinding his gaze as he tried to take in the beauty around him. It could possibly just be the village itself that has caused him to calm down. *Interesting...Very interesting...Yeah...* he thought, as he switched his attention constantly from Ichiro to the fallen leaves on the ground, making a game out of finding out how many leaves he could step on in a row.

As they followed the trail that was drawn on the map, the dirt road seemed to spiral, turn, and seemed to never end. To Zero's surprise, he could hear the faintness of running water, indicating that they were close to some form of water source. This water source would most likely harbor the saw mill they were going to go save. *I wonder what the worker did....was he touching himself inappropriately?* he thought.

As the duo broke out of the forest, they were immediately swarmed with the sight of the saw mill. It was rather big, althought Zero had never seen a saw mill in person before. It looked like one that you would see in Skyrim....Anyways....Along the sides of the mill, near the water, were grand stacks of who knows how many logs that were ready for shipping. It was clear that the mill was rather successful in its trade, having several trees and an entire forest nearby to cut down.

Making a promise to himself, Zero quickly rid himself of any pyrotechnique ideas or thoughts of arsen. Depicting this by shaking his head randomly without making any sound. His vision was on fleek, meaning he could see most if not all the damage and chaos caused by the worker. It didn't look good at all. *Messy Messy....* he thought as they approached even closer, now being a few feet from the mill.

There they met the captain of the mill, in which Zero paid little to no attention to his greeting. Unable to remember his greeting, Zero named the captain himself, giving him the name Tim. Tim seemed slightly annoyed, having wished that the duo had arrived earlier and with more shinobi to do this job. Other than his look of annoyance, Zero remembered absolutely nothing about him.

Zero made his way towards the location of the trouble, noticing that the saw seemed jammed. Reaching the edge of the water, he formed a single seal causing the water in front of him to bubble and rise quickly. The water churned and twisted, eventually taking the shape of a humanoid creature before taking on the appearance of Zero.  He had successfully created about fifteen clones made entirely of water. "Alrighty army of me....Lets do this...Do....Do stuff okay?" he somewhat commanded them as they all rushed out of the water.

Zero himself, was rather weak when it came to physical strength causing his water clones to share that quality, although a bit more exaggerated. Taking about all fifteen to lift a single log, the clones took their time pulling and extracting half chopped logs and the like. Zero didn't really know what Ichiro was going to do, or how he was going to help. 

With the help of Ichiro and the clones, the jam and the logs would most likely be removed and fixed. The saw Mill would surely be able to restart their process allowing for the cutting of more logs. Once all that jam was finished, he would release every clone he had created causing the saw mjill to become slightly moistened by this. With that, Zero waved to the sea, the mill, and even Tim.

The duo would then return to the forest, making their way through the winding path. Taking about the same amount of time as it took to get to the mill. On the way back, Zero didn't even try to play any games or even speak with Ichiro, he was just that tired. Luckily he remembered they were going on another mission, taking a chocolate bar out of his pocket to regain some strength.* - Fri Oct 23 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) remembered that they were going on a second part of the mission. This time, they were going after some type of Rhino that had some importance to them or a major figure. Never having seen a rhino in person, he was rather excited to finally see one in the flesh. *Pictures probably dont do them justice...right? Right!* he thought.

They made their way deeper into the woods, making their distance from the village even larger. They continued to walk for almost a few hours without anything happening. It was apparent to the two that this forest was empty or at least void of rhinos.

Just as Zero was starting to get frustrated with this, on the verge of quitting the mission, it happened. A slight roar, if anything, could be heard from the edge of the woods. *Could it be, the fields, yes? fields?* he thought quickly rushing over in that direction. It took him a few minutes due to the need to dodge trees and the like.

As he reached the boarder of the forest and grassy field that was connected, he couldn't see anything in sight. It seemed he either imagined the sound of the beast they were hunting...I mean searching for, or it had escaped his grasp. Turning back into the woods, he thought of several things that could help with gaining the location of the beast.

As he looked around the ground, noticing the soil beneath their feet. As he scanned the floor of the woods, he took notice of an unusual footprint in the soil. *It has to be the Rhino, right, right? Right? Right..* he convinced himself as she measured the size of the footprint with his own foot and even his hand just to see the difference. It was most definitely the Rhino, and it was more than likely going to lead the duo to the beast.

Motioning over towards Ichiro, he would indicate that there were footprints and that they should follow it. Along with the footprints, Zero's ability to observe his surroundings allowed him to notice damaged tree trunks. These damages might have occurred because of a rampaging rhino. The path they were following led them quite a few yards from their original location.

As they reached a sort of glade, or who knows what it was really called, they would both be able to notice a rather majestic looking rhino, its dry skin giving it an ancient appearance. Zero pointed towards the creature. "There Ichiro, there there, get it please, yeah.." he stated/commanded his partner, unsure of how to deal with the creature.

All Zero knew was that they had to bring it back safe and sound, meaning he couldn't just burn it alive or something. Mentally shifting through his arsenal of jutsus, trying to determine which jutsu would have the least lethal capabilities to capture this rhino. Finally determining which jutsu to use.

The duo began to plan, deciding to attack it from opposite sides to narrow down the creature's escape route. As he made his way, the Rhino seemed to distracted by the bush he was having a meal of. It's rather ripe berries a delicious treat for any who decided to feast on them. As the Rhino remained unaware of his surroundings, Zero formed three handseals.

The water nature chakra began to mold itself inside his body, as he channeled a significant amount of chakra into his technique. He opened his mouth releasing a large amount of slimey fluids towards the Rhino's direction as well as towards its sides. The liquid splashed onto the ground, quickly spreading onto the grassy field of the glade. 

If the plan was a success, the rhino would be scared by Ichiro or whatever he did, causing it to run. By running, it would more than likely step onto the slimey, and now sticky liquid Zero had produced. It should have been strong enough to contain the creature making its mobility null and void. It roared or whatever sound it made several times as it paniced from being unable to move.

Eventually calming down, the Rhino slowly began to grow angry or at least Zero thought, he can't read animal minds. Ichiro would then do whatever he did, probably something physical...he seemed like a tough individual. Well, anyways, Ichiro would more than likely do something to knock the creature cold orpossibly tame it...I don't know his life...lets say he tamed it.

After having tamed it, Zero used a basic water technique to wash away the slime that caused the creature to be held in place. WIthout trying to run, it let Ichiro climb on top of it. as if it was its new master. With that, they decided to head back to the village.

They made their way onto the forest, Zero eventually climbing onto the rhino as well because he was just too tired to walk back. They had fun, crashing into trees and the lot, nearly knocking down a few of them because of how hard they crashed into it.

With that, they finally arived at the village, handing over the rhino to whomever was going to be in charge of it. Giving Ichiro a high-five and everything, they went back to inform the queen that they finally finished their missions.* - Fri Oct 23 23:28:51 2015
