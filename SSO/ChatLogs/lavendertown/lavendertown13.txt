<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Mizumi arrived at his meditative glade, one he seemed to frequent more fluidly in recent days. He lowered his body to the soft sand that wrapped itself around the river, a protective layer of land to separate the wilderness from the stream. His body slowly moving its way, nearly crawling on the sand, as it entered th water's chilling embrace. The water reached up to his waist, readying himself for his upcomming training. As he sat waist deep in the water, he gave a quick look around at his surroundings before closing both eyes, allowing his sensory abilities to keep him alerted. As he did this, he allowed his chakra to flow freely through his body, seeping into the surrounding water at the speed of syrup.

He could feel the flowing river carry his chakra without a care in the world; his sensory ability painting the water in his mind. He had done his best to clear all negativity from his mind, having been told that doing so would help in any form of training. His body continued to allow the flow of chakra to become released from his body, infusing itself with the water nearby.

He had seen the powers the other 'Hogo' had; his ability to control water with simple movements both fascinated Mizumi, and terrified him. How could such a being exist? Mizumi had trained for all his life, but that 'Hogo' simply acuired this power as if gifted to from the Sea's God himself. He remembered vividly the moment when the Hogo had taken control of Mizumi's own water, realizing that the trick had to be the infusement of one's own chakra into the element. His near mastery of the element would surely allow him to perform the same.

Once Mizumi had sufficient amount of chakra infused with the water nearby, he began to meditate even more deeply than he had been doing. His mind went dark, pitch black from the clearing. A small ball of blue could be seen in his mind, a solid blue circle that seemed to have no constant shape; its figure twisting and turning every which way before returning to its circular form. As he sat in the water, he visualized this blob, this circle, to be his chakra infused with water; its fluidness being manipulated by said chakra.

His mental image began to expand, reaching every crevice of his mind. The small blob of shifting water had transformed into a flowing river. His mind trying to shape and form the water to its will. His head slowly becomming more and more stressed as he did this, focusing his mind and body into trying to manipulate the substance in mind. Although all the shaping and forming seemed to be occuring in his mind, the water he was submerged in remained stagnent; except for the normal flowing that occured.

6
The chakra infused river flowed regularly as Mizumi struggled to shape the water within the confines of his mind. Nearly overwhelmed with the struggle to maintain control over the mental picture of the water, he quickly released all control he had upon the mental water structure before relaxing both his body and mind. His body relaxed, sinking deeper into the water inch by inch. His eyes opened to see the open river flowing normally, believing he had manipulated it with ease. His Mind's Eye allowing him to still see his stagnant chakra sitting in the water, half mixed.

Half exhausted, he decided to try a different approach, allowing all of his body to enter the chilled stream. His body floating along the surface, his chakra surrounding him in the water, nearly disappearing amongst the river. He stared up at the sky, it's blueness a reflection of the river; his eyes glancing in every direction to indicate if he was going to crash into the riverbed. Once relaxed to the fullest, he allowed more of his chakra to gradually seep into the water. It followed him, his chakra that is, along the river as he continued to float. The peacefullness of this action keeping him calm and in control.

He took in a few deep breaths as he continued to flow along with the river, releasing them gradually as his body became accustomed to the cold. He began to picture the water in his mind once more, this time with his eyes opened. He could see the image clearly in his mind, his thoughts slowly commanding the water in his picture to rise. It promptly did so, although nothing was happening around him.

The chakra infused water surrounding him would shift slightly, Mizumi's thoughts barely able to cause a shift. Although, he wouldn't know he was doing that seeing as how the river was flowing and it looked like the normal flow it would have. Feeling as if he wasn't accomplishing the task at hand, he would drift off into a light sleep, allowing the water to carry him about; his constant sensing capability allowing him to survey the water.

After about an hour of drifting aimlessly, Mizumi's eyes opened wide awake to see the same surroundings. He hadn't drifted far, seeing as how he was already at the more still end of the river, where it opened up to a small lake or pond. Feeling as if this would be a more basic place to start in his manipulative endeavors. Feeling his chakra reserves to be sufficient, Mizumi began to quickly pour his chakra into the surrounding stagnant water. Within minutes, a good portion of the still pond was infused with his own chakra. Brow furrowed and determination in his eyes, he placed his hands together, allowing his body to stand up in the water; the water rising up to his stomach.

11
Mizumi was determined on performing this art of manipulation even if it cost him most of his chakra. His hands rose through the slightly thicker water until it reached the surface; the backs of his hands barely breaching the barrier. He concentrated, his mind on the prize, that being the water around him.The water itself was still motionless, his body sitting in its presence. As he focused on controlling the chakra he had released into the water, he could make out a wave or two being formed here and there; impossible otherwise due to how the current of the stream worked.

It was the first sign, apparent to him, that he was actually in some way controlling the water around him. "This...this is incrtedibly...this feeling....This odd feeling.." he muttered to himself, as he pulled his arms out of the water. As water trickled down his forearm, forming droplets off his elbows, he spread out his fingers as much as possible. His mind went into overdrive trying to reproduce the same effect he had just seen; his hands trembling as his control over the chakra infused water slowly began to cement itself.

He began to furiously think about the rising water, his eyes almost bulging out from his sockets. As if staring at the water would cause it to levitate. He could feel his chakra quickly escaping his body as he continued to pressure himself mentally, pushing himself to his very limits. As he did this, the surface of the water began to tremble, small globs of water bouncing off the surface of the Element.After a few moments of intense concentration, a little bit more water began to rise; bouncing off the surface of the source. 

Nearly passing out from exhaustion, once more, he collapsed back into the water allowing himself to float in peace. He was alone and away from anyone in the village that might bother or hinder his training. After several hours of resting and meditating to replenish and expand his chakra reserves, he was ready to head back to training. As he approached the stagnant pond, he allowed his Mind's Eye to search several yards around him to make sure he was alone. Realizing he was deserted, he placed his hands onto the surface of the water, while kneeling on the edge of the pond. His chakra quickly released into the water, as if he had done this several times before. Once enough chakra was ejected into the pond, he stepped back, standing upright on the sandy beach. His hands jetted out in front of his chest as he began to concentrate his chakra and focus onto the water at hand. 

The water began to bubble slightly, his chakra being the reason for its odd action. As he slowly lifted his right hand upwards, the water  would mimic his actions, rising slowly from the pond appearing like veins sprouting out from the pond. He continued with this practice, using his chakra to manipulate the natural water of the world; able to successfully control the water of the pond for a few seconds at a time, eventually becomming a few minutes. His ability to control the water grew quicker and quicker, as if natural to him; all the while he thought about the other 'Hogo' and how he would soon be on his level.

16
Now understanding that it is rather hard to manipulate natural water seeing as how you needed to infuse it with chakra first before controlling it, Mizumi decided to go a different route for the time being. He distanced himself from the pond, going a little be further into the forest that surrounded his village. He formed a simple handseal releasing a small stream of water from his mouth, causing the grassy terrain to become soggy with a thick layer of water. Seeing as how this jutsu was already infused with his chakra, he hoped to be able to control it much easier.

As the water remained still on the grassy terrain, Mizumi extended both hands out, his mind focusing intently on the shimmering fluids. His hands began to tremble slightly as he began to think up a mental picture of his water technique being controlled as he hoped he could do. Just then, the water produced from his basic watergun technique began to move along the surface of the field. It seemed he was able to control its lateral movements, causing the fluid to move to every direction without lifting off the ground. It was an amazing feat for him to witness; a reassurance that he was moving forward with this supposed training.

He could almost feel the water in his hands, using this feeling and instinct to wade the water to and fro. As he tried to lift his hands upwards, like last time, he would notice that the completely, chakra infused water would rise almost immediately. It was still rising at a rather sluggish speed, but that could be seen as Mizumi needing to train his control a bit more. As of now, most of the water technique, seeing as how he didn't release much of it, would be floating amongst the trees of the forest.

He knew he was able to manipulate the water, this example a testiment to his new found skill. As he focused on maintaining hold over the floating water, he would slowly move his hands about shifting the fluid to his will. This was just the beginning, as he began to perform small movements and gestures with both hands, causing the water to transform and swirl about. Mizumi was able to mold the water into different shapes, primarily circles, squares, and triangles. He wanted to be completely sure of himself and his skill with this manipulation. The other Hogo was far more skilled, being able to control a larger more significant amount.

Entertained by this moderate amount of floating water, he began to pull it around the forest. It had been the absolute longest amount of time while controlling the substance he desired to master. As he walked about the forest, his hand motions causing the water to float along, extending and contracting its body like a catipillar; using these movements to inch about the air. He made his way to the pond once more, staring into the shimmering reflection of himself at the base of the water. *How majestic...* he said softly, releasing a sigh of satisfaction and peace. The water he brought about, clumsily floating along until it hovered above the water of the pond. Extending both arms out, each hand had its finers spread as far as possible, as if this act would better focus his mind. He began to think, clearing his mind of the negativity that seemed to surface every few hours. This cleansing of the mind allowed him to better think; giving the mental command to release, the water that hovered over the lake ran rampant as it fell towards the pond, becoming one with the body.

21

After several days have passed, Mizumi training vigorously each of those days, he was finally able to control the water to a higher extent. He no long struggled to lift and move small amounts of water, his mind and body focused on the task at hand. Performing the seal of confrontation, the water of the everstill pond quickly rose, engulfing the surrounding area in mist. He knew the other Hogo was capable of performing water jutsus without handseals, but at this state he didn't want to try that. He didn't want to face a failure in his strings of victory and accomplishment. 

As the mist continued to crawl along the sandy beach that was present, he could feel his chakra in the moisture. Opening his hands caused an immediate reaction as the mist quickly pushed itself away from the palms of his hands. Realizing, and having taken his brief breaks of time without training to dedicte himself to research about this topic, he learned about a small clan on the outskirts of Kirigakure who would perform fluid movements that would command the element abundant in that village. Sighing with relief, his arms remained outstretched, his palms bent, he would mentally prepare for the rythmic motions he was about to perform.

Ready, Mizumi would begin to slowly sway his arms and hands left to right. Their movements almost identical to the flow of water. To those knowledgable, it would appear to be a form of Tai Chi fighting, but to Mizumi it was just a way to better control the water around him. With each sway of his arms he performed, he could see the mist moving, jolting in every direction he swayed his arms to. He quickly smiled, grinning ear to ear, at his realization that this technique would be able to further his advances. This was the first time he smiled like that in a very long time, not since he was adopted by his late father, Tethys.

Mizumi contninued on this path of swaying his arms as if almost dancing in place. The mist also danced, moving from left to right with each swing and glide of his arms. He began to change it up, moving his arms in different directions whilst still maintaining his calm and tranquil speed. These movements made the mist dance even more, large masses of the moisture grouping up and moving together as if whole. It might have been that this technique was basic in nature, or that the chakra spread out evenly amongst the moisture ridden air that made this technique so easy to manipulate.

This time, he decided to move his arms around in a circular motion, as if orbiting a central sphere. The mist followed, swirling and flowing in the air. The misty area quickly drew itself in causing the mist to subside, but creating a sphere of water at the center. All of the moisture that made up the composition of the mist had combined and formed a sphere of water made up entirely of the mist's substance and chakra. As he continued his spherical movements, the sphere of water itself would begin to spin mid-air like a planet.


26

Desiring to try a different jutsu with his new technique, he quickly motioned with his hands several gestures. The sphere obeyed, quickly launching itself into the pond dissolving into the body of water. He glanced at the pond, his eyes shimmering from the light that was reflected off the surface of the water. "Should I try controlling natural water again?" he asked himself quickly responding with a soft shake of the head. He planted his hands together, forming a single handseal. Charging up chakra within his body before spewing out a large quanitity of water that quickly crashed against the the ground causing him to rise above the wave that began to form. He quickly released, not wanting to create an ocean, but rather a single large wave to see if he could control it.

As the wave rose just a bit more, he began to sway both arms about in an attempt to control the massive amounts of water he had summoned from his gullet. To no avail, the water remained flowing as normal, as the mental picture of the entire wave was focused and implanted in his mind. As the wave, and Mizumi, traversed the forest, knocking down smaller trees, he would continue to fail, unable to make a single dent or budge in the water.

Panicing, he stopped his swaying arms, going back to his original tactics. His arms stretched out in front of his chest, hands trying to focus on the now descending wave. Nothing seemed to happen, prompting him to figure out an escape plan of sorts that would allow him to jump off this wave unscathed. That's when he saw an incomming tree. Mentally calculating the timing of the jump, he lept off the wave, landing roughy on an extnded branch. Climbing his way down, forgetting about the wave that seemed to gradually come to and end. As he finally reached the ground, he began to contemplate everything that could have gone wrong and why it did go wrong.

Mizumi had come to the conclusion that he wasn't able to control such large masses of water at this current time. The sheer size of the wave was too large for anyone to control, especially someone who had barely begun to train in this precise art. Deducing that he had to stick with small portions of water really angered him, desiring more for himself than currently available.He sighed, returning to the pond where he basically now lived due to this training. 

As he reached the water, he believed he had learned enough from his previous attempts to take a shot at natural water once more. He knew not to get his hopes up, not wanting to feel the heavy weight of disappointment that loomed over this training. He stepped into the water, the chilling liquid standing at his ankles. Like the Suimen technique, he allowed chakra to flow to his feet before being released into the water. He tried closing his eyes, thinking meditative thoughts as his breathing slowed down synchronizing with the sound of the water. Once enough chakra was distributed into the pond, he prepared his arms in the fashion he had learned.

Once he felt enough of his chakra was infused with the water, he began his dance-like technique. He would bend his elbows, bringing his arms and hands in and downwards before stopping. As he did this, he would then push, extending his arms outwards as well as his hands. He would repeat this, at a steady pace; the water slowly moving back and forth with his movements. His eyes perked up, his mouth formed into a smile as he realized he was able to control the water. He continued with his pushing and pulling method, increasing the speed every few minutes. The water was reacting splendidly as the still pond had transformed into a rocking tide-pool.

The rocking waves that formed seemed almost out of control, prompting Mizumi to quickly change the pace at which he was pulling and pushing. This change in pace caused the waves to slow down enough to where they didn't look violent in nature. He paused his pulling and pushing, instead now slowly extending one arm and to the side, switching arms with each iteration. The water followed as the pond slowly grew two small whirlpool like structures.

Filled with pleasure, he released his mental grip on the pond allowing it to crash back down, settling back into its stagnant nature. He stepped out of the water, allowing his chakra to be sent to his feet. As he stepped out onto the pond, he began to mentally prepare himself, as well as to calm down his excited state. Being several feet into the water, he stood completely still as his mind tried to grasp control of the water once more. "Oh pond...I command your waters, protect me, shield me....Sacred Art: Mizu Hogo!" he shouted as water from the pond burst up. The water swirled and spiraled as it rapidly rushed towards the air above Mizumi. Once completely connected, the water continued to spiral in a sphere of protection around him.

As the sphere continued to spiral around him, he was speechless by how amazing this felt. He had been able to perform the technique without forming a single handseal. * I shall surely pass that Hogo in months time.* he thought as the water began to lower itself back to pond. He could feel the strain of expelling a significant amount of chakra, but continued onwards. He cleared his head once more, focusing his mind on the water around him. "Water clone...Jutsu!" he shouted, the water in front of him beginning to bubble at his command.

After the bubbling, the water would rise immediately to about the same height as Mizumi. The water shifted and turned, shaping and molding itself into Mizumi's image. Within seconds, the water had successfully formed a complete water clone. It was perfect in every way, as if someone had performed the technique with handseals and of their own water. Satisfied with this quality, he dispelled the clone, turning back to face the land. Extending his arms wide to his east and west sides, as if asking for a hug, the water would begin to move beneath him.

The bubbling and churning water quickly began bringing him closer to the sandy beach. He was no long walking on the water, but instead the water was carrying him back to land, which only took a few minutes because of his level of training. As he stepped back onto land, he was happy with the progress he had made and therefore decided to head back to his village. He felt as if he would be able to better help his queen and best friends.* - Fri Nov 13 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) sat atop the floor of his small room, sighing with disdain as his body felt the weight of all the hard work he did. His body ached and mind near fried. "So much work....I hope...I hope it pays off..." he said trying to lean against the bed frame.* - Sat Nov 14 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) felt a lot better than before, allowing his body to continue resting, inching his limbs into a meditative stance. He tried to clear his mind as best he could to allow it to be less stressed and begin the process of mental healing. Although he was working on this, the moment he began to clear his mind, his mind's eye opened allowing him to sense his surroundings. *I can sense the villagers....* he thought keeping his eyes closed.* - Sat Nov 14 02:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Could sense someone or at least a group of people that shouldn't be there. Forming a single handseal, a shadow clone would be spawned in the room. "Go check it out...don't get followed.." he commanded as the clone departed from the room.* - Sat Nov 14 02:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why are all the men Ortho knows attractive, maybe he's hiding something. - Sat Nov 14 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Oh...Okay....He forgot all about m-....wait...did he see me with the mask? I don't remember anymore...ugh..... - Sat Nov 14 03:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) slowly allowed his left hand to rise up, reaching to about his left shoulder in height. Slowly, he would begin to shake his hand, as if waving in the most awkward way possible; all the while allowing his senses to take in his surroundings.

"Hi, we have met....You showed me around your village..thing...place...What brings you to the royal kingdom? Did your village turn out to be bor-" he stopped, looking over towards the girl standing rather close to Ortho, her presence appealing to the eye. He then glanced over to the apparent boy across from her. "Are these friends?"* - Sat Nov 14 03:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ...that explains their attractiveness. - Sat Nov 14 03:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: They are all awkward. - Sat Nov 14 03:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Yeah, most of the work was this guy behind me. - Sat Nov 14 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) continued to look between the three individuals, immediately stopping at the unknown boy. "Oh!" he nearly shrieked, rushing over to him. "Is that what I think it is!?" he questioned in regards to the musical instrument he carried. " -is- that a back scratcher with built in wire scratchers?" he asked excited by the object he proudly carried. "Can I see it? I have an itch....it would only take a second okay?"* - Sat Nov 14 03:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: I hope its an instrument used to alleviate itches.... - Sat Nov 14 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: This kid may as well be mentally brain dead. - Sat Nov 14 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Huh buddy? - Sat Nov 14 03:25:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Does he not know what kind of instrument it is? - Sat Nov 14 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) turned towards Ortho. "Hey, your friend doesn't know what kind of instrument he has. I think he might be dumb." he stated looking over to the girl this time. "Thank you kindly," he said politely.  In his attempt at winking, he would instead aggressively blink with both eyes, concluding by turning to Hatsujin. "Yeah see, she knows it's not for scratching backs. You could have said that."* - Sat Nov 14 03:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) thinks: None of this is in my job description... - Sat Nov 14 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would lean in a bit, trying to get a better look at the instrument he was about to play for him. as the cord was struck, chakra became visible to him in a colorful display much like a wave. *That's beautiful...sound-wise and color...* he thought as he watched the cords of his guitar fly at him, wrapping him in every which way possible. He tried to move, struggling behind the wires that constricted his movements. The sound seemed to go deeper into his mind causing him to become off-balanced, dizzy to be exact. He was still able to sense what was going around, sense his unstable flow of chakra. *Oh...* he thought, trying his best stay upright. "Hey....Good thing....I....haven't eaten..." he muttered, seeing the village spin around him.* - Sat Nov 14 03:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: This isn't helping the itch. - Sat Nov 14 03:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: What's the point in genjutsu if he can't finish someone off? - Sat Nov 14 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Mizumi. - Sat Nov 14 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Does my job apply to this? - Sat Nov 14 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) couldn't move and the dizziness continued to plague his mind. *My chakra flow is similar to someon- Did he say slit?* he thought as he closed his eyes for a second. In doing so, he allowed his body to stop and then restart the flow of chakra in an attempt to break out of the Genjutsu he could see. If successful, he would turn to Ortho, still a bit dizzy, seeing a few false images of him. "Hey...Why are you being mean.?" he asked, nearly collapsing to the ground. "No Ichiro, my best friend."* - Sat Nov 14 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: Good. - Sat Nov 14 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Wonder if he'll actually do it... too bad, that weirdo guy is handsome. - Sat Nov 14 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Oh..Didn't work...Ohwell. - Sat Nov 14 04:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) could feel the binds of the genjutsu wearing off, but alas it was too late. He was grabbed quickly by the man who had trapped him. He could see his life flash before his eyes, that time he was at the lake...the time he was at the river....the time he entered the village and then Ortho tried killing him; it was all there in black and white. He could have ended it himself, but he doesn't like jumping the gun on certain things. As he waited for the blade to be plunged into his throat, he realized it was taking a rather long time. Without opening his eyes, he would say. "Come on already...You're so slow..." 

Upon opening his eyes, he would notice that snakes seemed to be coiled up around the boy, preventing him from ending him. Realizing he wasn't bound anymore, and the dizziness all but subsided, he side-stepped a little bit before dusting himself off.

"Knew it. Weak," he stated, only saying so to make the boy angered.* - Sat Nov 14 04:14:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: Your guitar okay? - Sat Nov 14 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'd make a statement about music being my job. . .but she'd retort with 'Must not be very good at it then' or the such. . .I'll simply remain quiet. - Sat Nov 14 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. - Sat Nov 14 04:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) placed his hand on one of the snakes that constricted Hatsujin, petting it. "Pretty....You should have summoned that big one like you did in Kirigakure, Ortho..I like the bi- wait,....Did you lose it?"* - Sat Nov 14 04:29:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) stepped out towards the edge of the water that surrounded the temple. It was a small temple of course, and this small moat helped keep away most animals. As he stood in front of the timid waters, as a single thought crawled its way into his mind, the water slowly rose, shimmering with every ray of light that passed through it. He slowly lifted his hand, allowing the water the react to his gesture. It thinned itself out, configuring its structure even more.* - Mon Nov 16 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Picked the lock on the door rather easily before quickly bursting in. "Hey Ortho, I can sense someone at the entrance to the village.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Could sense little to no life apart from the guards and other civilians of the village. *Something happened...something not so good..* he thought making his way to the edge of the village. He could notice a row of tombstones lining the path to the entrance of the village. Taking a chance, he disintered the middle one, revealing it to be Ortho's lifeless body. "Really....Useless.....You never paid me..Ugh.." he thought before taking his body to a more discrete location.* - Thu Nov 26 19:26:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Had only just made his way to this location because he felt a familiar source of chakra, Ichiros. Letting his guard down slightly, he allowed himself to freely enjoy his past comrad's silence. "Hi Best Friend Ichiro, Hi person from Kiri, Hi per-......................................"

*What the fuck...She has six arms.....* he thought as he mentally threw up for a few seconds. To the others it seemed like he had just spaced out, staring at them. "Ugh....Hi." he managed, giving a single wave.* - Tue Dec  1 04:54:49 2015
