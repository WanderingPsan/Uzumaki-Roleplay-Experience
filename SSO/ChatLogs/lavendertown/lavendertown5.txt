<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) didn't really care how Kirie had known it was him, but nevertheless, he formed a single handseal causing the water from the immediate area to rise up into the air causing the immediate mountain top to be covered in Mist. It was training time in Kirigakure.

As the mist formed, he would form another singular handseal before 8 clones formed from the large water source nearby. Readying themselves.* - Fri Oct  2 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm confident in my traveling ability. - Fri Oct  2 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Sigh... - Fri Oct  2 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) could notice the lack of the orange haired girl's presense immediately from both the lack of sound she was producing earlier, and that the clones themselves could hear her disappear into the ground. *Earth...Tedious..* he thought as he made his way, coating his feet with chakra to allow him to walk on water.

The two clones near setsuko would attempt to grab her by the arms, restraining her if successful, taking into account that she might dip into the ground as well, he didn't know if she had the same capabilities. The clone near Kirie would turn to face her performing a quick round house kick. The four remaining clones would all form the ram seal before releasing ten shuriken from their own water bodies aimed at the different limbs of the girl, ten to each arm and leg. 

Forming a string of handseals himself, he would release a jet of odd looking liquid at Setsuna's feet in case she did try to leave, she would instead stick to the ground.* - Fri Oct  2 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would smirk, hearing the sound of what could only be Violet rising from the ground. He readied himself already by hopping back onto the safety of his pool of water, when suddenly he heard a sudden splash. It seemed that both Violet and Setsuko hadn't accounted for the syrupy field Mizumi had produced meaning both of them would be trapped in their place, unable to move; Mizumi would be safe seeing as how Violet's blade most likely couldn't reach that far. 

The clones struck by violet would have the blade run through them as if nothing had happened, their liquid bodies able to reshape and form almost instantaneously. Setsuko wouldn't be able to block all of the 40 shurikens that had been tossed near-simultaneously from the several directions meaning she would most likely be impale by many if not a lot of them; The clones she had been slicing at, would reform, just like the ones Violet had attacked. They would be nearly out of Chakra by now.

With a single handseal, Mizumi would cause more mist to reform making it even denser than before, relying on his hearing to make decisions.* - Fri Oct  2 23:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) thinks: The orange haired one is Violet... - Sat Oct  3 00:03:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: The special blades that belonged to Tethys....Now. - Sat Oct  3 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would still believe that Violet as well as Setsuko was in their original spot, having heard the stretching and eventual rip of the syrupy field. Forming three handseals quickly, he would spew an enormous ball of fire towards what he believed would be the two. *I told them not to move* He thought releasing the large ball of fire at the now defenseless Setsuko. The water clones nearby would quickly grab onto her in an attempt to restrain her. This ball of fire would most likely consume the can he threw.

It would quickly consume the water clones that were there.* - Sat Oct  3 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) thinks: Damnit.. - Sat Oct  3 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) as Violet began to form her jutsus, the three remaining water clones that wouldn't have been affected or dispeled by the fireball that was incomming. These clones would instead hear Violet's movements, reacting as she formed the handseals to make the clone. As she would be throwing the clone, the water clones would form handseals at fast paces before all releasing blasts of water aimed at crossing in an attempt at striking Violet and her clone.

He would then turn in that direction, if the earth clone wasn't stopped.* - Sat Oct  3 03:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) thinks: Get away from the water so I can end this... - Sat Oct  3 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would be destroyed in a puff of smoke, the mist would have most likely cleared because of how long it had been thinning out.* - Sat Oct  3 04:03:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) had been perched on the edge of the cliff, a small fire behind him like a campsite. "Where did Tethys hide those weapons..I wonder..I truly do." he muttered into the seabreeze that seemed to stroll in.  * - Tue Oct  6 05:14:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) took off the mask he seemed to prominently wear around the many villages he had visited. He didn't know what to do, but found solace int he fact that he was near his home village. * I could check out what's happening...I could...* he thought, forming a single handseal and creating a shadowclone before him.* - Tue Oct  6 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) quickly dispelled the shadow clone, thinking of a few things he could do instead.* - Tue Oct  6 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) sighed, forming the singular handseal once more, causing a shadow clone to form itself nearby. "I need to know...I need techniques...I need....Power.." he spoke with realization. "There must be someone who can give me power....something...anything.." he said to the clone. "We can meditate on this thought.." he declared making both Mizumi's to sit down and meditate near the warmth of the fire.* - Tue Oct  6 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) dispersed the clone before beginning to think of techniques.* - Tue Oct  6 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked out onto the ocean. He knew he had to eventually return to the village, in some way, shape or form. He rue the day he had to face the people he already attacked. *Next time...I leave no survivors...* he thought thinking about Kenshin.* - Tue Oct  6 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) looked over the cliff he had basically made his home.Desiring to be near to his once beloved village, he had started a small campsite at the edge of the land connectiong the world to Kirigakure's ocean. He had already learned, well...created, a  new technique and was dying to test it out.

Without even hesitating, his mask came off before he released a single needle of water as it soared through the sky. It went for a few yards before gravity decided to bring it down into the ground. He found a rather large boulder, releasing needle of water after needle of water, almost like a gatling gun of them.

He fired one, then three in a row, more and more each time he tried. They of course were released one after the other and not all at once. The rock seemed to have obtained a few cracks from the several attempted attacks.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) Formed a single handseal causing a clone to appear in a puff of smoke. "Go to Kirigakure...see the damage that has occured over the past few days." With that beingsaid, the clone left on its way.* - Wed Oct  7 22:33:23 2015

He couldn't quite put a finger on it, but it seemed as if the little boy was somehow familiar to him. *Have I met him?* he asked squinting behind his own mask. "Excuse me...who are you little boy?" he asked wanting to make sure.* - Fri Oct  9 18:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) gave a small smile, hidden behind the mask he wore for anonimity. *Good...* he thought placing a single hand onto his chest. "Pleasure to finally meet you. Your father told me a lot about you...He told me I would be training you one day.." he stopped realizing the boy was really young....too young. * - Fri Oct  9 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) nodded. "We were, best of friends...until...well I had to leave..Lets just leave it at that." he said releasing a small chuckle. "I did promise your father I would care for you in the event something happened to him; Sorry for being so late.." he said, the mask still hiding his rather sadened facial expression. * - Fri Oct  9 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Who are you, exactly? - Fri Oct  9 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) softly shook his head. "I'm sorry...I can't reveal that in the village...I took a risk coming here with Niza here." he said tapping on the mask with his right hand, a small tck being heard with each tap. "You don't have to come with me, but I have been learning from the most influential people around, Fujitora, Ushinawa, Teh-" he stopped thinking he heard something coming from the outside. Realizing it was nothing, he turned back. "What do you think?"* - Fri Oct  9 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Well.. - Fri Oct  9 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I'm sorry.. - Fri Oct  9 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: But even if you knew, Ushinawa... and he told you to train Heiwa. - Fri Oct  9 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I don't think I can let you do that. - Fri Oct  9 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: When we don't even know who you are. - Fri Oct  9 18:54:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: And like I said.. - Fri Oct  9 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I cannot let Heiwa go somewhere with you. - Fri Oct  9 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Umm.... - Fri Oct  9 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Not until, I have spoken with Hideki about this.  - Fri Oct  9 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Hideki is too emotional. He doesn't know what's best for Heiwa. - Fri Oct  9 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Okay, and? I'm not. - Fri Oct  9 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: So, I am going to be here protecting him. - Fri Oct  9 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: And you are nothing. - Fri Oct  9 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I am nothing? - Fri Oct  9 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: You have already spoken out of term for too long. - Fri Oct  9 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Look, I'm not letting Heiwa go with a stranger.. - Fri Oct  9 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) sighed. He formed a single handseal creating four clones in the immediate area for a total of five strangers. in the room. As if in unison, they all began to speak. "I don't want to start a fight...Move." they would say, all raising their hands in case she made a single hostile movement.* - Fri Oct  9 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: .....sir, can I just go in and see Heiwa please? - Fri Oct  9 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Please leave. - Fri Oct  9 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Or better yet, wait in the other room. - Fri Oct  9 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I want to see Heiwa first. - Fri Oct  9 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) turned slightly, allowing him to keep some portion of vision on the two, and the other portion of his gaze on the girl. "Look...You will see Heiwa if you go into the other room..." he said calmly, getting quite annoyed by her persistence.

The four clones themselves would all raise their left hand up to the mask covering their face. They would all lift the mask enough to reveal their mouth and chin. "Please, I don't want to hurt Heiwa....But I will if you stand in the way."

The original figure raised his hands in case Nina attacked or if he was attacked past the clones.* - Fri Oct  9 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) smirked from behind his mask. "Because Ushinawa never mentioned you, so I don't need you." he stated before all four of the clones, whose mouths were all visible, released a single senbon from their mouth made of water. The speed of which they released the senbon seemed almost inhuman as they aimed to strike Lyla directly in the chest. If successful, they would all fire another senbon at the same speed aimed to strike her again in quick succession.* - Fri Oct  9 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: See now you don't even have Hideki...Come with me. -omit- - Fri Oct  9 19:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) watched as two of his clones were immediately struck by the pressurized water attack dispersing them immediately. His gaze immediately landing onto the boy and his handseals. *I need him alive...* he thought as both the figure and one of the clones formed three handseals at rapid speeds before releasing bursts of water from his mouth in an attempt to possibly block the jutsu the boy was performing and attempt to smack him against the drawer knocking him out. The clone that didn't perform a jutsu, formed a single seal shunshining towards Lyla's side, pulling out his tanto and placing it near her neck. "Move and die."* - Fri Oct  9 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would be struck in the back, feeling absolutely nothing from the attack, as if someone was poking him gently. It seemed he had seen the handseals, along with the nearby clone, the only one not having seen them being the clone near Lyla. The room would immediately feel like being in a furnace, the temperature exponentially rising as the two began to sweat. The trapped clone began to walk towards Heiwa, his body moving oddly as if the heat was beating him down. 

The original remained standing still, his body sweating all over as he began to feel light headed. *What kind ofpower is this..?* he asked himself looking outside the window as if by instinct. He could notice some form of heat-source radiating outside. *He's mad! He would kill us all just to avoid coming with me? Why is the water on the ground not boiling...Why is the one of the far end of the room fine?* he asked himself, turning every which way.

"If we're dying...Then there's no point." he declared towards his clones. The one heading towards Heiwa immediately dispersed from fainting while the shadow clone that was fine, began to surge chakra through the tanto he had near Lyla's neck. "Hail Hydra." it said before trying to slice Lyra's throat with its fire coated tanto immediately burning her as she died. If successful, he would bring the tanto up to his own body and plunge it into himself, dispersing.

The figure would then pull out his own tanto giving it a simple twirl in his hand, nearly dropping it from the sweat. He was tired, and the heat seemed to be becoming even more unbearable, his skin feeling as if it was melting. "Hail Hydra." he stated before plunging the Tanto into his gut causing him to also disperse in a puff of smoke.* - Fri Oct  9 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) felt all of the knowledge rush towards him immediately hurling into the sea. His vomit revealing his breakfast of fish and chips. He coughed slightly, washing out his mouth with the sea water.* - Fri Oct  9 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Formed another singular seal creating a shadow clone outside the borders of Kumogakure. "Lets try this agian... GO." he commanded causing the clone to leave.* - Sat Oct 10 04:12:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) slowly lifted his hand upwards, forming the seal of confrontation. Uppon completion, the moisture in the building began to become more dense as mist spewed from underneath the mask. The room would quickly become flooded with Mist as the figure seemingly vanished amongst the surroundings.* - Sat Oct 10 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) could hear the boy fall to the ground, quickly making an exit.* - Sat Oct 10 04:27:31 2015

"Now then, I think I've distracted you long enough for the army I brought from Amegakure.." he stated, raising his arm up into the air, his hand formed into the shape of a gun already.

"You know, the village wasn't like this with Teth-....," he stopped, looking past the people that seemed ready to take him out.

He could feel his body pressing up against the solid rock, unable to move any limb.

"You know...if you're going to do this...You have to remember to cover their mouth..It's important, okay? Remeber that." he stated before spitting two times in a row, each spit instantly forming into a senbon made of pure water. It's speed unrivaled, as it's clear characteristic making it blend in  to the background. Both were aimed at Sanoke's chest, Mizumi's having faced his way before spitting. They weren't powerful by all means, only used to prove a point by acting like a weak punch to his chest if contact was made.

"Please....Hel-" he would stop, having been cut short by the oncomming rocks that piled over him, squeezing him to his breaking point. Smoke would seep out from the open room in the tomb of piled rocks. The bunshin that had arrived in Kirigakure would be popped.

He had been feeling so many things as of late, so many things tossing and turning in his mind; he couldn't help but try and turn it off. He didn't want to feel how he felt, or at least he didn't want others to see how the loss of his brother and only family affected him.

Placing his hands together, he formed a single seal producing a single Kage Bunshin. "Go stranger, go to this Village, yes, yes...Go." he stated watching the delusional clone waltz its way into the village.* - Mon Oct 12 19:32:54 2015
