<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Tell you what. Do three laps around this island and I'll take you to a buffet. - Wed Sep 16 01:17:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: If you slow down, you lose the bet. - Wed Sep 16 01:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded, quickly forming a long string of seals in a short amount of time. The chakra within his belly began to expand and overheat. This warmth spread to his throat before being released into a hoola hoop sized fireball out towards the sky. "That's about it...when it comes to fire."* - Wed Sep 16 01:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't know any fire release techniques, Fujitora.. - Wed Sep 16 01:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I wouldn't mind genjutsu as well... - Wed Sep 16 01:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Guess we'll all be learning Genjutsu today, you have Tethys over there to thank ..because of this scroll he gave me. - Wed Sep 16 01:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Knowing some taijutsu would not hurt. - Wed Sep 16 01:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Taijutsu Specialists are my specialist, though... - Wed Sep 16 01:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Also some genjutsu could come in handy for everyone here. - Wed Sep 16 01:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I thought we were learning them all. - Wed Sep 16 01:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: It was not pleasant but yeah. - Wed Sep 16 01:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: We are, but not all at once Yan. - Wed Sep 16 01:24:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Anyone who took the Chuunin Exams has experienced Genjutsu.... - Wed Sep 16 01:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So, I suppose the first we all should get down will be the Mist Servant Jutsu, to trick our enemy that our numbers have increased by more than the thousands. - Wed Sep 16 01:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: The scrolls must make their way back to me at the end. - Wed Sep 16 01:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Gotta return these after all. - Wed Sep 16 01:29:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Give me a moment to try working these things out.. - Wed Sep 16 01:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would suddenly begin to see shadows surrounding the young adult, his eyes furiously scanning his immediate field of vision. He remained calm and collected, feeling his chakra spread throughout his body as if by instinct. His body, although appearing normal to the others, had become liquid on the inside prepared to take any strike that came at him. Upon noticing that nothing had happened, he looked at Yan and then Fujitora accusingly.* - Wed Sep 16 01:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I think you both would want for me to master these first. - Wed Sep 16 01:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So, how was your Genjutsu experience? - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked over to Fujitora. "Sir, might I learn a fire jutsu while you are attempting to master these techniques? I feel left out..."* - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Of course. - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You know how to create chakra flow ? - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: No. - Wed Sep 16 02:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'm a master at it, I can teach you. - Wed Sep 16 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Chakra flow does sound interesting. - Wed Sep 16 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Indeed it does. - Wed Sep 16 02:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) watched Fujitora perform his technique, focusing his chakra onto the blade of his katana. His eyes widened with interest as he heard its explanation. Without hesitation, Mizumi grabbed ahold of his Tanto, pulling it to his front; wielding it firmly with both hands. "I've trained in a type of chakra flow...but never with fire...Is there a method to performing it correctly?" he asked referring to if it was all about trying to transfer one's heat through chakra.* - Wed Sep 16 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm could I apply that to my bare hand? - Wed Sep 16 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes, a method of heating your inner chakra much like you would with the great fire ball, but trying to maintain this flame as well.. - Wed Sep 16 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You can if you wear fire proof gloves. - Wed Sep 16 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Otherwise you'd burn yourself. - Wed Sep 16 02:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I've tried this.. - Wed Sep 16 02:11:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm....Where would one get this gloves. - Wed Sep 16 02:11:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mhm. - Wed Sep 16 02:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: .... - Wed Sep 16 02:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: That was genjutsu? - Wed Sep 16 02:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yuh...that wink hypnotized you. - Wed Sep 16 02:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) grabbed a hold of the scroll, unraveling it's rather ornate wrappings. He took to reading, making sure to read every detail he could from the scroll's content. What was written down was basically what Fujitora had described; its appearance and  instructions were quite clear.* - Wed Sep 16 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: And to make a fire proof glove, you'd need leather..Clay, some more clay...Steel...Another glove for the layer..Soak into water for a few days before applying the final layer, then seal it with tree sap.. - Wed Sep 16 02:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 16 02:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: So Fujitora. - Wed Sep 16 02:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmm Master fuji could you make some for me please. - Wed Sep 16 02:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm? - Wed Sep 16 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What other Katon techniques do you know? - Wed Sep 16 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes..Once I'm free Flex. - Wed Sep 16 02:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, not too much actually haha..Fireball ...The Dragon Fire Bullets..Fire Chakra Flow..And one ability I've created  along with another I've made that isn't exactly fire...But can put your entire body through the process. - Wed Sep 16 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What process would that be? - Wed Sep 16 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Overheating. - Wed Sep 16 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Overheating? - Wed Sep 16 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) held the scroll with a single hand, letting the scroll dangle in the air, making sure to hold his katana firmly with his other hand. As he read the scroll, his right hand would begin to shake slightly. He had begun to think it would be similar to the special technique Tethys had showed him, but tapping into his fire nature seemed to be rather tough. Nevertheless, he could feel his fire natured chakra course through his body......SOON....* - Wed Sep 16 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Over-.... - Wed Sep 16 02:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: How would I go about doing that? - Wed Sep 16 02:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: The human body can only take up so much of its own body heat..This brings it to the boiling point.. - Wed Sep 16 02:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It's a form of my own Fuuinjutsu. - Wed Sep 16 02:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Wouldn't that harm my body? - Wed Sep 16 02:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes. - Wed Sep 16 02:20:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What do I need to do? - Wed Sep 16 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Only one person has learned it with a worthy mind so far. - Wed Sep 16 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Ms.Noriko. - Wed Sep 16 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: So it's Fuinjutsu? - Wed Sep 16 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Yes. - Wed Sep 16 02:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Really? - Wed Sep 16 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mhm.. - Wed Sep 16 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Doesn't sound like any Fuinjutsu I've heard of... - Wed Sep 16 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It's what makes it unique. - Wed Sep 16 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: What constitutes a 'worthy mind' if I may ask? - Wed Sep 16 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: So you must be a jack of all trades... - Wed Sep 16 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Fuinjutsu is an art...I must be able to trust those with my creations. - Wed Sep 16 02:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: That requires time and effort from both parties. - Wed Sep 16 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Because for starters, lets say the seal backfires and spreads all over your body instead. - Wed Sep 16 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I am quite adept at the usage of Fuuinjutsu. - Wed Sep 16 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I hope I can earn your trust Fujitora. - Wed Sep 16 02:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had just about finished reading and soaking in the knowledge like a sponge. His ability to process information and his training with fire would certainly allow him the ability to solidify this jutsu into his arsenal as the chakra rushed towards his hand as it began to channel through the blade of his tanto, igniting it with surreal flames. * - Wed Sep 16 02:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I am more than a simple 'Leech' as Tethys refers to me. - Wed Sep 16 02:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm.. *rubs chin* - Wed Sep 16 02:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked over towards Fujitora, his Tanto ablaze. "Thank you for this technique..." he muttered softly as he extended his hand with the borrowed scroll. "I'm sure you'd want your scroll back..."

The stream of steady chakra that seemed to lite the blade would disperse once before reigniting as Mizumi was playing around with controlling his flow of chakra.* - Wed Sep 16 02:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I look foward to earning your trust if possible Fujitora. - Wed Sep 16 02:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I shall take my leave now. - Wed Sep 16 02:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oh? - Wed Sep 16 02:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I am rather tired. - Wed Sep 16 02:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: She lacks dedication... - Wed Sep 16 02:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I've used up too much of my chakra. - Wed Sep 16 02:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: -omit- - Wed Sep 16 02:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Thank you. - Wed Sep 16 02:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: It's been a very long day. - Wed Sep 16 02:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Saw that Dravae?....High five? Yeaah!....Where the fuck is he..... - Wed Sep 16 02:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 02:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: So what happened in Sunagakure>? - Wed Sep 16 02:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Not much that I know of. - Wed Sep 16 02:32:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I mean...Something had to have happened to move everyone from Sunagakure here... - Wed Sep 16 02:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You should invest time into studying this chakra flow@flex. - Wed Sep 16 02:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm I willl can i get  a scroll? - Wed Sep 16 02:33:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: That woman has silver hair....Reminds me of Kastya...Hmmm... - Wed Sep 16 02:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) grabbed ahold of the tanto with both hands, sending his chakra into the weapon with ease. The blade itself ignited in red flames as he rushed over to a nearby plant. With a single swing, it turned to ash.* - Wed Sep 16 02:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: [Lowkey what's Sharingan req] - Wed Sep 16 02:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: [Pft, Whispers don't get shown in logs] - Wed Sep 16 02:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: [but Flexus will hear ur whispers] - Wed Sep 16 02:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: [whats the partial :3] - Wed Sep 16 02:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave one or two huffs and puffs as he wasn't really use to physical exercise. He lit the flames on his blade once more before rushing to a nearby tree giving a string of quick slices that would scorch a small pattern onto the trunk of the tree. Sweat starting to form above each brow, Mizumi turned to Fujitora. "Can this chakra flow be applied to long range weapons...or does it need a constant flow?"* - Wed Sep 16 02:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) You have successfully increased you skill with this jutsu by a small amount!
You have successfully increased you skill with this jutsu by a small amount!
Studious 2 kicked in!
Elemental Training Fire kicked in!* - Wed Sep 16 02:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded, kneeling down onto the grass below. His hand seemed to glow red with heat as he pressed it against the greenery below. The ground ignited with joyful flames in the shape of a hand-print. Mizumi quickly patted it away...he didn't want to catch the island on fire...* - Wed Sep 16 02:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: So, think you can master it some time soon? - Wed Sep 16 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: May have a bit something extra you might like to learn. - Wed Sep 16 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: If you're skilled enough. - Wed Sep 16 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I can certainly master it quickly....and I'm always up for a challenge. - Wed Sep 16 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Good. - Wed Sep 16 02:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) continued to allow his chakra to flow freely through his body, reaching into his pouch for a few shuriken. As the chakra flowed into his hands, the shuriken too began to glow red with heat. A simple toss at the ground would leave burn marks on the stone upon impalment.

Suddenly, he looked over towards Fujitora, noticing him perform a technique he had never seen before, not even mentioned. He glared at the man with a look of disbelief. "Wha-...That is far more advanced than my Water Clone technique....Is that made from any substance? Or just...Chakra?" he asked eagerly.* - Wed Sep 16 03:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded in understandment. "That must take a lot of skill....Do you think Tethys is able to use that technique? I mean...if he could...he never showed it..." he said with a sudden questioning of his master's strength. 

"Who would win, You or Tethys?" he asked a small grin beginning to form on his expressionless face. His tanto randomly flickering on and off with flames. Mizumi would occasionally perform a swing or two causing the flames to dance around as they traced the swings that were performed.* - Wed Sep 16 03:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm, well Tethys of course...But we never know~ He is your -older- brother..May of been slacking by age~ Haha..Kidding. - Wed Sep 16 03:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: What jutsu? - Wed Sep 16 03:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Technically....Tethys and I are about the same age....Although he may be a year older... - Wed Sep 16 03:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: he says it's a 'Shadow Clone' jutsu. - Wed Sep 16 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Shadow clones. - Wed Sep 16 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Still new at it. - Wed Sep 16 03:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Right... - Wed Sep 16 03:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Tethys...I need to spruse up my portfolio...Any B-ranked Missions? - Wed Sep 16 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: If he makes me teach a class one more time... - Wed Sep 16 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Go teach a class. - Wed Sep 16 03:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: . . . . - Wed Sep 16 03:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Can I teach them how to fish? - Wed Sep 16 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Uhh, let me think. - Wed Sep 16 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Oh.. - Wed Sep 16 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Good. - Wed Sep 16 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Why not go fishing.. - Wed Sep 16 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Sea beast fishing. - Wed Sep 16 03:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: . . . - Wed Sep 16 03:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Back in suna, the outter desert was infested with sand worms and other insects or ebast you'd find in warm extreme climates. - Wed Sep 16 03:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Go deep enough in the ocean, you might find the same. - Wed Sep 16 03:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: But then again each village has its natural monster..Each worse than the last.. - Wed Sep 16 03:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: We use to have Sharks and whales... - Wed Sep 16 03:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm.. - Wed Sep 16 03:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: The only thing close to a monster Kirigakure has is me. - Wed Sep 16 03:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked over at the two kages as well as their copies. "Well..You two seem to be very skilled..." he said going back to his tanto and chakra flow training. With a quick pulse of chakra, his blade was ignited once more as he rushed over towards the tree, smacking it, slicing at it, and doing as much damage as he could, all the while each strike caused an explosion of flames and heat.* - Wed Sep 16 03:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That reminds me, Tethys .. How are your kids? - Wed Sep 16 03:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: . . . . - Wed Sep 16 03:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: Oright...he has kids... - Wed Sep 16 03:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: ..Well. - Wed Sep 16 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: To be honest.. - Wed Sep 16 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: They both died a few months ago. - Wed Sep 16 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: ..... - Wed Sep 16 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: . . . . - Wed Sep 16 03:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Noriko has been sick for a while, I was out on a mission.. - Wed Sep 16 03:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Came back home and found them both dead by the beach. - Wed Sep 16 03:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: No bruises, nothing.. - Wed Sep 16 03:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Just.. dead. - Wed Sep 16 03:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: I was hoping to see them ... - Wed Sep 16 03:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) turned back around to face his brother, dropping his tanto onto the grassy field beneath his feet. "No..." he said softly as he began to walk over towards the man. As he grew closer, he opened his arms up as if offering an embrace. "I'm so sorry Tethys...", he said unable to wrap his head around how he must feel about losing his own flesh and blood.* - Wed Sep 16 03:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave him a quick hug before allowing himself to step back. "Why didn't you say anything?"* - Wed Sep 16 03:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I have a village to run and ten thousand troops to lead into war.. - Wed Sep 16 03:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Didn't exactly.. have time to even hold a funeral. - Wed Sep 16 03:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Noriko.. doesn't even know they're dead. - Wed Sep 16 03:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: That would surely be the final nail on the coffin for her... - Wed Sep 16 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Children shouldn't die... - Wed Sep 16 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: She's not going to find out. - Wed Sep 16 03:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I'm going to tell her that I sent them off to her parents in a small settlement or something.. - Wed Sep 16 03:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: It's not your fault Tethys... - Wed Sep 16 03:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Damn... - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Think I'll go and rest soon. - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Tragic... - Wed Sep 16 03:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Sometimes.. I don't understand why I don't have the respect I deserve within my village. - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: ..I put my feelings aside, my personal affairs.. to assure the safety of Kirigakure. - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) decided they had silently mourned the loss of the children...at least enough for the moment. A single shuriken seemed to make its way out of his backpouch, igniting with chakra as he maintained it in his hand. With a quick swing, he released the ablazed shuriken towards Fujitora. "Think fast!" he said knowing the man would surely dodge...right?"* - Wed Sep 16 03:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I could've been taken Noriko and my kids off to live with her parents.. - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I thought you did have such respect.. - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: But chose.. to stay here and leade- - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You've been serving it for years on end. - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Who doesn't respect you? - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: ..Tch.. - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Want me to beat them up? - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: The respect I have is my ability to teach and hand out missions. - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: And know, it' fine. - Wed Sep 16 03:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: -omit-. - Wed Sep 16 03:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: No, it's fine Mizumi. - Wed Sep 16 03:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) jumped back in shock, watching the fire coming closer. It didn't seem as if it was comming directly at him in a vicious manner. He closed his eyes in this brief moment, opening them once he realized he wasn't dead. "Kenjutsu? Well rounded I see....But Brother Tethys surely outclasses you.."* - Wed Sep 16 03:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "What would you suggest to someone who doesn't like Physical conflict..." he said implying it was about himself. * - Wed Sep 16 04:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I'd suggest you learn abilities that will keep someone at a distance and at the same time, develop methods around such. - Wed Sep 16 04:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I am working on a fire jutsu just for that. - Wed Sep 16 04:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I will call it Fire Pillar. - Wed Sep 16 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Then again... - Wed Sep 16 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: That's why I was interested in Genjutsu.. - Wed Sep 16 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I see. - Wed Sep 16 04:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, one thing with shadow clones is that you can use any jutsu with them. - Wed Sep 16 04:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Meaning multiple genjutsu perhaps. - Wed Sep 16 04:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "Oh really?" he asked not having known that fact. "That means its a lot better than my Water Clone who can only use water type ninjutsu..."* - Wed Sep 16 04:10:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I suggest creating a Water Reflection Genjusu. - Wed Sep 16 04:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Using the relfection of water as a trigger no matter how small or big, capturing the number of foe in the illusion of a false world. - Wed Sep 16 04:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I could possibly even combine that with mist... - Wed Sep 16 04:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Indeed. - Wed Sep 16 04:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Thanks for the tip. - Wed Sep 16 04:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: No problem. - Wed Sep 16 04:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would run up to a nearby bush, placing his hand on it. As chakra began to flow towards the palms of his hands, he could feel the heat of a mighty flame begin to form. Suddenly, the bush ignited with a display of precious flames. "Tethys...I'm about to just go around catching things on fire..."* - Wed Sep 16 04:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded, allowing more flame natured chakra to flow through his body onto the neighboring bush. The flame seemed to grow more and more; only extinguished by mizumi performing a quick water style jutsu to douse it.* - Wed Sep 16 04:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) appeared at the scene, quickly scanning the area for any of the three he had been with a few days ago.* - Thu Sep 17 16:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at Tetyhs with an odd look. "Wait...you want me to head into the enemies army, as far as I possibly could...and then activate a trap that may or may not lead me to dying in several different scenarios...." he said as if he couldn't believe this task." I'll do if you teach me the Shadow Clone technique...so I can perform this task without risking my life on a suicide mission..."* - Thu Sep 17 16:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: You could have just given those scrolls to Kenshin. - Thu Sep 17 16:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: He could have set all three of those traps in like three seconds - Thu Sep 17 16:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: We can handle it. - Thu Sep 17 16:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Besides, if we don't learn to protect our village and take on these difficult missions, then we will always rely on the last generation to save our hides. - Thu Sep 17 16:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) thinks: I don't know if Yan understands what the mission is....or is oblivious.. - Thu Sep 17 16:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Yan. - Thu Sep 17 16:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: We're heading out. - Thu Sep 17 16:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Just you and I. - Thu Sep 17 16:31:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) sighed as well, realizin Tethys was being stubborn.* - Thu Sep 17 16:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) thinks: Soon my children.. soon I'll rejoin you.. - Thu Sep 17 16:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: .... - Thu Sep 17 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Raikage**(Chevy Malibu) says: What was that about? - Thu Sep 17 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Dunno. - Thu Sep 17 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Tethys is weird. - Thu Sep 17 16:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) walked forward a bit, thinking about if Tethys had really just doomed the young and naive Yan.* - Thu Sep 17 16:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Welp, I'm just going to be over here training for a bit. - Thu Sep 17 16:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: He was with the Gezo brat. - Thu Sep 17 16:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would clench his fists. "Damn it...He hadn't finished teaching me.." he said softly in anger.

"Thank you though...You know..you look different today.."he said offering up a slanted smile.* - Thu Sep 17 16:44:09 2015

"How are you feeling? Last I remember, Yan was firing genjutsu after genjutsu at you..?"* - Thu Sep 17 16:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: Im done with the scroll he gave you. - Thu Sep 17 16:50:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: It said Mist Servant. - Thu Sep 17 16:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "Right. Did you manage to master it already? I heard Fujitora say that the scrolls were incomplete."* - Thu Sep 17 16:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kirie(AxelFraire) says: I just learned it. - Thu Sep 17 16:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked around the area quickly noticing the new teacher's daughter. He was thinking about asking her when suddenly Flexus decided to give him some rather important information.

"What...?"* - Fri Sep 18 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: How did tethys get injured...how did the Raikage die? - Fri Sep 18 02:05:39 2015

"He was teaching me a few days ago...and I was wondering if he could continue with my training....but it doesn't seem like that's going to happen." he said sounding a little bit glum.

"Do you know where he is?"* - Fri Sep 18 02:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded at the beautiful display of fire the girl had just released. "Very good..." he said pulling out four sealed honeybuns. "Now, trade you it for a scroll, with that technique."* - Fri Sep 18 02:25:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: I know so. - Fri Sep 18 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Then that means I have to work twice as hard! - Fri Sep 18 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You're my daughter after all hehe. - Fri Sep 18 02:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a slight yawn.* - Fri Sep 18 02:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at the little girl. "You know...I'll spar you.."* - Fri Sep 18 03:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Okay, well after this one. - Fri Sep 18 03:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Takes his position. "So how do you want to do this?"* - Fri Sep 18 03:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What do you mean? - Fri Sep 18 03:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Nevermind...I'll start. - Fri Sep 18 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mkay. - Fri Sep 18 03:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) smriked, quickly bringing his right hand towards his upper chest, performing the seal of confrontation. His mouth opened slowly releasing a steady stream of moisture as chakra would begin to convert the moisture in the current area into a thick blanket of mist that soon engulfed the immediate area.

Once the mist began to crawl and blind the many that were there, he would disappear amongst the mist.* - Fri Sep 18 03:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) it seemed that Mizumi would dance about amongst the cooling mist, assuming Izanami was still in her current position. Slamming his hands together, forming a quick string of three seals, he would begin to spray a thick liquid from his mouth aimed towards Izanami's original position in hopes of trapping her in place without her knowing.

Of course he would move within the mist to avoid remaining in the same spot for too long.* - Fri Sep 18 03:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) couldn't hear any signs of struggling, therefore assumed she had not gotten caught. *Quite an interesting little girl* he thought, not wanting to delve deeper into his arsenal of jutsu  that might actually injure her. Performing a single handsign, the mist around Mizumi would begin to condense slightly, forming shuriken from the water that was produced, ten in all. They would zoom towards Izanami's original position in a wide range that would have been at about her waist; the wide spread coverage would make it hard to avoid.* - Fri Sep 18 03:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hmm.. - Fri Sep 18 03:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) could feel a sensation of heat radiating from a certain point of the quad. * Guess it's time to use the technique big brother taught me. Of course I wont use it to its fullest extent....* he said in his mind as he gave a single nod amongst the mist. 

He placed his hands together, forming a single seal. Chakra began to bubble inside of him, quickly rushing up to his throat. The large amount of chakra that had built up quickly transformed into water, causing him to release a large amount of it; gallon after gallon the water seemed to pour out of his body.

Because he didn't use it to its fullest extent, he wouldn't flood the village, but instead would use it to create giant tidal waves capable of washing out the entire courtyard. All the while Mizumi would be sent upwards with each release of water from his mouth causing him to in a way, ride the waves.* - Fri Sep 18 03:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Hm, a six year old against an adult...Well it's reality actually..She may face a llot of that in a chuunin exam. - Fri Sep 18 03:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would have been at the top of the crashing waves looking down at those bellow. As the waves seemed to die down, Mizumi also came down, allowing his feet to sink into the foot of water that was left over, the mist all but dissipated. He gave a few huffs indicating that he had tired himself out.* - Fri Sep 18 03:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked over towards the girl, controlling his breathing with each second. "Are you okay?" he asked the girl, hoping she could hear him from where he stood.* - Fri Sep 18 03:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Be strong Iza..Use all that I've taught you and more. - Fri Sep 18 03:56:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's eyes opened wide. With another seal of confrontation, the mist disappeared, fading away into nothing. "Is that better?"* - Fri Sep 18 03:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Yes! - Fri Sep 18 03:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Now I can fight back! - Fri Sep 18 03:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Lookadaflickofdawrist - Fri Sep 18 04:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: -omit- - Fri Sep 18 04:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reinup, Flexus(VantetheGreat) thinks: Go Iza use the Dravae Punch i belive in you. - Fri Sep 18 04:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oh shit you've done it, she'd gonna use Dravae's punch like Luffy uses Red Hawk. - Fri Sep 18 04:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: -omit- - Fri Sep 18 04:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) watched as the shuriken came zooming towards him, knowing he couldn't well dodge them effectively...he wasn't that quick to be honest. As they came towards him he spread chakra throughout his body, something he could do quickly, causing the shurikens to impale him in their directed locations. Of course, they would quickly fall out as Mizumi's body had turned into a liquid construct, quickly disolving into the foot of water that seemed to be consistently spread throughout the courtyard.

While merged with the watersource, he would begin to move stealthily towards the girl, unable to be seen by those without the ability to sense.* - Fri Sep 18 04:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would have turned to water already, merging with the source; moving towards Izanami's location. * - Fri Sep 18 04:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ....Hm... - Fri Sep 18 04:15:21 2015
