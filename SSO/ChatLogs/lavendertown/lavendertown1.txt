<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: [im talkin bout the Hiding in Surface tech] - Mon Aug 31 23:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had been running at a brisk pace behind his companions. Upon reaching the docks, he quickly leapt into a nearby tree, glancing over the docks and nearby ocean. He sat, perched on the tree branch as he heard Koeki become debfriefed by the fisherman. "So there are really pirates here.." he said softly as he looked at Koeki to find out what the next move will be.* - Tue Sep 01 00:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked down onto Koeki. He gave her an odd look of disbelief. *They are pirates....* he thought hopping down, landing onto the ground with a slight thud. "As you wish." he said, following every order. "How do you want to approach them?" he asked wanting to know if they were going to just walk there..swim..or possibly get on their own boat.* - Tue Sep 01 00:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) swiftly hopped onto the boat, landing onto the edge before performing three handseals quickly. Upon completion, he would release a blast of water from his mouth as it collided with the surface of the water beneath them. It would propel their boat towards the pirate's ship making their trip last a few seconds. That is...if everyone had hopped onto the boat.* - Tue Sep 01 00:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) watched as Koeki seemed to...for a lack of a better word...fearlessly march up onto the pirate's boat. *That.....was....a way of doing this..* he thought silently in his mind as he stayed on their boat. She was the one who was going to clearly try and negotiating and he would be there for strong moral support.* - Tue Sep 01 01:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) held on as he heard the pirates begin to become rather rude. Mizumi was trained and had plenty of self-control. He let Koeki run the show, and he wouldn't do anything unless he was ordered, or he felt that there was immediate danger to his team or village. He stood patiently, his arms crossed behind his back, his gaze seemingly looking passed everyone.* - Tue Sep 01 01:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) smirked slightly at the strike Koeki had been able to connect with. He watched the pirate fly, colliding with the surface of the faraway water before disappearing from sight. *That was clearly a few feet.* he thought still remaining in the same pose. It seemed Koeki didn't really need him to do anything...the pirates were rather...docile..even more so now that they saw Koeki was able to plummet one several feet away.* - Tue Sep 01 01:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would remain calm, noticing that the pirates were beginning to charge. *Half and half* he thought as he unclasped his hands behind his back. He swung them forward before  performing a set of handseals as fast as possible. As they charged towards him, they would be met with a wave of flames as a flamethrower was spewed out of his mouth incinerating them all.* - Tue Sep 01 01:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had made it back to shore, standing close to Koeki. "Should we go back to Tethys?" he asked before standing idol fora  response. All in all..it was...an odd mission, but they were able to rid the docks of menacing priates.* - Tue Sep 01 01:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had been lost in a meditative state or maybe he was just asleep while standing up. * - Wed Sep 02 02:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had watched Tethys leave the village, quickly following orders by closing he bridge...that is...after learning how to draw the bridge...
After several minutes of drawing the bridge, Mizumi made his way to the various shops in Kirigakure and began to gather and collect several pieces of equipment for the upcomming war.* - Wed Sep 02 21:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) turned ever so slightly, observing his surroundings. He wasn't sure if tethys had gone to war, or if he was just busy with a certain kage. Nevertheless, he could see some familiar faces, but it all seemed so stale at the moment. Nothing was happening and it didn't seem as if anything would be happening soon. *Man...everything seemed to go downhill after the Chuunin Exams..* he thought as he began to make his way south; he was for all intent and purposes.....Bored.* - Fri Sep 04 19:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) made his way towards the sandy beach, reaching the edge of the land that met the ocean. He began to rapidly perform six handseals, building up a large amount of fire natured chakra into his mouth. By releasing a large amount of it, superheated, it turned into a rather large fireball that was launched. As he did this, his body turned completely into water, whilst still holding his current mold and position. Within seconds he would return back to normal.* - Fri Sep 04 19:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) followed the duo in front of him, making sure to trail behind to cover their backs in case anything happened, you never knew these days. It wouldn't be long before they appeared at the entrance of Kirigakure, the land bridges that seemed to stretch for miles to the mainland. It was an odd feeling, being there without any intention of leaving the village, it was just there; and it seemed it was heavily guarded by automated guns. It only slightly bothered him that they were there, just the sight of them created a small sense of intimidation, possibly a use for them in the first place. Mizumi took a quick glance at the map that Elon was securing. Taking note of a couple of snares and bear traps that were around the immediate area. It seemed that Mizumi would be in charge of taking care of three bear traps, something that wasn't that terrible, although somewhat boring. He walked over towards the edge of the water, his reflection perfectly mirrored in the surface of the water. *I guess I can...* he thought placing his hands together to form a single seal. The surface of the water he was just looking at would begin to raise up as if controlled by Mizumi's own will. The chakra he was expelling would begin to spread further across the surface of the water creating two more creature-like constructs to begin to rise from the water. As they reached about the same height as Mizumi, the constructs would begin to quickly become detailed, forming exact copies of Mizumi before solidifying. He had produced three water clones. With that, Mizumi would lead them to the snares. The first clone, made his way towards the first snare, making sure Mizumi was nearby to keep control of the clone. The snare was out in the open, as if it was only there for a distraction of sorts. The clone made his way over towards the snare, inspecting its every inch. Since Mizumi was at a safe distance, he made an expression to clarify that he needed confirmation on the status of the trap. The clone would form a single seal, lifting its mouth towards the sky. It released a small stream of water to signify that the snare was clean. Mizumi would then dispell it. The second clone was led towards several bushes and trees, as if the snare was hidden between them. Carelessly, the clone stepped on the snare causint it to instantly snap at its leg causing it to burst. The clone was now a small puddle. Mizumi sighed, making his way over towards the snare. He spread chakra throughout his body causing his body to turn into water, except his hands; it would be noted that he was still physically there, just made out of water. This was to prevent the snare from accidently being triggered as He tried to reset it. Within minutes it was back to normal, and he walked towards the last one. The last one, found set near the water, was found by the last clone followed by Mizumi. It seemed that there was nothing there. The clone eagerly placed its hands together before releasing a stream of water from his mouth up into the air to signify it was clear. With that, he dispelled it again, turning to meet up with the others. "Everything good on my end.." he said having done little to no physical efforts.* - Fri Sep 04 19:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown)  made his way towards the southern beach, making sure to stay behind like he did previously. It was a tactic he was more comfortable with. He liked staying in the back, able to keep those in front safe, although it opened up the fact that he could easily be attacked as well, something he just had to risk. As he arrived at the beach, it was obvious to him that the proximity the snares had with the ocean would mean that there were higher chances for animals to be caught in the mess. He approached the edge of the water, like the last time. He didn't bother looking at the surface of the water, his reflection or anything. He wanted this to be done, and done quickly. Performing a single seal, three clones would form from the surface of the water. They were exact replicas of the original. Mizumi commnaded them towards the snares to make sure everything was good. At the first snare, trouble was spotted. It seemed a small seel had been caught in the snare, dying from hunger. It laid on the beach, flies hovering over its body as if it had been there for days. The clone approached the snare, struggling to pull the lifeless seal out. Mizumi sighed, pointing at the knot that was around the seal's tail. The clone quickly undid it, grabbing a hold of the seal and pulled it towards Mizumi who gave the clone a bag. The clone bagged it and tagged it, holding it for the time being. The second trap was clean, but there seemed to be a swarm of rabbits heading towards the snares. Mizumi didn't question why there were rabbits on the beach, but simply commnaded his clones forwards. They performed a few seals before releasing a pool of sticky fluids at the creatures causing them to be trapped in Mizumi's jutsu, rather than the snares. Without touching the snare, a clone would perform three handseals before releasing a wave of water over the bunnies, washing them all the way back to land where they belonged. Then the mizu bunshin was dispelled. The last trap was perfectly fine, being rather far away even. The clone had signaled that it was clear, and that was good enough for Mizumi. With a single handseal, he released all but one Bunshin, the one carrying the body of the seal. He would turn towards Elon and Jin. "I have one dead seal. That's about it." he said crossing his arms in front of his chest.* - Fri Sep 04 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) was feeling as if this event was becoming more tedious and transforming slowly into a chore. He sighed as he chased after this partners. The squad in charge of stealth it seemed. How this mission dealt with stealth baffled Mizumi, but he was in no place to really comment on the matter. Anyways, they ended up being near the eastern beach. There were more and more traps it seemed, as if no one was suppose to leave or enter the village. Performing a single handseal, two clones emmerged from the surface of the water. Mizumi himself was getting rather bored performing the same jutsus over and over. He wanted something different...something better. Anyways, after greeting himself, twice, he pointed towards the location of the two snares and told the clones to be careful. Without hesitating, the clone rushed over towards the trap quickly setting it off. The snare wrapped around the clones legs lifting it up into the air by some sort of levy system with a nearby tree. The clone's body would transform to water rather quickly causing a small drizzle of water to drip onto the ground as it slowly reformed into the clone. *It seems my clones can perform that technique as well.* he thought smirking, as if he found out a large secret. Mizumi walked over towards the rope snare, quickly resetting it before releasing his clone. He didn't need it, he already had two more out and one snare left. It just seemed like a waste. "The last one is over here." he said to the other clone showing him the path towards the last snare. It was fine, untouched for quite some time. "Well then..." He said performing a single handseal. The moisture in his hands produced four shuriken as he tossed it at the clone causing it to burst. Mizumi walked over towards the group, having barely lifted a finger except to use a few jutsus. His chakra level was normal, although it would be astonishing how much chakra he had leftover after all those jutsus; revealing how masterful he was in the art of Water Natured jutsus. "So...last one already?" he asked wondering if they were almost done.* - Fri Sep 04 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would continue to follow behind his squad leader and partner. It was the same deal, different place it seemed, but as they grew closer to their destination, it was becoming noticeably different. They were at a base of a mountain, a rather large mountain. *To get up this mountain...* he thought quickly thinking about the Suimen technique Smith had taught him....*Smith...* The bottom of his feet began to give off a blue hue as chakra seemed to flow towards the bottom of his shoes. Without hesitating, he began to run up the mountain, half expecting his partners to follow along. Although he was running up the mountainous wall, it was still rather tiresome...something he didn't want to bother with. He quickly turned around, facing the ground several feet above it. He performed a few handseals releasing a large amount of water from his mouth, propelling himself upward several yards. He continued to pour chakra into this jutsu, producing more and more water eventually causing him to land atop the mountain. It was rather peacful there, untouched by most and the river seemed to flow well. It seemed like he had gotten there last, being outsped by his squadmates. They seemed to have done most if not all of the work, making his arrival rather pointless. He didn't want to be left out so he simply made his way carefully towards the other members and inspected their work, making sure they did it perfectly. Once everything was completed, he looked the group up and down. "Good work....does this mean we finished?" he asked wondering if it was time for them to go back down the rather large mountain. "We could run down the waterfall if you wanted to make the descent much more fun..." he offered up, just wanting to go back already.* - Fri Sep 04 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) smirked, quickly mimicing the single handseal Aisu had produced. *You're forgetting I had that jutsu mastered before you even knew it.* he thought creating three clones to match Aisu.They would form a different formation, they would form a complete diamond with Mizumi in the back. "Go! Infinite Diamond Structure!" he shouted as if it were to mean something. The far left clone would perform the seal of confrontation causing the air in the immediate training field to become colder creating a thickening fog to appear. The clone at the top would perform a string of handseals that would release a pool of sticky liquid in hopes of catching the incomming clones in their place. The third and final clone would form a single handseal producing ten water shurikens, launching them towards the enemy in an attempt at releasing three towards each clone, the clone on the far right would have four coming its way. Mizumi would take advantage of the mist and his distance from the incoming blasts of water to jump high into a nearby tree, landing and perching himself on a branch. He would peek out through a few leaves, with no hope since the mist would have made it hard to see anyways. Since the clones didn't really dodge or anything, they would most likely have been destroyed by the force of the raging waves, but for Aisu to know would be hard* - Fri Sep 04 19:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would still be hiding in the tree, that is until he saw a sudden gust of wind cut through the mist causing it to separate creating two misty clouds instead of one large one revealing him at the source of the wind blast. *He was able to cut through the mist...impressive.* he thought quickly forming the same handseal he had formed previously. The water that Aisu had provided via the three clones using Raging Waves created enough water for Mizumi to create one more clone, hidden amongst the mist on the left's center. It was nearing it's maximum range, but continued to run towards Aisu's location, roughly. Once near, the clone would form the ram seal before swinging it's right arm producing and releasing eleven shuruiken in a horizontal wave towards Aisu hoping to cover a wide range in an attempt to impale him with the razor sharp water.* - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) upon hitting Aisu in the arm, the shuriken would lose all shape causing them to turn into water and spill out of the wounds. This was rather troublesome in the fact that there was no longer a material that would slow down the bleeding process in his arm causing him to start bleeding quicker. The clone would form the ram seal again, charging up its minute amount of chakra left within it to produce as many shuriken as it could (about four) before suddenly being blasted by a sudden release of wind. Being in such close proximity with Aisu would cause the blast of wind to clear more mist and obliterate the fragile clone. If he looked down at the grass, he would see a puddle where the clone was. Knowing he had to continue performing these guerilla tactics if he wanted to have a shot at defeating Aisu without serious injuries being inflicted to either party. He would form the same handseal one more time producing two clones One in the mist and one in the open. The one in the open would form a string of handseals before making a loud spitting sound, almost as if it wanted Aisu to hear him as more syrupy water was shot out towards Aisu's location. Mizumi would take this moment to push off the tree branch, using the sound of the spitting clone to hopefully disguise his movement; also hoping that Aisu would think the blasts of wind he created had something to do with the branch moving slightly. Mizumi and the clone would rush through the mist having memorized where Aisu was.* - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) arrived at the lake, readying himself for the training to come. He formed a single handseal, causing the water from the lake to rise a few feet. The water would mold and transform into an exact copy of Mizumi, without a single flaw; a testiment to his mastery over that jutsu. He pulled out his Tanto, being rather experienced in using it, he wanted to further his prowess. He set his blade in front of his chest, ready for any attack that seemed to come his way. That's when the Clone formed a single handseal before swinging his arm, releasing several water shuriken at him. Mizumi instinctively began to strike down the water shuriken with his tanto, being at a good enough distance where he could easily strike all four of the released shuriken. It was rather easy, prompting him to tell the clone to throw more. The Clone followed orders, releasing a volley of seven water shuriken at Mizumi. He managed to block five of them, but the other continued on their path towards his flesh. Within that split second as the shuriken crashed into his shoulder and arm, his body turned into a construct of water allowing the shuriken to pass through without hurting his person. * - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) glared at his clone before beckoning it to come in for a real fight. The clone once again followed orders as it charged towards Mizumi, tanto in hand. Each swing of the blade, Mizumi would counter and reciprocate with a swing of his own barely ever missing. That's when the clone swung too quickly causing Mizumi to miss his parry; the swing would have cut mizumi's left knee if it weren't for his ability to transform his body into water causing the blade to slide through his leg without causing any harm. "Damn it." he said before performing a 'Z' shaped slice at his clone. It seemed to also be able to perform the technique causing the swipe to do no harm, not even dispelling the clone. He would push off the ground aiming to start a clash between blades as each took a moment to swipe at the other's body triggering their water transformation to stay safe.* - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would watch the formation of the handseals the Proctor was performing. He knew he had to fall into the genjutsu and therefore watched intently. Upon the completion of the technique, Mizumi found himself surrounded by walls that looked all too familiar, as if he had been there long ago, barely being able to make out anything that was there. It was a small room, adorned with the simplest of necessities, and a single picture frame. The figures in the image were too faded to see, but the man in the picture had a few of the same characteristics that Mizumi held. Suddenly, he could hear a baby crying behind me, prompting him to turn around quickly. There was a crib, one that wasn't there before, catching his interest. "What kind of Genjutsu is this.." he said to himself as he walked over to the crib, peering his head into the basket. It was a baby alright, a rather small one with soft slate-blue hair, struggling to sleep. That's when it happened, the room suddenly and mysteriously caught fire as the bamboo walls of the room ignited with flames. The reflection in his eyes held the dancing flames as he realized that he had been placed into the memory of when he lost his parents, of when his childhood home caught fire. He reached in, picking up the baby with both hands before turning towards the door. As he made a break for it, he was stopped as the door suddenly became enulfed in flames causing him to step back a bit from the immense heat that seemed to saturate the room. It was getting hard to breath with all the smoke and fire beginning to make the room a living hell. The procotor would surely notice Mizumi beginning to breath irregularly, even giving a cough or two, as he tried to keep calm amongst the dancing destruction of the flames. Cries and screams could be heard from the other room, behind the wall of flames. The paper panneling of the door seemed to quickly dissolve in the flames revealing his parents being engulfed in flames. "Nooo!" he shouted through the fire, a single tear beginning to form at the corner of his eye. He knew he had failed to save his parents as a baby, he couldn't do anything about that...but now, as a man, how could he have failed this time? Mizumi's blood began to pump as his adrenaline seemed to fuel his intentions. He charged at the weakened door, tucking in his head as he did so. He would break through the burning door, tumbling through to the other side. As he lay on the ground, he didn't feel any heat....any fire. As he lifted his head, he was on Kirigakure's beach, his clothes covered in sand. His hands which once held his baby self were now empty as he saw a lone figure waiting for him at the edge of the water. The man had gray hair and seemed to carry around a rather large blade. It was Tethys, his new family, as he rushed to his side. "Tethys...What are you doing here...?" he asked the figure whos back seemed to be turned towards him. Without saying a word, he turned, looking Mizumi straight in the eyes. "You are no longer a part of the family...You are no longer welcomed in Kirigakure. Leave now....Now!" he shouted at him. Mizumi didn't understand....He had been a part of the family for a few years now, but Tethys was being unreasonable. He had lost his family once more it seemed, causing him to walk away from the beach. As he walked away, he began to ponder about what had happened and why. He had completely forgotten he had been placed in a genjutsu until now; the scenarios didn't add up. It was as if it had been pursuiting the notion that Mizumi's greatest fear was to be abandonded, to be cut out of a family. *Everything....it was....so real...* he thought.* - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Would see a figure appear as he walked away from Tethys. He face was blurry, but he could see handsigns being formed. With that, he wasn't on the beach anymore, he was on top of the rather large waterfall cliff behind the mansion. The river that opened up into a waterfall was flowing as normal, separating the two portions of the cliff's landmass. Mizumi was on one side, while the other side held Smith, Elon, and Aisu in its grasp. All three seemed to be as close to the edge as possible without literally walking on air. Their backs were towards Mizumi as he looked at them with an odd look. They turned around to face Mizumi each with a numb look etched upon their faces. They stood there, motionless, their arms lifelessly hanging at the sides of their bodies. Mizumi tried to make his way across the river to be with them, but he couldn't. As he tried to step onto the surface of the water, some sort of invisible barrier halted his motions causing him to crash into it. He began to panic slightly, causing his heart to race as he reached out to touch the barrier with his hand. It was there, as if a physical wall that he could see through. That's when it happened, Elon, Smith, and Aisu lifted their right hand in a synchronized fashion, up to their chests. They gave a sullen wave as if to say goodbye before leaning back as far as they could. Mizumi tried to shout, try to reach them in some way to stop them from doing what they were about to do, but the barrier he was in seemed to cancel any noise he made; he was mute. They continued to lean back until gravity took its course causing each of them to fall back, disappearing from Mizumi's vision. They had all killed themselves, let themselves drop from the highest point in Kirigakure to their fates down below. Mizumi didn't want to helplessly lose his friends.*)* - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown)  would suddenly blink causing him to appear at the center of a giant stadium, his clothes turned to that of a gladitator of sorts; sporting leather and metal pieces. "What is tis..." he muttered as he looked onwards at the several screaming fans. At one end of the stadium, there was a wooden gate about ten feet tall that began to slowly open itself. Once completely open, a being as tall as the gate walked out causing a small quake with each step. Mizumi, a prepared individual who prized knowledge, preparedness, and technique over many things, instinctively reached for his backpouch that would have been strapped around his waist....if it was actually there. He looked down, his waist showed no signs of his equipment meaning he was left to fight a ten foot being that resembled an ogre without anything to defend himself with. He groaned as he clenched his teeth shut. His feared being unprepared in dangerous situations, the fear of looming death also fit into that category. He had to think quickly or else it would be all Ogre....so to speak. Mizumi began to plan, making use out of anyhting he could find. He ripped his leather clothing fastening an old-timey slingshot, using the string that laced up his boot to hold it together. As the Ogre came stomping towards him, he couldn't do anything but perform a few backhand springs to get away. When he landed near the wall of the stadium, he noticed a pile of small rocks that had formed most likely from a previous fight. Grabbing one, he placed it at the center of the slingshot before hurtling it at the Ogre, having done a few good spins beforehand. If successful the rock would have hit the ogre in the forehead with enough force to cause it to pass out, crashing against the floor creating a quake. Mizumi had been able to slightly overcome his fear of being unprepared, having been able to think quickly in the midst of battle* - Fri Sep 04 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) test* - Fri Sep 04 19:21:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) sighed, being in a place of extreme oddness.* - Fri Sep 04 19:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) sighed, leaning up against a nearby pillar. It seemed as if there was a slight chance that something would actually happen today. At least he could enjoy whatever type of entertainment they were about to provide.* - Fri Sep 04 23:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a quick yawn looking over towards Tethys.* - Fri Sep 04 23:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) wondered if the action was going to get good.* - Fri Sep 04 23:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) moved over to the bench, hoping to get a better view of the action from there..* - Sat Sep 05 00:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had begun to feel a little bit hungry from observing this confrontation between the two. Although he slightly knew Violet, he had no idea who the other opponent was and therefore felt little to no sympathy for what was happening...Then again..* - Sat Sep 05 00:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) was lowkey upset the show ended so early.* - Sat Sep 05 00:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would shout at Violet. "IDIOT! IT's You ARE!" (omit)* - Sat Sep 05 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) pushed off the bench, quickly raising to attention. It seemed he would need to find something else to do.* - Sat Sep 05 00:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) starts masterbating in the streets (omit)* - Sat Sep 05 02:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Made his way towards the rather large gathering of shinobi...all of which seemed to be making a singular line. "Well..." he started, not even finishing his sentence. More of the same nothing.* - Sun Sep 06 00:42:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) made his way from the rather secluded bench, moving towards the gathered shinobi that again seemed to be fighting. It was Keoki again, a repetitive set of information when it came to squarrls or tussles in the courtyard.* - Tue Sep 08 17:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gve a disinterested look at the fight happening before him. He had no idea if it was a spar or an outright fight, but nevertheless he gave zero fucks. He did note that Koeki wasn't causing her opponent to die in one connected hit, giving Mizui=mi the impression she was holding back implying it was a friendly fight.

He gave a quick glance towardss Tethys, noticing he was vacantly standing there as he usually did. *Well....I guess I'm never going to get trained...and get these markings off of me...* he thought crossing his arms in front of his chest.* - Tue Sep 08 17:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) seemed to scan the immediate area, realizing that Tethys was absent yet again. He crossed his arms in disbelief as he began to walk around the courtyard, as if doing so would somehow stop his chronic case of boredom. Even the idea of fighting seemed to bore him.

he seemed to notice Violet in some form of interaction with an unknown shinobi, at least to Mizumi, and decided this could be the slump buster he needed. He took no time in walking calmly over towards the duo looking at each of them for a brief moment. "How are you Violet....and...Who might you be?" he asked politely.* - Wed Sep 09 00:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at the recently neglected boy with even eyes. "Pleasure to meet you Kiba, you may call me Mizumi." he said, immediately jamming his hands into the shallow pockets of his pants. "I haven't really seen you here before...Good at hiding are you?" he asked jokingly, although the manner in which he said it made it appear to be a serious question.* - Wed Sep 09 00:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) seeing as how Kida never corrected Mizumi on how to say his name, he will forever be cemented in his mind as Kiba. "Maybe I just wasn't paying attention, Kiba..." he said slowly looking towards the East as if he had heard something. "Have you seen Tethys?" he asked having set a sort of appointment to train.


"Train what?"* - Wed Sep 09 00:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at the rather foreign substance known as the Kirigakure no sato headband. "Ugh...This village doesn't use that headband..." he said  informatively. "We've stopped recognizing that as an identifiable substance."* - Wed Sep 09 00:45:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave the girl a quick glance. "Sure...we can go watch you train and stuff.." he said seeing as how he had nothing to do.* - Wed Sep 09 00:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had no idea what he needed to train, he had no real direction at the moment...none that he could think of really....He just sat himself at the border of where the cool grass met the moist ground near the lake and began to mediftate.* - Wed Sep 09 01:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked up from his short meditation, noticing the boy performing some form of combative strikes. "Yeah...I don't enjoy nor do I like to train my more physical attributes...I believe in the power of my mind." he said realizing how odd it sounded immediately after he finished speaking.* - Wed Sep 09 02:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Made his way towards the center of the rather popular square. It was clear that there seemed to be a customary gathering here, and it would be the best place to do anything worth while.

Spotting Tethys and his rather long, white hair, Mizumi made his way over to him. "Lord Tethys, are you ready for that battle?" he asked looking at him directly.* - Wed Sep 09 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) remained standing, his feet plastered to the surface of the water as if it was solid ground. He wasted no time in quickly performing the seal of confrontation as chakra quickly began to rush through his body. The surface of the lake instantly mixed with chakra as the water was released into the air forming a dense fog that quickly devoured the lake making it extremely difficult to see what exactly was going on. The mist itself was infused with chakra making any attempted sensing technique to be blinded by a growing cyan color that was Mizumi's chakra.

While in the cover of the mist, Mizumi began to move, forming another singlular handseal as  he released more chakra. The surface of the water rose in three different locations as three clones formed from said risen water, hidden by the cool white mist. They readied themselves as they awaited Tethys' move.* - Wed Sep 09 15:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would have already been planning his next moves when a sudden blast of wind could be felt causing his loose fitting clothing to flap slightly. The clone in front of Tethys was pushed back quite a bit causing it to stumble back, but not dispersing. The wind was able to clear some of the mist around Tethys, but the growing fog continued to creep back to its original place, making sure that Tethys was blinded by mist slowly but surely.

 As if knowing what to do, the clones each formed a single handseal as Mizumi jumped up into the air, nearing the edge of the mist, but making sure he was still doused in his water technique. He formed a long string of handseals rather quickly and effortlessly as he began to spew fire from his mouth that swirled into  a ball, with haste, before being released towards Tethy's last known location from above. The three clones who had already formed the handseal would swipe there arms towards Tethys' location causing the water they were standing on to release ten discs of water each (30 total) that would form into extremely sharp and durable shuriken as they scattered towards their target's location in a widespread flurry. *Delta Dragon Formation*, Mizumi said in his mind as he had launched an attack not only from above, but from several different sides making it a challenge to dodge all of the barrage.* - Wed Sep 09 15:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would be descending back down to the lake, having released a rather large fireball towards Tethys' direction successfully. As he landed, he could feel the sudden change in his own mist as the vortexes of wind seemed to pull and draw in the surrounding mist. *Wind....* he thought quickly allowing his chakra to spread throughout his body as he began to sink into the body of water below him, becoming completely invisible as his body merged with the liquid. In doing so, he tried to quickly order the clones to do the same, but alas, the fireball that continued on its path seemed to collide with the vortexs that were formed causing a rather large and intense explosion of fire quickly incinerating two of the clones that didn't manage to follow suit and dip into the water. The large explosion of fire would also evaporate a good portion of the mist causing the field to be somewhat cleared.* - Wed Sep 09 15:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown)  would have already been merged with the water causing his chakra signature and that of his clone to be swirled amongst the general area of the lake making it difficult to pinpoint where he was or his clone was exactly. As Tethys was combatting against the explosion with his own water attack, the general water behind him began to slowly rise up as Mizumi's clone began to form. It didn't have a large amount of chakra left, but it had enough. The clone only rose out of the water up to his pecks before performing a single handseal. The water would spit out another flurry of shuriken aimed at Tethys in an attempt to plunge them into his back.

The real mizumi remained disperesed in the water as he began to plan on his next move.* - Wed Sep 09 17:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) the clone seeing as how there was no use going back under the water with how little chakra it had left decided to reform completely before performing one last handseal. The seal of confrontation was formed causing his chakra to mix with some of the chakra unfused with Tethys' own. Mizumi realized this, as the mist began to disperse from the outer regions of the lake meaning something was stopping him from controlling the water nearby. The clone also used the moisture in the air to help create the somewhat weaker field of mist.  Upon completely releasing all of its chakra into the mist technique, the clone was left with nothing causing it to disperse back into the lake. Using the mist to stop Tethys' from sensing his exact location, Mizumi emmerged from the water allowing his body and feet to rest on the surface of the lake. 

He looked worried, he knew he didn't have a large chakra reserve; he was a untrained genin after all. *What is he trying to do with this water....Why is he pouring his chakra into it...is it just for my mist?* he thought as he pushed off the ground hopping closer to the Waterfall while still surrounded by the growing mist. He performed a single handseal causing the water pouring down from the waterfall to release a figure that quickly began to resemble Mizumi. Of course, Tethys wouldn't be able to notice or sense the creation of the clone because of the chakra mixed mist blocking his overall sensing.* - Wed Sep 09 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) seeing as how they were both standing on the surface of the water, it would be assumed they were both performing the Suimen technique causing them to be unphased by the sudden transformation of the water's surface to the sticky fluid. They were both covered in the mist, however small amount was covering the lake (mostly the waterfall area). He had no way of knowing there was a clone, which Mizumi took as a plan. Making his clone run out of the mist, his chakra covered feet patting against the surface of the liquid without even noticing what it was (not like Mizumi would see it either). 

The clone continued to run performing three handseals before releasing a blast of water from its mouth as it hurdled towards Tethys with rock crushing speeds. As he maintained the water pouring out of his mouth, he formed a single handseal causing ten Water shuriken to pop out of the rushing torrent of water before zipping towards Tethys. *Aquatic Drill Technique..* he thought as he, the original, remained in the mist trying to keep his senses ready.* - Wed Sep 09 18:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) could feel the shift in the water below his chakra coated feet. Unsure of what was going to happen, he lept back allowing his feet to grapple onto the nearby cliffside. *This doesn't seem good...* he thought unable to see past his own mist. He was starting to feel tired and the mist still provided cover as Tethys should think the clone was the real Mizumi. 

*I can't do much right now...* he thought as the clone couldn't really do much if anything else. It pulled out a single kunai from its pocket, letting his body drop to a defensive stance as if that would do anything.

The real mizumi would begin to climb up the cliff, poking out of the mist enough to see Tethys now atop a large body of water. *If anything...I can climb this cliff...* he thought. He formed a string of five handseals before coughing out a large ball of fire towards Tethys in an attempt to disrupt whatever he was planning, he didn't care if this gave him away.* - Wed Sep 09 18:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) seemed to poke his head out from the mist before noticing a large wave coming towards him. A stroke of fear rushed through his body as he began to run up the cliff managing to reach the top before the wave came crashing down ontop of him. The force not only engulfed him, but launched him further north. It seemed to tsunami was grabbing a hold of him as he finally reached the end, the giant wall of Kirigakure. He was slammed against it most likely causing several bruising and pain, possibly having his bones saved from being broken due to his high durability. The strength of the blow and running water quickly knocked him out as he continued to be pinned against the wall. Once the water subsided, Mizumi would be laying on the cliffs surface knocked out.* - Wed Sep 09 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had taken in too much water and needed Cpr* - Wed Sep 09 19:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) made out with Tethys clone. (omit)* - Wed Sep 09 19:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) woke up after coughing up a lot of water. "huh...?" he asked unaware of what was happening.* - Wed Sep 09 19:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) struggled to move.* - Wed Sep 09 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) groans a little. "H-eal..."* - Wed Sep 09 20:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Got up. "that healing was great." he said in a sarcastic tone. 

"I'm okay now." he said shrugging everything off. "Setsuna, that was a test. "* - Wed Sep 09 20:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked around towards Tethys. *He didn't really finish talking to me....** - Wed Sep 09 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at Tethys. "So...about that jutsu.." he said persistent as ever.* - Wed Sep 09 22:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) cleared his throat giving the scroll a quick glance. "I'm going to teach all of you how to touch your toes," he said with a half serious tone. "First you extend your arms out, palms stretched too. Then you bend over and touch your toes....Now you all try it."* - Wed Sep 09 23:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) whispers: They aren't touching their toes....How am I suppose to teach them.... - Wed Sep 09 23:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) formed a single handseal before releasing a small jet of water towards Mitsuru's face. "What rank is that?" he asked.* - Wed Sep 09 23:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) seeing as how he was being ignored, he pulled out the scroll Tethys had just given him and gave it a quick read, looking at the descriptive writing about how to perform said jutsu and even examples of how it can be applied. There wasn't much to read or go too much into the details about the handseals seeing as how it only required one handseal and it wasn't even a complicated one at that.


"When are there meetings being held?"* - Wed Sep 09 23:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Made it to the rather small council room in which several of the old people were gathered around in order to discuss a certain matter that they didn't want the public to take note of. Noriko was sick far too often to go unnoticed it seemed. The oldest council member stood up, greeted everyone and then sat back down, taking  note of everyone that seemed to be there. That's when mizumi sat down at the end of the table. He was looking around, taking note of everything and everyone, even pulling out the scroll he was given by tethys thinking he could actually read it on any downtime this conversation could have.

Within minutes the council meeting started, as several old people began to speak at the same time not even letting the other finish before already commanding that they be heard. It was getting really loud as each thought speaking louder would somehow make their opinions stand out or be more correct. Mizumi slightly laughed at this, thinking their outdated tactics were actually flaws that they were too old and ignorant to even realize. Seeing as how they continued to dwell on this tactic, Mizumi gave quick glances at the scroll in order to better understand it.

As Mizumi continued to scan the scroll and all of its contents, he couldn't help but open his ears up to the conversation at hand. They were still on the subject of Noriko's chronic case of illness and overall attitude. She was sooner or later going to cause an epedemic with all of her unknown diseases, and even cause it to effect the villages better leader, Tethys. 

The main issue lied in that Noriko always wanted to be alone either from some headache or other reason. She wasn't involved in the village and seemed to slowly descend into a worser state that would soon envelop the village. The village was on a path that seeemed to mirror that of Sunagakure or Kumogakure. Who knew what Noriko had in mind for the future, but the angry and annoyed council members didnt want a part of that.

As Mizumi continued to take notes as he had been doing so the entire time, he continued to make quick glances at his scroll seeing as how he wanted the power Tetyhs was able to show in the match they had. It was engraved in his mind, the loss he faced against Tethys, even though he totally cheated. It wasn't a loss, he knew and memorized Tethys' techniques and strategy making sure he would be able to defeat and possibly counter that same jutsu once he figured out how to perform said jutsu.

The council seemed to drag on and on about noriko and how she may be doing more harm staying in power than helping the village. Mizumi quickly wrote this down, unsure if he even wanted to present this to the Mizukage or well...the current mizukage tethys. Tethys was her husband, and a great shinobi in his own right. Who is to know if he would make a better mizukage that the current one?

The council members finally changed subjects, this time to the matter about pirates who seemed to constantly arrive and attempt to claim the port as their own. This was a rather funny subject for Mizumi since he had been successful at attacking and fending off other Pirates.

* - Wed Sep 09 23:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) approached Tethys in a calm demeanor. "I finished sitting in on a council meeting...They talked about Noriko and Pirates..." he said handing him a piece of paper with some notes and crude drawings of pirates.* - Thu Sep 10 00:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) extended out his hand giving the boy the scroll. "Have fun."* - Thu Sep 10 00:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) made his way to the lake once more, seeing as how he had faced Tethys there not long ago. This time, he would face Muhhamed, to find out if he had the element of Raiton...something he most likely did have...

"He's late...or isn't coming.." he stated noticing Mohhamed hadn't arrived.* - Thu Sep 10 00:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had been waiting at the edge of the water for Muhhamed who finally arrived. "Took you a while...didn't it."* - Thu Sep 10 00:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) made his way slowly towards the center of the lake, his feet cloaking themselves in chakra to allow him to walk on water all jesus style. "Alright..." he said understanding this was simply friendly. "I've never really seen you fight...so I have no idea what you're capable of...it's sort of thrilling and scary at the same time.." * - Thu Sep 10 00:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) simply glared at the shuriken that seemed to rush towards him. He wasn't the fastest kid when it came to reflexes simply standing still as he watched the shuriken fly in his direction. He did release chakra throughout his body causing his shape and form to turn into that of water allowing the shuriken to crash into and through him falling limp after passing through his liquid body. Once that was done, Mizumi performed the seal of confrontation causing the surface of the water to disperse quickly creating a dense mist around the lake making it extremely hard to see.* - Thu Sep 10 00:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would smirk, feeling a slight breeze against his loose clothing. *He's using wind...like Tethys...* he thought as he began to move, making sure to avoid his last known location. Performing a string of handseals he would build up his chakra before releasing a large boulder sized fireball from his mouth in an attempt to strike Muhhamed down; the fireball would be hidden behind the mist before flying into the mistless space that Muhhamed had cleared. 

After releasing the fireball, he formed another seal creating two Water clones nearby.* - Thu Sep 10 00:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would look on as the explosion evaporated some of the looming mist. *Did he create fire?* he thought causing the two clones that were near him to push forward as Mizumi himself sank into the water, his body turning into water itself, dispersing into the lake. The clones would emmerge from the mist giving the impression that only one of them was a clone and the other the original. 

Both clones formed a single handseal before controlling their chakra onto the surface of the water in front of them. The water would release ten discs each for a total of twenty discs that would all turn into shurikens before flying towards hassan. *Lets see if he uses wind again...** - Thu Sep 10 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would remain underwater while the shurikens seemed to be repelled from the sudden burst of air hassan had made. It seemed to effect the water as well as it sent ripple after ripple from his position. As he jumped up towards the clones position,  they both would sink into the water, their body becoming invisible the moment they entered the water as they too perormed the transformation technique. At the same time Hassan was in the air, the real Mizumi's body would rise out of the water, up to his waist allowing almost all of his upper body to be visible. He would form a single handseal before releasing a jet of fire from his mouth towards Hassan's projected location  If successful, the fire would collide with the wind armor engulfing the old man with a weak flame. After spewing the fire, he would sink back into the water, transforming himself to continue going on inconspicuously.* - Thu Sep 10 01:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would remain in the water, although, from the water that seemed to be splashed out of the lake and onto the land something seemed to be moving. The water that was splashed out seemed to begin to form and reshape itself into Mizumi's figure. The figure would say, "All I'm seeing is Wind natured techniques...." as if to imply that he didn't think the old man had Lightning nature.

The real mizumi could feel every quake and wave generated in the lake causing him to feel slightly sick, but nevertheless remained underwater. 

The figure on land would take a few breaths before performing a string of three handseals releasing a gooey looking liquid from his mouth that would spread onto the surface of the water and would slowly spread out more and more. He knew that Hassan was floating, but whatever went up had to come down sometime...right?* - Thu Sep 10 01:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's clone's jutsu would continue spewing, although the spheres created by Hassan would poke through the stream causing the spread of the jutsu to be spread unevenly across the floor. The spheres would also strike the clone causing him to pop immediately from how drained it was. 

The second clone would slowly rise from the water, performing the single seal as he did so. The water's surface would release more water into the air creating more and more mist to form and surround them. If he couldn't get near him...he would sure annoy the hell out of him.* - Thu Sep 10 01:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's clone would perform three handseals before spewing out a large amount of water from his mouth, slowly replenishing the water in the lake, just like the waterfall was doing. The small pool of water that was Mizumi would now become bigger and bigger as the clone continued to pour all of his chakra into replenishing the water source.* - Thu Sep 10 01:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would slowly rise out from the water. "Why...." he said taking note of what was left of the lake. As he stood there, he lifted both hands with open palms up into the air. "I give...My chakra reserve has taken quite a hit.." he said giving a quick deep breath or two. "You're pretty good for an old man.."* - Thu Sep 10 01:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) smirked. "Because it's more fun to mess with someone...Get 'em when they're slipping.." he said tapping the side of his head. He would then make his way out of the water. "So....You don't know Raiton...do you..." * - Thu Sep 10 01:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) scratched the side of his head. "Well...do you happen to know someone who does know Raiton?"* - Thu Sep 10 01:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fukushu, Angetsu(Rich The Kid) whispers: Happen to know any blacksmiths? - Thu Sep 10 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: There was a armorsmith roaming around here once upon a time, but I don't know what happened to her. - Thu Sep 10 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) shrugged slightly. "I don't mind...Just know I only take missions of C or higher...Up for that?" he asked the eager shinobi.* - Thu Sep 10 13:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Looked at the raather small group of people. "Alright, so..Who wants to learn how to prepare a fish for consumption...It can help save you when you're out in the field and low on supplies."* - Thu Sep 10 13:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked oveer towards Tethys. "So....about the teaching mission from the other day...I never got rewarded for teaching a few students the basics of Kenjutsu wiith the Tanto...and how to stretch.."* - Thu Sep 10 13:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had no idea what he meant.* - Thu Sep 10 14:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gives a quick and sudden cough that could be heard by many.* - Thu Sep 10 17:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a quick look around noticing that every day it seemed there were fewer and fewer people around. * - Thu Sep 10 17:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) shook his head. "Keep it."* - Thu Sep 10 17:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) sighed a little realizing he had to get out of this square. "Well..Since there's nothing to do...I'm going to go practice my Ninjutsu..." he said with a tone of boredom. *Hassan wont tell us who he is talking to..* he thought as he began to walk away.* - Thu Sep 10 17:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) wouldn't get involved because four people is rediculous.* - Thu Sep 10 23:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) shrugged off the cinematics, quickly making his way towards Kiba. "Hey there Kiba, how have you been? Did you watch the mess that just happened?"* - Fri Sep 11 00:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) whispers: Is she always like that? - Fri Sep 11 00:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) quickly scratched an itch behind his ear, turning towards Kida. "So, Kiba, have you progressed in your training?" he asked squinting slightly.* - Fri Sep 11 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) stretched his arms slightly before looking around. "So...."* - Fri Sep 11 00:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) began to walk around Kida, making sure he was moving in a typical "trying to be sneaky" method with his tippy toes softly touching the earthen terrain. Of course all of his steps could be heard as he had zero practice when it came to canceling out the sound of his footsteps. "So Kida, I haven't seen you train...are you sure you're training?" he asked as he still tried to sneakly walk around even though it wasn't working at all..

As he walked, he made sure to control each of his leg's movements feel the pull and tug of the muscles in each limb. These were baby steps of course as he wanted to master the art of sneaky walking and before one could do that, they must learn the basics. *I have the right shoes and socks...right?* he thought as he looked down below to make sure he was wearing a rather light pair of shoes.* - Fri Sep 11 00:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) continued to walk circles around Kida, the echoes of each step apparent to any and all who were paying attention in the square. This wasn't a test and Mizumi knew he had nothing to prove at the moment, he had time and he was going to take up as many precious seconds as he needed. "You're kind of quiet." he said in reference to Tethys, but he was probably in his own little world.

By now Mizumi had performed about five revolutions around Kida, no change in his method of movement and of course no change in the pitch of each step he took. "You know...trying to walk silently is harder than it looks." he said to himself, although making it audible enough for Kida and the others to hear if they bothered to actively pay attention.* - Fri Sep 11 01:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) let out a bothersome sigh as he was already growing slightly tired and bored. Having to walk around Kida, revolution after revolution was going to stain his psyche with this amount of boredom. That's when it dawned on him...he could multi-task...right? Multi-tasking was a thing....Totaly was.

He reached into his backpouch as he continued to do that signature trying to be sneaky walk. He pulled out a simple gray book, no title or image on the cover. On the spine, the embroidered words, "Sneaky Ducks" stretched across the remainder of the spine. "I have a book, you see..." he began as he flipped open the book to a few pages in, of course on Chapter one.


"Chapter one is titled, 'How to Walk' ", he said with a slight grin on his face. "Isn't that rather funny?" he asked as he read diligently making sure to look up after every few lines to make sure he was still walking circles around Kida. He would on occassion bumb into the pour boy before going back to walking around him.* - Fri Sep 11 01:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) was quickly focused on reading, feeding his mind and eyes to the literature trapped between the bindings of the book. "You know, the book says that wearing black makes you innately sneaky..." he said as if blurting out this sudden piece of information would help Kida with his own training. Mizumi would take a break from molesting the text with his eyes to make sure he was wearing black, "Check." he said as he continued back to reading.

"Yes I am. This is quite delightful....Who wouldn't find a book exilerating?" he asked looking at Kida with curious eyes. His steps still making the same amount of noise as when he started. "You know...you could be training right now.....Give me fifty pushups!" he shouted...or tried to shout..His voice didn't really go that high so it just sounded like he was stating that rather loudly. Nevertheless he continued to walk and read his book.

He had gotten to chapter two, "How to Step" which talked about the fundamentals of arching your feet and walking on your tippy toes. One could argue that this book was taken from the kids section of the academy, but that person would be wrong and most likely slapped by how rediculous they sounded. Mizumi continued to read, changing his movement and arc of his feet in order to better position his feet....it seemed the book may have been working.* - Fri Sep 11 01:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had continued on with his book, his rather extreme studious nature helping me remain focused on the words infront of him. He was now on chapter three, "Posture is Proposterous" which talked about how ones posture affected how one stepped which in turn meant it would affect the sound they made with each step. This really interested Mizumi, which was the whole point of this whole thing. "You know, Kida, you should also start doing this super sneaky training I'm doing...would help" he said with a koi smile.

Mizumi took note of his current posture, his back arced, and his hands somewhat close to his chest. It was overall a sore sight to behold. Taking notes from his book, he began to adjust his back and arms, positioning them in more comfortable and overall healthier positions. 


Continued to speedily walk around Kida, unsure if he was going to take his advice to heart and start training. Overall, Mizumi had progressed in the time he had taken to read a few chapters and walk around Kida. At the beginning, his steps were somewhat loud and obnoxious, echoing across the couryard with each step of his overused sandals. Now, his feet seemed to scratch the rocky ground making slight brushes and taps. It was progress nonetheless.* - Fri Sep 11 01:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) took brief breaks from his rather interesting novel to look at Kida. "are....Are you following me? that's not nice...that's kind of annoying." he said giving him eye squints that would indicate that silent walking was his thing, not Kidas. "Do you even go here? Like Honestly..." he smirked as he went back to reading while now walking around nothing...that is if Kida was in fact walking in circles as well.

Mizumi had made a decision and skipped chapter four, "How to sneak in Jordans" mainly because he didn't own a pair and wasn't thinking about buying any in the near future. He then skipped over to chapter five, "how to know if you sneaky af." Which talked about the several scenarios that sneaking would be very useful.

It seemed to be very common knowledge, spying...hiding..that sort of junk. But what really caught Mizumi's eye was the parts about hiding. He liked hiding...it was fun and overall thrilling. If he could sneak around without making a noise, his hide and seek game would be the strongest in the village. That's when he noticed the last sentence of the chapter. 'How to use sneaking with various enviorenemts: See chapter 8'. This prompted him to flip to that chapter immediately.* - Fri Sep 11 01:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) was deep into the contents of his book, barely noticing Kida had began to perform the same type of training he had been doing. he halted in his tracks closing the book immediately. "I knew it...you're copying me...Copy cat...Copy cat Ninja..." he said  giving him more eye squints. 

He shrugged, not really minding Kida having copied his training. "You know, I could let you borrow my book if you wanted...." he stated offering up his book while still walking around. He needed to =step= up his game and reading this book wasn't going to accomplish that. He had an idea already in mind but he didn't want to carry the weight of the book anymore.

he began to move faster and faster in the same circle he had been running in this entire time. He wanted to see how his movements would echo out into the courtyard at these rapid speeds. With all his training, it was noticeable that his training had come some type of way seeing as how his movements and steps weren't as loud as he orignally was. * - Fri Sep 11 01:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) continued to run, although since Mizumi was naturally a slow person, it wasn't as fast as one would think it to be. He had lost interest in Kida seeing as how he was ignoring him even though he wanted to help him in his endeavors...seeing as how they were the same as his. Anyways...Mizumi continued to run, making sure his steps planted themselves firmly and at an angle that would reduce any to all noise.

It seemed to be working, lasting a few minutes at a time with silent running as he decided to break free from the consistent revolutions he was doing since the beginning. He needed to change it up as he performed a few handseals whilst he ran. Upon completion he released a stream of water creating several puddles. "Now I can see if I can run on water without making a sound."

He liked the challenge a lot, preparing himself mentally as he aimed his running direction towards the puddles. As he ran, he would try and focus chakra into his footsteps effectively performing the Suimen technique. He wanted to simulate something he might end up doing in the near future. As he ran across the first few puddles, he made audible splashes signaling he wasn't at that level, but he wasn't ready to give up.* - Fri Sep 11 02:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) knew he needed to complete his excessive sessions and mastery of the art of silent movement. He had tracked his footstep and overall movement of his body making sure it had followed the book's advice to a tee. On land, it seemed he was invinsible when in the matter that he made no sound on rock, grass, or any form of terrain really. There was only one thing he had no idea if he could conquer and that was water.

He was able to walk on water meaning that he could quite possible make no sound when he walked on it. No more splashing or sounds that could give him away if he was sneaking on water. He arrived at the lake, a staple when it came to his training. "Alright..." he said calmly as he allowed chakra to rush to the bottom of his feet. "It's now or never..." he said as he dashed towards the water's surface prepared to make as much noise as he possibly could. 

To his surprise, he stepped softly onto the water, regardless of how quick he was moving. The surface of the water made no sound as each step brought him further into the center of the water. He looked down, his feet gently patting at the surface as his movements went completely mute. "I did it..." He mumbled as he continued to run atop the water without a single sound being heard. "I will be the invisible man...one day.." he said vowing to rape Zeno's decision of making his technique a higher skill rank.* - Fri Sep 11 14:56:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: It's as easy as checking to make sure no landmines were set off by wild animals. - Fri Sep 11 15:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Right...Can we have a map then? - Fri Sep 11 15:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: A map of where all the landmines are burried? - Fri Sep 11 15:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Ok Mizumi, Guess we better get started. - Fri Sep 11 15:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Hassan, I'm not entirely sure if you've met Zetsumo before. - Fri Sep 11 15:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Maybe I should fill you in on his abilities. - Fri Sep 11 15:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded, quickly swiping the map from Tethys' grasp. "Lets head to the land bridge first..." he said making his way towards the exit of the courtyard.* - Fri Sep 11 15:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Mizumi - Fri Sep 11 15:34:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: Pass the map real quick, I want to memorize where the landmines are. - Fri Sep 11 15:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: If you check one direction and I do the other, it'll be quicker - Fri Sep 11 15:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) made his way towards the land bridge, making sure to follow the map that seemed to have several small 'x's scrawled onto various portions of Kirigakure. Without hesitating he gave the map to Himura. "Right..well, there's a good amount near the landbridge...I'll do those...you can do the rest," he said as he turned his back on Himura. "got it?"* - Fri Sep 11 15:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) dashed onwards, saving time by running past rivers and who knows what else. Arriving at the landbridge, he could notice there were several guards patrolling and guarding the entrance to the village hidden in the mist. He knew that if anything happened, they could and probably would, easily come and help him.
Nevertheless, he began to formulate a plan that would keep him safe incase something did happen. Remembering the map he once held, he remembered the exact place of the five landmines located on the strip of land that lead to the other nations.

Performing a single handseal, the nearby water released four figures that quickly took the shape and appearance of Mizumi marking the completiong and precise execution of the Water Clone technique. THEN his radio started buzzing that Tethys requested them back. Mizmui gave Himura a quick radio call to meet at the square.* - Fri Sep 11 15:42:43 2015
