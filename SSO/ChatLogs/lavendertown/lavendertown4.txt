"Why...Why did you do this.." he said projecting towards the criminal. "You will now lose your life.." he said pushing the man onto the ground infront of the water.* - Sun Sep 20 01:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) without hesitating, he pushed the the mans head into the water, holding it in position whilst he drank as much water as possible before eventually drowning.* - Sun Sep 20 01:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) turned towards Fujitora. "M-Mas...." he stopped. He had almost let slip a rank he was not ready to give. "Mister Fujitora...Can we finish the training we had started several days ago?" he asked wanting to get as prepared as possible before getting revenge for his fallen comrade and brother. * - Sun Sep 20 01:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: In time...I may even give you a certain gift as well.. - Sun Sep 20 01:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Though hardly anyone here is a close up fighter aside myself and the swordsmen. - Sun Sep 20 01:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: You're right Koeiki. - Sun Sep 20 01:57:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Our greatest advantage is the water. - Sun Sep 20 01:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: We have many wild beast within it and we can use them against the attackers. - Sun Sep 20 01:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: You are correct on that one.  - Sun Sep 20 01:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Koeki(ZuuZuu) says: But I have something important to tell you. - Sun Sep 20 01:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: That's easier said than done. - Sun Sep 20 02:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Not at all. - Sun Sep 20 02:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Hassan is quite proficient, if not a master, of the Wind element. - Sun Sep 20 02:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: He could easily alter the winds around Kirigakure or even the battlefield, making it dangerous if not hazerdous to fly. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: But he also has a limit. - Sun Sep 20 02:03:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Wind and Water for stronger water attacks. - Sun Sep 20 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Raiton and Suiton are more effective.. - Sun Sep 20 02:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Not really...Wind powered Suitin could easily negate the Raiton in that combination. - Sun Sep 20 02:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: suiton* - Sun Sep 20 02:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Raiton conducts Suiton regardless. - Sun Sep 20 02:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Unless Hassan is the one providing us with the Fuuton and Suiton combination it'll still conduct Raiton.. - Sun Sep 20 02:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Otome, Setsuna(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: It's not good enough. - Sun Sep 20 02:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Im only good with close range fighting... If I can get close to him I tould try to fight him hand to hand... - Sun Sep 20 02:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) sighed. *This is pointless..* he thought as he turned around. *Wont be much longer anyways...** - Sun Sep 20 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well I need my rest. - Sun Sep 20 02:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) disappeared in a poof of smoke. Would use the verb but a nigga aint give it to me, smh....But before he poofs, he looks over towards Koeki. 


"Any more criminals that need to be dealt with?"* - Sun Sep 20 02:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "Thank you...have fun sparring." in which he poofed away.* - Sun Sep 20 02:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) placed his hands together, forming a single seal. In a puff of smoke, an exact clone of Mizumi would appear before him. "It seems I've done quite a better job of this jutsu.." he said thinking of how dumb tethys was to not use such a valuable jutsu. Within seconds, the clone would disappear as it would be the one to escort the being to Konohagakure.* - Sun Sep 20 02:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would meet the blacksmith outside the village before departing towards their destination.* - Sun Sep 20 02:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Continued on his path, passing through several small villages, making sure to keep a watchful eye on the blacksmith and his property. It would be a rocky trip, making sure to avoid walking by the known camps of Zetzumo's army.* - Sun Sep 20 02:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had taken a short cut along a flooded straight. It lead exactly into a lake near Konohagakure. It wouldn't take long for the duo to arrive at the gates of Konohagakure. As they reached the gates, a rather large cat-like creature possibly a tiger appeared. Without hesitating, Mizumi released a large ball of fire, as well as a bullet of fire from his mouth combining to incinerate the cat into nothingness.


"Here you are....I don't know why you want to be in Konohagakure...but...Here you go.." he said leading him to a nearby shop.* - Sun Sep 20 02:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) simply allowed himself to poof away.* - Sun Sep 20 02:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had been back so quickly because he had sent a Shadow Clone, something Tethys was too bad to do. # Sweg.

He would nod toward the possibly still sparring Koeki to signify a mission complete.* - Sun Sep 20 02:41:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) seemed fine for the most part, spending a good amount of time meditating in the tower hiidden amongst the forest. It wasnt the most lucritive place to be, but it was far away from the place he thought was home, but was really just a prison of dispair. "Tethys....I know deep inside I should have gone with you....but why...WHY did you have to go!" he shouted slamming his fist into  nearby wall. His hand turning to water just before crashing against the stone wall.* - Wed Sep 23 12:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gritted his teeth. He had slowly grown into the realization that he was furious with his late brother and teacher. It was his fault...it had to be. Mizumi warned him and he had every technique available to him to keep him alive. "He did it on purpose!' he shouted into the wind.* - Wed Sep 23 12:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) shouts, "RAWWWWWGHHHHH!"* - Wed Sep 23 12:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Performed a single handseal causing a puff of smoke to appear beside him. Once the smoke cleared, it was a shadow clone of the user, Mizumi.  "Go to Kirigakure...Take note of what's happening." he said to it as it disappeared, heading towards the village.


The real mizumi would remain in the tower, meditating and safe.* - Wed Sep 23 17:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would land onto the ground, having been hopping rooftop to rooftop till he eventually landed at the square's entrance which seemed to be inhabited by who knows what. It seemed to be a fight of sorts, but he was in no place to start fights or better yet, join a fight.He awaited patiently.* - Wed Sep 23 18:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked over towards the black haired boy, having lost interest in the waste of space that was the masked figure. "You, boy...Where can I find someone that can do something about hair..." he said, having forgotten where the barber was.* - Wed Sep 23 18:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Sighed. "So...who are you?" he asked the boy who didn't seem to respond the last time he said anything to him. Of course he was referring to Sabo.* - Wed Sep 23 19:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) simply said, "Right." before beginning to walk away. There was nothing of importance here, nor were there anything he needed to do. It seemed to Mizukage wasn't there and therefore he needn't be there as well. Having taken a few steps forward, he reached into his pocket pulling out a singular red object. With a tug, it was torn open summoning a brownish substance from its opening. With a single bite of the chocolate, he tossed it behind him. There would now be a perfectly good chocolate bar with a single bite taken from it laying on the ground, because fuck Africans who have nothing to eat.* - Wed Sep 23 19:08:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's squinted towards Mitsuru, the scroll still in his hand. "You're right," he said extending the scroll in hand outwards. His chakra would flow towards his scroll baring hand quickly igniting the scroll, burning it to a small pile of ash which he then let fall to the floor. "Thank you though."* - Wed Sep 23 19:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Now then. I'm off. - Wed Sep 23 19:16:03 2015

"Fujitora," he began, his voice firm and matured, "It's time to continue the training. You have been slipping and I need to learn more."* - Wed Sep 23 21:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would be grabbed by the neck, without even attempting to back away. As he was grabbed, his chakra would begin to course through his body in preparation for what he thought was a punch or a simple choke. When the tanto attempted to connect with his femur, it would instead pass through his body as he had transformed his body into liquid allowing him to be unscathed by the attack. At that moment, he formed a single tiger seal as fast as he possibly could before releasing a jet of intense fire from his mouth from this close proximity making it hard for the shinobi to avoid getting at least singed if not by the fire itself but the heat radiating from it.* - Sat Sep 26 05:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) heard a sudden shout from nearby, quickly noticing a man with what seemed to be ranking official clothing. He halted in his attack meaning he wasn't just hit with lightning, but instead jumped back a bit. "Control your dog." he said reaching behind his back to pull out a tanto; holding it firmly in his left hand. * - Sat Sep 26 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) sighed, his vision still on the garbs of the man, trying to distinguish what rank he was.  "Names are such a drag...See, I didn't even ask for yours," he said tanto still in hand. With his free hand, his right one fyi, he would form the seal of confrontation before using the moisture in the air, as well as the moisture released from his mouth, which spewed out from behind the mask, to create a blanket of mist in the immediate area, in an attempt to blind the many that were there. If successful, he would try to disappear as best he could amongst the mist.

*Where was he again...one...two...four clicks away?* he would think to himself before rushing over towards Mamoru in an attempt to give a quick swipe of the tanto aimed at striking his right arm, near the shoulder. Nothing drastic, just a quick cut.* - Sat Sep 26 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) felt his tanto clash with the ginger's blade, quickly releasing the grip he had on his weapon allowing it to be sent downward into the ground as he heard the familar sound of fire being created. Because he gave way with his weapon, Mamoru would surely continue with his eastward strike unless he was able to quickly stop his swing. Now that he had his hands free, he would place them together forming a single seal, something he loved, jutsus with only one seal, just when Ushinawa's technique vaporized the surrounding mist. 

The figure would channel as much chakra as it could muster before opening his mouth behind the mask. The water that rushed out quickly broke the mask causing his lower half of his face to be revealed (basically nostrils down). The force and rate at which the water was being produced  was shocking as it even pushed the masked being upwards into the sky as more and more water was released. In seconds, more and more water would  come out, the shinobi immediately next to him would surely be launched quite a few ways away if not knocked out by the crashing and swirling waves. The water would also surely shield the shinobi from Hanabi's unsuspected attack seeing as how he wouldn't be in his original position and waves would be rushing towards her. (Zeno said 1 use covers 20 tiles...used it Twice.)* - Sat Sep 26 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would be kicked back before being rained down by several projectiles unknown to him. As they impaled him, the figure would simply explode in a puff of smoke, revealing that it wasn't an actual person.* - Sat Sep 26 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) quickly formed a single handseal that would cause a shadow clone to appear. "Go back to Kumogakure..." the real Mizumi had said causing the shadow clone to quickly run to Kumogakure, mask on hand.* - Mon Sep 28 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Hi. - Mon Sep 28 00:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) was suddenly stopped by a masked being, taking the time to look at every curve and crack of said mask. With a deep sigh, he managed to speak up from behind the cofines of his mask, "Ugh...I'll tell you my name if you trade me....My mask for yours...Yes?"* - Mon Sep 28 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would suddenly be struck by the raiton technique causing the shadow clone to immediately pop with a small display of smoke. #SoMean* - Mon Sep 28 00:40:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) Returned to his now home, panting from his exhaustion. He would walk over to the mote, quickly scooping up a cup of water before drinking it. He popped open a bag of chips and began to eat it. "Those Kumo shinobi are ruthless."* - Mon Sep 28 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) began to meditate, preparing himself mentally and physically for what was needed to happen. He would need to find a way into Kumogakure without being attacked on the spot.* - Mon Sep 28 01:07:50 2015
