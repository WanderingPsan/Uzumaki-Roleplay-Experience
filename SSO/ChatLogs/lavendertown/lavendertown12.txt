<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "Right. I knew that. Testing you." he stated before turning to follow Ichiro. "We got this, leggo!"* - Tue Nov  3 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Ugh.. - Tue Nov  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: You could have woken me up. - Tue Nov  3 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) rushed in behind Ichiro, making sure to pay attention to the surroundings and the barrier that defended their goal. Noticing Ichiro going after a structure to the east, and a similar structure being in the west. Deciding that he had to go after that one instead, he ran over towards the structure, making sure he kept a look out in case something flew out of the barrier. 

Forming a single handseal, a shadow clone was formed near Mizumi, as both began preparations to take on the structure.* - Tue Nov  3 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) *Asteroth ||In the group's approach, they;d fiond that things were mildly different.'

For example, at the entrance, there would be no opposition -- as any opponents had been dealt with in a previous meeting. Instead, the bulk of the village's protection seemed to be geared towards the north, where most of the forces laid about. The barrier, spawned of Holy Energy, is still fully in effect.

It's transluscent, able to be seen through like glass. Although, there was the coloration of yellow ona nything that was seen through it. On top of this, there were now two pillars constructed towards the west and east - no doubt to strengthen said barricade of ethereal nature. Of course, the group  of Ichiro and Mizumi would be more than capable of taking notice of the horde of men that remained behind.

All in all, fifteen of the forces were Priestess, while the other thirty-five were Necromancers, each with different areaso f expertise. Some excelled in close-ranged combat, others were support and had to be protected. Nevertheless, they were all seemingly prepared to fight to the deeath if the situation lead to it. "You all shall not pass! In just a few moments, Lord Roth's experiment will reach completion!"*)* - Tue Nov  3 03:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) watched as his clone rushed into the path of the lightning hoping to sacrifice itself; drawing in most of the lightning causing it to immediately disperse into smoke. *That was annoying...* he thought before forming five handseals rapidly in front of his chest. Upon completion, he began to spew fire that coiled and balled itself, growing and growing into a ball of fire almost two times the size of mizumi. It's strength already causing a crater where it was forming. Upon completion, the ball was released at the pillar in hopes of obliterating it with the intensity and destructive force of the fireball jutsu.

After the ball of fire was released, he formed the seal of conffrontation, spewing moisture from his mouth which quickly cooled. The cooled moisture formed mist, blanketing the field and himself in chakra infused cover. Hopefully it would make it harder for them to see and therefore aim at him.* - Tue Nov  3 04:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had been standing amongst the mist when a sudden rush of energy flew past him. It must have been the bolts like last time, instinctively rubbing his shoulder where it last hit. They didn't hurt him before, but they were bothersome then...more now that he wanted to finish this mission. Forming a single handseal, six clones would be formed in front of him, two of which instantly got struck by the bolts causing them to disperse.

The four remaining clones would rush towards the flickering barrier, arms flailing as if to intimidate or scare anyone who saw them or even pass the barrier if possible. If they did pass the barrier, they would try to distract or at least smack into the priests.

Mizumi would try to run towards Sado.* - Tue Nov  3 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's clones would instantly be obliterated from the explosion of light and mystical ninjutsu. Being taken back by the sudden quake of the earth, he made sure he was a good enough distance from where the barrier was before clapping his hands together to summon his shield made purely of water. It would be used to protect him from any damage or rogue jutsu that had been flung at him, or at least reduce the damage.* - Tue Nov  3 06:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) formed a single handseal, releasing more mist from his mouth as he used it to disguise his movements. He rushed up towards the Eastern building, gaining enough distance to more than likely not trigger a booby trap. Once there, he formed a single handseal causing a large sized lake to flow out from his mouth as it was aimed at the remaining Eastern building. It was used to immediately crash through the front door, and flood the entirety of the building. If successful, it would either destroy most if not all of the traps that were inside, almost completely knocking down the building, or make quick work of anyone inside and causing the contents of said building to pour out of windows or through the front door when the technique was complete.* - Tue Nov  3 07:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 07:08:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) saw that purple smoke, immediately thinking it was poison. He jumped back before clapping his hands together causing a rush of water to swirl and spin around him like a dome. It was to protect himself from the foreign smoke, but would also help against any debris or falling weaponry as he held the jutsu in place not knowing how long the smoke would last or if it was dangerous.* - Tue Nov  3 07:41:13 2015

" she stated, closing the box, hugging it tight against her chest. "Bahahahahaha" she started to laugh as a sudden puff of smoke appeared before them. The supposed Queen was in fact Mizumi. "Thank you best friend Sado, you're so Kawaii!" he shouted before forming a single handseal and poofing away.* - Wed Nov  4 05:03:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had come onto the scene of the village, noticing it quite empty. Needing to pass the time, he simply lowered his body tot he ground and begun meditating.* - Wed Nov  4 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) walked around the outskirts of the village he now called home, realizing it was abandoned by those who inhabited it. He couldn't see nor hear a single person wh-....scratch that.,...* - Thu Nov  5 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) positioned himself on his bed, his vision fixated on his roof. The day seemed to drag on for what seemed like weeks, his illness, boredom, quickly growing and spreading.

He didn't know what to do with himself, there was spying or investigating other villages, but he didn't want to do that....It seemed as if the queen was nowhere to be found making it rather difficult to receive missions.* - Thu Nov  5 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Formed a single handseal, concentrating on the amount of chakra he was building up. In a burst of smoke, a single clone appeared before him. "Alright...So, you're here....Now I'm not lonely..." he muttered as the clone gave him an odd look. 

"Don't look at me like that...I know....But hey...Want to do something? I can make tea." he offered, watching the clone sit down on a lonesome chair nodding in agreement to the offered tea. Quickly getting up, Mizumi walked over to a pot of water he had already set. Releasing chakra into his hand, he allowed it to heat up the pot almost instantaneously. Pouring the hot water into a cup, as well as a tea bag, each waited for their tea to be ready.* - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had been waiting long enough. Both took their cups filled to the brim with tea, taking a couple of sips as to avoid spilling. "Mmm Good tea right Mizumi?" one asked.
"Right, it really is good." the other Mizumi commented, both figures sitting across from one another. It seemed he had resorted to talking to himself...to avoid confronting what he had buried deep within himself...as well as the lack of people in the village.* - Thu Nov  5 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) each finished their cup of tea before placing the dishes in the sink. 

"So, tell me about yourself, Mizumi." one asked, crossing his legs while seated.

"Oh..I'm okay I guess. You must know more about me than well...me? How are you?"* - Thu Nov  5 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) the clone shook his head briefly. "Oh you know...just passing the time...Want to play ball?" it asked to the real one, who quickly rose from his seat.

"Nah..I'm good." he stated walking over to the sink. "Wait..actually...you wash the dishes.."* - Thu Nov  5 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) the clone rushed towards the sink, quickly and eagerly beginning to wash each and every dish. 

"That's a good job you're doing there.... Keep up the good work." he stated as he laid back down onto the bed.* - Thu Nov  5 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) once the clone had finished the dishes, Mizumi quickly dispelled it causing him to be alone once more. 

"Yeah....I should really do something..." he said, but as always...he wouldn't do anything.* - Thu Nov  5 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Sighed, realizing he was back to being alone... The idea of combating his inner demons and thoughts surfaced for a second before quickly being snuffed out. "No....I don't want that....no no no!" he shouted into the emptiness of his small home.* - Thu Nov  5 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) began to question his motives, still remaining enclosed by his homes' tight walls. "I wish I was like that one guy Kuro...Yeah...He was so relaxed...you know...yeah..." he rambled on, tossing and turning in his bed. "How do I do that? No more fighting? Ughhh......Huh...."* - Thu Nov  5 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would lift his head up from his pillow before allowing it to come crashing back down. "Ughh....Do I want to do that? Ugghhh" he groaned.* - Thu Nov  5 07:30:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) ventured into the inn's lobby, quickly making his way towards the front desk. A simple smile towards the attendent was all he needed for her to quickly offer him a room free of charge. "Thank you kind lady." he stated, taking the key from her hand. He was in room 4, meaning he would be on the second floor. Without hesitating, he would leave to see his new home.* - Fri Nov  6 10:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) entered his room, it was generic in appearance. It seemed as if no one had been renting this room for quite some time. "Well...I'm going to have to redecorate..." he stated, looking at the basicness that was his new temporrary home.* - Fri Nov  6 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) Grunted, finding it a hassle to actually redecorate. "Should I just leave it....as is? I don't know these days......But...Kiri sounds like stuff is happening....I should see what that was...." he said to himself, mentally planning his upcomming trip.* - Fri Nov  6 10:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) collapsed onto his bed. "Ughhh..Okay...Trip to Kirigakure tomorrow...or the next day.....Maybe..." he stated removing all of his equipment. "Yeah...."* - Fri Nov  6 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) forming a single handseal, a clone would be formed in the exact image of technique's user. "Go to Kirigakure...see what the news is all about.." he stated watching the clone run out immediately.* - Fri Nov  6 17:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would watch Lera fly up into the sky, making sure his gaze was on her the moment she burst out of the ground. * I can't handle a giant snake...I better get on this guy's good side...* he thought. Without a single handseal, the man would spit towards Lera's floating direction, the spit transforming into a single needle of water instantly. It zipped through the air, using the force of the spit three-fold to zip through the sky in an attempt to smack her in the chest, catching her attention. If the smack was successful, it would feel as if someone punched her, doing no lethal damage whatsoever, hopefully causing her to look at him.

As the needle had been spit, he formed a single handseal before allowing his chakra to flow  into his hands.* - Fri Nov  6 19:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) watches the girl quickly get swallowed up, none of his jutsus landing, turning his attention towards his brother. *He's grown....surpassed me.....Or maybe he was always stronger....Damn it Teth-....* he stopped thinking, slamming both hands into the sides of his head, grabbing his hair tightly. *It's his fault....It is!* he shouted in his mind as he collapsed back onto the roof of the building, squirming in pain from the thoughts that slowly began to creep back. His body would roll around a bit, his teeth gritting; clenched as tight as possible.* - Fri Nov  6 20:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) had been struggling atop the roof, forcing down his emotions and thoughts. He wasn't scared of facing anything at the moment, quickly getting up and jumping off the building, forming a single handseals as he did so. Releasing a good amount of water from the opening in his mask. It was aimed at Lera's general direction, not intending to hit her with it, but get the area around her wet.

As he landed, he formed three handseals utilizing the water that had been spread about the area that Lera was at. The water would converge around her, spiralling in an attempt to enclose her in a sphere made completely of water; The agent's right hand placed inside the sphere to maintain its structural integrity. If successful, lera would be trapped in a prison made of water, making it increasingly hard to breath, and the density of the water making it almost impossible to move. *Lets play a game of chicken! Maybe You die...Maybe we both get crushed by the snake!* he shouted within his mind* - Fri Nov  6 20:57:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ghost Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well ain't this a fun bout. - Fri Nov  6 20:58:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) smirked realizing the girl had screwed herself over. She would be seemingly trapped in the sphere of water instantly stopping her attacks. Because the water's density was so immensly heavy, it would already cause a normal being to be unable to move at all, but seeing as how she coated herself in what seemed to be a type of earthen ninjutsu, one he had only seen a few times, would make ehr even more heavy, causing her body to be more than likely fixed in place.

While stil maintaining the jutsu, using his free hand, he formed the seal of confrontation causing water to gush from his mouth. As it fell to the floor, three water clones would take shape, quickly rising and forming around the girl as they prepared themselves.* - Fri Nov  6 21:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would be ready to strike the girl now that his prison had dispersed, that is if he could move. He was frozen in place, unable to move a single limb, but that didn't stop his clones. Clone two and three would immediately begin to form a string of handseals, using their own bodies as a source of water. Clone three would attempt to cast the water prison technique around Lera whilst the Second clone did the same, this time, forming the jutsu around the first prison forming a double sided prison. The clones themselves wouldn't feel much from the blast of wind seeing as how the wall of water Ikaro had erected would soften much of the blow. The first clone would turn 180 degrees looking at Ikaro and his petrified snake. Forming three handseals, the clone would launch a torrent of water towards the man, more than likely losing force by the time it reached him.* - Fri Nov  6 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) couldn't stop himself, his actions being performed on their own. *What is this sorcery....Not even Sad-* he stopped thinking as he flung his tanto forward towards Clone 2. Seeing as how Lera had disappeared, the clones canceld their attempt at forming water prisons as the tanto immediately phased through the water clone as if nothing had happened. That's when Mizumi would begin to walk towards Index, his rather fragile body unable to physically break out from the constraint that seemed to hold him out of sight. *How is this even happening...what is holding me...* he continued to thinking trying to understand what was happening.

Clone 1 would have been destroyed by the electricty that traveled down the water technique it had used causing it to burst into a puddle. Clone 2 and three would turn their focus onto Index, rushing towards him. As Mizumi was now in front of Index, kunai threatening to to kill him, he smiled. "Cocky...See...you're lucky....You will be the first one to witness my technique." he said as Index had finished speaking, but before he said 'Exit stage left'.

A sudden rush of chakra would expel itself from Mizumi's front, no need for handseals, as this immense force would more than likely be impossible to detect unless they were a skilled sensor type. Although this Mizumi was't as strong, it would surely be enough to blow away the intruder and break whatever spell or curse was holding Mizumi in this trance.* - Fri Nov  6 22:23:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would suddenly be launched back, sliding against the ground. It was nothing to worry about, as he quickly got up. The clones had already been ready to take action, clone two nearly out of chakra would perform a single handseal before releasing a large amount of water from its mouth. The water would crash down onto the ground before rushing towards Index in a six foot wave, unable to generate enough water; the clone disappeared, using itself up in the process because of the lack of chakra. The wave itself would be wide and large enough to catch the flaming vortex, quickly killing it.

The third clone would come to Mizumi's side, prepared to act or strike, defending its owner. If the fire hadn't been put out, this clone would quickly smack its hands together causing water to be formed around both Mizumi and the clone in a swirling dome that would more than likely stop the fire and cut the shadow connection without both mizumis knowing that's what had done it.* - Fri Nov  6 22:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would somehow, illogically be burned, causing Mizumi to burst in a puff of smoke, seeing as how this shadow clone was unable to withstand the force of of the fire and the damage it sustained. The water clones themselves would dispel, turning into puddles giving the appearance that he was never there at all....except for the water...but we can blame that on Ikaro......* - Fri Nov  6 23:04:57 2015

"That's enough....I've had it ignoring my feelings....my memories....I don't want to be like this anymore....I don't!" he shouted into the open space of his room.  He made his way, kneeling onto the ground, allowing hismelf to sit on his legs and feet. He closed his eyes, having remember he left the door locked. "I don't want to hate him anymore....I don't..." he muttered, talking about Tethys of course.* - Fri Nov  6 23:16:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's eyes remained closed, his mind quickly wandering around his past memories. Tethys' image forcing its way to the surface. His face forging itself in rampaging storm that was his mind. "Why...Why did you leave..." he muttered as he tried to remain calm, taking in deep breaths in this meditative stance. "I'm not angry anymore....I'm not...." he stated releasing a deep sigh.* - Fri Nov  6 23:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would slowly watch the image of Tethys fade away in his mind, he had begun to accept Tethys' death, releasing the restraints on the anger and resentment he had for his master....his father. He liked the peacefulness of his meditative stance, causing him to remain there, meditating, waiting to see if Tethys appeared before him once more; he would surely be ready.* - Fri Nov  6 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) had arrived onto the scene, leaving the peaceful confines of his room. "So. There's a new Mizukage and some turmoil occurred....Yeah." he stated, his demeanor a tad bit more serious than normal. It seemed as if he was beginning to lose his rather comical way about him.* - Sat Nov  7 00:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Oh?!~ - Sat Nov  7 00:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I should go meet them. - Sat Nov  7 00:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) scratched at his head just slightly. "There was a bit of trouble....You know Ortho right? Well....He summoned a gigantic snake and all hell broke loose. That boy Index showed up and attacked me....Please...I know you have some connection with him....Control him or who knows what might happen..." he finished saying, looking over  towards Sado. "Be careful if you do."* - Sat Nov  7 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Mizumi-kun..there's no need to worry about me.. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: That boy, Index..knows not to attack me. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I've met this.."Ortho" if you're referring to the man connected to that giant snake. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I had my mask on...So who knows if he knew it was me... - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: He's seen my mask. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: We've met in Konohagakure. - Sat Nov  7 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Why did Index attack you? - Sat Nov  7 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) shrugged. "I was attacking this girl, I don't know her name...but she was causing a bit of trouble. That's when he attacked me....He trapped me in some type of genjutsu...I don't know...Whatever he did, I would mimic." he said, not understanding what kind of technique it was.* - Sat Nov  7 00:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And what type of trouble was she causing? - Sat Nov  7 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: All of this was in Kirigakure, by the by? - Sat Nov  7 00:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Yup. - Sat Nov  7 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: She was being rather aggressive towards the Mizukage and Ortho. - Sat Nov  7 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. And back to the first question. -- Who is the Mizukage? - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I didn't catch a name. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Or he said it... - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: I just don't remember it. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: An appearance will work too. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: the Mizukage robes... - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: and the blue hat. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: face somewhat covered. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course. Well, Nigen. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Go check for me. - Sat Nov  7 00:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded, walking over towards Sado. "Be careful..." he said trying to place his hand on the man's shoulder. "Come back intact.."* - Sat Nov  7 00:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hmph. - Sat Nov  7 01:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded as well. "I know...I shouldn't be worried...but...I am...Here." he began, digging his hand into his back pouch. Within seconds he pulled out a crude-looking ruby. "I got this from one of my very first missions for Amegakure....If I give it to you...You have to come back and give it to me...So...In a way..I know you're coming back." he stated, his newfound meditation regime making him slightly more compassionate.* - Sat Nov  7 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: This bitch just got my name wrong....I thought we had something.... - Sat Nov  7 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: -omit- - Sat Nov  7 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Welp! - Sat Nov  7 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at her oddly. "Huh? I feel fine.." he said, shoving the ruby back towards Sado. "Take it!"* - Sat Nov  7 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) began to walk away a bit. "I....I think I'm going to go lie down a bit..." he said making his way into the woods because he liked to nap there.....OKAY!?* - Sat Nov  7 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked over to Asteroth. "I couldn't nap..." he stated still looking at her. "How have you been?"* - Sat Nov  7 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Well. - Sat Nov  7 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And you? - Sat Nov  7 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a confident nod. "I've been doing a bit of meditation...I feel a little bit more at ease....A lot more relaxed that's for sure..." he said giving her a polite little smile. "Have you been practicing your form?"* - Sat Nov  7 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a little laugh. "So i've been told...I don't know...I felt too reckless...Don't you think?" he asked making his way towards her, standing up near her.* - Sat Nov  7 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) took in a deep breath before releasing everything. "Right. Well, I've been working on dealing with some stuff...No need to be alarmed." he said with a playful laugh.* - Sat Nov  7 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What compelled you to be in Kirigakure, by the way? - Sat Nov  7 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) shrugged a little. "The news of a new Mizukage, I couldn't pass off seeing if Kirie actually died, and maybe I could befriend the new Kage." he said answering his Queen's question honestly.* - Sat Nov  7 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. Makes sense. Does he seem friendly? - Sat Nov  7 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) says: Mm...Didn't get to speak to him much - Sat Nov  7 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: On a side note. You claim this 'Ortho' guy is responsible for the chaos. - Sat Nov  7 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Yet he was there as you were? - Sat Nov  7 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) shook his head a little. "It was Index and this female that caused the chaos. Ortho was just helping." he said trying to calirfy what had happened. "Then Hogo, Ikaro joined in and it got even more messy."* - Sat Nov  7 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. .. I suppose this is the friend Index told me of. - Sat Nov  7 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: The one that's wanted by Suna. Thus forcing his departure. - Sat Nov  7 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Or so I assume. - Sat Nov  7 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Seems like trouble. . the last thing I want is for Index to get dragged through mud over some harlot. - Sat Nov  7 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded with a little laugh. " Right. She should be stopped....but I think The Mizukage might be holding her." he said crossing his arms in front of his chest. "May I ask where you have been? I know it's none of my business...but....I haven't seen you in a while."* - Sat Nov  7 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) wasn't even shocked at this point, having realized something fishy had been going on. " S-spells?" he asked trying to get some confirmation or better yet, reinforcement.

* - Sat Nov  7 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a quick smile. "I like interesting." he said giving her a quick look. "Magic is so mysterious...at least I would think...I've never really heard of that type of thing....is that was Sado uses? Does Index do that?" he asked wondering if everyone but him uses magic. 


"Does Ichiro?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "I promise not to mention anything to anyone. I wouldn't want anyone coming after you...." he said remaining quiet afterwards. "Yukio is also a magic user?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) reached up to rub the side of his head, ruffeling his hair just a bit "Ugh...Magic....Sounds so complicated..." he said laughing awkwardly just a bit. 

"Hey, so I wanted to let you know that I'm trying to become a sensor-type so I can start helping the village in that way." he said with a smile scrawling over his face. "Sound good?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) looked at her with an odd expression. "I've heard of it.....Never tried it...but..how did you get such a scroll?" he asked rather intrigued. "And...what kinds of books do you have?"* - Sat Nov  7 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) gave a soft sigh, lowering his body onto the soft, crisp grass. He sat, legs crossed as he began to take in breaths before exhaling everything. "You know, I like reading books too." he said giving a small laugh.* - Sat Nov  7 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) 's eyes widened as did his smile, filled with excitement. "Oh wow, thank you my Queen. I promise to not give this to anyone." he stated , quickly rising from the ground. "I promise to keep it hidden." he said, taking the scroll. * - Sat Nov  7 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mhm. It should be  useful. Although. . you won't be able to use your ninjutsu while suppressed. - Sat Nov  7 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "Of course...Of course...Thank you. This will surely help me with my attempts at being a proficient sensor...When I hone my skills, I could keep this village even more secure." he said, smiling as he unravelled the scroll he had received. "This is so...interesting...You can perform this technique...right?" he asked just to clarify.* - Sat Nov  7 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) nodded. "Amazing...Well...I will have to take a look at this jutsu scroll later when I'm bored. Again...Thank you for trusting me enough to share this technique with me. " he said rolling the scroll back before placing it into his backpouch.* - Sat Nov  7 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Of course, of course. Least that can be done for the man that saved my life. - Sat Nov  7 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) placed his hand behind his neck. "Haha...Right...No problem." he said with a laugh. "Would do it again if needed."* - Sat Nov  7 03:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) watched her leave, his gaze almost like a trance. Suddenly, his attention refocused as his queen gave him a command. "Your highness...I'm sorry but...After that chaos in Kirigakure...I've been left a bit...injured...Not physically of course...be my energy is nowhere near at an acceptable level...." he said hoping to not have to register.* - Sat Nov  7 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Ah. A pity. . Seems I'll need to depend. . <*shivvers*> On Nigen. - Sat Nov  7 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Sheesh.. - Sat Nov  7 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Yura..yura toooo!~ - Sat Nov  7 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) lifted his gaze from his meditative state. Noticing that everyone was loitering around, he decided not to waste any time and simply go back to meditating in a different location.* - Sun Nov  8 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) sat himself down near the bank of the water, his body submerged up to his waist. The freshness of the water chilling him, a sensation of ice upon his skin. "So.....cold...." he stuttered as his body gradually settled. Once everything was calm and peaceful, he closed his eyes taking in a deep breath, holding it there for a moment before releasing it out into the lake. He was at peace fo the time being, allowing his chakra to flow through his body, even leaking out into the water nearby; the flow of water contiuously relaxing him.* - Sun Nov  8 02:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) continued to relax in the water, his body continuing to release small traces of chakra from his body into the water. Letting his essence blend into the water, without using his transformation technique of course. His mind picturing his surroundings, the water rushing and crashing along rocks and other structures that stuck out from the water's surface. His senses slowly opening more and more each second he spent in the water. *Allow my chakra to spread...so......sooothing...** - Sun Nov  8 02:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Come on.. - Mon Nov  9 01:52:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Suimu, Mizumi(LavenderTown) would note that that nigga wasn't even looking in this direction, and the fence was taller than his body.* - Mon Nov  9 01:56:28 2015
