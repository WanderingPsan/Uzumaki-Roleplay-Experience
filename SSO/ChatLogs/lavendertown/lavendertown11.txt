<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Ichiro(Master Roku) says: .... - Sun Nov  1 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) scratched the side of his head. "So.....This Bush Village...."* - Sun Nov  1 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Maybe.. - Sun Nov  1 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) had been trailing behind Ichiro, relentlessly waiting for them to arrive at the desired village. His weight making it almost impossible to move, but it was the training he required...movement. As they trudged along, he removed more and more weight from his person to allow better movement.

"Are we there yet?!" he asked annoyingly, his feet already tired. As they approached, the sight of a giant wall could be seen, and a sensation of evil along with it. *What is this...why is this feeling happening to me...* he thought, his expression of dissmay and angst hidden away behind his mask. As the appeared near the enclosed village, Zero would look to his partner, watching him form his odd jutsu.

* I got you friend.* he thought, as if he thought he could telepathically speak to him. It was obvious that this type of closed off village would have some type of patrol. As he remained perched in a nearby tree, he formed the seal of confrontation while opening his mouth. Moisture would begin to expell from the hole in his mask out into the open, quickly cooling into a blanket of mist that seemed to sprawl across the entrance to the village. He would continue to pour more and more mist from his mouth until it made the entire entrance to the village impossible to see. Because there was a nearby river, and because the land was so closely located to the village hidden in the mist, an occasional layer of mist would seem natural and not out of the ordinary.........unless niggas had sensing powers.

Zero had rememebered Ichiro's current location, appearing next to him almost immediately. He whispered. "How do you want to do this...I can see us trying to cut through the wall, we can climb up it....if you're good with Earth techniques we can go under.....Kill the guards and see if they have a key.....anything really...."* - Sun Nov  1 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) could hear the enemy shouting out about the mist. *How....Unless they have sensors....* he thought quickly hearing the commands to aim and fire. Without hesitating, he clapped his hands together causing a surge of water to instantly burst forth from below his feet simultaneously spinning as it did so. The spinning water wrapped around the man in a globe-like shield as the bombs crashed against it, quickly being nullified. His techniques masked away by the thickening fog around them.  

Once the explosions were dealt with, or at least he assumed they were done with, he would release the tehcnique allowing the water to instantly drop to the ground. He formed another handseal, a single one, before immediately vommitting gallons upon gallons of water. *Dare sense my chakra!? SENSE THIS!* he shouted within his mind as a small ocean's worth of water was spewed from his mouth, the waves raising to about fifty feet into the air before attempting to crash down onto the guards wiping them away and leaving Zero clinging to the wall or rather on top of the wall.* - Sun Nov  1 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ricky(Lordlol45) says: Yes - Sun Nov  1 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) knew he had to acquire more forces to cover the incomming shinobi. Seeing as how the top of the wall now had some source of water from the leftover that had remained from the waves. Forming the seal of confrontation, six water clones rose from the water as they surrounded Zero, two of them pulling out their tantos in preparation. As the six clones surrounded their owner, Zero also pulled out his tanto before forming his hand into the shape of a gun. Chakra began to focus itself into his index finger before being released; a bullet made of fire shot out towards one of the guards aiming to pierce him through the chest * - Sun Nov  1 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) seemed to be fueled by the death and pain he was causing, his eyes burning with firey passion. One could possibly say they saw him lick his lips with pleasure. Zero did not necessarily require himself to take notice of the abundant kunai and the like being thrown at him. The four clones who did not pull out their tanto would all form the same singular handseal as they leaned over the edge of the wall into the village. It was the handseal Zero had used prior, as their mouths all opened to release several gallons of water. They would more than likely use up all of their chakra in doing so, turning themselves into water as wave upon wave ,created by the four performing the jutsu at the same, came crashing down flooding a good portion of the village; the rising waves also attempting to blast away any kunai or ranged weaponry that had been thrown at them.

The dark blasts of energy quickly destroyed the remaining water clones, Zero focused on taking control of the top of the towering walls by repeatedly and rapidly firing bullet of fire after bullet of fire at any guards that remained on the wall; that is until a rogue energy bolt collided with his right left shoulder, tossing him back. As he tripped up, he would fall back off of the wall, but not before grasping onto the ledge with his right hand. His natural ability to tank ninjutsu and other chakra based techniques allowed him to not be seriously injured as he clung to the outside of the wall. ** - Sun Nov  1 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) used all his efforts to lift himself back onto the wall, this time hopefully without being seen.* - Sun Nov  1 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) had taken a few minutes to regain his composure, his desire to kill and maim dwindling; his eyes losing that pleasurable flame. After he was ready to continue, he allowed his body to dangle against the inner wall of the village. Coating his feet in chakra, he latched himself to the wall before running down it to regroup with his team, staying beside Sado, who he was surprised to even see here. "Best Friend Sado, you made it!" he shouted thinking if he should smack him on the back as a welcome, but quickly deciding not to.* - Sun Nov  1 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) had hid behind Sado and his shield, waiting for the barrage of attacks to be dealt with before watching the other two begin to retreat. *I guess this gives us time to figure out a way to crack that shield...* he thought, unsure if they were going to take the same route out as he just did to get in.

Anways, he coated his feet in chakra once more, rushing up the wall in an attempt to get up and over it.* - Sun Nov  1 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I'll kill them. Every last priest... - Sun Nov  1 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) sat himself down behind the fence, chillin like a villain, you know gedo sweg. He pulled out a single bottle of water and began to sip it.* - Sun Nov  1 05:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) hopped out from behind the fence, noticing the others to be rather silent. "So Sado-chan...That's what you can do....huh....When are you going to teach me?" he asked hoping for a good answer.* - Sun Nov  1 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) blinked a few times. "Sado-kun...Notice me please."* - Sun Nov  1 05:25:32 2015

Seeing as how he was in his home, he had his masked removed, revealing his true face; allowing it to breath. "What should I do...what can I do..." he said to himself unsure of his next act.

Of course he didn't have to wait to find out, having been staring at the man for what seemed like minutes. His right hand raising, causing him to internally wimper as several thoughts zipped through his mind in an instant, his body quickly releasing chakra. 

As the bone bullets zipped towards the man, he couldn't move, shocked by the suddeness of the attack. The bullets dug into his body, face, and thigh, quickly flying out the other end as quickly as they entered. He prepared himself physically and mentally for what was to come. He made  a quick move of the neck making a rather audible crack. "That actually hurt....why?" he asked still fixated on the attacker.* - Sun Nov  1 07:11:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) watched the man with curious eyes. "Yeah...That looks like it hurts...and kind of gross at the same time." he stated stepping back a few fet. As he moved back, he formed three handseals rapidly, causing a burst of water to be released from his mouth out towards the man, it wasn't aimed directly at him, rather at his feet. That's to say, the jet of water had been released in a more of a cone-like spray than a direct blast of water. This was to strike him if he continued to advance, but mostly to flood the field slightly with water. 

Without wasting time, he formed the seal of confrontation the moment the water got close or near him. causing four water clones to rise up and form themselves up and about near the approaching attacker. "Oh yeah, can you make me some bones too? I noticed Kirie have something similar to what you're holding."* - Sun Nov  1 07:31:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) felt the rush of wind generated by the sword flying by him, seconds later he watched the man rush towards the fence causing Mizumi to run towards Sado's direction to sort of even out their spacing. That's when the man disappeared, causing Mizumi to turn towards the area of the village where he had no clones; there he was, holding onto the blade that had crashed into the fence not minutes ago. *He's fast* he thought as the clones had already formed and moved forming a sort of triangle or rather a ' > ' shape with Mizumi behind the four. Of course, water still remained on the floor as the two water clones at the front of the formation formed three handseals ratrher quickly, as they both released a rather thick liquid from their mouths as they intended to drench the area where Baen was in it, coating the ground with their chakra infused fluid.

"You know...Why not just kill Kirie? I heard she's running the village into the ground?" he asked preparing himself for anything really, he had no idea what he was capable of doing.* - Sun Nov  1 07:48:54 2015

This nigga was going all Kamikaze type with this jutsu, using up all of the chakra alloted to it when it was formed. Seeing as how this clone was one of the clones who had performed the the previous jutsu, it wouldn't have as much chakra to spend on this technique. Using itself in the process, the clone would vomit out gallons upon gallons of water straight from his mouth aimed at creating somewhat decent sized wave. It reached about ten feet high as it took up the entire width of the market square, making its way towards the man on the short fence. The wave wouldn't affect the approaching Ichiro and his army as it would have dwindled by the time it reached them. This wave would have wiped the sticky field away, but produced more than enough water for clone four and clone three to sink into the water source, disappearing from sight. Clone two would then take the place of Clone 1, both it and Mizumi prepared.

*Shit...I should totally have waited...I would have let him kill the army....* he thought.* - Sun Nov  1 08:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) thinks: I wonder when he'll tell me the price of his bones.. - Sun Nov  1 08:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Well..then.. - Sun Nov  1 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: It seems like things are happening. - Sun Nov  1 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hey could you guys not try to kill eachother for the moment? - Sun Nov  1 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'm trying to do business here! - Sun Nov  1 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: Just steal Kirie's sword...It's basically the same thing. - Sun Nov  1 08:13:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I'll give you one-hundred thousand for an arm. - Sun Nov  1 08:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) would run on the watery field, towards the area Baen had run off to. Forming a single seal, he disappeared, only to reappear several yards away. The clone squad would have made their way towards him as well, two of them still int he water, and the other running along the flooded field. He took note of the giant creature, assuming it was Asteroth...who else could it be?

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I can kill anyone if I put my mind to it. But i'm not here for you, or even Mizumi anymore. - Sun Nov  1 08:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) continued to mark Baen mentally. "I don't know...I don't have that authority..." he said forming three handseals rather quickly before releasing another gushing of water, enough to cover the pathway in about a foot of water. The hidden clones would continue to move along in the water. The clone out in the open would also move forward, standing in front of Mizumi.* - Sun Nov  1 08:34:08 2015
