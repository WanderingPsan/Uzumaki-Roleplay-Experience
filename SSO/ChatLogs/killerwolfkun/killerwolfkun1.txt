<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) smirks lightly walking forward with his eyes closed and a jig like walk. 

"I see your tenacious training and was thinking. Maybe you could help me out. Kehehe~"* - Fri Sep 25 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) He stopped his more direct movements and took a more, child like and friendly stance, as he knelt lightly and closed one eye giving a toothy grin. 

"Just saying, maybe we could train together. Ya know?"* - Fri Sep 25 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) Looking at the man, he studied the great muscle mass and the wrinkles and put his hands on his legs replying. 

"You think because I'm small, I'm not able to live up to a challenge? We can duke it out old time and see where we both stand."* - Fri Sep 25 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) grins widely while looking to the giant and getting into a ready stance. He viewed all the points of the body, trying to fomulate a plan to combat the jugernaut and took a step to the side to get a better angle. 
[Can you act as a tutorial for me please ^_^;; I'm new and would like a little help learning the basics of battle.]* - Fri Sep 25 20:40:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) inhales, a bit taken back by the man's display of strength through mere stomping. It was already apparent that hits taken would be his downfall. So in this, his body leapt forward, seeing if speed would help, he rushed in and threw a punch towards his shoulder in mid air. 

"Alright, Let's fight!"* - Fri Sep 25 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) eye's widen as he saw that his punch didn't even put a dent in his skin. It was almost as if he was fighting a golem. His hand cringed while looking at the slight anguish he felt from the attack he preformed. Yet when he turned his head, he was met with a large swipe, hitting him off to the side. His eyes widened a bit while feeling the pain of the hit and being thrown to the side. His mouth made a cough while he held his side and frowned. His mouth began to pant as he slide a half of a meter and flipped on to his feet, panting greatly. He didn't know what to do as far as hand to hand combat, but, he took a step back and put his hands together, after 3 hand seals, he pulled his finger out infront of him, trying for a different approach. 

"Water Style: Water Gun Jutsu."  He called out, shooting a bullet of water from his finger tips at the brute, hoping it would have some sort of effect. * - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) his mouth frowned while looking at the giant. It was surely intimidating witnessing such a strong man, up in his age like this. He stared, seeing that he might not be able to keep up anymore than he had, though, he wanted to show the old man that he was not only a force, but even at a young age, could do soemthing against, what seemed to be an inpenaterable defense to the young man. 

Akirama took his arms and put them in the Boar handseal. 

"I'll show you I still have a last trick up my sleeve." He told before preforming the sequence Boar, Ram, Snake, Horse, and Dragon. His hands glew brightly. He moved them in swift movement as he looked to the man with a twitching arm muscle. He then smiled while looking to the Elder man as he said,

"Eat this! Lightning release: Electromagnetic Murder!" He called out as lightning bursted from his palms in a speradic stream at the man, hoping for the water to take effect with this jutsu. 
(Sorry, it took a while, lag)

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Technically speaking, it wasn't a hit. Since it didn't explode. - Sat Oct  3 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) waltzed into the fray in the last moments of combat, only to see that there were shinobi already in a bout. He saw the end and gave a light smile from what he saw, it was not two mere genin clashing. His eyes blinked lightly before his hands went behind his head and laughed lightly. It would have been fun to join in, but since it was over, he couldn't get the experience in. Akirama looked to the man whos eyes were glowing earlier and blinked lightly, wanting to know a bit more about him. * - Sat Oct  3 18:10:33 2015
