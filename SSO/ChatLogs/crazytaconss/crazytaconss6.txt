<br><font color=green>***Otokage**(Jack Lyzerg) says: Hmm, this is going to be an interesting fight.
<br><font color=teal>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) whispers: And I think im going to fund, the rebuilding of Sunagakure no Sato.
<br><font color=green>*Hayate(Deeksixx) says: smh sso had to be down)
<br><font color=teal>*Zakku(Zakku) whispers: Why do you plan to do that?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( .-. I have to go people :S Just pretend like I gave up on my match. )
<br><font color=teal>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) whispers: Wouldn't you like to be the Kage of Sunagakure no Sato..?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( It's almost 12 PM here and I have school really early tomorow :S )
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [12 PM..]

<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I mean 0:00 maybe that's 12 AM. )
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) checked his holster. He had five kunai, ten shuriken, three Exploding Tags, and two Smoke Bombs. They should come in handy.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) slowly lifts his right hand toward his lip, thumb extended, he'd nip at the center of his thumb, causing blood to slowly drip from the point of impact. He'd then form a chain of handseals exclaiming, "Summoning Jutsu!". Out of a puff of smoke on each of his shoulders, two small slugs would arise, dripping their mucus all over his cloak. He'd then smirk slightly saying, "Go ahead and make your move.". He'd then begin transfering his chakra into each of his slugs as he formed a chain of handseals, his hands were obviously covered by his cloak.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( That's whut I say, I say that you guys can pretend I gave up in my next match. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Meaning not yours. )
<br><font color=green>*Miyamoto, Tengoku(Self Proclaimed Savior) says: (Kevin?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( But the one I would have next. )
<br><font color=green>*Hayate(Deeksixx) says: buut in reality u nebber 1 wat dat legit)
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: I'mma blow this bitch up, btw.)
<br><font color=teal>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) whispers: Wouldn't you..?
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ RPing. ]
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( So, cya guys :S Till Tomorow :S )
<br><font color=green>*Miyamoto, Tengoku(Self Proclaimed Savior) says: (Dawn? Kevin?)
<br><font color=teal>*Zakku(Zakku) whispers: While that sounds amazing, I'm not fit to be a Kage at the moment.
<br><font color=teal>*Zakku(Zakku) whispers: I believe more training on my part would be required.
<br><font color=teal>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) whispers: Well I have a brilliant idea.
<br><font color=teal>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) whispers: This is what will happen.
<br><font color=teal>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) whispers: You would take over as the new Kazekage, you will be incharge of Sunagakure and I will be in charge of both Sunagakure and Amegakure. I want to build an empire.
<br><font color=teal>*Zakku(Zakku) whispers: I still believe, that even I were to be a..viceroy, so to say, I would need to have more power than I do at the moment.
<br><font color=teal>*Zakku(Zakku) whispers: Although, I do play to work on my training extensively, it will be a few years before I feel that I'll be ready for such a position.
<br><font color=teal>*Zakku(Zakku) whispers: [plan*]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Than I shall wait.
<br><font color=teal>*Zakku(Zakku) whispers: Perhaps, you could aide in my training.  What better way to train for the position of Kage than to receive training from a Kage themselves?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Now to act like Mizuki and Irui.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (OH MY GOD THIS IS TAKiNG SO FUCKING LONG)

<br><font color=green>***Otokage**(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( <_< jk )
<br><font color=green>*Hayate(Deeksixx) says: wynokx, y u start dislikin meh?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) mused at how Mizuki began. He had summoned those two slugs again that stood upon his shoulders. Doing this consecutive times was bad variety, and clearly, he would be manipulating a similar strategy to what he did in his preliminaries versus Namano. "Well then. You're offering me the next move then? I won't deny it then. In fact, I graciously accept your offer!" He smacks his right fist into the palm of his left hand. Withdrawing a kunai and spinning it around his middle finger, he gripped it casually with a firm hold. Clearly, he mainly wanted to utilize that kunai for melee purposes. He was one that did not let out any openings in his tactics.

Reaching down with his left hand into his holster, he decided to get some equipment into the named hand's reach. His right hand was already preoccupied with his kunai, his dominant hand being his right and benefitting him if he were in a strength-struggle. He took a smoke bomb, fumbling with his holster for a while. He didn't think Mizuki would make any moves during this period, as honorable as he was in battle. Finally, three shuriken were in his left hand, a smoke bomb resting in the middle.

Quickly, he'd begin his attack. Flinging the smoke bomb right over at Mizuki with all of his might, Irui wanted to hit the ground just right before Mizuki. If it made an impact with the satin floor of the Chuunin Semi-Finals, it'd burst from the seams into purple gaseous clouds. It's color and darkness was focused on decreasing the efficiency of Mizuki's vision, while its texture tried to make it harder to get out of, seeing as it was rougher than a real smoke bomb at some areas. It was like being pecked by small grains of rice while moving through it, and showed that it was manually brewed, so the entire thing was not mixed in a fine powder. With those three shuriken he had, he flung them with precision into the smoke, at where Mizuki WOULD be. He wasn't focusing on his entity when he had last seen him. He figured Mizuki, being the evasive and elusive one, would either jump out of the smoke, or raise his guards in defense, trusting and abiding in his abnormal physical strength. He flung on shuriken above the cloud. It was moving slow, but it was very sharp, so it could still embed itself into one's being if made contact with it. In fact, saying it was slow was overestimation. It was slow in shuriken-throwing standards, moving as fast as a giant shuriken. 

It was angled so that it would fall down from the sky and try to slam into the ground where Mizuki's actual entity was standing at the time where he had thrown the Smoke Bomb. The other two shuriken were aimed to the right and left of Mizuki, incase he were to move to the left or the right. Finally, Irui jumped into the air, in order to get more vision of the battlefield. Make your move.*

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yes)

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Reasonably speaking, I'd say you could do..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Like, 30-50 tons.]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [O.o]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [This is Naruto.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Physical limits here >>>>>>>>>>> physical limits in the real world]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I mean.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [If you're just picking it up that's reasonable.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Naruto threw a 2 ton Rhino about three hundred feet in the air no problem.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'd say you'd have similar strength with the Monstorous Strength perk.]
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: So.)
<br><font color=green>***Otokage**(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( link me to that video? o-o i need that )
<br><font color=green>*Hayate(Deeksixx) says: <--- nots trying_
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [[What, where he threw the rhino?]
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: There is a shuriken coming from all directions, except from behind, right?)
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Coo.)
<br><font color=green>*Hayate(Deeksixx) says: notes that naruto was using sage mode strengtgh_
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I said that.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Monstorous Strength would be similar to what he had.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Since, Naruto wasn't really known for physical strength outside of Sage Mode.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) smirks as the cloud of smoke appears, he'd exclaim, "Fire Style!: Misty Flames Dance! Ninja Art: Fire Run!". Each of the slugs resting on his shoulder would inhale deeply, channeling the recieved Fire Chakra into their lungs, the first Slug would exhale a mist-like highly flammable gas out into the open, enveloping most of the area, mostly focused around Mizuki and Irui, the other slug would exhale a bright flame in the shape of a funnel, as it collided with the gas, it'd explode into an enormous raging flame headed toward Irui.  He'd then leap forward, evading the shuriken coming from the sky, also the one soaring toward him from the front as they approached. Mizuki would use the distraction of the giant flame and smoke to form the handseals for his next jutsu.*
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Lawl.)
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: They are using my chakra.)
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ...
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) smiled. Well of course Mizuki wasn't slacking. This huge Fireball greatly resembled the one he had faced from Narusegawa's opposition. Her Goukakyuu was quite the fearsome opponent, yes it was. But, he had developed a way to avoid it. He clasped both of his hands together, pointing towards the ground. "GALE PALM!" He jumped RIGHT before he used it, allowing what you would name as a 'Super Jump' to happen. He avoided the humongous flame, although his legs were inflicted with a raging heat, and it burned the back his pants slightly. Backflipping in mid air, he executed his hand seals.

"Rat. Ox. Ram. Monkey. Horse!" 

He lodged chakra in the middle of his throat, accollecting his chakra in an amass. He took a deep breathe. The oxygen, instead of entering his respiratory system though, transfused with the chakra inside of his throat. He compressed the oxygen balls that formed in his throat with his experience of compression. This chakra held tthe balls in smaller balls than usual, greatly decreasing their volume. However, when this chakra was let go, aka when he released the balls, the bursts would grow right back into their full size.

"FUUUUUUUUUUUUTON. AAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRR BULLLLLLLLEEEEET."

And like Shukaku, he began to rain down Air Bullets. Two in total. About the size of Katon Goukakyuus.*

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Summoning is C rank.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) widens his eyes as the enormous orbs of pressurized wind soared toward him, He'd dash toward safety as the two orbs collided with the ground, but the pressure of the impact would send him crashing into the wall, he'd slow slide down the wall as he said, "Not bad...guess it's my turn..". He'd then dash toward Irui, leaping into the air, channeling his chakra into the slug on his left shoulder, the other would begin channeling it's own. Mizuki would then form a chain of handseals exclaiming, "Prepared Needle Shot!". He'd slick back his sleeve revealing his senbon shooter, and the left slug would open it's mouth, each launching 10 senbon at a nearly point blank range, the other launching a pressurized stream of acid toward Irui's chest.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (And ngrs Super Genin 4days about dodging.)

<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Lol.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) had dropped onto the ground by the time the two Air Bullets had made contact. Now Mizuki was moving to the offensive, the initative. Multitasking was not his best sport, but since the slugs were so small and compact, he could tell what they were doing in conjunction with Mizuki. A mid-ranged combination of acid and nearly-invisible senbon. He could tell Mizuki was shooting some kind of tool, for his mouth formed strange shapes over and over as if blowing outward. Utilizing his reflexes, he snapped his knees, bending them, and kicking off the ground to the right, avoiding the acid. The senbon was aiming at him though, and knowing that it was Mizuki, his head would be tilted in the direction that Irui was moving. He jumped to the side, avoiding a few senbon, although taking one right into the thigh. He held in a yelp, before taking another in his shoulder. Prying them out of his body, he ran over to Mizuki, sweeping through the ground. With the kunai he still had in his hand, he flung it at Mizuki's knee, trying to land a clean mark. With his spare hand, he took a smoke bomb out of his holster, slamming it against the ground. After sending the kunai point-blank range, he could expect opposition. He tried a hit-and-run strategy.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) begins a chain of handseals, swiftly summoning his favorite small slug, Katyusa. Mizuki would smile as the slug said, "More Strength and chakra control training then?". Mizuki then smirked as he walked to a nearby boulder, which was obviously larger than him. He'd wrap his arms around it, bending at the knees slightly before lifting it up, causing small pebbles to fall from under it. Mizuki would then step onto the surface of the lake, channeling his chakra into his feet, as he did squats on top of the water's surface, doing chakra control and strength training.*
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Then sign meh up)

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Hmmph.

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: That' will certainly come into some use.
<br><font color=green>*Kurina(Punkamainia) says: Okay. I saw that jutsu in the Forest of Death when my teammate used it.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Soo..do you want to see it again..?
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Or do you want me to tell you how to do it..?

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Alright.
<br><font color=yellow>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) smiled, as he turned around .He couldn't risk hitting Kurina with that jutsu. Since it was very leathal. He did one handseal, and inhaled and exhaled, sending one leathal air bullet, bursting outwards from his mouth. He smirked. Than he decided to show her, the other version of the technique too .He did the same, channelling his wind chakra threw his body, than doing one hand seal.   " Air bullets !!" he yelled as numerous bullets of air, came bursting outwards. " Wind is very powerful, controling it can be very usefull.." he said.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina(Punkamainia) would watch and learn, mentally taking notes of the jutsu. Some of Kurina's habanro red hair blew back as the bullets were created. She could tell the Amekage was very powerful with it. "Wind is sharp too."*
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Now you go ahead, and practice doing the technique. 
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Im gonna go make sure Zakku is breaking peoples backs with weights.

<br><font color=yellow>*Tachi(Willdowe12) sighs as his attempt to vlunteer not going first made him go first. He tested raiseing his legs, noteing that they felt like marshmellows in a titanium crunching machine. He slowly raised on leg up, then dropped it back down, makeing a creeking like noise in the bridge. This was not going to be easy. He would slowly keep raiseing his legs, trying to jog over the bridge atleast. This wasn't really working, as his legs felt heavy. He took one more step on the bridge, watching as a piece of it snapped and fell into the water. He would hurry and try to run across, makeing it to the other side finishing lap one.
 As he looked back across the bridge, it looked alot more scarier than it did the last time. He ran back across the bridge, his legs feeling like complete shit now. He decided to try something, as he jumped abit across the bridge, landing back down makeing a shakeing feeling. Next the bridge piece under him cracked, him falling into the shallow water below, shakeing off his hair and drying his jacket, aiming to walk back up the bridge now, just to finish his other lap. This was gonna take forever.*

<br><font color=yellow>*<i>Gin Akasen</i>(OmniKage) takes a step onto the bridge, his foot causing the wood at his feet to creak under the weight. "Aww damn." he would say as he pressed his dominant foot forward a similar result taking place. Standing for a few seconds he would approve of the bridges solidity and pressed on. Beginning to run across the length of the bridge, Gin would note his feet cracking the surface of the bridge. Yet another incentive for him to complete his run before the bridge gave out on him. Once he reached the end, Gin would look down to the other end and shrug his shoulders.

Once he made it to the end, he would begin to note the strain on his legs. "Damn..." the young monk would say aloud. However he would continue to run despite the pain he felt in his legs, this was the type of training he had favored and if he were to give up, he would look bad in the eyes of his peers. Once he made it to the other side once more, he would take a quick breather and then sprint once more intent on completing the exercise.*
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (its called me too lazy to rp all dat)

<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) walked to the bridge, feeling his legs burn.  Working with weights is something he and his students would have to get used to, but he felt the yield would be worth it.  To him, you should always work hard, or else you shouldn't have tried at all.

Standing at the edge of the bridge, he took off as fast as he could.  Which wasn't saying much, since the weights reduced his speed to that of your average genin.  It felts as if his legs were tearing apart has he finished crossing the bridge, but he turned around and kept going.

By the tenth crossing, he was panting heavliy.  This was truly rigorous exercise, but it would be worth it in the end.  Despite the protest from his legs, and lungs, he continued on.  Finally, he finished the fifteenth crossing and fell on the ground.  He looked at his students and said, "Hm, this was harder than I expected.  But, next time we'll triple it."*

<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Ngr fine
<br><font color=yellow>*Tachi(Willdowe12) looked at that guy that made them run so much times. Even though it made his legs super weak, they would probally be stronger in a kick to the face fight. He slowly concentrated his chakra, going to the full extent, as he looked at the water. The water slowly pulled up, forming onto Zakku's hand. He would throw a blob of water at the guy known as Zakku, aiming to hit him int he face. Next he would run at the guy aiming to start a match with a punch to the face.*
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [I did fucking break the bridge.]

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It's completely reasonable that I can dodge your fist..]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Lightning Reflexes, you know..]
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) felt the water splash against his face, temporarily catching him off guard.  But, having the reflexes he did, he was able to lean back and avoid the fist flying at his face.  Reaching up out of instinct, he tried to grab Tachi's arm while it was still in mid-air.  If this were successful, he would spin and around and try to throw him into the mountain next to them.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Tachi(Willdowe12) got his arm grabbed cause of the weights, and lol flung to mountain, but dragged into the water.*
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Welp)

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [o.o]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [Im'a learn curse seal.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) watched as Tachi slammed into the mountain and thought, "Maybe I over did it, just a little."  His eyes widened though, as Tachi began to slide down into the water, his weights speeding up the process.  This time, he thought, "I hope he has the arm strength to swim with those weights on, other wise he'll die."  He looked on, hoping to see some sign of Tachi swimming, not dying.*
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Pfft as if water can kill me)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (-dies-)
<br><font color=yellow>*Tachi(Willdowe12) looked up through the water as he slowly sank to the bottom. Seems as if this would be the end of a normal person, but Tachi wasn't normal in the slightest. Heck, nobody was. They were all fricken ninjas. He closed his eyes as he focused his chakra once more, summoning some water to him. He would put some water around him leg weights, makeing them lighter so he could try and swim up. Next holding his breath he did some handseals. A large water jet would spray from his mouth, boosting him up out of the water as he was suddenly mid-air. Now he was about to do something epic. He pulled out two Kunai's with hidden tags on them, not easily noticed. Next he threw them at Zakku, aiming to atleast distract him. Next he would reach into his pockets while he was falling, grabbing some shuriken. He manuevered tot he side abit so he could land on the ground. As he did that, he focused chakra into all of his shuriken. Next he charged them up and threw them at Zakku, aiming for them to hit him.*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I got to see how fast lightning reflexes will allow me to react to that.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yeah, I could -probably- pull a dodge on the first two.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Yay)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (If i activate the tags)

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [and Im liek.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) looked at Tachi, smiling at his ingenuity.  It turned out to be good that he happened to utilize the water element, as it had saved him from an untimely death.  However, he watched as two kunais barreled towards him.  Using the limited speed he had, he jumped out of the way of them, watching as they stuck into the bridge. 

It just wasn't his day though.  Turning to the side, he saw a swarm of shuriken speeding toward him.  He spun to dodge, but was sliced in the arm, and one of them stuck into his leg.  Normally, this would have done more damage to a normal person, but years of training his body to take damage allowed him to take the damage head on.*
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [Who the fuck is Satan..? Fuck him.]

<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [xD]
<br><font color=yellow>*Tachi(Willdowe12) would watch as his Shurikens managed to damage Zakku. He would do a single seal as the two Kunai's lodged in the bridge exploded. They would likely cause the bridge to fall in on itself. This would cause Zakku to either drop in or jump. Either way he would be open. Next he pulled out multiple Shuriken once more, this time they had tiny tags on them. He chakra enhanced them once more, throwing them at Zakku at the same time. Next he would focus chakra to his feet, aiming to run to the edge close tot he water and fire a stream of water in a wide like motion, aiming to cover most of the air. That was gonna be his backup if Zakku dodged this Shuriken.*

<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Because, my fire is gon' evaporate your water.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (D:)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Screw ur fire)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: ( dont know of my tag shurikens)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Do you have tags in your inventory?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Or Shuriken?]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Depends)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Do people usually buy those weapons or dot hey just have a spam load like all naruto ninja)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I don't use weapons unless I actually buy them.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (>.>)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'd expect everyone I RP with to do the same..]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Neither does the rest of the rp world)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (joo finish rping now)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You should engage me in h2h after this.]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Zakku...
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Why don't...
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Me and you train..
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Or spar rather.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Im sure it'll be intense.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: Uh, sure.
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Let me finish this RP.]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [ok.]
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) felt the bridge below him burst, the explosive notes blowing it to bits.  Thinking quickly, he jumped on to the land, doing a form of tuck-and-roll.  He watched another batch of shuriken fly toward him and used something he'd been saving.  Forming the appropriate seal, he switched himself with a log, performing the "Substitution Jutsu".

Before he was able to breathe a sigh of relief, he noticed a wave of water that happened to be hurtling toward him.  This time, he couldn't really react, except for one thing he thought might work.  Forming a few handseals, he used something he tried not to rely on in battle.  "Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!" he screamed, and a large ball of fire burst from his mouth.

It launched toward the wave, and he hoped that when they met he would cause the water to evaporate.  If this failed, he would just wait for the jutsu to hit him, hoping it would cause minimal damage.*
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (I ttly ownz u cause)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (I sent le giant wave)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Dat washes away joor fireBALL)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (-trollface-)
<br><font color=yellow>*Tachi(Willdowe12) forced the rest of the Large Wave of water through, haveing it fall over the fireball and destroy it. The wave would continue flying at Zakku, as it would crash into him probally and wash him into the water. That's where Tachi would finish it. Tachi quickly did some handseals, focusing chakra as tentacles formed from the water, hopefullly wrapping Zakku up, makeing him unable to move. He was getting better in manipulateing water. Next he would just pull out a rope with tags on it, wrapping it around Zakku as Tachi was in the water now. He would jump back as he activated the tags, then aiming to throw off his weights, aiming to run and punch Zakku in the face and knock him the fuck out.*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Nigger, how much chakra do you have?!]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Unless you got the chakra perk, that last jutsu shouldn't be possible.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Wut last jutsu)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (:3)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [The tentacle.s]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Its not a legit jutsu if its just manipulateing)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You should totally be out of chakra now.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [You propelled yourself out of the water]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Used several explosive notes.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Notes dont count as chakra)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Sent a large wave at me.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Ngr fine)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [They take chakra to activate]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Just the knocking u into the water)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (NOW TAKE THE ROPE TAG BOMBING)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (AND GET PUNCHED)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Man, I still have genin speed with the weights.]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: lol.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Ngr just)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (wjighauiwghauihgauiwhguiahguiz)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Wif weights off I have Itachi speedzor -nod- Ud ead)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Do you haz this perk?]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [No, you just got reflex, lol.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Last time I got speed)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (it didn't help dodgeing Nibi fireballs much)
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [btw.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Reflex coulda saved me)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (UR ARGUEMENT IS INVALID0
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Yeah, lol.]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [The Otokage.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Wait a minute)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I've got Lightning Reflexes?]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Doesn't substitution only work)
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [is the ec ..they made to kill me off.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (When u set it up previously?)
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [Soo yeah.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (So dat means)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Sometimes.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (U dodgin my shuriken tags)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (Is invalid)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [We're not going back that far.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I want to finish fighting you so I can fight the Kage.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (>.>)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [Tbh, I probably should have pwned you by now.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (i still say substituteing wifout setting up is invalid)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (So get blown up)
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (-nod-)
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [It's only going to happen once.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And that's because, I didn't feel like running away.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [And letting mah weights blow up.]
<br><font color=green>*Tachi(Willdowe12) says: (NGR LET JOOR WEIGHTS EXPLODE)
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Ughh..
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Well im joining in on this.
<br><font color=yellow>*Zakku(Zakku) felt the wave over take him and wash him into the water.  Thinking quickly, he swam over to the edge of the water, and looked up to see a rope of explosive notes being thrust at him.  He thought, "Where and the heck is he getting all of these explosive notes?"  Even though he was still feeling weak, he grabbed a rock on the edge of the shore, and flung himself out of the water.

However, he'd taken the explosive rope with him.  He sighed, feeling slightly defeated.  He grabbed the rope, and tore it off of his body, flinging it back toward Tachi.  Once the explosion went off, he would charge him from behind, hoping to catch him off guard with a jump-kick, screaming, "Dynamic Entry!!"*
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I'm about to knock his head off.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [I used a jump kick with 1000 pound weights on each leg.]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [yupp...im defending .]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [rping.]
<br><font color=green>*Zakku(Zakku) says: [LOL]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [Im gonna grab that shit.]
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [and spin your ass around.]
