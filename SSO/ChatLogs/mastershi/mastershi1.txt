<br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) left hand slides into a pouch on his back, his ingers shuffle around for few seconds before stopping as his finger tips grip onto a shuriken. He pulls the shuriken from the pouch and would use one of star corners to cut the middle of his right pal open a little. He smiles at eh pain he feels from cutting his hand. He stares at the blood seeping out of the cut as he puts the shuriken he took out back inside the pouch. Now his hands were brought together as he went threw a chain of five hand seals. Ram, dog, Ox, ram, dog were the set of seals he moves through before bending over pressing his hand on the ground. 

"Summoning Jutsu" He staes as a spacetime seal appears on the ground. His blood acting as a key to open up the link between this world and the world of his summoning. Soon the seal erups into a cloud of smoke. As his body is surrounded by the smoke he parts his lips a little to say "It's time Dark-side". Only thing that can be seen is outline of Moths figure as well a small figure next him. The smaller figure holds a smile that shows off shadow type sharp teeth.

As the smoke clears a bit more Moth is standing tall looking at the distnace as a Hyena sits next to him witha  big smile on its face showing off its teeth. "Moth this better be important."The Hyena states with few snickering laughter at the end. Moth presses his right hand against his red pants to help stop the bleeding from smal cut on his palm. He then tilts his head to side a little looking at the hyena. 

The hyena not onyl has its creepy smile but his rights ide or his fur on the right side of his body is black and the fur on his left is white. Its left eye is grey and its right eye is red.. The air on its back sticsk up a little making it look spikey in a way.

"Dark-side we are going to train. So it is important."Moth states to the hyena.* - Sat Sep 05 20:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) ||
*Dark-Side* lowers his head down to the ground sniffing the ground a little. He did this with a that same snickering laugh as before when he was firsted summoned. The animal then stands up on all fours and would lift his leg up. The leg that wasn't closes to Moth that is. Soon a yellow stream of uren would be flowing out onto the ground creating a good size littel pudle. Once dark-side was done releaving him self he would put his elg down and bring his head up a little looking at Moth side ways. 

"Fine we start off with a jog or sprint."He said before he began to sprint off down the path. Moth of course nods and folows suit joging down the path catching up with the hyena quickly. 

"This is fine I don't want to get to tired out. " Moth said. Dark-side would do his odd laugh again before stating this " Try to focus this link you opened is for long. I'll be heading back to my home in no time." * - Sat Sep 05 21:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) had jogged down to base of moutain now following dark-side south down into mian area of the village. villagers look at the duo jogging and seem to keep there distance from them. Moth glances at the village just taking it all in as he was liked his home alot. Dark-side would have given a glance to the kid and would do his odd laugh once more. 

"If you start day dreaming I'll leave now."The hyena states laughing after he did so but he emnt every word of it. Moth nods turning his head so he was focused on what was ahead of him. Just jogging on when he would hear "Oi" in the back ground. Moth tunrs his head giving a glance behind him seeing the ornage haired male. He would then tunr his head back looking ahead.

"What."Moth states as he kept his joggin pace along side dark-side. The hyena  just focused on jogigng and holding his creepy smile for now.* - Sat Sep 05 21:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) ||
The hyena that jogged alongs ide of Moth of course takes notice of the two who came down on a bird. But the training at hand was on the top of the list and for that he ignores them plus he had no idea who they were talking about. Now that it seemed Moth had alot of things to destract him. dark-side would pick up his pace tunring the jog into a sprint. 

"Hurry now boy put those legs to use."The hyena stated. 

Moth could only nod as he to picked up i his pace but would raise his right hand  up and kind of wave it letting Mamoru know he didn't seem to care if he follows suit or not. It was also a greating to duo that came on the bird. Moth legs began to open in wider stretches to allow him to keep up with the hyena. 

"This is nothing. You planning to take me straight south?"Moth questions the hyena that he was sprinting next to. Darkside would nod his head as he would say "We sprint untill I have to return home." * - Sat Sep 05 21:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) ||
Moth and the hyena now were now sprinting at the same pace. They had sinked up rather quickly for this being first time ina  long time the two had trained together. The both of htem hd left Mamoru alone they were not the types to talk to people as they trained unless it was to eachother which was almost never. Each step Moth and the hyena took did indeed pick up a bit of dust that would creat a little clouds ont he grond as they sprinted down south. Sprinting down all the slopes and hills the vilalge made had on this path. 

Moth began to pant a little after they had sprinted up a good up hill slope. The hyena does his odd laugh again and would start to kick it into igh gear picking up his sprinting pace now. Moth narrows his eyes on his training partner as he now in front of him. "Man I can't let him hear or see that im getting tired."He thought before he had to kciekd into high gear soon sprinting at hte sid eof the hyena once more. Unsure where Mamoru may be at this time or what not.

"He needs to get in shape even more then I thought." Darkside thought to him self.* - Sat Sep 05 22:01:36 2015

just kept up the good work.* - Sat Sep 05 22:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) had returned to the area in a light jog. He stops and would breath trying to get his heart rate down to normal. He even took few sips of water as well poured some of it on his head to wet his hair. The hyena that was with him would sit and look at Moth.

"Well I'm heading back home. Summon me when you ready to do more."He said before poof the link that allowed the hyena tos tay in thsi world would brek letting him return home. Leaving nothing but some white smoke behind as he was summoned back to his own world.

* - Sat Sep 05 22:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) slides his left hand to his holster pulling out a kunai that he would use to cut his right pal open a little tod raw out some blood. Once the cut was made hs holsters the kunai and brings his hands together moving through a set of five hand selas. Ram,dog,ox,ram,dog was the set of seals he went threw. He then bends his knees crouchign down so that he may place his right hand onto the ground. Upon his hand touching the ground a spacetime seal would appear on the ground creating a link from this world to the next. 

"Summoning jutsu"Moth stated right as the seal earups into a cloud fos moke that would swallow up Moth. As the smoek celars those looking can see a Moths figures standing striaght up and next to him was his hyena. The hyena sports the same large wide creepy smile and does his snickering laugh as always. "Moth we starting with some jogging."The hyena states before standing on all fours and moving down south in a jogging pace. 

Moth would nod and follow suit jogging next to his hyena. "This is post to be stage two. So why re we still doing the same thing as last time?" Moth stateds looking at the Hyena. Darkside glances at Moth and laugsh a little before stating "You got to warm your body up or ells you'll catch a crap." With that stated Moth would nod and focus on jogging off south.* - Sun Sep 06 13:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) ||
Moth and Darkside both kept a steady jogging pace down south. This pace was only broken whn they would go down hill slopes in the village as for they kind of forced to speed up do to gravity pushing them down on them. But when it came to up hill slopes that were big Moth found him self panting and sweating once reaching the top. Darkside was a rather fit yena for his young age and size it take him longer to break a sweat during these sets of training. 

"Moth boy, make sure to pace your breathing."Darksid estated as he began to pick up speed. Moth nods as he kepts his breathing calm breathign through his knsoe and exhaling out of his mouth. Making sure that all parts of his body were getting oxygen. He of course pciks up his pace in jogging to macth darksides. His leg muscles are feeling the burn and so was his feet. 

"Darkside, I'm going to guess we are about to move into stage two." Moth states as he began to pick up his pace to pass the hyena a little. "The link that allowing me to stay here going to give soon so yes."The hyena stated before jumping onto Moths back. "Now run!"The hyena shouts laughing after he stated what he had to say. Moth was shcoked a little from darkside jumping onto his back but her quickly uses his hands to kind fo hold his animal friend on his back as well picking up his pace into a full on runing pace. 

The added weight from the hyena made things harde ron Moths lower body as his legs had to work double time to pick up and keep the runing pace. His breathing picks up as well the sweat his body was dishing out. * - Sun Sep 06 14:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) || 
Moth had ran up few hill liek slope sin the village and ran a long distances with darkside on his back. This training was really taxing on Moth stamina and caused him tot ired quickly so after about thirty mintuse Moth found him self laying flat ont he ground with darkside laying on his back laughing. 

"I'm going to head home. We'll do stage two over again you are to out of shape Moth boy." Darkside said before he poofs away leaving behind a cloud fo white smoke. Moth just lays there panitng his vest soaked in sweat and his legs feel like there on fire and to heavey to move. 

"His training is always tuff."Moth said to him self.* - Sun Sep 06 15:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) gets up from the ground and starts to walk back to square. He leaves all teh dirt on hsi clohtes fro he didn't cre about it being there.* - Sun Sep 06 15:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) steps inside the rather alrge office. He stands near the front just listening to the others there. * - Sun Sep 06 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) STands in the large training arena just to the left of the mansion. His head is tilited down a little as his eyes are focused on the floor, he was staring at notihng just stuck in a deep ttrain of thought. So many things were going on wit te whole war thing and just  his training. He then shakes his head a little ocming out of his train of thought. It was about time for him tos ummon darkside so he can start his training up again. "I hope hes ready."He whsipered to him self before sliding his left ahnd downt o his kunai holster grabbing ahol dof a kunai. With the kunai he holds in his left hand he cuts his right palm open just a little bit to draw some blood. Once that was complete he stores the kunai away and began to go through a chain of hand seals. Ram, dog, ox, ram, and dog were the seals he would weave. 

Crouching down and extending his hand hand down to ground pressing it against he surface of the blue tiles. His blood had made contact with the tiles and soon a space time seal appears on the ground. "Summoning jutsu!"He shouts in sink with the seal appearing on the ground and then earuping into a cloud of white smoke. Once the smoke began to clear there standing infront of Moth was darkside his hyena training coach. "Moth boy it's about time you called me." The hyena stated before he did his odd laugh. Moth just nods his head a little before scanning the area he was in then looking at darkside. "What do we got planned for today?"he asked darkside. Darkside laugh a little more before standing all fours and slowly circling around Moth, looking the boy up and down. "You failed stage two remember so we have to do that again." The hyena stated.

Moth nods to darkside before crouching just a little as if waiting for someone to jump on his back. "Get on." Moth said and with that Darkside jumps on his back and once the hyena was on his back Moth move shis hands to he kind of holds up the animal. Making sure he doesn't fall or any thing. Once that was done he would push off the ground and start to kick into a runing pace that was fast. Pacing him self when going up large slopes and going down steep slopes as well seeing the cloud village ha dalot of hils and mountains in it. This trainign was taxing on Moth and made him tired easly but he trys to keep on going oushing through his bodys limits to please him self so he can feel good about moving on to the next stage of training.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Naw. - Fri Sep 11 23:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Moth(Master Shi) Brings his thumb up to his mouth and presses it against his teeth so he could bite down on it. His eyes water up and he winces a little as he bit into his flesh. He then lets out a sigh as the pain from the bite really hurt kind of had a sting feel to it. His eyes stare down at his thumb as the red liquid flows out of the cute. 

"Time for training. I wonder what darkside has in mind this time."He thought as he would do a chain of five hand seals. Once those seals where complete he would crouch down and slam his hand on the ground. A space seal appears on the ground as the blood from his thumb creats a link for the two worlds. In matter of seconds the seals erups into a cloud of white smoke. Moth then stands up for sure he had summoned the right hyena. He wipes his bloody thumb on his pants and huffs a tad.

"Hey darkside let's get started."He said, but as the smoke clears there clearly wasn't a tall hyena with white and black fur. No there was  tiny cub sitting there looking around the area as if he was consufed. "W-what hey I was int he middle of dinner."The little cub said before pouncing at Moths foot biting at his ankles. 

Moth eyes grew wide as he felt the little teeth form the cub against his skin. He starts to laugh as it tickles more then it really hurts so he just lifts his foot up and stares. "Hey why did a shrimp get summoned. I called darkside!"He shouted, and would start to shake his leg to get the cub to release his ankle.  The cub lets go and lands on all fours. He huffs a little and starts to circle around Moth.

"You suck at this you know that! But it doesn't matter when I go back I'm telling!"The cub said before he erups into a cloud of smoke as he returns to his home world. Moth just sighs a little and shakes his head. He again does the seals for his jutsu assuning his thumb was still bleeding. He would get down on his knees and press his hand against the ground. 

A space time seal appears on the ground as the blood creats a link between two worlds. Soon the seal erups into the cloud of smoke as it has done many and amny time before. As teh smoke clears Moth just awaits to see who it was this time. He sighs again as it was yet another cub.. The cub had all black fur and just stares at Moth little confused..

"Hey mister why did you bother me?"The cub asked Moth would just place his right hand ontop of the cubs head and sigh again. The cub would twtich its eye before biting Moths hand again Moths eyes get all watery as he would sigh out in pain. "Let go you little shrimp!"He shouted shaking his hand around trying to get the cub to let go. The cub bites down harder and breaks the skin a little. Moth takes in a large amount of air before slamming his hand down causing hte cub to hit the ground hard. Once that was done the cub would turn tino a cloud of smoke as he returns home. 

"Why can't I get the one I want today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"He shouts out as he sits there on his knees. He would shakes his head a little before biting his index finger to draw blood. Once again he goes through the seals needed for his jutsu and would place his hands against the ground. A space time seal appears ont ehground and would soonerup into a cloud of white smoke that swallows up Moth. As the smoke clears Moth is smiling and the sound of hyenas laughter could be heard. 

Moth looks closely and would then smile as it was the hyena he was looking for. There darkside sits with a smile on his face. "Moth, boy where you having some trouble?"He asked with a snicker. Moth just shakes his head smiling knowing he couldn't lie but knowing he cant really agree with the hyena too. "I was just trying something new."He said to dodge that question darkside asked. 

"Well be careful next time. Any ways you called me for some training right, of course you did."The hyena would say with a snicker at the end. Moth would yawn a little nodding his head to agree. The boy stands up and looks down at the hyena. "Hey what do we got planned for today hmm?" Moth asked. The hyena stands on all fours and would start tow alk off east. Moth follows right next to him of course wondering what was up.

"Listen Moth, I been spreading the word about around my world. So for now on we got to really train like we mean it."The hyena said. Moth blinks a little and would then speak. "Well you know I'm down for training. I do plan to get stronger alot."He said. The hyena would stop suddently and turn to look at Moth. 

"Listen kid I need to know if you are really ready for this. I been making you do little stuff like run to test you. But I need to know that you wont question any of my training tips."He said. Moth would laugh a little and wipe the sweat from his forhead. He then places his right hand flat on his chest and crouches down. He stares the hyena into his eyes and smiles. "I promise whatever you have for me. I can do it and wont question it at all okay."He said. The hyena nods his head and would sit his butt down on the ground and  flciks his tail a little.

"Alright Moth, this what I want you to do. One every day you need to summon up four of my kind. If I don't show up don't worrie just listen to who ever appears. Two your body is going to be pushed to make you tuff. So I need to punch rocks, kicks rocks, and slam your body into rocks.. I mean really put your body threw some hell man."He said. Moth just nods his head a little and would remove his hand from his chest letting it rest near his side.

"You lucky I promised before you said that.. Yeah I'll do it. "He said the Hyena then lifts his right paw up and places it on Moths knee or shoulder. "Okay I'm heading home do what I told you and don't stop untill I appear again."He said. He doesn't wait for the boy to speak and just puff cloud of smoke and darkside has gone home. Moth sighs a little and stands up shaking his head. "I wonder what hes planning."He thought before running off to find a place to train. A area with alot of big rocks and open space was his goal. Once he found such a spot and he would take few sips of water from a bottle before getting started.

"Alright so first things first.. I need to summon four of his kind right. No matter what I get I'm post to go with that flow."He said. So he bites his thumb again int e hsame spot it hurts like hell but he ignores it. He goes through the cahin of hand seals and places his hand on the ground. A space time seal appears and then erups into a cloud of smoke. Standing in the smoke was a cub. The first cub he summoned before. "Oh great its you."The cub said with a huff. Moth just rolls his eyes and would wipe his face with hiseft hand. "Listen here you little shit. You are helping me train got it now sit there and be a good little boy so I can summon the rest."He said. The cub just sits and doesn't say a word he was solking it seems.

Again he bites his index finger and goes through a set of hand seals. He presses his hand on the ground letting a space time seal appear. The seal erups into a cloud of smoke. He repeats teh summonings steps two more times untill he had all four. He stands up and looks at the what he got. He seems displeased at his pickings.. All four were cubs two where the ones form before and there were two more. "Man I have no idea what I'm post to do wtih ou four but. I am Moth and need your help with my training. "He said. The cubs all nod as if they know sometihng about the boy. "We are post to watch you Moth!"The cubs all say together. The boy sighs again before shrugs.

"Well alright I'm going to start."He said before turning around and walking to a large rock. He balls up his fists and cocks back his right ahnd thensend sit out aiming to hit the rock with alot of force. When his fists makes contact his eyes widen and he lets out a real low sigh or screach. "THAT IS PAINFUL!"He shouts but instead of freaking out he smiesl and retracts the fist fomr the rock and would then send the left fist to make contact. When it does he shouts again and then retracts that fist and send the right. Each hit hurt like a son of a gun but he enjoys it. The pain just puts a smile on his face and he cant stop him self from hitting the rocks.

"I can do this all knight!"He shouts. The cubs all kind of give that I'm grossed out look but watch. They each sperad out making sure toe watch from different ankles. As Moth hits the rock over and over the skin on his nuckles start to split. Bits of blood get ontot he rock as it stains it slightly. He keeps this going over and over each fist hitting the rock making that smack sound thats how hard he was hitting it. 

"Hey stop you need to rest."The cubs all say. Moth stops and looks at cubs he sighs and stops and would rest his hands near his side. "Man it was getting good."He said. The cubs all sigh as thought "Hes a idiot, his hands are all bloody". Moth turns around and sits down leaning his back against the rock as he reaches for his pouch taking a bottle of water form his pouch so he could drink. "I wonder how long I have to keep this up."He thought lookingup at the clouds.* - Mon Sep 14 22:27:37 2015
