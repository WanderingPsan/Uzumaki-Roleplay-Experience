<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zephira(Demon4626) being taken into the illusion of it all, she had no choice but for her mentality to surrender over to the great false image provided by Hanae, while she dropped her kunais, her body fell limp, from her knees to her face she falls to the ground without a concious to respond much due to her below average defense against the Genjutsu.

"End..It.." she kept saying as if a dream.* - Mon Nov 30 03:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zephira(Demon4626) was being forced into something else that seemed worse than death, her eyes shut tight as she spoke the ways of a religious yet death wishing woman "I--I don't care what choices you offer!" she exclaims before having a kunai drilled up into her leg! The pain extreme , making her shed tears and yell the pain of agony from her being at the fullest of volume!* - Mon Nov 30 04:47:34 2015
