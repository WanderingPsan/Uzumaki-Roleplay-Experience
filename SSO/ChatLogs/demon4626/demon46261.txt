"P-Please no!" she had to squeeze the ehart of the woman, feeling it pump within her hands.. She was panting and skipping beats in her own heart..As if it had dropped within the inside of her own body..The young Uzumaki had much issue with this, many problems against such, why she became a medic to heal people when she can not even face the potential of touching organs..She was HORRIFIED by this..Wanting to back away..

Once Zenaki finally left, she fell straight to her knees in tears .. <I'm...A Monster..> she thought, looking at the bloody palm.* - Mon Oct 12 12:06:36 2015

"And never lose to yourself.." she laughs softly.* - Wed Oct 14 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zephira(Demon4626) giggled softly to the guys dedication "Oh and I almost forgot didn't I?" she felt like she was acting too much of a spoiled brat when taking advantage of his wealth to feed her in the place they went to dine out at..She leaned forward to give Izutora a soft kiss on the lips, only to gently force her tongue in to as he would say, spar against his own..She did this for a good few seconds or longer within the moment as a thank you to him..She backed away then with a fainth blue, smile, eyes closed and hands held behind her back "A thank you for the food and adventure." she states kindly.* - Wed Oct 14 01:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zephira(Demon4626) blushed brightly, she'd release a scream "Kyaaaa! What kind of stretch is this?!" she blushed even more at the realization of her short dress revealing her panties and virgin vagina behind the very clothing she had over such..Her smooth legs and thigh spread apart, she tried to close them. 

"I--Is this really a stretch?..How?" he figured he innocently meant to stretch her legs..With such a blush her body was warm. * - Wed Oct 14 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zephira(Demon4626) little skin can be seen through and on the side of her panties as she wiggled her hips to try and get him off "What kind of youth exercise is this Izu?! " she blushed and spoke softly. Her little body compared to his own and well trained one not much to compare when she tried to struggle against his grip "I hope that's it to this stretch! Your father must of been a perv!" she insults as she felt embarrassed to have her privates exposed in such a manner, so little and untouched.* - Wed Oct 14 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zephira(Demon4626) soon if or once her hands were released, she'd reach down to shield her private area and blush with a glare "I would guess so!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zephira(Demon4626) soon would look down at the sudden grasp, she would let out a loud yelp from it, angry she'd slap the back of his head. "Perv! Now you're doing push ups with one hand." she didn't move his hand, he'd have to suffer with it there under her thigh and butt while he'd do all 200 push ups without the use of his other hand "This is your punishment..You can keep your hand ther eonly if you can do push ups..Hmph.."* - Wed Oct 14 02:45:58 2015
