<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taku Wakufaku(UnknowinglyEvil) wasn't as disoriented as one might think...He was Taku...of the Wakufaku family. He would not let his family down, he had to try for the little Fakus around the world. So the moment she swung her fan down, head move to the side,  he was faster than he may've let on. He aimed to evade most of the strike, all of it would probably be a stretch. And one of the blades causing a few cuts to appear along his flesh.

He winced in pain, But stop he did not! His hands were bought to chest level, and with a flurry of seals, two fingers were raised to his lips, as he inhaled followed by a sharp exhale, blowing forth a massive amount of fire which gathered into that of a fireball which shot at Marissa...It was definately powerful, she'd probably notice how fast his hands moved as well almost like a blur.

The strikes he had taken were primarly along his side, and bicep, they weren't lethal, but weren't the easiest to ignore either.* - Sat Oct 31 19:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taku Wakufaku(UnknowinglyEvil) wondered if Marissa was a one trick horse, and keeping on his feet, he slowly ran before, dropping down into a slide, aiming to catch the outer edges of her attack rather than the brunt force. And as such, he'd probably once again,  suffer cuts. He realised that the larger the range she spread the attack the less total force it would have. So his hands were raised to chest level as he exhaled. And a clear gas would've arouse around the scenary, moving towards Marissa.

Since  the fireball without a doubt, would've scorched the ground with some pre-existing flames, once the mist met the flames, it hoped to ignite, causing a minature explosion before Marissa, which was aimed at blowing her back and causing her to suffer ever greater burns.* - Sat Oct 31 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taku Wakufaku(UnknowinglyEvil) was happy she decided to run towards him before attacking, he was confident he would be able to get off this jutsu before she actually cleared the gap. So his hands moved together, making a series of handseals, before he inhaled followed by a deep exhale. As a fine mist of ground gun powder was released into the air, it's obvious intention was to react with the girl's flames, and create an explosion while she was in the middle of it.  He took into account her running speed, and had the feeling it'd be near impossible to change trajectory after running in a straight line. 

Though afterwards, his arms were raised over his chest, intent on taking at least one of these, not to say he didn't try to dodge, but to time his own attack perfectly, he'd risk taking the brunt of her strike.* - Sat Oct 31 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taku Wakufaku(UnknowinglyEvil) wasn't sure if her sharingan could compensate, and change it that quickly. Somewhere along the line, there'd be a moment of hesitation he was looking for. But without a doubt, she'd probably was deep within the smoke at this point, and he switched it up. Instead of the three generic seals, he made a single one. Before inhaling followed by a deep exhale, blowing a ball of flames into her last known spot. Regardless he aimed to ignite that gas, and blow her all the way to Heuvo.

"For my god...I will survive this hit, Spare her from the eternal damnation....And deliver her to the rice fields in the sky." He prayed.

He was within the blast radius as well he wasn't getting out unscathe.* - Sat Oct 31 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taku Wakufaku(UnknowinglyEvil) felt the heat caress his body intamately burning away his skin, his flesh. His being, "My god...Has burned away my sins....And has granted me the strength...To kill the non-believer..." He spoke through pained moans, as he picked himself up from the ground. His skin was practically falling off. As he spoke "My god...Just a little while longer...And I shall see you along....Along with this Heathen!" 

There was no doubt in his mind, he was going to die. The pain was so bad it numbed, he honestly didn't feel a thing.  He couldn't walk, but he tried to crawl while his opponent was down on the ground. "I'll...I'll take her with me....The Path to the holy land...Is a lonely one...I'll need...I'll need company."* - Sat Oct 31 20:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Tough* - Sat Oct 31 20:16:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Taku Wakufaku(UnknowinglyEvil) as he saw her go to clap her hands, "Woman...Do not...Fear death...It is...Comforting." He pleaded,  as he felt the wind hit him, he was blown back slightly. Though he aimed to dig his fingers into the ground to slow his being pushed back. "You........Reject...My god..?" He asked, he felt his breathing slowing greatly he was dying, he wasn't going to bring his god another sacrifice.* - Sat Oct 31 20:18:33 2015
