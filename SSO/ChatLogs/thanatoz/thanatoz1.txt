<br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) had just left the Academy and headed towards an open area that he deemed to be a training area. He liked the spot. Most days it would be nice and cool, and since it was crowded with trees there was always an abundance of shade up and about. He often went there to practice some of his clan's techniques. Just recently, he learned how to liquify certain parts of his own body.

It was certainly an interesting technique, one that would definitely help him out in battle, though it did have a major drawback. After using the technique, he would feel thirsty afterwards, as if the water had been drained out of his body somehow, probably because he kind of turned into it. Oh well, that problem was easily overlooked by simply carrying around a water bottle with him.

Other than that, before he learned that technique he would often come out to the fields to practice his Kenjutsu skills. He dreamed of becoming a brilliant sword fighter, and as such, he practiced everyday to hone his skills in the art. While learning ninjutsu and other things were cool too, he always thought that if one ran out of chakra, that they would have nothing left to turn to, meanwhile, he still had his sword skill to tear them apart with. Well, at least that was the thought process going on inside of the thirteen year old's head. * - Thu Dec  3 05:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) Asin did the usual thing for his training. He ran aronud the old field, avoiding the farm animals that frequented it and kept up a brisk pace. He kept his back upright and his arms moving at his sides, his hands never passing his body by far and not crossing over. His feet moved from heel to toe as he struck the floor, as if they were simply rolling to keep him moving forward. 

His breathing was steady as his body was somewhat used to the physical training. He breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth. He ran for three laps before moving onto his warm-ups. He did about thirty jumping jacks, touched his toes for twenty seconds followed up by ten lunges. Now that he was all worked up and stretched out, he would begin his training in the Hydrofication technique.

He closed his eyes and formed the tiger seal with his hands. He focused on his chakra before holding one hand up. Slowly, it began to change in shape and color, becoming a little more transparent and any shape that it had to begin with began to fade away. A grin appeared on his face for a brief second before he went right back to concentrating. He moved the focus from his hand and shifted it over to his chest, slowly turning it into water as well.* - Thu Dec  3 05:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) had simply been strolling around the village. There wasn't much activity in his life as of late, so he spent most of his time either training or relaxing off in some field or something. He had finished a bowl of ramen at the local eatery before he stumbled what appeared to be a battle going on. Shuriken were thrown at a boy clad in a tight, green jump suit who had used a technique the boy had never seen before.

A shockwave was emitted from his being as a crater forms beneath his feet. He literally dashed forward through the Shuriken and landed an impact so hard on the other boy's chest that it literally killed him. Asin stood in shock. He knew that some spars could get a little...intense, but to actually kill someone like that with one blow, wow.

The teenager stood in silence at the scene, wondering what was going to happen next.* - Thu Dec  3 22:55:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) had spent most of the day relaxing, wandering around the village, venturing to parts of it where he's never been before. His last stop was a little eatery at the Western side of town. He had been sitting in there trying out various meals, along with soups and salads. He had heard some ruckus going on outside, but paid little mind to it all, thinking that it was simply children playing around again.

At last, he picked up a cup of tea on his way out. As he exited the building, he blew gently over the top of the heated liquid before closing his eyes and taking a sip. He opened them only to find the outside of the shop in ruins. There were rocks jutting out of the ground, a huge gathering of people, including the Mizukage and she looked a little injured there.

He dropped his drink and rushed over to them. "Hey! What happened here? Is everyone okay?"* - Sat Dec  5 04:13:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) would take a step forward and attempt to help carry the woman. He would try to slip underneath her left arm, hoping that one of the other boys would follow suit and go under the right to lift her off of the floor effectively.* - Sat Dec  5 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) stepped aside as another boy came over, this one manipulating what appeared to be Gold dust. He looked over to the boy who was controling the material, swaeting a little as he did so. He scratched the side of his head a little before opening his mouth to speak.

"Hey uhh...are you sure you can carry her all the way? You look like you're having a hard time."* - Sat Dec  5 04:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) felt a strange presence around him as he looked at the Sand manipulator with curiosity. It was strange, as if a creature with extreme malice had appeared near him...but where? He turned around to where the Mizukage was, cloaked in a strange Teal chakra. It formed an aura around her body, stucking close to her skin save for the lone tail that stuck out from her rear end.

It seems as though she was focused on the pushy Genin from before who had struck her across the face. In a moment she was up towards him, as if her injuries had vanished. She extended her arm forward, chakra extending away from it and grabbing the young man, raising him into the sky and slamming him onto the ground. Asin flinched at the sight of it all, wondering if the boy was fine after that.

No matter how durable some people are, an attack like that is sure to do some real damage, especially from someone at a Kage level. He wondered what this power of hers was though. He's never seen or heard of something like this for as long as he's been alive, and this interested him. Well, not enough for him to get into this situation. He took one step back from his original position, watching to see if the Genin would get up from that attack.

Still, he was on guard, he had already focused his chakra, just in case she tried something on him. Besides that, he simply waited silently.* - Sat Dec  5 04:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) watched as the boy slid across the floor and struggle to get back up. It was the same boy who had fought the other Genin who manipulated shuriken, a difficult opponent indeed. As he struggled to get back up, Asin noticed that he used his power once more, the one where a slight aura and pressure are released from his body.

He began screaming that this power was his resolve or something, and that he must defeat the Mizukage for the mist...Defeat..the Mizukage, for the Mist. That sentence does not sound right at all. As far as Asin was concerned, the Mizukage was in complete control of her actions, after all she made it clear that her target was the boy who struck her.

The Mizukage retorted almost immediately with her own jutsu - cutting off the boy mid speech. Weaving a few handseals she opened her mouth and from her lips came gushing waves of water that knocked him back to the floor. She simply stated that she was getting even with him for striking her across the face, seems legit. Asin stood there, chuckling a little at the whole scene. Just what was Geo thinking to attack her like that?* - Sat Dec  5 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) shrugged as he walked closer towards the action now. "Hey, my friend in the green, need some help walking to the hospital?"* - Sat Dec  5 05:35:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Uhh, alright then. - Sat Dec  5 05:37:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) followed the duo all the way to the hospital, ensuring that they were safe and that nothing happened to them on the way. He watched as the boy before him helped her get settled in and sank into a chair soon afterwards. He looked back from him to the Mizukage and back to him, chuckling a little.

"Haha, well that's a neat skill there! How'd you learn to do it?"* - Sat Dec  5 05:47:44 2015

He was traveling North through the town when he spotted an older woman reading a book.

He walked over to her with a smile on his face and a slight wave. "Hello there~ If you're not too busy, would you mind showing me around this place? I'm not too sure where everything is.."* - Sun Dec  6 18:55:47 2015

As he was about to continue the conversation, a newcomer joined in. He was a male slightly younger than Asin, but he called the woman by name, meaning that they were famaliar with one another. Since that was the case, he decided to wait til she was finished with him before going on.* - Sun Dec  6 19:05:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Just wait a bit and sit down.  - Sun Dec  6 19:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) nodded towards the older woman and walked towards the statue, noticing a boy there with purple hair. She said that he might be into showing him around the village, but he declined. Asin chuckled a little, holding up his finger and focusing on his chakra. Slowly, it began to morph and change shape, turning into a liquid! He pointed the liquid finger at the boy and sent forth a weakly powered steam of water at him, wetting his head a little.

"Hey guys, lets just cool off haha." He said jokingly, hoping that they would get it.* - Sun Dec  6 19:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) stood there with a dull look on his face. "Come on, least give me a reason why not."* - Sun Dec  6 19:23:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Back off kid, before you get hurt. - Sun Dec  6 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: You'd hurt me? - Sun Dec  6 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Abraxas. Let him be. - Sun Dec  6 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: New guy. Back off. - Sun Dec  6 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: If I felt like it~ - Sun Dec  6 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Then we'll ask, Claudette! - Sun Dec  6 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: No. I will do it alone.  - Sun Dec  6 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Very well. - Sun Dec  6 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) sighed as he turned his head, listening to the input from the older woman. Perhaps this village was just filled with people who were mean? Or perhaps they jusut had a bad day or something. He looked back to the purple haired individual and shrugged his shoulders as he turned to walk away.

"Alright then. Couldn't hurt me if you tried~" He said, chuckling to himself. Clearly it was a bluff, but the young boy was simply seeking entertainment. As he turned to walk away he began focusing his chakra, spreading it evenly throughout his body and though it was not very visible, his form began to change, becoming slightly transparent.* - Sun Dec  6 19:29:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: You are willing to teach me after what I pulled? Are you trying to punish me some how? - Sun Dec  6 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) thinks: What kind of training does she have as a regime... - Sun Dec  6 19:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) halted as he felt the ground tremble a little. As he turned to look the grounf around them had been transformed into a crystalline structure. Then, two dragons rose from the ground, one moved to go around Asin and the other wrapped around himself, as if shielding him from attacks, or maybe just to look cool. He asked if Asin would like to test that theory, and to be honest, he probably did not wat to. He had only recently graduated from the academy and he only knew a few jutsu.

Continuing from the previous chakra focus, he would simply walk -through- the Dragon before him, his body being completely water as he did so. Though he looked composed, keeping up a full body water transformation would be draining his chakra constantly, so lasting a full fight was out of the question. He turned to face Abraxas now.

"Haha, wow! Now that is amazing! Well, no, I don't want to test that. It was a joke but it's clear that you're really strong, thanks for the display."* - Sun Dec  6 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) , though he had large amounts of chakra, would still be unable to keep up his transformation for much longer. The Dragon pursued the young boy, beginning to wrap around his form. Though his body was made of water, his chakra pools were beginning to go down now. As it wrapped tighter and tighter he could feel his concentration slipping.

He would try his best to keep up the technique, but he was slowly failing. His skin was slowly turning back to normal, and he could feel the rough crystal of the Dragon pushing against it. As if God had came and intervened, the Dragon began backing off, right as his jutsu wore off completely. He called it back to his side to stand guard with the first one.

Asin was breathing a little heavy now. <That was a little too close...> He thought to himself while looking at the purple haired boy. He was certainly strong..very strong, able to manipullate such things at ease. "Well..after that..I'm sure haha..Mmm..who's Asteroth? Name sounds funny."* - Sun Dec  6 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) notices that they boy simply went silent afterwards, not saying or doing anything. As if he were a toy robot and his batteries had died or something. He shrugs at this and took a seat right there, meditating a little to restore his lost chakra.* - Sun Dec  6 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Hm? - Sun Dec  6 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Now? - Sun Dec  6 20:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I have time now, - Sun Dec  6 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Menma. - Sun Dec  6 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I suppose now is fine then...And yes? - Sun Dec  6 20:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Hm? nothing. Uh. Hospital? - Sun Dec  6 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) thinks: Now she wants to move... - Sun Dec  6 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) , seeing as thought nothing was going on much, figured that he may as well go or something. Sad though..he had hoped to at least make a friend or two here, but it seems like that wasn't going to happen, though seeing a Crystal Dragon was kinda cool he figured. He got up from his resting position and went to the West, looking over his shoulder and speaking to the gentlemen as he did so.

"Well, I guess I'll be seeing you guys later.."* - Sun Dec  6 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: ........ - Sun Dec  6 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Thanks? - Sun Dec  6 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Welcome. - Sun Dec  6 22:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: ..Uh... Needed anything..? - Sun Dec  6 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) thinks: I have something in mind. - Sun Dec  6 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Nothing. - Sun Dec  6 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Did you need anything? - Sun Dec  6 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) thinks: Damn I wanna do her in the ass. Make that shit clap!~ - Sun Dec  6 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Why the fuck would I need anything from you at the moment? Mmh.  - Sun Dec  6 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I don't know. However, why did your tone change from me asking a simple question> - Sun Dec  6 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Nothing. - Sun Dec  6 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) was pretty much bored and down-right tired of the Leaf by now. Most of the people there refused to associate with him, not even knowing where he was from or anything. He sighed as he walked around the village, visiting the places the woman told him about, starting with the Kage Mansion.

He headed further North and passed through a few gates before he notices a famaliar figure coming towards him. It was the very same woman who had helped him out earlier, both with directions and the crystal user. He waved to her, his eyes closed and a smile on his face. He opened them to reveal purple irises that peered into her black hues.

"Hello there! Nice to see you again, what's up~"* - Sun Dec  6 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Oh... - Sun Dec  6 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Alright I guess. - Sun Dec  6 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Later. - Sun Dec  6 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) thinks: Onwards to the mansion I guess.. - Sun Dec  6 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No, I'm just ignoring you. - Sun Dec  6 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why? - Sun Dec  6 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Then what would you prefer me to call you? - Sun Dec  6 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Because I am? - Sun Dec  6 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Fine, be like that then. I was going to give you the money she gave me but whatever. - Sun Dec  6 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) says: ... - Sun Dec  6 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tengoku(Punka) thinks: Kana seems more...ignoring ever since the attack. - Sun Dec  6 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryo(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Damn, and I'm the unsociable one. - Sun Dec  6 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: ...Hm. - Sun Dec  6 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: These shinobi are pretty rude. If it was like how Tethys ran it, they'd have broken jaws.  - Sun Dec  6 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Call me Hisoka, if you want a name to use. - Sun Dec  6 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) thinks: Oh well, not my problem. Except for Kyubishu.  - Sun Dec  6 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rokujou, Kida(Shiziru101) says: Ah. Pleasure to meet you Hisoka. I'm Rin. Rin Kitsugami. - Sun Dec  6 22:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) , giving up on Konohagakure, decided that it was time to go back home. The people there were a little strange, not to mention anti-social, though it seemed the Crystal user was not of that village. Shame, he had hoped that he could get some training done there, oh well. He went to the village entrance with the little Ryo he had left and boarded a Caravan that would take him back to Kirigakure.

The trip there took a while, but at last he was finally home again. He walked through the village for a while before noticing a rather large crowd assembling in one area. Even though he was from the same village as them, he hardly knew anyone. In fact, looking in this crows the only one he's even spoken to was Kana. Nonetheless, he walks in and begins to speak.

"Uhh, hey, did something happen here again?" He asked to no one in general, remembering the last attack that happened in the village.* - Sun Dec  6 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Anguo(Waterpark) says: Right. - Sun Dec  6 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hello, Mizukage. - Sun Dec  6 22:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Can't you see I'm not in the mood to speak? - Sun Dec  6 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Nope. - Sun Dec  6 22:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) thinks: Maybe if I kill someone I'll get a response... - Sun Dec  6 22:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Well.. - Sun Dec  6 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Besides being ignored.. - Sun Dec  6 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Alright. - Sun Dec  6 22:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) shrugged his shoulders at the request of a spar. Perhaps sometime later, for now he was focused on what Geo had said before about joining a Squad. Even though he graduated from the Academy, he still wasn't in one, and the boredom was getting to him. He moved over to where Kana stood.

"Glad to see that you're out of the hospital~" He began, a smile on his face. "Mmm..well, if it's not too much trouble, can you add me to a Squad so I can start some missions and stuff?"* - Sun Dec  6 22:42:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) notices that Kana is ignoring him, and honestly that is kinda annoying, soooooooooo he has a plan. Focusing on his chakra, he would mould it through his entire body. Even though he looked normal, he was now in a liquified state. He raised one hand and rubbed his finger on Kana's arm, leaving a trail of warm water where he moved.* - Sun Dec  6 22:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) was rubbing her arm in his hydrated state, even though he could not hold it for as long as some of his elder clan members, a few minutes wouldn't strain his body as much. As he rubbed her arm he would notice something at the side of his face. It was as if time froze. What exactly was that? A bug..? No..something much bigger than that. And then, as if someone had hit the play button, a sweeping foot went through his head, wetting the woman's foot and disturbing his form. 

As her foot landed on the floor, his head would reconstruct back to its proper shape. "Geez, you didn't have to kick me!"* - Sun Dec  6 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) took a step back, but continued to speak to her. "I just wanted to join a squad so I can start helping the village, Lord Mizukage." Well, he mainly wanted to do it to make himself stronger and get some experience by doing missions, but he wasn't exactly lying, it would be helping the village by bringing in profits.* - Sun Dec  6 23:02:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) had simply been relaxing in front of the academy, well, despite the fact that a man had just been executed in the front of him. He's seen death a few times already, so this did not really phase him much..however, what happened next did.

He peered to the South as a lone figure approaches the group. He seemed somewhat famaliar, donning the Mizukage's Robes. He had long white hair and strange skin, yet his overall appearance was..famaliar. It took a few moments before it snapped in Asin's mind that the man before him was none other than the previous Mizukage, Tethys!

But..how can that be? Didn't the man die? Strange..very strange indeed. Asin came closer to the man, a little on guard as he was still not sure on if this was a trap set by an enemy. He began molding chakra through his body, liquifying it just in case a surprise attack came out of nowhere or in case the man himself attacked the group.

He approached him cautiously. "Ermm...Hello?"* - Mon Dec  7 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) , still carrying an uncertain gaze, stared at the older male. Well, it sounded as if he knew who he was, and from the way he spoke he sounded welcoming enough. As Asin was about to open his mouth, the man's eyes suddenly snap open and he turned into a flurry of papers that fluttered about. His voice however, could still be heard in the wind as they vanished, telling them to not speak of this day..How strange.

Asin releases his technique and turns to face the others. "Uhmm..did you guys see that?"* - Mon Dec  7 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(Wantpark) says: .... - Mon Dec  7 05:14:27 2015

The boy used to spend days learning the various techniques such as the Bunshin, Kawarimi and henge techniques, nearly perfecting thrm, but now he has grown somewhat lazy, shoot, he didn't even learn many of his clan's skills.

This day, he decided that he would fight with someone, who he would fight he didn't know, but hopefully it would be someone around his skill level. He wandered around the village for quite some time until he spotted someone around his age with a head full of blue hair. He dashed over to the boy, a smirk on his face while waving slightly.

"Hello there! Would you be interested in a spar by any chance? I'm not really skilled so some help would be appreciated~"* - Mon Dec  7 22:38:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geo Dude(Wynokx) says: If you're about to spar get it over with quickly. - Mon Dec  7 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) smiled at the boy's politeness and moved to the South of him to face his direction. He pulled out his tanto, sheathe and all to use in the spar. He stretched his arms and legs  little as he got into a simple stance. "Thanks, ready when you are~"* - Mon Dec  7 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) smirked as the boy was ready for battle. He held the Tanto in front of him as he dashed forward. Since the sheathe was on the blade, there was no real threat from it besides blunt damage, but it still may hurt. As he moved forward with the blade in his right hand, he held up a handseal with his left, focusing on his chakra.

His control over the technique was growing steadily and he was able to hold it for a while now. His body was now completely liquified, though it was not apparent, not unless someone attempted an attack on him or something. He brought the blade across swiftly with a simple basic strike to start the spar off.* - Mon Dec  7 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) moved the sheathed blade quickly in a swiping motion, but it was met with a powerful fist that managed to knock the blade back a bit, though since the sheathe was made of metal perhaps he may have suffered some damage that way. Just then, another fist came into Asin's stomach, attempting to deliver a powerful blow to his abdominal region. Thankfully, the boy had liquified his body, managing to avoid the damage.

Instead, the fist went through the boy. Now smirking, he pushed forward, with the fist inside of him still and attempted an overhead strike on Gravel!* - Mon Dec  7 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) was shocked to see someone react so quickly to his technique, but oh well, he puched on. The blade was blocked by the boy's arms, which seemed to be chakra enhanced or something of the like, so instead, Asin tossed the blade aside and moved both of his hands and arms, while in a liquid state, to cover Gravel's face! 

Doign this would cut off his flow of oxygen, as if he were underwater. Asin would stick close to the boy, attempting to make him pass out like this.* - Mon Dec  7 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) watched as the boy tapped on his legs. For a moment he thought that it was just a strange gesture, or perhaps preparation for another attack? He almost face-palmed as he caught on and jumped backwards, returning his body to his normal, solid state. He rubbed the back of his head as he picked the Tanto up and strapped it onto his back and chuckled a little.

"Hehe...sorry, I guess I got a little confused there..Man, from that punch and how you blocked my blade I can tell that you're really strong! Oh right, I am Asin by the way. Asin Hozuki, that was a nice spar my friend~"* - Mon Dec  7 23:23:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Well met, Gravel~ I hope we can do this again someday. And I do believe that we're about the same strength haha. That jutsu takes up a lot of chakra, so I was gonna run out before I could end it~ - Mon Dec  7 23:25:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) rested up for about two days before making any plans whatsoever. It seems as though everyone in the village has left in groups to do God knows what, leaving him there alone. The Kage never put him in a squad, and whenever he asked about it, he was simply ignored.

Sighing, Asin had saved up enough money to travel somewhere via caravan, and so he decided to go back to Konohagakure, seeing as though he actually met some people there last time. The Caravan he chose got him there in a relatively fats pace and he paid them as he got off. He wandered around the village for a while before he spotted a famaliar red-headed woman. He waved to her as he approached.

"Hello there! Nice to see you again~"* - Mon Dec  7 23:39:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: Oh my, hello guys. - Mon Dec  7 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) 's initial excitement dropped a little as she seemed not the least bit interested in the younger boy. Perhaps she was just that kind of person? Nonetheless, it was someone to talk to in the near empty place. He shrugs off the negative attitude she gave off and continued.

"Well, what's going on?" He asked as he heard a voice behind him. He turned his head to the side to see a black haired girl behind him. He waved his hand to her and smiled. "Hello there~"* - Mon Dec  7 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) cocks his head to the right as the woman simply shrugs her shoulders at his question. What did that even mean? He dropped the thought from his mind as she just stared at them. "Sooo...where were ya headed?" He attempted again, hoping to get a bit more of a response this time.* - Mon Dec  7 23:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) looked towards the blond woman who finally decided to speak up and responds to her after she spoke with the ladies behind him. He placed both of his hands behind his head as he intertlocked his fingers. "My name's Asin, and who might you be?" He asked. Purple hues shifted left and right, and she was right. There was hardly anyone around the town, and it seemed as though nothing was going on.* - Tue Dec  8 00:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) carried a nonchalant attitude about the whole thing. He actually only came to this village because back at home people were just completely stupid and he couldn't take it anymore, that and the few people he hung out with left. He smiled at the slightly warm greeting, remembering the name Asteroth from Abraxas.

"Ahh, so you're Asteroth, nice to meet you, and thank you for the welcome~ Mmm, is there anything around here to do or is it all just mix n' mingleing?"* - Tue Dec  8 00:11:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) was beginning to think that the entirety of Sunagakure was going to ignore him, well not exactly ignore him, but people tend to stick to their own crowds, and unfortunately for Asin he wasn't a part of any. He was strolling through what looked like the village square when a girl who looked to be around his age approaches him and extends a hand forward and introduced herself as Chikyu.

He returned the smile and shook her hand firmly. "Nice to meet you as well, Chikyu~ And I guess you can say I'm new around here, more or less. I usually don't come around this way. Oh, and I'm Asin by the way~"* - Tue Dec  8 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anyone seen Koji? - Tue Dec  8 03:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: T-Training with sanoke.. - Tue Dec  8 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) , upon closer inspection, noticed that the girl had chunks of metal scattered about her body, closely resembling that of a Gladiator, well to Asin at least. She seemed like a pleasant enough person to be around, well compared to the people around them who remained rather silent. She looks past the boy to another who was looking for and requested a mission, which she got.

Not being able to see the scroll Asin would look to Chikyu. "Hey, I know this may be a little weird..but do you mind if I come along to help? I've never been on a mission before, not even a simple one sadly.."* - Tue Dec  8 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: O-Oh..where a-are you going c-chikyu? - Tue Dec  8 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Ahh, alright I guess, though I don't know where he ran off to.. - Tue Dec  8 03:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: A-Alright. - Tue Dec  8 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) nodded and smiled at the girl's comment, taking a step to her side. "Well, let's go when you're ready."* - Tue Dec  8 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Lets go Asin, we'll ask Sanoke if you can help. - Tue Dec  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Okay - Tue Dec  8 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Asin here, would like to help on that mission to clean up your filthy attic, if you don't mind. - Tue Dec  8 03:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: What? Uh. . sure. I don't mind. - Tue Dec  8 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asin(Thanatoz) says: Thank you~ - Tue Dec  8 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: LETS GO ASIN! - Tue Dec  8 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) watched as the girl leapt high into the air, an impressive feat for someone her age, and grabs the handle, releasing a ladder that fell down onto her head. Asin was going to laugh a little, but he considered that to be rude, so he held it in. Not too soon after, she held the ladder and gestured for Asin to go first, after saying ladies first. If he knew she was gonna play that card he was gonna laugh at her soooo hard.

He chuckled a little at her gesture and held his hand out as well, mimicing her. "Well then you should hop to it eh?~"* - Tue Dec  8 03:47:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) looked high and mighty when she said that she would go first, as if he had won the bout between the two, then she called out and said that she was only going first because he was afraid. He instantly looked up at her as she made her way up the ladder, a grin on his face. "Psh, yeah right."

He began traveling up the ladder moments before she called down to him, saying that it was safe to come up. As he went up the final steps he took a sweep around the room, purple hues bouncing around in his eyes as they looked to each item. "Man, I can see why he wanted in here cleaned, it's filthy. By the way, who is Sanoke? I mean he can give out missions, so someone important right?"* - Tue Dec  8 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) 's eyes widened as the mentioned that the man before was the Kazekage! He was so young and he seemed so normal. Well, that just goes to show that one cannot judge someone by their appearance. He compared the two sides of the room, noticing that hers was less cluttered that her side, but he didn't mind much. He simply walked over to his side and began picking up stray books and assembling them into piles after dusting them off.

He figured that he may as well make some small talk while cleaning up, so he spoke up. "So, Chikyu, why are you wearing armor in the middle of the village? Isn't it heavy, or hot even?"* - Tue Dec  8 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz)  had found his own broom and began sweeping his side of the room after he had fixed up the books and arranged them properly. He took a swift glance over to her side, and the room noticeably became brighter and looked so much better than before. "Attacks from your Dad you say? I take it you two spar a lot?" Asin chuckled at his little remark, remembering the days his Father taught him a technique or two.* - Tue Dec  8 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) finished up sweeping on his side of the room and began working on the spider webs that were up in the corners of the attic. He often wondered when they got there, because while cleaning this entire room, he's yet to see a single spider around that would be able to make the webs, how strange..Chikyu had answered his question, saying that her father often got lost in the spars and actually beat her, something that made Asin's mood go a little sour. He couldn't stand people like that, but what could he do, kill her Dad and make her fatherless like himself? Not worth it.

"Ahh, I see,,Sorry for asking, I guess I overstepped.."* - Tue Dec  8 04:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) 's mood lightened up a little as the girl burst out into laughter. It was good that he met someone who could shrug off something so easily and not get completely offended by it. He continued to knock down cobwebs that were up and about the place and moved back to finishing the floor by sweeping the dirt and dust into the pan. He took one final look around his side of the room before nodding and smiling to himself.

The books and scrolls were all in order, the cobwebs were down and the floor was swept. It actually looked decent now~ He strolled over to her side of the room and smiled. "Haha, need a little help there?"* - Tue Dec  8 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Asin(Thanatoz) watched the girl work hard and after a little while she was done and all set to move out. Once again, he swept the room with his gaze, a smirk appearing on his face as it was successfully cleaned up! He nodded to himself as she stated that they should go back to Sanoke to report in. "Hehe, yeah. Thanks for letting me help by the way, it was nice~"* - Tue Dec  8 04:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Its no problem. - Tue Dec  8 04:55:15 2015
