"--Hrm?" Before Marcocould ask why she hadn't just gone to a library, Kiyoko grabs attention.

"And what makes you say this?"* - Wed Nov 11 10:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) opens his maw, as if to reply -- but decides against it.

Even if in the belief that jealousy was a very ugly thing, it's clear that scolding Kiyoko wasn't exactly wise. Regardless, his gaze falls back onto the conversation being held.* - Wed Nov 11 10:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Unfortunately..yeah. Things aren't going so well in kirigakure right now. - Wed Nov 11 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Funny how life works. . I suppose everything happens for a reason. Sunagakure has been well for me thus far.. - Wed Nov 11 14:47:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) perks a brow, seemingly intrigued.

"Oh. . ? And what would the business be of? My. . . All of this time, I figured you to be a simple shinobi."* - Wed Nov 11 14:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Trading Jutsu. - Wed Nov 11 14:57:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Intelligent. I will eagerly observe. Who knows, it may actually make money. - Wed Nov 11 14:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Ah. .. Nifty technique. Still, the price is ridiculous. - Wed Nov 11 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Of course. For a jutsu I personally developed, the price won't be smalle - Wed Nov 11 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I have a large amount of jutsu I can teach for significantly less. - Wed Nov 11 15:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Well. The idea, in hindsight, isn't too bad. - Wed Nov 11 15:06:40 2015

"Care for a cup of tea? Or anything."* - Wed Nov 11 15:22:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure I suppose - Wed Nov 11 15:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) kicks off the ground.

He seemed a lot more social as of late. Perhaps due to the chipper mood that had been gained with the growing expansion of his business. Perhaps in time Marco could go global.* - Wed Nov 11 15:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||

The shop is nearby. 

After a few short meters of traveling, Marco cracks the door open, his eyes examining the insides. Oddly, the restaurant seemed a tadbit dishoveled, as if a brawl had taken place. 

The employees chattered in discontent, blaming rowdy shinobi for the issues. 

Ignoring such, Marco takes a seat while gently waving for a waitress. Given slow businessand the early-ness, one of the more. . special employee is sent. A pink-haired ditz, physically gifted with curves and clumsily making way on over to the table. "Yes. . I suppose a cup of tea?" A hand motions for Lera to do as she pleased.

"Hrm. .  Are you good with thinking of names?"* - Wed Nov 11 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||The waitress nods before clumsily moving to the north. She personally begins handling the request.

"My shop. Funny enough, I've gotten business, but I haven't really thought of a good name. It has to be something recognizeable. . "* - Wed Nov 11 15:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: A name for the business... - Wed Nov 11 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sorry. Can't say I'm good with that sort've stuff - Wed Nov 11 15:43:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Unfortunate. . I've been struggling. - Wed Nov 11 15:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I may just go with putting my name on it.. - Wed Nov 11 15:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Marco's Weapons... - Wed Nov 11 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Ergh. I dunno. What would you call your business? - Wed Nov 11 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* It does the job - Wed Nov 11 15:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||
"I suppose. So. . . Tell me about yourself. I've seen you plenty, yet know so little. I recall being told of your might back in Kirigakure. Certainly, a powerful shinobi such as yourself has a story to share."

The waitress by then had managed to complete they order.

She walks over, in high-heels, clearly being unable to retain her balance. Upon reaching the table, she trips up, forcing both the cup of tea and coffee to slam onto the table. It spills over shortly after. 

Meanwhile, the moderately tall woman likely goes crashing into Lera.

* - Wed Nov 11 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) looked on with surprised as the earthly technique is casually performed. 

With the clutz now reduced to light weght, she effortlessly regains balance. "Weee!" It goe s without saying that she fully takes advantance and proceeds to fly off.

"Quite the impressive skill. And I don't know. . " Marco drawls. He leans in after a thought.

"What drives you to do what you do. . . Why you wake up every morning wanting to be a shinobi."* - Wed Nov 11 16:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: What drives me? - Wed Nov 11 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Indeed. - Wed Nov 11 16:13:13 2015

By now, Marco was sitting on the hot sunagakure floor. A scroll was taken out, and the male is essentially drawing up schematics, various different images. Some for his own personal creations, while others revolved solely about the craftmanship of other orders.

Sadly, the battle at hand was far too captivating. 

"Ah. . . Hiding Like a Mole. Such an infuriating technique. It's up to the blue-haired lad to keep that jutsu from being as effective," Marco mused. Of course, he had a hard time choosing who to root for. On one hand, it was always fun to go for an underdog, and one was a friend.

On the other. . Yan was a paying customer. Thus, his opinions are held to himself. Maco can't help but to notice the perversion to the left. Keeping up his persona as a stoic, dignified gentlemen, the male's eyes cant to the left briefly. "Get a room, would you?"* - Thu Nov 12 08:15:47 2015
