<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) folded his arms and watched the entire exchange.

Inside Marco's body, a pinge of envy developed. He hated Zaen -- not for his attitude, or holier-than-thou demeanor. . But rather, due to the power he possessed. The Kaguya was the personification of what Marco fundamentally despised --- People simply being better than another person due to heritage or natural strength.

And all too soon, Kirie had reacted with swiftness.

The strange weapon is manipulated, transforming into a Hammer and crashing down harshly against the Bone Manipulator's frame. It was a gruesome sight to behold. Momentum carrying ahead, the flesh on his cheeks moved in ripples, all until the entirety of Zaen's frame had been pounded into the floor. Shortly afterwards, the Hammer's weight continued to take advantage of the gravity, and thus crushed the poor soul.

Easily, bones are fractured, and blood begins to trickle along the area. Marco's eyes flowed the liquid's strange path. . . His hearty hanging heavy in protest. ". . .I. . . I understand the need for caution. But. . . Lord Mizukage. . .  There are better ways to handle this. Children frequent here. . !"

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Is it really expected for us to? It's been only a little bit.. - Tue Nov  3 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) squints. 

He whispers more to Heiwa.* - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: And now. . he seeks to leave? - Tue Nov  3 07:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: He's not the only one. Elon and Violet have both left. Alongside Thaenan.  - Tue Nov  3 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Off of merit of that alone we can't judge Nina or Ortho. - Tue Nov  3 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whispers: The -village-? - Tue Nov  3 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) clenches his fist in protest.

Anger boiled in. He takes a step forward.* - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Now now. . . - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I assume. . . An intelligent man such as yourself. - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Woudl realize the suspicion that is immediately garnered, no? - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He doesn't care. - Tue Nov  3 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) remained stoic.

His body subtly shook in rage-- moreso at Ortho's heartly comments. "It's this thinking. . . It's why the current system is flawed," Marco muttered to himself unintelligibly. The shakings quickly come to an end, as the blacksmith re-obtains his usual, reserved demeanor.

". . .The saying goes. 'All that is necccesary for evil to triumph. . . Is for good men to do nothing.' . . " He replies with a sign being turning back to the rubble. There was no way Marco could stop Ortho anywho. For what was a mere man to a shinobi?* - Tue Nov  3 07:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||His back had remained to the action.

"I pity these shinobi. . . Chakra is often poison. Corrupting their minds. . . compelling them to do evil," Marco monologued to himself quietly. He's still enraged internally, moreso at his inability to put the Katon-Releaser user in his place.

Then a screech could be heard.

Like a blow torch, flames emanated from the fiend's maw. The light shoned bright, and the heat was even more significant. It was these symptoms that prompted the horrified craftman to turn about face and observe the destruction. BOom! The flames eventually release themselves on impact, easily incinerating twenty lesser shinobi.* - Tue Nov  3 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: What are you doing?! - Tue Nov  3 07:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||The blacksmith's look of horror only expanded.

It wasn't due to shock -- but rage. This was a skill similar to many others he'd seen in his time. . . And without fail, Marco was irked. A hand rises, rubbing against his cranium as a headache suddenly is induced. Marco's heart beated a bit heavy, and a flash back was being induced.

But it was partial. . 

The physical realm, and Marco's on psyche was more or less smelding. Imagery of the devestating Chakra Beast, the very same that had come from the last Mizukage, appeared in a ghastly formation. In tandem with Manda, it terrorized and wrecked havoc, destroying shinobi by the hundreds.

"STOP IT! STOP IT! STOOOP IT!" The usually reserved figure was reaching his breaking point. The screams of the innocents screeched through is brain. But only one cry really stuck out. . . Oh brother. Not another episode..* - Tue Nov  3 08:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||And just as quickly as it had began, the chaos had subsided.

He watched with detest as the slimey snake slithered away, the mere presence or sight of it enough to make Marco's skin craawl. "Ugh. . . Those type of people make me sick." And he wasn't just talking about the villainous type. Marco spoke in reference to all of the humans that shamelessly abused the gifts of chakra.

Yet. . . being the only adult figure, the apparently 'kind-hearted' blacksmith makes his approach, reaching the center of the crowd.

A glance falls first onto Violet. "Shinobi. . .It has an interesting definition, does it not? It is to endure. Your past leaders wouldnt' want you to simply break down under the pressure. Get up, and fix this mess. . . Then maybe you'll be more prepared to vanquish this fiend in the next encounter."

Finally, his gaze falls onto Nina. A hand plants onto the adolescent's head of hair. "As for you. . . Don't linger on these negatives feelings. Yes. . . that man was your 'brother'. . . In a biological sense. But based on his action, he wasn't truly your kin in relation. Don't mourn that he's ignored or perhaps left you to fend for yourself. After all. . If you are a Kirigakure shinobi. The village that still remains is like an extended family. . "* - Tue Nov  3 08:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods.

He gives a very brief smile. "It's good. . . Luckily for you, you have young men. . . Such as this little one, who seem ready to serve," Marco notes, referencing Heiwa. 

"Albeit. . You may want to prepare for a subsequent attack. As well as put ah it out on the man that dared summon the Snake. . "* - Tue Nov  3 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods along.

"Good thinking. . . You are quite mature for a youngster. . ." the blacksmith responds casually. It wasn't exactly a rare feat to witness -- not in this chaotic, shinobi-based world. Kids often were forced to grow up faster than they'd like, that was for sure.

He gives a glance to Violet and does a gesture. Perhaps she too should go about with release efforts? * - Tue Nov  3 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: ... I guess I have alot of work to do...  - Tue Nov  3 09:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Tell me. Who do you see as becoming the next leader? - Tue Nov  3 09:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says:  It would probuly be Me or Elon... noone else is really fit for it - Tue Nov  3 09:45:48 2015
