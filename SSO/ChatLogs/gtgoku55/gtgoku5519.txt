<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||Cue a brisk walk to the blacksmithing shop.

The front room possess a counter and a display for customers. Shurikens, Windmills, Katanas, and so forth. It's late, and just as they arrive, two of Marco's clerks are stepping out. 

A brief wave is given.

"We'll head to the backroom." Naturally, both parties would have moved beyond the table and push through a door. In the back, the room is dimly lit, with a few candles being the only source of light.  . . Well, save for the furnance that burned in the back. Opting not to go further, Marco manuevers to a seat and pulls a chair out for Mitsunara's sake.

A slew of tools were set on the table for appraise and testing. Hammers, blow torches, magnifying glasses, thermometers, and an assortment of other items. Particularly, some ores are also around -- you guessed it, the very same ores he planned to use to replicate and craft a sword beyond Mitsunara's.* - Sun Dec  6 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) raised a brow.

"Have a bad time? I didn't intend to break it, but hrm. . How am I going to test it's properties?" A blow torch was in hand, and flares briefly. Azure flames were secrated out for just a moment, before ceasing.

"Can it not be burned? If not I can simply look at the other properties not related to physical things."* - Sun Dec  6 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) 's lips cracked into a smile.

"Of course. I know what I'm doing. . .Didn't expect you to be so protective over the weapon. But yes, I'll act with care."

With that, Marco began with his examination of the blade. Carefully, his tool for measuring heat is pressed forward as he aimed to examine and validate each property of the new material. Just at first glance, he could tell that the item was foreign --- completely. Perhaps even from a different world. 

The consistent glowing released a slight aura of malice, and coupled with Mitsunara's potective nature over the blade, he couldn't help but feel that there was more to the tool's power."Alright. . .Carefully. . . "

With that, the blow torch is at last brought forward, and moves to incinerate the tip of the bladed contraption. Each second iscontrolled, forcing the tool's energy levels to rise, and the temperatures to take a stark incline as a direct result. As the time ticked on, the recorder was enable to note the and record each of the attributes taken. Once that had been done, the process is just another half hour or so of testings.

The tensile strength, it's malleability, and of course the it's durability. In no time, Marco is more or less completed with the physical tests. Now? All that was left was to check the Huevo-based weapon would respond to actual chakra. He gives a wary glance to Mitsunara. "So, you can activate this blade's ability by sending chakra to command whatever is stored in, yes?" Conveniently, he has tools just for the task -- supplied by some grand Fuuinjutsu master. 

From seals, chakra pours out, lathering the base of the weaponry in order to gauge how it'd react. Based on that, Marco jots down notes too. He'd hope for input from the defacto assistant. In no time, the male arises, gathering his own notes from a filing cabinent. As it's opened, the swordswoman would take notice of an assortment of data revolvintg around chakra-based metals. Mostly the ones that could absorb natures, or even block chakra.

It was these types of items that he'd hope could be fused in addition with carbon and other elements to form special alloys. The alloys preferably would work to absorb ethereal materials. . And given chakra's close connection to the soul? Maybe the proposed weapon could take that as well.

Along the side of the file was a complete and detailed diagram of the mind-body concept, that gave information of chi, the body's relation to chi, and the soul.* - Sun Dec  6 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||
Indeed. The comparisons were made, linking it to various average-day materials. Still, her weapon was an anomally, and it baffled Marco's very understanding of blacksmith-ing or crafting in general. The look of confusion was obvious, while also being laced with intrigue.

"This is amazing. I only have one more question before I collect my data and work on a prototype to my weapon later. Is manipulating the shape of the tool all you can do?" Curious, brown eyes settle onto Mitsunara's face, clearly desperate for an answer.* - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) rubs his nose in thought.

So souls made it grow in power and efficiency? That is noted, and all of the information is hastily stored back away.

"That's a lot of good data. I should be able to get a nice prototype of my mission completed within a month's time at the most. Where did you get that blade again? It's beyond anything I've ever seen before."* - Sun Dec  6 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) 's eyes followed her hips along the way.

He bit down onto his lip, as the motions came off as clear taunts -- as if Mitsunara sought to tempt him.

"And. . The blade is something you were born with?" He asks after taking a moment to regain composure.* - Sun Dec  6 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods. It made sense.

"I see. Well good research -- But what have you to do after this? I looking to redeem myself after that crushing defeat at the bar," He replies casually, of course with less than honorable intent available in his eyes.* - Sun Dec  6 08:13:13 2015
