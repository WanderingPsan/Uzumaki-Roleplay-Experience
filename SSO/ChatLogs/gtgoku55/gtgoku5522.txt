<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||

Finally, Marco had to get offh is lazy ass and work for a living. Being a rich motherfucker had made the blacksmith complacent. . Yet now he had obligations to fulfull. The order given to him by CHikyu wasn't anything that was truthfully beyond the craftman's ability. . . It was essentially a zanbatou crafted from steel, with very high-end aethetic appeal.

Starting off the blacksmith-ing process, the gent moved, throwing heaps of raw owes into the frying pan and leating the furnace do it's thing. By now, given his years of work, this was a trivial task, and with observant eyes, Marco knows just when to remove the material. It possesses an orange glow, making it the perfect temperature for refinement.

For the umpteenth time, Marco never moved to use the crude metals until the proper alloys had been designed. Once re-inforced steel had been smelted, the process of blacksmtihing began, each one systematic and fundamental. He startedfrom the beginning, first hammering away to bend the heap of metal to the general shaping. And from there? Refinement to the weapon's density was applied. 

The sequence was one of repetition and tediousness. Again, the hammers slammed, forcing sparks to fly from the tool's form, and naturally panning out the metal like a regular pancake. But all the same, each blow pushed the item one step furhter to completion. For the next hour, this is all Marco did, obsessively as he made the simple dream a reality. . And it was done. HAving placed the weapon in a cooler, the gent moved to add aethetic appeals.

The gem is chiseled in, as is all of the specialized, colorful designs.* - Sun Dec 13 18:25:52 2015
