<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: Actually Marco...Now that you can make weapons, would you be interested in examining this legendary weapon I told you about? - Fri Nov 20 14:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) whispers: And I would also like to discuss an idea I had. I would like to know if its possible. - Fri Nov 20 14:22:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Good, how are you? You okay, you seemed pretty hurt. - Fri Nov 20 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) waits for Lera to lead.* - Fri Nov 20 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm good, Kiyoko is an awesome doctor. - Fri Nov 20 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) orders fattening foods.

They're set onto the table. "Mhm. . . I've yet to meet an order that was beyond my ability. Talk to me," Marco speaks calmly.* - Fri Nov 20 14:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well then, This should be interesting then - Fri Nov 20 14:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I would like a large amount of fabric made into some...special clothing. While that doesn't sound hard, I want to know if its possible to make this fabric similar to armour. Strong and durable, yet still flexible. - Fri Nov 20 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Obviously. It would probably be impossible to make something so thin as strong as genuine armour. - Fri Nov 20 14:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But every little bit helps right? - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Durable cloth. . . Do-able I suppose. I'd assume this is your desire so that you can avoid being slowed down, right? - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: That and I don't paticularly like armour. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: besides the other idea I had, but that can wait. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I see. I was going to suggest light armor, but this isn't too hard either. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Is that all? I have time if you want to discuss more. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Paticularly...I want them made in a similar appearence to my current outfit. - Fri Nov 20 14:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And if you have time then I could put in an order I guess. - Fri Nov 20 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: But I wanted to make a little more money first. - Fri Nov 20 14:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) shifts a brow to Kiyoko as she seemed flustered over so little.

Making no comment, Marco goes back to gorging himself on the sweet dumplings, before giving a nod to Lera. "Well that's easy. . . Although, new. I haven't really thought about making simple cloth durable. And please, tell me of your other plans. It'll at least let me be able to make an estimate of the cost."* - Fri Nov 20 14:40:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) chuckles at the comment.

"Wow. What's with all you shinobi and wanting brass knuckles or gauntlets. This wouldn't be hard. . .I'd even be able to make it chakra conductive. Currently, I'd estimate that this would be about. . . one-point-two million?" Marco says with a shrug, his tone reserved as always.* - Fri Nov 20 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sounds reasonable. - Fri Nov 20 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I'll give you an extra hundred thousand for spiked knuckles on those gauntlets. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'll see how much more that'll cost me. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) jots this down.* - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Sure thing. - Fri Nov 20 14:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just on a random note....i'd like it to be red... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: The gauntlet I mean. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Kind of like a deep crimson. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) writes this down as well.

"Anything else?"* - Fri Nov 20 14:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Nope thats about it. When i get more money i'll have more of that cloth made though. - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: I'll have Kiyoko's clothes made from it... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: All of that includes the Kukiri set's? - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) whispers: It seems like so much stuff... - Fri Nov 20 14:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Oh no, the Kuriki Set would probably cost like six-hundred grand per. Lera can afford it, sure enough. - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: O-oh.. the big set is the same? - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: After paying that is. - Fri Nov 20 14:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) thinks: Plenty enough to build a house befitting Kiyoko... - Fri Nov 20 14:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Most likely. <@Kiyoko> - Fri Nov 20 14:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well, Thats about everything. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Just give me a time when you want to examine the weapon. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I don't mind when. - Fri Nov 20 14:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods along.

"Sure. I'll get to that in a few days, a bit pre-occupied finishing some other requests," he admits before turning back to eating to his heart's content.* - Fri Nov 20 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No worries. - Fri Nov 20 14:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Well then, don't let me hold you two up. I'm going to finish up my dumplings, you are free to go. - Fri Nov 20 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Heh. Sure, I'll see you later Marco. - Fri Nov 20 15:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Well.. you do seem to like that trait though... Marissa and Mitsunara.... you chose the two most agressive people in the villag.e - Fri Nov 20 17:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well...I guess. - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Theres not many single women in Suna either... - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: But, most are agressive because they have a dream or a goal to obtain. Which means you can rely on them. - Fri Nov 20 17:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: And, yeah... so many pretty girls hooked up. - Fri Nov 20 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mm...not always... - Fri Nov 20 17:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But uh...I guess theres lots of people here though. - Fri Nov 20 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So that makes it easier to make friends right? - Fri Nov 20 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Of course, I'm sure you'll find lots of friends. - Fri Nov 20 17:39:50 2015
