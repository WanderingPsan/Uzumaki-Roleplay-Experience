<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I have nothing to do right now, and it sucks. - Fri Dec  4 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Ah. Besides fighting, what is it that you enjoy to do? - Fri Dec  4 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) wrinkles his nose.

He ponders, before stepping out. "Shall we?" A hand gestures to the Hungry Ant.

"Drinks on me?"* - Fri Dec  4 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) briskly walks into the restaurant.

He takes a seat, bringing up a menu. "So. . What do you usually like to drink? I'm curious how well you can hold your alcohol."* - Fri Dec  4 04:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Mmm. So, would you be willing to place a wager for who can hold their alcohol the best? Can be anything. - Fri Dec  4 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'll put some yen. - Fri Dec  4 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Eh... - Fri Dec  4 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't much care about gambling. Sure, I guess? - Fri Dec  4 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: What would you wager? - Fri Dec  4 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ah... I dunno. - Fri Dec  4 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I don't really have much of value, y'know? - Fri Dec  4 04:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Pity. - Fri Dec  4 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. - Fri Dec  4 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: It doesn't have to be an item. It can also be just a task, something silly or whatever. - Fri Dec  4 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, what do you want? - Fri Dec  4 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'm unsure. - Fri Dec  4 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) by then had made an order.

He brings up about twenty glasses each -- some filled with sake, others filled with whiskey. The payment is given on the spot. 

"I doubt either of us will finish the entire content. Mmm. . How many Yen would you like on the line?"* - Fri Dec  4 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ponders. 

His eyes avert forward, deep in thought. 

"I'll put one-hundred and fifty thousand on the line?" It wasn't too much, and wouldn't exactly hurt Marco's pockets.* - Fri Dec  4 04:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: As for you. . Hrm.. - Fri Dec  4 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: How opposed would you be to wagering a strip-tease of sorts? - Fri Dec  4 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods. A simple wager between two collegues.

"Obviously not in public. Then it's a done deal, let's start," the blacksmith declared casually. THe table was already filled to the brink with an assortment of drinks -- twenty each for the participants. Some of the mugs were overflowing, with foam spewing from the lid. 

Regardless, the craftman seemed undettered. A hand wraps around the first mug, and the contents is gulped down. Marco retained his usually gentlemanly demeanor, taking modest gulps, and never spilling a drop.

In no time, a warm fuzzy feeling came over his insides. It was relieving. to the say least. A satisfied sigh escapes the lad's maw after. "One. . "* - Fri Dec  4 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||
The effect of the first glass had been dehilitating, just a tad. Although, the effects of such were hardly notice-able.

"Wow? Nothing. . ? It's like you were drinking a glass of water," Marco replied with a tone of mystification. Regardless, he was still in perfect condition. Another cup is reached, and just as with the last, the mug is tipped forward. It pours the alcoholic beverages deep into his maw, moving beyond his throat and finally entering the body.

Just as with the last, a calming and warm touch comes over his body. It places each cell at ease, and prompts another sigh of satisifcation. . "I should be able to win, with my bigger frame. . "* - Fri Dec  4 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) met her gaze.

It was primal, not much different from a Lion staring down a gazelle. Oddly, the stare lit a fire within Marco's belly. He wore a smirk -- a very rare facial expression for the habitually stoic, craftman. "We'll see. . . I can already feel the effects of the alcohol moving through my pours.  I might actually feel even better than I did at the beginning," the gent replies, hopefully removing any signs that he was struggling.

A third mug -- which was seated by the edge of the table -- is eagerly and confidently grasped. Like a college student, the liquid is slurped up in record time. Despite the quickness, the drinking is still done in a dignified, polite manner. * - Fri Dec  4 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) rose a brow at how easily Mitsunara had been taken her liquor.

"Wow. . I didn't take you seriously before when you claimed to be a heavy drinker," Marco admits. 

Still, he relented to not lose, given that he was a bigger person. . and thus should be able to handle drinks better, no? By then, the fourth of many flasks were taken within his giant claws. Upon tightening a grip, the raven-haired blacksmith took one giant gulp.

He had practically inhaled the drink in one go-- And by then, the effects of the constant drinks were settling in.

His eyes lulled partially, gaining a 'sleepy' like expression. He was tipsy at best.* - Fri Dec  4 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: 9HEHER - Fri Dec  4 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods.

"I'd pay for it regardless," the smith replies, given his well off positioning in the village. 

He takes yet another cup, and drinks it with ease-- and this time, the effects are notable. He exhales, feeling ab it under the weather. "Oi. . "* - Fri Dec  4 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) was determined -not- to lose.

It would have been pitiful. A man of his stature losing to someone as skinny and feminine as Mitsunara? With a sense of purpose, the male moved ahead, grabbing another clear-tinted glass. Once a firm grip is established, Marco chugs away.

He seemed to have been capable of resisting the after effects well this time -- but was still a tadbit tipsy. Although, this was moreso progressing into full on drunkness.* - Fri Dec  4 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods.

It -was- a pleasing endeavor, even if Marco was on the losing end thus far. One more drink is taken, numero seven! And this time, it hits heavily, as if drenching his very sole. A grunt emanates through the bar, one that suggests pleasure, and of course fatigue. 

Clearly, Marco could hold much more.

Would he throw in the towel? No.* - Fri Dec  4 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) 's gaze trailed over Mitsunara's surprisingly ample busom, just as it's being set back to normal. He grunted, partially bitter, but also amused.

"How arrogant to think you could win just 'cause of your size, Marco," the blacksmith muttered to himself. He takes one final drink -- and the last one hits heavy. Knowing things were getting hectic, the adult figures it's best to call it quits.

"Okay. . You win." Although, the comment isn't as clear as you'd think, filled with unnecessary slurs.* - Fri Dec  4 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) grunts.

He was clearly a bit displeased, but smiled all the same. A hand reached into his pockets, and the promised yen is slide across the table. It was contained without about a dozen bills.

". . .You're. . . Pretty good at thish," Marco admits with a hearty chuckle -- which was again rare for him.* - Fri Dec  4 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: As have I. . Although, probably not as young as you. .  - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I really thought I had it won. - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah... - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, goes to show, eh? - Fri Dec  4 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Indeed. . .Was looking forward to the tease. Regardless, you and I should hang out more. I never got to examine that weapon of your's. - Fri Dec  4 05:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh... I suppose that's so. - Fri Dec  4 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Should probably do so sober, huh? - Fri Dec  4 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: 'Course. .  - Fri Dec  4 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) grunts, still cursing himself for losing.

"I don't. . Think I could take another. What would you want to do now?"He says with the usual slurs. Just not writing 'cause hard.* - Fri Dec  4 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) thought on it, before nodding.

Mitsunara spoke a lot of sense. He calls for  a waiter once more, who promptly cleans up the table. As the contents are cleared, new menus are given out.

"Order what you'd like. I'm a little full."

With that, Marco's order is simple. A single order of dried, meat loaf. He'd have ordered ramen, but that would probably upset his stomach. "And let's talk. ." the dark-skinned, craftman says gently. Why not have small talk over drinsk and a meal?

"Outside of reaching immortality and defeating this 'Lich King.' Do you have any other dreams or goals?"* - Fri Dec  4 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||

At the orders, the server quickly moved off to prepare the dishes.

He smiles in direct response to Mitsunara's, nodding soundly in agreement. "You and I have some in common in that regards. I don't care for fame. . .Although, I would like fortune."

A glance is given to the surroundings. "And coming to Sunagakure has aided in that endeavor. Although. . I still hunger for more. To have riches that rivals even the Gezo -- maybe even surpass, that'd be something to see. But. . .I suppose that means I'd need to accumulate fame and expand my horizon as a blacksmith of renown. . " The male continues, his tone deep and articulate. Each one is sounded out completely, and Marco spoke in deliberately slow tone.

Clearly, the man was in no hurry.

"Funny how far ahead I think. I haven't even thought of a cool name for my potential empire."* - Fri Dec  4 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) grinned hearily at the response.

"No. . I'm sure 'becoming a living god' isn't a lot to ask for. Although, perhaps it's within your ability, given your sword's strange nature. You know, I've been theorizing ways to mimic your sword with my own intellect. Could potentially even make something superior," Marco notes.

In the meanwhile, the food was already being cooked.

The water brewed heavily, and the scent rushed off into the skies. In time that the two were talking, all of preparations had been made. It isn't long before a squeaky wheel comes rolling in, no doubt being the wheels of a cart -- which carried both of the dishes.

Three plates are set onto the table. One for Marco, the other two for Mitsunara. "Anything else I can get you all?" the waiter asks.* - Fri Dec  4 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) 's grins widened.

"I can detect some doubt in your tone," he muses while grabbing for a fork and knife. The waiter is respectfully declined and sent on his way.

"Do you think what I've done so far is the extent of my ability? Blacksmith-ing goes much further than just refining hard to burn materials. . . " Marco says, bragging a tad due to his vast intellect. A piece of meat is cut into a decent chunk, and brought to his mouth to be devoured.

"The key would be in a special material known as Chakra Metal -- or even it's counterpart. I've used it in other weapons. "* - Fri Dec  4 06:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: For some reason? - Fri Dec  4 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I doubt you can replicate what I do with a simple weapon, yes. - Fri Dec  4 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: It's nto a normal technique, after all. - Fri Dec  4 06:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Hah. I'll have to prove you wrong -- not that it'll be easy. - Fri Dec  4 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: The reason I believe such is due to the connection between one's chakra and soul. - Fri Dec  4 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: If there is a metal that can absorb the nature of one's chakra, it isn't too far off to craft an alloy based off it. - Fri Dec  4 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods.

"And that's why I'd want to study your's, and as you wish.--" he says with a coy grin.

For a few moments, silence falls over the area, as he munches on more of the meat loaf. Right after, his gaze manuevers, falling back onto the swords woman.

"So. Outside of your mother and father, you have no siblings? No family?"* - Fri Dec  4 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Not that I know of. - Fri Dec  4 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Pity. I suppose that's fine, however. You've made many ties in this village. - Fri Dec  4 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) thinks: Well, save for Bryson. - Fri Dec  4 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh..I suppose that's true. - Fri Dec  4 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) continued to chow down.  The bulk of the meal had been consumed, leaving him a tadbit satisfied.

A hand tapped against the table as the awkward silence once again resumed, prompting Marco to speak up again. He peered closer, in clear debate, before just speaking.

"So. Are you seeing anyone?" The tone is as calmed and collected as always, and seemed to lack any fear. Having lived the last months alone, devoid of any real ties, save for his customary, the blacksmith aimed to move forward. Although, much of his true motives were still clouded.* - Fri Dec  4 06:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) laughed, although clearly not to ridicule.

"Chikyu? Adorable. But, I suppose by now, it's clear where I wasgetting I. You and I?" He says, gesturing between him and the Deathbringer.

"That is, if you don't mind me not being a warrior."

Marco wore a stoic face, but he was indeed insecure over the fact that he lacked any real combat potential. Lord knows he's tried to become a shinobi in the past.* - Fri Dec  4 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) tilts his head.

"Fair enough, I can respect that." He looks down, examining how far along Mitsunara had come along with her food.

"Anything you want to ask me? I've been doing all of the talking."* - Fri Dec  4 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) winces at the question.

Just thinking about that little bit of past brought him a bit of pain. 

"Well, I won't lie and say I never wanted to be a shinobi. I tried to become one in Kirigakure during my youth. But I proved unable to really build up a competent amount of chakra. Not to mention, my body was a bit weak. Eventually, I reached a certain age, and my parents decided I had to take on a trade. -- Not that I don't like my job."

He says with a shrug, then grunt.

"So I took up blacksmith-ing. It was then I discovered, the only limits to this art was my own imagination. I've grown to love it, given how creative I could get with enough resources. . . Still, it'd be cool to be able to use chakra someday."* - Fri Dec  4 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods.

"Given my predicament, I focused most of my life on it. Although, in the end, it may have been better if I had the joy of using chakra. Imagine, perhaps I'd have been able to save Kirigakure from previous destruction," the blacksmith laments with a sigh.

"But that's in the past, I suppose."* - Fri Dec  4 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Maybe. . Not many people could stand up to that beast.  I should stop thinking about it, just makes me depressed. - Fri Dec  4 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Good call.. - Fri Dec  4 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: We've been here for a while. Want to leave? - Fri Dec  4 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, probably... nice spending some time with yah. - Fri Dec  4 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Indeed. . .Really wish i had won. Where you headed? - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Probably the Arena? I dunno. - Fri Dec  4 07:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Seems about right. Always something going on there. I'll likely go the square. - Fri Dec  4 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Just for reference. . Were you really going to hold up your end of the bargin? - Fri Dec  4 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, 'course. - Fri Dec  4 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'm a crazy psychopath of my word, y'know. - Fri Dec  4 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Ah. Mmm, well would there have been any chance without a wager being around to butter you up? - Fri Dec  4 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) grinned. 

He found the woman's nonchalance amusing. "I see, could be a challenge then." There was no motion to stop her. Once she had gone, Marco pays the bill and moves to the square.* - Fri Dec  4 07:14:20 2015
