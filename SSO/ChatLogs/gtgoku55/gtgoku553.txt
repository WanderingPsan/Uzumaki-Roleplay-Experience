Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!

The wheels on the caravan goes round and round, round and round. . . The wheels on the caravan goes round and round, all through the desert!

After days of travel, the increasingly accomplished Blacksmith made his approach. One foot steps out of the vehicles, followed by the other. Once out, the male turns, giving a curt bow to the agency that had kindly offered servitude. It doesn't take long for the caravan to unhurriedly roll on out, of course after getting a nice tip.

He turns now, finally taking notice of the daunting forces that served as protection to Sunagakure. Thousands of men laid in wait along those wall, all armed and clearly ready to murder. The sheer mass spawned a shadow, a blockage of light that loomed over the dark-skinned craftman's form. 

The sight was unnerving, enough to make -most- people shake in their boots. But yet. . . Marco was different. He remained composed, almost as if each of the dangerous individuals were invisible, non-existent even! "I pity them. . ." mumbled the gent.

With dignified steps, he comes forward, giving a glance to the center most of the men. "Good evening. . . I can assume those leaving Kirigakure for Sunagakure is no actual surprise. I go by the name of Marco. Given the circumstances, I wish to establish operations here -- as an Armor Smith."* - Mon Nov  9 03:41:26 2015

Not that there was much to carry. . . Plus, he lacked ability in Fuuinjutsu.

Regardless, there was a decent tricket. He moves to his back, revealed a set of armguards. Although, they're made with weak material, iron. 

And just because he's black, doesn't mean he's been in Kumo. Marco is from Kirigakure.* - Mon Nov  9 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If so and you can agree to 'one' thing I will allow it and make it a sweetened deal for you. - Mon Nov  9 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Go no. - Mon Nov  9 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you make armors and later weapons for only the people of Sunagakure I will give you your own shop, I won't even charge you property tax. - Mon Nov  9 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) thinks: nice deal. - Mon Nov  9 04:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Mmm. That's a bit difficult. My dream is to go global. To have an empire that can rival the Gezo. - Mon Nov  9 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: What is the highest matieral you can work with? - Mon Nov  9 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And if you halve the price of your wares for only registered ninja in the village, i'll buy you matierials when you need them monthly. - Mon Nov  9 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I may be willing to do orders free of charge, however-- That I can do. - Mon Nov  9 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You see I want you here with us, we need an allied smith. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: There is no limit to the material I can work with. I've studied for years. I know how to work with anything. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: And if you can do me a favor. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Marrissa. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Mmm. If this can be the base of operations. I'm willing to be an allied blacksmith. In times of war, I will refrain from working with your enemies. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Yes sir. .  - Mon Nov  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: --And there is -best- armor. There is only armor that you describe. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Hmm... - Mon Nov  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: How about you double the price you charge other villages? - Mon Nov  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Hehehe, good way to get at them. - Mon Nov  9 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Seems do-able. It would either be me, another blacksmith, or them settling for the Gezo's overpriced weapons. - Mon Nov  9 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Yeah. - Mon Nov  9 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I want you here because this would be your ideal environment to grow. - Mon Nov  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: We export all types of ores and minerals. - Mon Nov  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: There are even misguided kids here who need you. - Mon Nov  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I can set him up in the smithy, and he can room with me in my home, untill one is made vacent for him. - Mon Nov  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you could teach the trade you would have underlings. - Mon Nov  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I already have a vacant spot. - Mon Nov  9 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: A new neighborhood was built last month. - Mon Nov  9 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Come in. - Mon Nov  9 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods.

He already felt welcomed.

He steps ahead, moving beyond the horde of shinobi and following behind the Kazekage.* - Mon Nov  9 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: This is a place you can use. - Mon Nov  9 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) gives a glance to the interior.

He looks around, tapping against the walls. "Ah. Good. The material will limit the risks of fires spawning."* - Mon Nov  9 04:10:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Can I ask a favor now, as I write this contract up? - Mon Nov  9 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sign here. - Mon Nov  9 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) takes a pen.

"Hrm?"* - Mon Nov  9 04:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Right on the line. - Mon Nov  9 04:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||After reading the fine print,Marco nods. A hand diligently jots downward, signing his name in cursive.* - Mon Nov  9 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you need anything send me a message or come to my office. - Mon Nov  9 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Come find me when you have a moment. I'd like to be your first costumer. - Mon Nov  9 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) whistled a low tune. He was new in town, and honestly seemed a bit eager. While Kirigakure had been representive of crushed dreams -- the actions simply personifying why Marco despised the shinobi word -- Sunagakure, on the otherhand, was seen as a ray of light. It was here in which he could build his weapons' empire!

. . . Even if he hadn't a clue what to name it.

In the craftman's travels, he stumbles upon a pecular area. Massive walls encase the entirety of the region, save for the north, where the entrance/exit reside. SHuffling his foot, the tall, dark-skinned male looked on over.

He says nothing for the moment, with both arms crossed and his back leaning against the wall. His gaze never flicks off, practically reading the movements as Mitsunara essentially battled with herself. Shadow Sparring even. "Impressive. You have. . . sufficiently unique manner of using your sword. It's not much like traditional shinobi techniques. . If it wasn't for the location, I'd assume you to hail from the Iron Temple."* - Mon Nov  9 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) kept a stoic expression, even as she smiled.

He carried himself in this same, dignified, reserved aura no matter where he went. It was the byproduct of living in this chaotic world. Of course, as an accomplished blacksmith, Marco easily examines the weapon, taking note of the difference.

It was no Katana.

Yet she wielded it masterfully all the same. "Ah? Well your skill is one to be proud of. What are you then. . ? A chunnin of Sunagakure. .  I'd assume."* - Mon Nov  9 11:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||Closer examination reveal more info.

He takes a step forward, his eyes running along the blade with a smirk. "The blade seems nifty. . Although the metal doesn't give off a powerful vibe, it's foreign all the same. Where did you get it?" Marco asks suddenly-- He pauses, recalling that Mitsunara had spoken before.

"And nonsense. Talent deserves praise. Even if you aren't the most powerful swordswoman, your talent still shines bright."* - Mon Nov  9 11:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||"Ah. Yes. . . Well I'd love to know that --"  He pauses, giving a gander down to Mitsunara's belly. 

It rumbled hard, enough that the vibrations broke out into the airwaves. 

After some thought, Marco eventually nods in agreement. What better way to kickstart his new life than to get to know the locals? "And you may continue to call my comments kind words, but I speak nothing but my opinions -- which is the truth. In anycase, let us go."

He motions for the lass to lead. Foreigners knew not where to get bites to eat.* - Mon Nov  9 11:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) perked a brow mysteriously.

He knew he wasn't a fool -- there was something afoot. Saying no word, Marco follows behind the woman up until they had reached the bar.* - Mon Nov  9 11:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) steps into the homely building. 

His eyes wonder, before he nods in approval. Still following behind Mitsunara, the male takes a seat on the adjacent chair, his elbow resting onto the tables. 

"A nifty name. . . " Marco comments. He'd need a name for his shop soon enough.

"Speaking of names. I'm Marco. " A hand extends.* - Mon Nov  9 11:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods. Their hands meet, shaking one another.

"Of course, of course. Dinner on me," He replies casually. A hand motions for the local staff to make way. And they do just that, diligently mind you. 

Menus are supplies, showcasing the surprising lengthy offering that the restaurant could provide. Simple foods, such as sandwiches, chicken wings and rice. To of course the favorites, Ramen -- in all varieties -- , Boiled Eggs. Desert is also clearly on the menu as well.

After handing one to Mitsunara, his grip relinquishes.

"Well. A lot of curiousity stems from the blade. But it would be rude not to get to know you first. . . Not that I hold no interest. Tell me. How long have you been in the business? How old are you?"* - Mon Nov  9 11:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) made his order too. It's plain and simple. A grilled, ham-filled sandwich. Herbal tea is added at the last second.

Once done, attention falls back onto Mitsunara. "I see, not long. Still, impressive for someone that is barely not a rookie," Marco notes. -- Then the question from Mitsunara is delivered.

He pauses, thinking carefully over his words. "Mmm. I am craftman. Although, my ability in the trade leaves much to be desired. So far, I've excelled in the creation of armors. Any armor you can imagine mostly would be within my ability to make. Well. . . within reason," He says casually, making references to real armors that had been crafted already.

"I've recently moved to Sunagakure to potentially get business. My shop isn't far from here.:* - Mon Nov  9 11:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) flicks his pupils up and down.

"You. . . Skin of iron?" To say he was skeptical would be an understatement. 

"You're skilled, yes. But also dainty," Marco points out. Mitsunara was kind of on the lithe side. "And yes, that would be within my ability. Although, I'd have to charge a decent amount depending on how sturdy."* - Mon Nov  9 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Mon Nov  9 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Interesting. We'll have to test that some time, I think- especially if you don't seem to believe me! - Mon Nov  9 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) gives a subtle, brief grin at the challenge.

Of course, he quickly shifts gears. By now, the waiter returns, settling all of the orders back onto the table. Both of the meals were steaming, letting the aroma hit their noses like a ton of bricks.

"Certainly. As for the sword. . . Why would I not be able to wield it? I'm interested in examining it sometimes. I'd be willing to pay even."* - Mon Nov  9 11:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) taps his fingers along the table. It audible reverberates.

"Mmm. . . I suppose that is a challenge. It would do well with my studies I suppose. Tell me more. . ? Your soul legitimately materializes?" Of course, Marco speaks with skepticism. It isn't every day that someone made as bold a claim as this.

"And by wield. . . only you may -touch- it?"* - Mon Nov  9 12:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||He pauses for a moment to let the girl speak.

The sandwich is brought onto hand. Gently, the male eats away, his mannerism as reserved as the demeanor that Marco typically wore. Not even a crumb found it's way falling out of place.

After ingesting, the blacksmith speaks up.

"Well then. I'd like to test that claim. Certainly, me simply trying to wield it and being unable would validate your words, yes?"* - Mon Nov  9 12:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nodded.

"Indeed. I'm anxious. But more questions. . "

After taking several bites, he brings the tea up, swallowing some of it's contents. "What inspired you to be a shinobi? I know that kids often pursue it due to the glamarous life that they presume will come. Often times, however, I've seen that the job is filled with tedious, grunt work. And heartarch," he quips.

Hazel eyes set onto the teen's feature in await of the response.* - Mon Nov  9 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||His brow perked.

"My. I didn't expect a woman of your stature to be some eager for battle. Nevertheless, your reasons are sensible. I suppose you're born and raised in Sunagakure?-- Nonsense, there would be no way such a nifty clan technique went unnoticed," Marco notes.

By then, more bites had been taken out, reducing his sandwich to a simple fraction of it's beginning size. Likewise, the herbal tea is nearly completed as well.* - Mon Nov  9 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nodded. He ate as she spoke, finishing the rest of his food.

There, Marco sat idly. "I see. Prejudice against women. . .You must leave far from these parts. Nevertheless, the ideology is flawed -- as you've clearly shown." 

One hand rests against the table, primed to aid in Marco's ascent should the two be ready to leave.* - Mon Nov  9 12:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) smirked.

Upon rising, Marco heads to the south. "As you wish." The trip is short given that they were near the local plaza. His feet drags along the sand, before eventually reaching yet another homely building. "And that's a tall task. But what's life without a little ambition, eh?"

This time? It's a bit more dim. The lights hardly can cover the area. The largest source of illumination seems to be from the backroom. It's where the blast furnance was placed. Although, it was turned on low.

Once within the room, Marco eagerly turns to the woman.  "Well then."* - Mon Nov  9 12:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) takes a step back,

Despite being familiar with Shinobi tactics or techniques, such as Fuuinjutsu, this seemed different. With each second, it was beginning to look more and more as if what Mitsunara claimed was true -- that she called it simply from her soul.

Eventually, the gaseous state settle, gaining a harden, solidified form. The purple tint of the metal gleaming wonderfully under the dim lights. As his hand reaches, flesh eventually makes contact. But the -second- that a grip had been established, the sword dematerialized. He looked on ahead. . . curious as to whether or not this was Mitsunara's game.

"So tell me. Was this voluntary? It's hard to tell if the blade legitimately repels me."* - Mon Nov  9 12:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. It wasn't voluntary, no. I had no strong feelings either way about letting you touch it- at least not consciously. - Mon Nov  9 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Is it really so hard to believe, Smithy? - Mon Nov  9 12:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Somewhat. . But I reckon in a world where Chakra Demons can materialize out of  thin air. . - Mon Nov  9 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Anything is possible. - Mon Nov  9 12:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) shook his head with a gentle smile.

"Nonsense. Although, it's a pity. I'd love to have tried to improve on the blade."* - Mon Nov  9 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Maybe even study it. - Mon Nov  9 12:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Well, you might be able to study it- but improve on it..? While such is possible, it is not through the arts of the smith, but through me advancing my mastery of it. - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: And studying it would involve an awful lot of me holding it steady for you to look closer. - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Heh. - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I'd assume damage to the blade would be detrimental as well, yes? - Mon Nov  9 12:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I'd like to avoid such, if nothing else. - Mon Nov  9 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'd rather not test any such theory, no? - Mon Nov  9 12:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: It's bond to be a potential issue. You and I should arrange days to study such. Perhaps I'd be able to learn -- and even improve your weapon. No matter how farfetched it may seem. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Perhaps. I am interested in seeing what you might learn from it, admitably. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Oh- and while we are here. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: I'd like to prove my claim. - Mon Nov  9 12:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: The other one. - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Hrm. . ? - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Care to give me a punch in the arm? - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I would never. <*He seems hesistant*> - Mon Nov  9 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Ohoho? - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Against striking a lady, is it? - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Indeed. - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Hold back if you like- but I must insist. Just on the arm, nowhere to worry about. - Mon Nov  9 12:55:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) scrunches his  lips together.

"I. . Cannot." He wasn't the violent type -- and wouldn't ever openly strike a woman.* - Mon Nov  9 12:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) gives a bow.

"Farewell. I greatly enjoyed our time out," Marco admits. As she leaves, he takes a seat and begins to tinker with objects.* - Mon Nov  9 12:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Evening. - Mon Nov  9 15:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I specialize in armor making. - Mon Nov  9 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: You do not make weapons? - Mon Nov  9 15:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Even special armor? - Mon Nov  9 15:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Special is a broad term. - Mon Nov  9 15:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: With capabilities that don't apply to normal such as reactive to chakra and more. - Mon Nov  9 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Possible, I'd suppose. - Mon Nov  9 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Hm, I do not have any money at all at the moment though . . . So I'll most likely pay a visit whenever I do. - Mon Nov  9 15:47:37 2015
