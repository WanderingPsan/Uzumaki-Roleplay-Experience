Once again, Marco found himself back at his shop, where the last of the items could be delivered.

By now, he had worked tirelessly on the gauntlets -- some being brass knuckles, others being more or less arm guards. Regardless, by now, it's clear that the craftman was ready to move onto different things. With that thought in mind, Marco quickly suited up, supplying his body with the protective gear needed to tackle on the tiring task of blacksmith-ing again.

Naturally, he heads into the dimly lit room, where the furnace existed. The lights were near non-existent, except for the only source of fire. As such, things were relatively warm, even by Sunagakure's heated example. Heaps of metals are tossed in, and like any good blacksmith would do, Marco began with crafting new metals -- as the natural, earthly material just couldn't cut it.

Two seperate heaps of alloys are formed. One being of simple, yet sturdy and light steel. . . The other being crafted from a specialized substance, meant to make the tool in question more chakra conductive. Beginning first, the mesh-up of material is placed onto the giant, modified anvil, where the real work could begin. Naturally, the main tool used for refining -- at least the initial stages -- was a hammer. Although, it wasn't uncommon for Marco to occasionally pause and use other items, like chisels, saws, and even smaller hammers.

Each interactiion inspires a metal clank, and occasionally sparks flew from the collisions -- but each motion serves a grand, overarching purpose. With enough luck, utilizing his vast knowledge in the blacksmith-ing process, and of course his experience, Marco is enabled to form four slabs of sharpened metal spikes. It's from here that he begins with less power, and focuses more on finesse. The two spikesm anage to be formed into serrated blades, one being giant and hollow, the other being smaller. Even then, both were of similar weight.

Thankfully, all that was left now was to work on chakra conductive metal. With this, Marco is tasked with chiseling off the heap into fifty seperate portions. The ease comes with flattening, as the sequence was based on just power hammering each ores into a flattened pancake. In no time, the deed is done, making portions of metal having only a thickness of a few centimeters -- maybe even millimeters. It was akin to a card in that regard, although far more heavy, and dense.

Having said that, using a cutting tool, the stacks are trimmed into rectangular shapes before the ends are trimmed and sharpened. With all of the items completed, Marco finally heads off.* - Wed Dec  2 22:34:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||
Fixing a giant sword.

No problem, especially for someone on Marco's level. He briskly moved along the sand, making good time to reach his shop. Once in place, he begins to place the edges of both ends to the tool in the furnance. The edges from each portion are heated, gaining a orangish tint.

In addition, after appraising both constructions, Marco is enabled to discover just what materials had spawned the metal. He quickly goes to form a metal alloy that was correspondant. 

Thus, more minerals are burned, and the two halves meant with additional heated metal being used as a bindage. For the next thirty minutes, Marco hammered away, gluing the two portions to one another, and of course ironing out the mis-shapened portions. After coolling off, Marco moves to return the item.* - Fri Dec  4 03:08:35 2015
