<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Mmm, I can makethings as simple as iron. . . Or I can go and craft alloys. The most common being steel. Naturally, they can get better. . . But the materials needed tend to cost a bunch.  - Tue Nov 17 17:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: I guess that part will be up to Lera...but of course I would want them as strong as I can get them. - Tue Nov 17 17:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Re-inforced steel is what I recommend. - Tue Nov 17 17:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Better ask her, I don't know how much that costs. - Tue Nov 17 17:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakano, Kiyoko(HypnoticEssence) says: Y-yeah... - Tue Nov 17 17:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||And the order comes down to Lord Hassan's. He had requested a particularly difficult item to craft -- but Marco had no intent on backing down. Quickly, the blacksmith headed on off towards the southern area of Sunagakure. It wasn't a long walk, given how compact or small Sunagakure happened to be.

Indeed, in about ten minute's time, the blacksmith was closing in on his smithery. It stood tall, easily eclipsing fifteen feet in height. The doors were currently locked, given that the shop was closed down for the night. With his keys, Marco presses against the door, unlocking and pushing them wide open. They'd slide apart with a creak, prompting the male to step right on through.

The place was eerily calm or quiet -- much like the scene you'd expect in a stereotypical haunted house. But in this case. . . there were no ghosts or spirits lingering. No, the closest thing to an otherworldly entity existed in the back room. It was the blast furnace, an object or tool that consistedly released scorching fire, the level of which was based on how the blacksmith was feeling. Of course, it constantly burns fuel to power it's inferno nature.

The entirety of the blacksmithing workshop is dimly lit as per usual. The point? It's merely so that Marco can better analyze his metals as they burn -- once the process had began that is. As a blacksmith, his job was half-way based on analytical ability. He'd have to capaboe of properly identifying when a particular material had reached a hot-enough temperature. And commonly, this was determined by examining the tint or glowing coloration that would  overcome a material.Usually, the desired color would be orange-red.

"All seems to be in place. . . No one was in here over the night. . " Marco murmured to himself as he traveled along. His eyes were scanning each significant area of the shop, ensuring that everything was okay and there were not thieving over his night's rest. "Alright, good. . . I should get into my gear then." 

Considering everything was okay, the craftman was swift to go into his personal quarters. It was this area in which all of his tools had been set, as well as protective gear. In a leisurely fashion, his coat. The cloth involved in this particular item was made to be especially flame retardant, and of course was resistant to heat. Logical in a profession meant to constantly work with burning fires, and hammering hot weapons, yes?

Ontop of this, he slips on his goggles, protecting his eyes from the hazardous lights and proving insurance against potential fire sparks. Then came the gloves, and after was an apron. Tying this all together, Marco eventually ties his hair up into a manageable style, and tucks it underneath his clothing to ensure that those raven-black, and luscious locks refrained from being an issue.

That said, Marco lingers around the shop for up to an hour, until more of his employees proceed to pour in. Their job for the day was simple, to ready his tools and manage the stock so that customers could come in and make purchases at their leisure. The other job they were given was to order the needed materials. With enough luck, a large portion of Sunagakure populous had already been sent out to the local mines.

"--Oh goodie. Benji, Gano. Do the usual, and go to count my inventory, and restock the display. Charlotte and Ina, I want you two to place orders. Send word that I need a large gathering of the toughest materials that the Wind Country can offer. Diamonds and other minerals -- even metallic -- will be needed. I'm going to craft a strange alloy made from minerals and metals," Marco barked out, speaking towards his assistants and/or interims.

They were all pretty young. The two males were at the most were eighteen year old. Both were close employees, blacksmithing apprentices even, that Marco was providing tutelage towards. The woman, on the otherhand, held no interest in such. They were merely there to design aesthetics, like clothing attached to weapons/armor. Likewise, Charlotte and Ina also acted as messengers. Both were younger teenagers, being around the age of sixteen respectively, though they could easily be confused for older.

At Marco's behest, the foursome moved to do their job. Meanwhile, he;'s sitting at the entry desk, his eyes glued to the table. Ontop was a scroll, and to the side seemed to be abottle of ink! Indeed, in the male's hand proved to be an ink brush, which had already soaked in the aforementioned liquid.

Carefully, his wrists stroked, developing an outline for his plan. He was quite the artist, his hands working magic and making the once blank sheet of paper filled with life and style. Unbeknowst to most people, Marco had a tendacy of staring Rias down -- who was the client in question that this armor was being crafted for. Her firm was a shape firmly ingrained into his mind, thus making it ab it easier for the drawing to be completed.

Naturally, the process is a gradual or slow one. He takes his time, making light sketches of the basic body phyqisue before beginning with another image to the right. The secondary illustration was for the armor's design. Marco was an intelligent man, and thus he held a great deal of strategy and foresight when it came to these types of things. Almost obsessively, he worked on the drawing, his mind thinking of all the cool gadgets or tricks that could be added to his heavy armor.
"Keep at it. . . It isn't often that a woman as curavecous as her seeks to wear diamond-esque armor. . . It's going to be hard to make this tool fitted for her usage. Regardless, it has to be done. The first step is planning, and once I have all of the plans done I can begin with putting the armor together in the real world. . " he chatted to himself to pass on time. This really was boring.	

For the next hour and a half, that's all Marco did. --Until suddenly, the  two girls sent off before come rushing in with a smile. "The job is done, boss! We should ben expecting your order in about three to five hours. Then you can work on that special heavy armor you want to craft, along with that light armor. Man, your customers always ask for some -really- hard things to make," both of the teens said energetically, theirs words being in unison.

It was a starting sight, but by now, Marco had gotten used to it. His hands was suffering from a cramp due to the endless process in which he wrote and drew up more plans for his endeavors. . .  Despite the tediousness, the gent never once wavered in his desire to complete the arduous task. After all, it was going to be these orders that brought in the money-- Resources much needed  to expand his empire. An empire he desperately desired to truly bring about the change in the world.

For a moment, Marco is lost in thought as he realized his fortunate. His mind drifted to the past, one in which a giant Chakra Demon ran rampant. . .destroying the village indiscrimantly. The cries of many screeched through the skies, but none stood out more than the anguished howls of his newborn. . His wife,  his family. As the memories flooded in, Marco merely stared ahead with a solemn expression. . . his mind in a daze.

"--Uh! Boss? Be alert! You can't go to sleep just now!" the blond-haired assistant, Ina, declared with a simper. She found the lost-gaze amusing, much to Marco's chargin. Nevertheless, the much older employer shook his head, shaking off any lingering daze or angst that snuggly rested inside his body. "O-Oh. . .Good work, the both of you. I didn't expect you air-headed divas to get it done so fast. Thanks, you may take the day off if you'd like."

They decline the offer and take a post back at the frotn desk. At the same time, both of Marco's apprentices move back to the front, after completing their busy work. The furnance had been cleaned, and the inventory had been thoroughly polished. He smiles, and continued working on the boring task as his mind raced, eagerly awaiting the order. 

Seconds progressed into minutes, and minutes soon evolved onto hours. In this time, the craftman had complete and utterly finished in the shematics at last. Every dimension or compartment of the heavy armor had thoroughly been defined. From the exterior apperance, to the detailed curves to make sure that it fitted onto the body it was designed for. What more, the designs also covered the needed material and other specific dimensions, such as the thickness and so forth.

And by then, the material had finally been delivered, much to Marco's delight. It was going to be an interesting project, sure enough. It wasn't often that he had such durable, and hard to refine materials to work with. This was going to a task that certainly stretched the blacksmith's ability to the breaking point. . . and he loved every second of it. 

Being a non-shinobi, the gent gained excitement from tackling higher degrees of equipment to create, and making better conceptual items. He moves, taking the massive cart of materials that hadj ust been delivered to the backroom. The apprenticesf ollowly shortly after, as they knew this was going to be a grand learning experience. One that they'd probably have a hard time duplicating -- but it was good to view at the very least.

Quickly, he'd begin with the usual processes of blacksmith. The first being. . . the heating of his material. Due to already being in the protective gear, Marco jumps righti nto the fray, layering a platter into the blast furnance, and tossing heaps of material inward. Some were diamonds minerals, while others seemed to be basic ores that could commonyl be found in the upper levels of the Earth's mantle.

Naturally, Marco watched with folded arms, the fire roared. His hand pressed against a latch or button, turning up the natural intensity of the flames. Like a storming, raging lion, the inferno rushed ahead, scorching the lifeless items that were ruthlessly served on a platter. The heat transfers from the flaming energy, and assaults the materials. As the temperature rises, so too do the activity in the atoms.

The crude ores gain the usual coloring, and the earth that surrounded their form is slowly being stripped away. It gains a magma-like consistency, that slithers down and is placed towards a storage compartment in said furnance. He continued to observe, waiting for just the right tint or color to be obtained. ANd once the metals had gain suched? Marco moves them out.

The diamond, on the other hand, was a much trickier task to tackle. It was mainly because the mineral didn't react as you'd expect the metals to. Instead, of gaining that stereotypical glow, it just became liquidy. In addition to this, diamonds tended to have much higherr melting points than normal, and thus took a lenthy period of time to get ready. 

It was hard doing this, as Marco had to maintain the temperature of other materials all the same. But given enough time, all had been prepared or 'baked' properly, allowing for the continued process of his smithing. The assortment of sturdy, yet light material are conjoined into one giant conglomerate. In addition to the fusion, carbon and other gases are thrown into the mix, inducing the needed transformation to make a large lump of precious material.

That;s right, years of careful studying and practice had enabled the lad to be capable of making extraordinarily new material. it was something unlike anything the world has ever seen! Engineering on par with the fine craftmen that only the Gezo, the WORLD EMPIRE, could duplicate or mimic. As that was completed, Marco goes to take a moment's rest. His mind was suffering from fatigue due to the heavy multi-tasking.

It took a lot out of him, as the process was mainly him ensuring that nothing was over-heated. This took a lot of micromanagement, and repetition. That said, he goes to place the large heap  into the cooling room. It's a place with flowing and cold water, that coolds the item on the touch. Steam roamed about in response as the water vapor is produced from the two oppsoing temperatures. 

Nevertheless, as that was settled, Marco goes to take ab reak to give the item ample time to cool so that he may work on it later. He falls back to the front, andh is apprentices follow after, their minds filled with awe. Their mouths were even open agape, so wide that you'd assume it'd fall right onto the floor like a regular cartoon. "Phew. . . That was tough. .  . I felt like I was running around with the King of Hell. . . "

The two lackeys chuckled, finding Marco's sweatied and fatigued mannerisms to be humorous. Along the way, all three chatted, as the master gave much needed advice. His words were eloquent and described the processes with perfection. The topics discussed was moreso in the processes needed to create needed alloys -- which Steel was a byproduct of. After all, the natural materials found in nature could only get so strong and would need a keen eye and intelligent blacksmith to improve upon.

Once at the desk, he orders one of the assistants to get him a cool-ing drink. Eventually, a 'Purple Drank' is brought along, prompting the thirsted man to gulp it down like a regular bottle of water. It's a repeated process that happens on three different occasions, up until his thirst and appetite had been quenched or satisfied. 

As usual, he lingers around for a moment or two, before enough time had gone by for him to be considered rested. Eagerly, the artsy male ventures back to the work room, with the two apprentices in tow. It was time for additional work to be provided, and Marck simply was not going to rest until the entirety of the armor had been completed. 

Starting off, the heap of ore or material that had been formed in the previous hour or two of work is brought back to the forefront. It's placed right into the frying pan, and heated to an adequate level. As with before, this is al engthy process, given just how high of a melting poitn the conglomerate possessed. But sure enough, all succumbs to the might of the mean furnance. 

As it gains heat, the malleability naturally takes an incline. Using tongs, Marco is quick to move the hot item onto another platform -- a saw-like tool. It's utilized to cut the source into much smaller and manage-able pierces. THis is desireable, since it allows Marco to work with smaller portions and to refine them into the proper shaping.

Several of the usual techniques are applied once a good dozen or so pieces are cut apart. The bulk seemed to be a process of 'upsetting'. This was basically Marco slamming his hammer towards one end of raw material  to lessen it';s density, while also strethcing the material out further. This was imperatively, since by now the bulk of the item seemed to be one giant lump. 

Pang! Pang! Pang!

The hammer relentless slammed up and down. The hits are thunderous, and seem to routinely force sparks to fly from the collision.  Nevertheless, each hit holds a purpose and nicely flattens out the raw alloy -- which hadn't been named-- into a usable fashion. Marco repetitively does this over and over, each time on a different section. Naturally, he has to constantly use tongs and pliers to re-heat the working material.

In the end, several parts are constructed. Or well. . .  the general shaping of the parts. Chest Plate, Head Set, Arms, Shin Guard, Kneepads, and other portions are expertly crafted to ensure that Ria's body would firmly be protected from all forms of damage.  

For the next hour, Marco runs each of the items along his anvil. The edges of said anvil serve as the solid force that dictates that the hammering bends or shapens the raw material in a particular way. Mind you, the slamming was far from mindless. Each one had precise power added to the blows, ensuring that the material would never once be bent or shapen in a misformed manner.

Naturally, due to his high level of experiences, Marco never makes an error. In about an hour, he's completed all of the several portions, and opts to keep them seperates. THe only thing left to be done was form latches that would bring each of the parts together and bind them so that Rias could actually wear and remove at her leisure.

Once done, all are cooled together and placed into storage. He'd have to do some slight finishing touches later, revolving around the aesthetics. This was going to require Rias however. 

After spending all of that time, Marco graciously makes his exit.* - Tue Nov 17 18:45:58 2015

In his hand was a type of ruler-tape. It'd be his primary tool for measurement -- and he'd have to be thorough. It was still hard for Marco -not- to gawk, and as expected, the man succumbed to his natural desires.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ventured back to the usual shop as per usual. The shiny armor isstill on display, and seems to have been on display. Once more, Marco saunters to his work area, pulling out several strands of ruler-tape, along with an assortment of other tools.

"Right. Are you prepared?"* - Wed Nov 18 01:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods. He looks the woman up and down, and opts to first begin with height.

The bud of the ruler is set onto the floor. "Step onto the bottom, please." Assuming she had complied, the blacksmith would extend the tool upward, up until her forehead had been reached. Once done, the height is taken and marked down.* - Wed Nov 18 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods. That's jotted down.

Secondly, he kneels and pats Rias against the thigh, gesturing for her to part her legs. Assuming compliance, the tape would go, wrapping about that particular appendage, gaining a decent m easurement.

Marco worked his way on up, soon taking a hip and waist measurement as well, each time jotting the quantities into his notepad. "Not bad. Glad I made the armor the size of an average woman. . " Of course, he wasn't done quite yet. The blacksmith seemed genuinely surprised that he hadn't been making Rias uncomfortable.

Of course, if the woman wasn't paying attentino, his instincts woudl have kicked in, prompting him to gawk at her curved form. * - Wed Nov 18 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nodded along.

"Easily fixed, it's why I'm getting measurements," Marco retorted with a leisure tone. He moves upward, soon taking measurements of the shoulders, and at last, the bust. 

He pulled a bit tightly on the last, before finally relinquishing. 

"Good. I'll have to make some readjustments, however. . Due to the new information."

* - Wed Nov 18 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) nods along.

"That should be fine. I'll have the armor finished in a bit. One more thin--" then the door opens up. He looks to Toudou.

"Yes?"* - Wed Nov 18 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shishigami, Toudou(RhapsodyManiac) says: Yo. - Wed Nov 18 03:12:51 2015
