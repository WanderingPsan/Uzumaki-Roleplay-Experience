<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||Without further ado, Marco got to work  He had two simple orders to complete. One being a modifcation of a simple Shuriken. . . the other being arm guards in the guise of gloves.

The former was actually paid for, prompting Marco to place that mentioned order to the forefront. 

Fortunately, the required minerals were soemthing Marco already held a very high quantity of. It was two basic ores, iron and copper, primarily needed to craft the powerful alloy of Steel. Although, the process was far longer and more tedious than you could anticipate. After the lengthy period of time, theblacksmith had produced a wide enough quantity.

The newly crafted mixture is soon taken out via pliers and attached onto the anvil. His hammer is taken into hand and repeatily goes to smash onto the heated surface. Relentlessly, the burning object is bent to the desired shape, as Marco strategically places it along the anvil. Eventually, two different strips had been targeted and flattened to a desired shake. It had the slight curve, making it comfortable for a forearm. 

As he held slight knowledge on human physique, the design is pretty spot-on, stretching even to where Mizora's shoulder would be. Then came the aesthetics. Cloth is taken and cut up, only to be sewn elegantly into a beautiful glove. The two parts are conjoined, successfully making steel gloves meant to protect her body, while also looking fashionable.* - Tue Nov 17 04:22:24 2015
