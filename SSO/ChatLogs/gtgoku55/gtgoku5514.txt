<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||Even in the village's destruction, Marco could never cease in his work. The hectic ransacking in part by Edge only served to be a motivator to the blacksmith, whom was notoriously critical of the shinobi system. Well. . . Not notoriously, but he was a skeptic!

The craftman moved onward to his shop that had surprisingly survived the strikes.

Still rich in material, the furnance is quickly turned up, and materialss tossed in. They were the usual ores, mainly being of iron and other inexpensive items. Using his expertise, Marco doesn't take long to apply some carbon, forcing the blast furance to act as a giant oven -- melding together all of the different ingredients to make something new. 

An alloy.

It was what all the true metal manufacturers did. The natural metals of the world simply were inadequate in most cases, unless they happened to be exceptionally rare or precious. The one crafted on this day proved to be steel, an exceptionally potent metal for weapon/armor smithing.  

With dimmed lights, his pupils focus in on the metals at work as the heat scorched or attacked their defenseless frame. The usual glow is spawned, and once the color spectrum had reached orange, heats of hot metal is removed with a pair of tongs. Given the high-spirited nature of the atoms in this state, the tongs practically squish the heavily malleable metal on impact.

As they're slammed against the anvil, sparks fly, and with that, Marco was getting to work. It was weird, why did people so seldomly seek to buy armor nowadays? Ever since adding custom weaponry to the menu, that's all anyone has ever cared for.

Regardless, Marco is hard at work, taking ahold of a massive hammer, crafted from the most heat-resistant material. Without relent, the tool is lifted and slammed forward, going a long way to ironning out of the lumps in this particular gathering. As the force is applied, the steel is inevitably being flattened, while also pushed outward. This was a basic blacksmith technique that any craftman should work to refine if they ever wanted to dabble into the art.

Once two since strips had been developed, Marco moves along, finally working on the shape. Given his skill, doingso wasn't something that was too mentally stressing. Each hit along the edge of the anvil forces the heated metal strip to bend to the male's will. Every so often, time is taken off to work on re-heating the steel alloy.

In no time, an arc is forced along the edges, and the general shaping of the scythe is performed. He ensures that the edges are smooth and even, and capable of being sharpened so that the Kurisagama could legitimately be completed. Binding the two parts would chains and a pole, completing the Kurasigama.

In no time, Marco was continuing with his tedious tasks, this time finally working on the assortment of gauntlets and brass knuckles that seemed to be so popular among tai-specialists. He had taken their measurements much sooner than this expedition and crafted a mold. This same shaping mold was used to form a general shaping, and as that was completed, the blacksmith went around adding density and refining the specifics. Last but not least came asthetics and cooling.* - Fri Nov 27 01:11:15 2015

It was pretty simple. Once at the shop, a basic Kunai is taken, and heated. Using a chisel, designs are added along, and the edges cut. Cue a long winded period of hammering and adding a serrated edge to the Kunai blade. 

In no time, Marco returns, charging a low price.
