<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||Finally, Marco arrives to his work place to begin with the arduous task of constructing two fairly durable sets of armor. One, unfortunately, was going to be detrimental to overall movement speed. The other, however, probably would hold nothing but advantages. 

Figuring that weaker set of armor would probably be the best to begin with. Before he can begin, the budding blacksmith is forced to make a few calls or orders, easily gaining an assortment of rich materials. Iron, Copper, Diamonds -- and the list went on. All had been gathered, and neatly set along in carts towards the right of Marco's stock. 

Greedily, the male makes his approach, his mouth nearly salivating at how swiftly his own fortunate had changed. Just days prior, the dark-skinned behemoth was just a poor soul trying to find his way in Kirigakure. A man with ambition, but a lack of direction or a guiding hand to his goals. Swelling with motivation, the process was beginning immediately. As any good smith would do, the long-haired craftman first suitded in protective gear. His body was adorn with a white, insulating coat, meant to protect his flesh from heat, or droplets of sparks that may linger.

In addition, gloves meant to migitate burns also are worn. Finally, on came the goggles, thus protecting his eyes from any harm while also granting perfect view. Given that his body was now fully prepared, he'd begin with placing copper and nickle ore onto a platter. The container is slide forward, on into the currently tamed Blast Furnance. Casually, Marco was just an onlooker, his eyes observing for any miscues or potential issues. The room was as dim as could be, with the only light source being from the aforementioned furnace. It was this factor of the area that made his vision incapable of making silly errors. After all, the art of smithing was one based on precision and attention to detail, he had to be mindful of the colors spawned by the heat.

With a single dial turned, the fire proceeds to spark up, roaring like a famished Lion. Accompanying the roar came an increase in activity, which certainy packs an incline in heat. The waves of energy pilfered through the area, almost forcing the normally stoic gent back in recoil. Regardless, he perservered, his eyes un-blinking as the impurities of the ore were essentially melted away. The rocky composition was essentially being 'sweated' out, and once that had been out of the way, Marco is more capable of observing the objective of the goal. 

The precious metals still being baked.

Seconds leapt into minutes, and as time wore on, the items gained a distinctive, glowing coloration. It was like an aura, one produced due to the atoms being overcharged with infernos. Observant, the male doesn't yet make a move, at least not until the tint had shifted to the 'orange'-level of the massive color spectrum. With a pair of tongs, every ounce of material is shifted and placed onto a massive anvil, ready to finally be forged. Stacked ontop of on another, Marco -- now with a hammer in hand -- proceeds with the tiring process of hammering.

PANG! PANG! PANG!

Each hit is hard, and loud. The collisions are more than enough to produce a clear echo that haunted the blacksmith's shop. Those that lingered in the front, or even just outside the room wouldn't be crazy to get the impression that a fierce battle between two powerful men had been occuring. As the hits go on, it becomes distinctively clear that he isn't in anyway seeking to bend or shape. Rather, he's forcibly prompting the different materials to meld into one, thus spawning a Steel Alloy. Naturally, the heated and now more malleable items are being flattened ontop of one another like pancakes.

On occasions, he even goes through the sequence of re-heated to ensure that the bondage went on unopposed. Given abouit half an hour of relentless work, the tirelessly craftmen is enabled to finish the procedure, thus being fitted with a series of alloy to work with in the future.

Having already taken Yan's measurements, the true work could now begin. At once, With the massless heaps of metal still fuming with heat, Marco begins to hammer away as per usual. Yet this time. . . There seems to be a level of precision or strategy not available in the previous expedition. Indeed, the hits, no matter how they looked, were far from mindless. Expertly, the male manuevered the 'slab of metal' around, ensuring that certain parts had reached the edge, while others didn't. Thus, once the force of the hamme,r had come, the object would be forced to bend or shift in particular directions.

In no time, you could see that this particularly aspect of the armor was gaining curves -- correspondent with the angles of a body. Clearly, it was for the upper portion of the torso, the arms even. Tirelessly, Marco worked, breaking each part of the armor into manageable pieces, so that in the end, he could simmply smelt it all together to be one significant suit. Using his forethought, latches and openings are inserted, ensuring that Yan could easily get dressed in a moment's notice. Last but not least? Came the SUnagkaure signal carved on the back.


Having completed that terrible sequence, Marco drags the item to the cooling area of the room. Cold water runs along, forcing steam to rush. As that goes into effect, he scuttles back to the main room, sweat covering or hugging his form. Last, but not least, came Tetsumi's own request. Unlike Yan, it seemed the young lass had no intent on actually remaining nimble or swift in combat. Instead, he wanted to sacrifice mobility for durability.

In no time, the male began. Due to the alloys already being in place, he's more easily able to produce the items. On this occasion, after heating the materials, Marco made a different approach. Rather than striking along the middle, he workedo n the edges, each time forcing the matter to scrunch up towards an epic centre due to the momentum. The point? To add much needed density and thus make his constructions more durable or capable of enduring damage.

Of course, this wasn't without consequence, as such required a heap of effort and consumed more material than normal. Nevertheless, he's capable of doing so in less than an hour. The armor on this case was designed to cover much more of the body, further restricting mobility. At least it ensures that there would be very little weak or exposed points, yes?* - Wed Nov 11 04:21:32 2015

"Best of luck in your recovery, ladies," He notes. Quickly, the smith turns back and proceeds on to his shop. The situation here was covered for.* - Wed Nov 11 06:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Marco(Gtgoku55) ||Back to the old grind. Every so often, it seemed there were additional orders to be had. Once again, it happened to be a bit of light armor. This time for a man under the age of ten -- well a kid. 

He was of small stature, and thus probably would be relatively inexpensive to provide a set of light armor for. As the furnance turns up, and Marco is suited into the protective gear, the blacksmith eagerly gets onto work. This time, the ores provided are of a different material. Ones with slightly higher durability to weight ratio, thus making it useful for armor.

Casually, as the heat forces the material to reach it's melting point that's when Marco is hammering away. He's like a God of Asgard, tirelessly slamming away, each time forcing sparks of flames or electricity to erupt. All the same, the stress or work serves a single purpose, and that was to shapen the thin metals. As that's done, the red-hot material is set into the cooling room, allowing cold water to fall over it's frame.

The energy transfers and as that's completed, off Marco goes. To deliver and get his cash flow up.* - Wed Nov 11 07:19:02 2015
