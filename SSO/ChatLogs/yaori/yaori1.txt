<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shin(Yaori) nods.* - Sat Dec 12 16:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: My name is Shin. - Sat Dec 12 16:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: You have twenty questions. - Sat Dec 12 16:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: Each question you get wrong merits an injury. - Sat Dec 12 16:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: First question. - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: Name the founder of the Gezo Empire.  - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Ouch... - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Gezo? - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: No. - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ......Damn. - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Brace yourself. - Sat Dec 12 16:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shin(Yaori) watches her arm move, surprised at the level of gracefulness that was taken for his punishment. He prepared himself for some kind of projectile, but would neglect to see one as a sudden pain echoed throughout his body. 

He'd wince  as he felt as though something inside of his lower leg was ripped. He fell to his knee immediately. Shin was definitely in pain, but he could fix that later, hopefully. He reached to grab the wound, but there was none. Curious . . . how was it possibleto injure someone without any contact or entry wound. He would examine the surroundings, he was a bit nervous, but not frightened.* - Sat Dec 12 16:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: Sooo! - Sat Dec 12 16:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: Second question. - Sat Dec 12 16:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: ..Jesus. - Sat Dec 12 16:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: What do you call the high ranking official of Tenryuujoutei? - Sat Dec 12 16:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Shin, back out. You're not ready. - Sat Dec 12 16:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: No way, I'd rather die. - Sat Dec 12 16:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Commandant? - Sat Dec 12 16:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Damn. You're dead then. - Sat Dec 12 16:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ... - Sat Dec 12 16:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Bloodline Killer X) says: ... - Sat Dec 12 16:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: The answer is Pope. - Sat Dec 12 16:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Interesting - Sat Dec 12 16:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: ..... - Sat Dec 12 16:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shin(Yaori) would stare at Chen, awaiting her next movement. This time she seemed to poke the air. It was an odd motion,,  not one he'd expected, but nonetheless, it was followed immediately by a bodily reaction. He felt something tweak just behind his face. Not an excrutiating pain, but more like a severe pinch. Shin blinks for one moment. Weird. 

As soon as Shin blinks he vision fades and his body feels off balance, as though he was misinterpretting what was in front of him. It made him dizzy for a moment. He also felt sick, perhaps it was from his vision being altered. Perhaps it was fear, though it was exciting. An excitement he hadn't felt in a long time. 

Shin smirked as his eye virtually faded. His crimson iris dulled to a dark red. Shin looked at Chen with a singular eye. "Fitting." Shin chuckled lightly to himself, considering what he had gone through to make his eyes stronger. He stood up, though not completely. He could barely stand on his left leg. His right leg was the only one that could support any weight. No left eye, no left leg, it would probably be a sight to see, only half of which would be visible to him.

"Not bad, interesting techniques. It's kinda emberassing to be seen like this though." he straightly. He rubbed under his nose a bit. "Next question then?"* - Sat Dec 12 16:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: Third question. - Sat Dec 12 16:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: What would you refer to the high ranking official of Huevo Del Diablo as? - Sat Dec 12 16:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shin(Yaori) bites his lip a bit.* - Sat Dec 12 16:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I have no idea. - Sat Dec 12 16:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: I see. - Sat Dec 12 16:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: It is unfortunate. - Sat Dec 12 16:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shin(Yaori) shakes his head and chuckles.* - Sat Dec 12 16:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shin(Yaori) would observe, shaking his head. He had worked hard in his life for a long time, it was a shame it had to end like this, but they all have to die some day. Shin shakes his head again as Chen thrusts her hadn forrward. Blue chakra extends out in the shape of a claw. Shin observes silently. Even now he'd rather die studying than live a foolish coward.

He felt no pain as it entered his body. It was ethereal, as chakra was, he didn't expect to feel it too much. Shin nods to himself again. A fitting end that he was proud of. He felt it grab at his heart. IT was the type of pain you felt when you ate too much acidic food and you had severe chest pains. HE didn't cry though, he coughed a bit instead, but he was too proud to die dramatically. 

He looked at the hand and shook his head. Next he felt nothing. No pain in his ankles and no discomfort in his tomach. He didn't feel dizzy or dazed, he just felt right. He felt the room get igger and bigger as his body dropped to the ground, though he couldn't feel it. He laughed a bit, but could not tell he was doing so. 

So this was Gezo, Shin's hunger and urge was sated. He nodded internally. Looks like he was right, maybe he shoulda been more careful. It doesn't matter now, Shin could finally rest.* - Sat Dec 12 16:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Are we next? - Sat Dec 12 17:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: Indeed. - Sat Dec 12 17:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chen(ZenoKuthric) says: You three will be next. - Sat Dec 12 17:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yaori(Yaori) says: . - Sat Dec 12 21:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Yaori(Yaori) awoke. He was tired. Most of the leaf was destroyed recently and that was not a stress Yaori enjoyed having on his mind. He was way to o young for that. He sighed as he made his way to the forest in order to get an early start on the training he needed. 

Yaori was a nototiously hard worker. Everything he did he put every bit of effort possible into. He knew that if he were to slack off, others would likely catch up to him and that was not something Yaori ever hoped to be one of the best. He walked quicker and quicker until he caught himself in a bit of a sprint. Everyday was exciting to him and it was time for him to reveal himself as a shinobi today.

Yaori entered the training field and looked around. He waited for a moment, remembering the realization he had not but a day ago. One that revealed him as a true one of his clan. He boasted a very powerful technique that only hiis blood was able to activate, one that was legendary and ancient. 

Yaori closed his eyes. He focused his chakra up to his eyes, preparing to train every bit of what he had at this moment. Yaori's eyes shot open, revealing his violet iris. It shifted and corted into something new, something magnificent. His eyes rdarted into a light red that became vermillion slowly. It was instantly taken over by a single rung and a tomoe was revealed in the corner of that rung. 

Yaori smirked as he began to perform handseals. Slowly, but surely Yaori would begin ding handseals for his technique. This was water release. He performed the handseals slowly, he was still learning about handseals and such. He finished them rather curiously, with his tongue sticking out slightly. 

When he finished his chakra burst forth and manifested in the form of a large wave of rushing water. It leapt from his gullet and rushed down the training field. It was more like a stream than a waterfall, but in time, Yaori may get strong enough to use it formidably. He felt a natural affinity with water, but he knew that was not his limit. 

Yaori's eyes wore him down a bit, using them was tasking for one his age. YAori looked to master these eyes even at his young age. He feared no man, no fight, and no amount of labor, but he did fear falling behind. The more things he could practice at once, the easier time he'd have learning everything there was to learn before everyone else. 

The stream slowly came to an end as Yaori panted a bit. He scanned the area with his eyes. He locked onto a nearby tree then jumped from one spot to another. Even with his advanced sight, Yaori was on an entirely new level with his eyes. One day Yaori might even become stronger than he already was.* - Sat Dec 12 22:06:27 2015
