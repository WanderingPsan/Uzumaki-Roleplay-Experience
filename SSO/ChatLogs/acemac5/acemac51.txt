<br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Oh, nope - Mon Nov  2 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see. - Mon Nov  2 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) notes the presence of the man he had passed earlier outside of the academy. It was a strange thing, this village. Kuro skirted the masses assembled here, staying largely out of sight. He took up position a bit further from them, but as his curiousity prevailed he kept a keen ear turned towards conversation* - Mon Nov  2 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, well, I just got back from a long walk home..Uh, I mostly just train...*cough* I try to stay busy with my ninja duties.  - Mon Nov  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: It doesn't leave much room for hanging out and leisure time. - Mon Nov  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I could train with you and maybe critique you, if you'd like. Otherwise Trilliam is someone you'd probably liket o go hang out with. He's a fun guy. - Mon Nov  2 22:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, you could train me if you'd like, but I'd rather have a friend to hang out with too. - Mon Nov  2 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) thinks: Such a gathering. They look strong.. I wonder how smart they are! - Mon Nov  2 22:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey Nina, how are you doing today! - Mon Nov  2 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There ya go. She seems pretty fun. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm doing good. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And you're not getting out of this Yan, don't even try it. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Eh, like I said, come on if you want. - Mon Nov  2 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: In fact, I wouldn't mind both of you sparring me. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Its quite rude to try and use training, as an excuse to break a conversation! - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I'm not that strong but I can try to hold up against two ninja. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: How about three? - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: You should've told them your training schedule was coming up soon! - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Three? - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ......Come on. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) looks to the man over the small distance, his demeanor a bit shy. The kid looked very slight, almost no meat on his bones at all* - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Ohh FOur do four. - Mon Nov  2 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..Trilliam, you can watch. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I don't think I can even handle three. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Nina is who I invited. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: So come on Ninja. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe Trilliam will spar you two. - Mon Nov  2 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He's a strong genin. - Mon Nov  2 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) crouches low on his haunches, trying to make himself seem small. He looked embarrassed* - Mon Nov  2 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No, it's fine. Let them two go. - Mon Nov  2 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...Come on! - Mon Nov  2 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) watches the pair with interest, though never having the courage to speak himself. He timidly looks from them back to the dirt, having eyes mostly for Chikyu. * - Mon Nov  2 22:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Sensei. - Mon Nov  2 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Can you check something for me? - Mon Nov  2 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: A weapon. - Mon Nov  2 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: I need ya to check something. - Mon Nov  2 22:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Cheap good quality weapons don't exist so check if the blacksmith plant a bomb on it or something. - Mon Nov  2 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) slides away from the group, rising swiftly and turning on his heels. He had lost interest in those gathered, figuring he could learn something elsewhere* - Mon Nov  2 22:44:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) enters the arena area, knowing little better. He awaits near the far wall, watching the pair with interest. * - Tue Nov  3 14:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) watches the man poof around, making himself seem a little smaller. He looked intimidating, and Kuro was not known for his outgoing nature. Still, he watched and remained observant* - Tue Nov  3 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: <*Stares*> - Tue Nov  3 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) immediately looks uncomfortable, trying to look away. He would switch from staring at the ground, then checking to see you you're still looking, then to the ground.* - Tue Nov  3 15:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: <*Genandis back at him*> - Tue Nov  3 15:50:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yo. - Tue Nov  3 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Why you looking all. . . Serious? - Tue Nov  3 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Uh, I.. Ehm, Me? You mean me? - Tue Nov  3 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Indeed. - Tue Nov  3 15:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: I don't know a- Well, I just graduated.. it's all very intimidating.. - Tue Nov  3 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: How old are ya? And being a shinobi isn't that scary. - Tue Nov  3 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: I'm uhm. Fourteen sir. - Tue Nov  3 15:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) thinks: I wonder what he'd look like if I split him up..Like a cat or a dog on the inside? - Tue Nov  3 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Is there.. uh, a medical shinobi in the village? I'm fascinated by.. uhm.. medical things you see - Tue Nov  3 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: A lot. - Tue Nov  3 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Head medic is that white-haired chick named Zenaki. I wouldn't bug her about it just yet, though. - Tue Nov  3 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Oh, I understand.. shes probably very busy.. - Tue Nov  3 16:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: How about.. uhm.. poison research?  - Tue Nov  3 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: She's the best man. And nah, not very busty. - Tue Nov  3 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Anywho. Hit her up when she's got some free time. - Tue Nov  3 16:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Ha- Uh I will.  - Tue Nov  3 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Do you know where she can be found? - Tue Nov  3 16:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) sighs lightly, his search having turned up nothing. He kicks his feet about the sand idly* - Tue Nov  3 16:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Sanoke - Tue Nov  3 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'. - Tue Nov  3 16:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) wasn't sure who the man was talking to, and as such played to his habits in keeping his mouth shut until formally addressed. * - Tue Nov  3 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ... - Tue Nov  3 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: E-..excuse me..? - Tue Nov  3 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: I'm.. uh looking for.. Zenaki - Tue Nov  3 19:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Dunno' where she is. - Tue Nov  3 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You need healing? - Tue Nov  3 19:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Oh, uh no. I was pointed towards her for.. uhm.. learning purposes - Tue Nov  3 19:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Oh, a medical shinobi. It's nice to meet someone going into a field that's geared towards helping people instead of killing. - Tue Nov  3 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: What's your name, buddy? I'm Yan. - Tue Nov  3 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: I'm uhm. Kuro. - Tue Nov  3 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: I've just graduated.. - Tue Nov  3 19:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: What uhm.. do you specalise in Mr. Yan? - Tue Nov  3 19:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Elemental ninjutsu. I'm pretty plain jane. - Tue Nov  3 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: At any rate, it's nice to meet you. I'll let Zenaki know you are looking for her if I see her. - Tue Nov  3 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If I can help you, let me know. - Tue Nov  3 19:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) says: Oh, uh thank you. I suppose i'll just take a look around, thank you for your time - Tue Nov  3 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sure thing, boss. - Tue Nov  3 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) bows shortly to the man, seemingly out of place because Yan was only a year older than him. Kuro seemed hopelessly lost in this whole shinobi ordeal, so he just scuffled away* - Tue Nov  3 19:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I's not Tobacco. . It's Sweet Herb. . PErfectly healthy for you - Tue Nov  3 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And it's called blunt? - Tue Nov  3 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) enters rather timidly, looking around a bit. The blood on the door had intruiged him, rather than frightened him. Though he was a shy boy by nature, the prospect of meeting Zenaki after he had heard so much about her sent his blood rushing. He found a white haired woman, and a white haired man as well. He wasnt sure who was who, he just knew her by name alone.

"H..Hello?"* - Tue Nov  3 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) looks up to the woman, making direct eye contact with the taller Kunoichi. He cocks his head to the side, assessing her for what she may or may not be worth. For the first time, he sheds his shy exterior, grinning a shit eating smirk that would otherwise tell of malicious intent. Kuro spoke, again quite differently than when he had made inquiries of the same woman before him. It radiated a confidence found in kindred spirits.

"I've been looking for your madame.. I've been told we share much the same interests. Poisons and the like, no? I come seeking tutelage."

With that, Kuro nods low to the woman, not rising until he is spoken to. The entire macarbe spectable sent his blood rushing about him in ways he seldom ever experienced* - Tue Nov  3 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) enters, rising only after he hears her allowing him space in which to rise.

"A novice. I am able to craft only the most basic poisons. I've also dabbled in genjutsu a ways, though that field I plan on training myself in."

Kuro takes stock of what ever else he may see, and anticipates it to be none too pleasant. It makes the boy smile that same sickly-sweet smile as before* - Tue Nov  3 20:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) follows her at a distance, knowing her nature and having little trust in it just yet. His desire to learn however overcame his hesitations as he then entered the basement as well. When he came to the landing, he hesitated for just a moment, but that was quickly overcome when he understood he was home! Such sick fascination gripped the boy as he looked about at all the gore. This was nothing like the animals he dissected... now his research could truly begin...

He kept himself small, a shadow on the wall whilst he watched her work. The man laying there on the floor, apprently without sexual organ, was to him just another setpiece in this dreamland* - Tue Nov  3 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Neh.. Shinji.. - Tue Nov  3 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Want me to experiment on you again?  - Tue Nov  3 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: I want food and water, first.  - Tue Nov  3 20:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: All that is there is human flesh.  - Tue Nov  3 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: And what experiment? - Tue Nov  3 20:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm?.. - Tue Nov  3 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Eh...Always new faces.. - Tue Nov  3 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) looks to Fuji for but a moment, however remains enwrapt in the proceedings between Zenaki and Shinji. How exciting!* - Tue Nov  3 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mind telling me whats going on here? - Tue Nov  3 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Uhuh.. - Tue Nov  3 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: Perhaps...I should start burning her -experiment- men... - Tue Nov  3 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I fixes Marrisa's arm. With the help of Bryson. - Tue Nov  3 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It works perfectly again. - Tue Nov  3 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: fixed* - Tue Nov  3 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) thinks: She is even more wicked than they say. This is... amazing.. - Tue Nov  3 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Sounds good.. - Tue Nov  3 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm.. - Tue Nov  3 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) looks between the two, assuming his other, shy demeanor. He shrinks himself in the other man's presence, timidly looking up to him though never meeting his eye. Kuro didn't seem scared per se, that he could never fake, but he did seem as if he was uncomfortable around the new man* - Tue Nov  3 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Too many ... - Tue Nov  3 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Too..Many..? - Tue Nov  3 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Yes.. Too many students.. - Tue Nov  3 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Poison guy. Get out the house. We'll talk later. - Tue Nov  3 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) complies immediately, dissapearing from sight* - Tue Nov  3 20:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Sakuma, Kuro(Acemac5) assumes his place on the bench seat, looking about at the square. That woman was amazing! She was a scientist to the core. She was corrupt in all the right places! It may take some work, but impressing her may reap the most benefit in this entire village...

Kuro sat, observing as always, lost in his own mind* - Tue Nov  3 20:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Sanoke - Tue Nov  3 21:02:30 2015
