She then sets the scaple down on floor and extends her hands out placing them just over the wound on the fesh. Closing her eyes she began to focus on her chakra carefully kneding it up in her hands. Soon after a faint green arua of chakra surrounds her hands. The wound on the fish slowly began to heal up, sealing shut ever so carefuly.

Once it was done being healed she stops her flow of chakra and moves her right back over to grab the scaple. Again she brings it to the fishes scaley flesh and makes a vertical cut a little deeper then the first in it. She sets the scaple down and extends her hands out over the wound. Closing her eyes as she focuses on kneading her chakra ot her hands slowly but carefuly. Soon her hands would be surrounded in a light green arua of chakra. er chakra is then poured nito the wound on the fish slowly healing it back up. 

Opening her eyes and stopping her flow of chakra. She titls her head down a little letting her mouth open up a tad. She huffs quietly to her self before moving her right hand back over to the scaple. Using the sharp blade she cuts another vertical line in the fish but makes it a bit deeper then the first and second time. Se sets the blade to her side and extends her hands over the wound and closes her eyes. Chakra from her inner core began to spiral out into her body. s her body was being filled with her chakra she focuses on kneading some of that chakra to her hands. A green aura of chakra would surround her hands. With hat being done she carefuly pours her chakra into the wond allowing for it slowly seal back up as she heals it for the thrid time. 

Once done she sets her hands in her lap. Her crimson colored eyes stare down at the fis threw the many strands of hair over her face. <One more time.> She thought moving to grab teh scaple using it to cut another deeper vertical slash into fishes flesh. Not only is it deeper but she makes it longer as well. She then sets the scaple down next to her and extends her hands out. Letting them rest still just over the wound a tad s she focuses on kneading her chakra. Hands are surrounded by a green aura of chakra that is carefully poured nto the wound. This one taking longer and more focus for her to heal. She focus on controling her chakr aas well trying to knead more chakra so she keep jutsu going.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mei(Fang7777) Looks away from Jehan string down at the fish that lays there on the ground. Her right moves over grabbing her scaple that rested near her right knee. She uses that scaple to cut three vertical cuts into the fish flesh. She then sets her scaple to her side again and extends her hands over the wounds. She closes her eyes and focused on kneading her chakra to her hands. A green colored aura of the chakra energy surrounds her hands. Her chakra being poured into the wounds, now sinc it was three cuts she was healing it would take longer then healing one. Slowly but carefully each wound starts to seal up but it was moving slowly. Her focus was really on her chakra and healing the wounds but it was just to much for her rookie level. So she stops the flow of chakra and inhales through her nose then exhales from her mouth taking a breather.

After she had gathered some much needed rest from her little break she extend her hands back down over fishes wounds. She closes her eyes and began to knead chakra into her hands pouring her chakra into one of the wounds. This surely would be faster then having to heal all trhee at the same time it took less chakra and less focus. She would then move to heal the next wound once other was done then next wound. Once all three wounds were healed she would place her hands in her lap and huff quietly to her self. <Trying to heal more then one wound at teh same time was to hard.> She thought.

Her right hand again grabs teh scaple using it ot cut deep and long vertical cut into the fish again. She sets the scaple to her side and extends her hands over the wound. Closing her eyes and breathing calmly she began to knead chakra to herhands. Letting the chakra surround her hands and then carefully pouring it into the wound trying to keep cnotrol on her chakra. Slowly the wound began to seal shut and once it was healed she sets her hands in her lap and huffs. <It gets harder when you have low chakra.>she thought.

Uses her left hand to move the strands of her hair infront of her fac eback behind her ear. She thengr abs her scaple with her left hand and moves to make a cut into the fish starting from its head and going all the way down to its tail. She sets her scaple down to her side and then extends her hands out over the fish. Her chakra being slowly kneaded into her hands. Letting her hands being covered in a gree aura of chakra that is carefuly used to pour medical charka intofishes wounds. Slowly but carefuly the wound starts to heal, she starts at the tail and moves along with  the wound to heal the up. IT take some time and chakra but once done she again puts her hand sin her lap and pants softly.* - Sat Nov  7 23:04:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mei(Fang7777) being grabbed and brought closer to him only made her gaps a little. She oepns her mouth and screams out a little trying to get away but it happened he forced him self into her ass it hurt so bad that she trys to scream but no sound came out. She is then rappidly raped by his threads inher other holes nothing not even her will was going to help her get out of this one..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Mei(Fang7777) sucks on his threads not really having much of a choice. Her mouth was just wide open frm all pain she was feeling and she couldnt help but pant from all thrusting and teasing happening to her. She closes her eyes during this all and trys to picture something better..<It'll end soon>she thought.. Her body being abused and used and she had no choice but to lay there and take it...* - Sun Nov  8 01:36:25 2015
