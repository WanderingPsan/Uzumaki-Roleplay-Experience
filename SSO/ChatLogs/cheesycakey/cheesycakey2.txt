<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: His blood -wreaked- of thirst to kill.. - Sat Oct  3 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He had the potential to be reasoned with. - Sat Oct  3 17:51:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Bye.. - Sat Oct  3 17:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) recalled dragging Kubikiribocho off with her. Guess not. She'd look toward the male. "Why was I being looked for..? And mind letting me have that..?" She'd question, seeming a little tense.* - Sat Oct  3 20:27:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Hey, Chiharu. - Sat Oct  3 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Do you want to go practice? - Sat Oct  3 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Uhhhhh.. sure. - Sat Oct  3 20:33:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Come. - Sat Oct  3 20:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: What do you want to practice? - Sat Oct  3 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Um.... hmm.. - Sat Oct  3 20:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Hand to hand combat, I guess. - Sat Oct  3 20:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: ....Alright. - Sat Oct  3 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Actually...er.. - Sat Oct  3 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Sure. - Sat Oct  3 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Oh, alright. - Sat Oct  3 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: If you want to that is. - Sat Oct  3 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I don't mind anything. - Sat Oct  3 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: You choose, this time around. - Sat Oct  3 20:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I figured we could do hand to hand combat. - Sat Oct  3 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: That sounds fine by me. - Sat Oct  3 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Just go easy on me; I'm still injured. - Sat Oct  3 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Okay... - Sat Oct  3 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) distanced herself from Mamoru, her gaze drifting to the male. 

"Ready when you are." She'd state, leaning forth slightly and bending her knees some.* - Sat Oct  3 20:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) ran forth rather eagerly, moving at a rate that was basic for her ranking. The black haired girl would throw a right hook, partially open, toward Mamoru's side. She was doing her best to ensure that she didn't hit him anywhere that would affect his recuperation from his injuries. She seemed to be well versed in taijutsu, but lacked the speed and reaction timing to fully branch out into it.* - Sat Oct  3 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) had her hand slapped away. Before she knew it Mamoru had managed to push her with his palm strike. None the less she'd attempt to stop herself from staggering or falling, trying to extend her left arm out, aiming to slap her palm firmly against his left breast bone.* - Sat Oct  3 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) was caught off guard when his hand made contact with one of her breasts. She'd stagger, her face flushing red. Her arms would fling up, her hands pressing against her shoulders, as though she was shielding her chest from visage. The girl would maintain the distance between them.

"T..that's unfair." She'd murmur, whimpering and pressing her lips together. Her look of discomfort was obvious.* - Sat Oct  3 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) shifted her uneasy stare to the left.

"I'm sensitive where you touched me..." She'd utter, her lips barely parting.* - Sat Oct  3 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I..It's fine.. - Sat Oct  3 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) managed a half-hearted smile, her attention redirecting to the male.* - Sat Oct  3 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Alright... by the way... j-just make sure you don't do that unexpectedly, okay..? - Sat Oct  3 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Y-Yeah. - Sat Oct  3 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'll keep that in mind. - Sat Oct  3 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Sometimes I forget that you're a girl. - Sat Oct  3 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Since you're always my weapon and you act like my best friend. - Sat Oct  3 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Oh.. - Sat Oct  3 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: My bad. - Sat Oct  3 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: You want to go get something to eat? - Sat Oct  3 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Sure. This time you can choose for me, instead of it being the other way around. - Sat Oct  3 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) shined white, spinning into Mamoru's grasp in katana form.* - Sat Oct  3 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: How about some takoyaki? - Sat Oct  3 21:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded, reverting and seating herself beside Mamoru.

"I've never tried takoyaki before but I've heard it's great!" Chiharu stated, smiling toward him. She completely forgot about the boob-touching ordeal.* - Sat Oct  3 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: So what's your favorite food? Just wondering. - Sat Oct  3 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Hmmm... - Sat Oct  3 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I don't know, I like cinnamon buns a lot, though. - Sat Oct  3 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I think that's a bit sweet. - Sat Oct  3 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm not much of a sweet tooth. - Sat Oct  3 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I like anything that's sweet. - Sat Oct  3 21:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: So we differ on that a little. - Sat Oct  3 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Yeah. But that won't stop us from being partners..~ - Sat Oct  3 21:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) smiled lightly toward him, her hands clasped to the table.

"I like you." She'd state. The girl thought about what she'd just said,  her face flushing. "I-I-I mean that in..li-like... I like you as a partner... or a friend.. not like... not like like..." She'd murmur.

<I think I don't..>* - Sat Oct  3 21:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded. She'd lift one of the sticks with fried batter containing octopus up. The female would take a small bite, chewing slowly. The flavor filled her tastebuds with delight and yearning for more, her eyes noticeably widening as she gulped down the treat.

"Waaaw... derishush.." She'd state with part of the stick in her mouth, the reasoning her wording was distorted.* - Sat Oct  3 21:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) wasn't even aware of his actions. She was caught up in just how great the food was. Chiharu continued 'nomming' on the takoyaki, gulping down the fried balls of octopus and batter with delight. Her tastebuds were being overloaded by the pure deliciousness of the food. "Itz sho'good.." She'd say, lurching her head forth toward the stick in front of her with one ball left. Her pair of orbs drifted over to the plates of takoyaki nearby.

The Tokisaki girl plucked the last ball from off of the stuck, chewing it. Her shoulders tensed, her hands tightened slightly, and her eyes shut. "Mmmmmmnnn.." She'd moan in satisfaction, her belly full just from that single stick of takoyaki. "That was delicious! I can't believe I've never eaten something so good.." Chiharu said after she returned the world of bliss that the treat immersed her in.

She would attempt to clasp Mamoru's hands with her own, a smile on her features. She ate in small portions, but did it nimbly, and was neat and organized while doing it. "From now on you're in charge with referring me to foods, okay..?~" She'd state. Her eyes glistened with passion and gratitude.* - Sat Oct  3 21:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Thank you so much Mamoru, honestly! Honestly I've never tried foods like this. I don't know why either. - Sat Oct  3 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: You should get out more. Lots of foods are discovered that way. - Sat Oct  3 22:01:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Um... I'll be fine. I don't have to go far. - Sat Oct  3 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Alright. - Sat Oct  3 22:02:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I've seen Misa. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I mean today. - Sat Oct  3 22:06:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm not going to wait on her for too long then, I'll just train by myself. - Sat Oct  3 22:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Then I'll pester the Raikage. - Sat Oct  3 22:10:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded. She'd wave toward the male as he made his departure, regardless if he saw her.

"Uhuh! Bye, Reguel."* - Sat Oct  3 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Later Chiharu. - Sat Oct  3 22:14:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) stood up, attempting to leave the restaurant.* - Sat Oct  3 22:18:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Sure! - Sat Oct  3 23:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) clasped the male's hand, deciding that she'd rather walk with him instead of transform into a katana as she usually did.

(Grab plz)* - Sat Oct  3 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded. She'd approach the store. The girl would enter the store holding Mamoru's hand, taking a look around.

"Hmmm.."* - Sat Oct  3 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded, pointing to a pale-green open-chest turtleneck sweater. "How about that..?" She'd state. It seemed the female liked the style of it.* - Sun Oct  4 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) peered at the price. It seemed to be half off, making it less expensive than it originally was.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) reverted, new to the feeling of being used like a kitchen knife. The girl would sit back down beside Misa, intending to make sure the girl was okay emotionally.* - Sun Oct  4 01:31:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) went in the kitchen briefly, returning with a plastic fork and plate. She'd place a piece of cake on the plate, seating herself down beside Misa. She'd remove a section of the cake and eat it. Her grip on the fork tightened and she closed her eyes, her lip curling slightly. "S..So good.." Chiharu would state, only after gulping down the piece that she consumed.* - Sun Oct  4 01:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) was apparently picked up. It was at this point that she immediately reverted from sword form. Because he was holding her hilt that applied to her hand being held by the male when she -wasn't- in katana form. With that being said she'd apply her strength to the situation, attempting to snag the male in front of her and throw her right arm out toward the nape of his neck, trying to coil her right hand around the back of it and drive him to his knees, aiming to press her knees to the back of his ankles and press his head to the floorboards.* - Mon Oct  5 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) had no intentions of fighting especially without Mamoru to wield her. The girl would revert from katana form, standing up and attempting to manifest a distance between herself and the masked individual. She'd take the time to recover any lost chakra while keeping a good eye on the events taking place between the two. For now she was no longer involved with the situation.* - Mon Oct  5 21:09:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) tensed up, her gaze drifting down to Mamoru's figure. The girl's fingernails dug into his back. She'd moan more when he eagerly clenched her left breast. Chiharu feverishly worked to expose more of her body by removing her clothing. She'd pull her sweater just above her pair of breasts, her leggings hanging off of her kneecaps. The black haired girl would manage her way to her hair, partially removing the band holding before her hand fell to the side, clutching at the bed.

Chiharu's other hand gestured to the back of Mamoru's head, clenching at his hair and rustling it. Her moans were as contained as possible.* - Mon Oct  5 23:28:00 2015

She was a little nervous, but also very eager.* - Mon Oct  5 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) tensed up more, her grip on him tightening as she pulled him as close as possible, her tongue pressing against his. She'd threw her head back if she wasn't occupied with french kissing him. Chiharu felt his rod push into her walls, moaning considerably in a mix of pain and never-felt pleasure. The girl's legs clenched tighter around him. The walls of her pink pathway drenched in self-lubrication seemed to contract around the shape of his member, fitting to it in a degree.* - Mon Oct  5 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) felt even more of his shaft shove it's way into her vagina. The torrent of pleasure that immersed every inch of her body easily trumped the pain of having her cherry popped. Her legs and arms would constrict around his frame, but only to a degree that wouldn't cause discomfort. "M..Mamoru..!" She'd say between loud moans, her fingernails scraping across his bare back.* - Tue Oct  6 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) moans became louder.

Her eyes were rolled into the back of her head, her gaze only drifting away from the ceiling when she felt him ejaculate upon her belly and pair of breasts. A soothing sigh escaped her mouth, her body untensing. Her legs would slide from being wrapped around him, and her arms would fall to her sides. "Nnnnn....." She'd mumble.* - Tue Oct  6 00:23:28 2015
