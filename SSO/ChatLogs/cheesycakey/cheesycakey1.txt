<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: No. - Tue Sep 29 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) shined white, transforming into her katana form once more. She was stabbed into the earth, her hilt upright.

"Let's go like this. That way you can move as fast as you like without me lagging behind." Her voice would resonate in a manner that made it seem like she was inside of it.* - Tue Sep 29 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Good. - Tue Sep 29 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: So. - Tue Sep 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Let's try this out. - Tue Sep 29 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) made a small "eep" sound when he pulled her back slightly. She'd suddenly feel the force of being swung downward at an incredibly rate of momentum. "Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww..!" Her speaking was delayed by the incredible rate of speed in which he swung her. "That... speed... will take some time adjusting to..!" Chiharu would state, whimpering slightly.* - Tue Sep 29 23:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) was durable enough to knock the shuriken out of the air. Combined with her durability and relatively impressive cutting ability the task would be easy for Mamoru, specifically because of the momentum that he applied behind each slash he performed while using her. She was slowly adjusting to the speed that he used her.* - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I see. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Not bad. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Now. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Let's try something a bit harder. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Prepare yourself for this combination. - Tue Sep 29 23:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: Please don't slam me against anything. Or swing me extremely fast. - Tue Sep 29 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded slightly, mentally preparing herself for what he was about to do. She found herself being swung at an extremely fast rate of speed, stifling her sounds of displeasure. She'd suddenly feel her gravity shift twice, before being swung downward at an intense rate, akin to that of the momentum that the male swung her before, most likely faster though. She was relieved to know that he slashed the air with her, instead of the ground.

"Wow..." She'd state, her mind in spirals, as well as her vision. This seemed to be her first time experiencing training while in her weapon form.* - Tue Sep 29 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) shined white, reverting to her human form.

"That was... pretty good." She would start smiling at him.* - Wed Sep 30 00:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I try. - Wed Sep 30 00:00:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Hey! What elements do you got? - Wed Sep 30 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Have.. rather. - Wed Sep 30 00:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Elements? - Wed Sep 30 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I have... - Wed Sep 30 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Wind, Water, Earth.  - Wed Sep 30 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: You? - Wed Sep 30 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: We have two matching elements. I've lightning instead of wind. - Wed Sep 30 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I wonder how flowing chakra into me would work... what if I infused my katana form with Doton as you did it too? I don't know how to do that though.. - Wed Sep 30 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I can't chakra infuse in general. - Wed Sep 30 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) laughed shyly.* - Wed Sep 30 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I think that'd be interesting. - Wed Sep 30 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Conveniently. - Wed Sep 30 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I have a scroll for chakra flow. - Wed Sep 30 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: But it's without elemental ties. - Wed Sep 30 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Hmmmmm... - Wed Sep 30 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I wonder how infusing lightning would work on me... - Wed Sep 30 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I'd teach you how to use Lightning... but I don't really know how to pass on elements, hehe.. - Wed Sep 30 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I don't know either. - Wed Sep 30 00:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Anywho. - Wed Sep 30 00:13:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) whispers: Let me know if you need anything. Like... a certain gesture could indicate.. - Wed Sep 30 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Mamoru, what happened with the two of you? I heard you both suffered serious injuries. Was it because of Erebus? - Wed Sep 30 23:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) ran her stare across Mamoru's frame, looking at his bandaged wounds.* - Wed Sep 30 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Wed Sep 30 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) whispers: Are you hungry or anything? I'll try and take care of you until you're better. It wouldn't be nice for me not to. - Wed Sep 30 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: No. - Wed Sep 30 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I see.. - Wed Sep 30 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) smiled a bit. "Okay.. c'mon then." Chiharu would state, attempting to grasp his hand and allow him to follow her as she lead him out of the room.* - Wed Sep 30 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: .... - Wed Sep 30 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) entered a diner she was familiar with. The girl would settle down beside Mamoru at a table. "Alright.. put your thumbs up or down, depending on if you like the food I mention. Whatever you like I'll buy for you, okay?"* - Wed Sep 30 23:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Ramen. - Wed Sep 30 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) waited for him to respond. In the meantime she would check the diner's menu for anything that she could get for him that wouldn't require chewing. When he responded she thought. "Uhhh.." She wasn't good at caretaking. She'd hold the menu toward him slightly. "How about soup..? I always like miso soup personally whenever my jaw's hurting... though my jaw hurting is different from it being broken.." It seemed that her suggestion had turned into her contemplating it's sufficiency out loud.* - Thu Oct  1 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) wished that a medic could heal him or check him at the very least. She would do it herself, if she was one. Chiharu grasped the attention of a nearby waitress, ordering miso soup for herself and a recently added soup on the menu, "Kabocha Squash soup". She'd never heard of it, but she hoped that it was good and didn't require chewing. From past experiences she knew that names to things, especially foods, were often misleading.* - Thu Oct  1 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) peered at the male as he removed his mask, discerning his facial features."I visit this place often... everything's good, regardless of what it is. You don't have to wait long for the food, either." She'd state, as chipper as she typically was. It'd be a few minutes before the waitress would return with their orders, placing Chiharu and Mamoru's orders down in front of them.* - Thu Oct  1 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Just learnin' about self defense, I gotta have some taijutsu knowledge as a medic. - Thu Oct  1 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Of course, Kuro gets more training. - Thu Oct  1 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Oh.. - Thu Oct  1 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps you should speak with the Raikage about teaching you the basics? - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I should. - Thu Oct  1 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) waved, smiling. Her smile turned into a minor look of concern when her gaze drifted to the male beside her.

"I feel bad.. he can't even talk.."* - Thu Oct  1 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) folded her arms beneath her chest. Chiharu looked at Mamoru out of her peripheral. The girl wanted to help him out with daily duties because his injuries prohibited him from them, but she wasn't experienced with caretaking. Her stare drifted to Reguel as he approached her partner.* - Thu Oct  1 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Sorry I can't heal ya. - Thu Oct  1 03:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) extended her arm out to shake Kuro's hand unless interrupted. She'd smile then respond, "Im Tokisaki, Chiharu. Nice to meet you." She stated in a bubbly manner.* - Thu Oct  1 03:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'm Reguel. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: Long as I don't strain myself too much and only use my arm muscles I should be okay. - Thu Oct  1 03:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) drifted her gaze to Mamoru. She'd simply nod, drifting her arm over toward his. She'd link her fingers between his, her entire body being overlapped by white. Her figure would shape into a normally-sized katana. As the white light diminished she'd have fully transformed into a black-bladed, white handled katana, held by Mamoru.* - Thu Oct  1 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Pleasure to meet you as well.  I see that you and Mamoru are rather close. - Thu Oct  1 03:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . - Thu Oct  1 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Uhuh, we're partners. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I wonder if I can scare someone someday by talking in katana form. - Thu Oct  1 03:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) had adjusted well-enough from her last time being practiced with by Mamoru. Therefore, she remained quiet, attempting to adjust to the speed that her partner used to practice with her. As usual, the training was exilerating. She was impressed by how well he wielded her, specifically because the weight she possessed as a katana matched her physical form's. * - Thu Oct  1 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Release.....My wrist. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hideki. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: What you're doing, right now. Is a disgrace to Ushinawa's life. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: If you continue with this, You're snuffing out his experiences. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Also, I won't hesitate to take out those eyes of yours. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: His pain, his suffering, But also his happiness and joy. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: It's my fault anyway, Seisuke. I think you fail to understand... - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That is the story of his life Hideki, And if it is your fault, Why do you seek to destroy it? - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Mamoru got injured because of me, Mariana got injured because of me, fucking Hanabi died because I wasn't strong enough to grab her and run. - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're holding a kunai at the person because it's your faut? - Thu Oct  1 23:16:54 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: No. - Thu Oct  1 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You aren't involved at all. - Thu Oct  1 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Hideki, Allow me to say this. - Thu Oct  1 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Ushinawa, was the first person who gave me a chance in this land. - Thu Oct  1 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: A debt I can never repay. - Thu Oct  1 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: Ushinawa was also my best friend, Seisuke. - Thu Oct  1 23:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I may never come to understand the bond you two have shared Hideki, I won't try. I won't lie and say I understand. - Thu Oct  1 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: I won't tell you it'll get better. - Thu Oct  1 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: This world, is trash, and so are it's people. - Thu Oct  1 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: But Ushinawa, He was someone who desired to see the Dawn. - Thu Oct  1 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: Reguel, is next on my list. - Thu Oct  1 23:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: That is a dream, A History, a Legacy. - Thu Oct  1 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: You fail to understand the situation I am in, Seisuke. - Thu Oct  1 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Then tell me Hideki, I won't say I understand. - Thu Oct  1 23:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) gazed the two in silence. She'd approach Mamoru's side.* - Thu Oct  1 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: If I wasn't hurt right now.. - Thu Oct  1 23:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: I would've took Ushinawa's body and ran. - Thu Oct  1 23:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ...... - Thu Oct  1 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 23:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) gazed at Mamoru with a slightly dialated gaze.

She'd slide her fingers between Mamoru's, smiling lightly at him with intentions of providing him with some sort of hope. The girl would look at the situation going on in front of her.* - Thu Oct  1 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . . . . . . - Thu Oct  1 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: Is it over? - Thu Oct  1 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Thu Oct  1 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded lightly. A look of shock consumed her features, her head shifting toward Mamoru quickly. "You can talk again? You should've told me.." Chiharu drifted off into a murmur that was intended for only Mamoru's ears to hear. The female's frame shined white and she transformed into a black-bladed, white-handled katana in Mamoru's grasp.* - Fri Oct  2 00:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Now then. - Fri Oct  2 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: We should practice. - Fri Oct  2 00:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Yeah. - Fri Oct  2 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) remained transformed into her katana form. She'd await for Mamoru to start using her to train. The girl mentally prepared herself for the rate at which he'd probably swing her.* - Fri Oct  2 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) luckily had the time to brace herself for his intense training methods. She would pay close atteniton to the fluency in which he wielded her while she was in katana form. It seemed that, so far, she had no faults to point out in his methods. Except for one. "Hey... try to reinforce your momenutm by putting strength behind the attacks. Of course... you should maintain the flexibiltiy of your attacks. Regulate your strength in a manner that you won't limit your physical mobility after swinging."* - Fri Oct  2 00:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) would clap if she was capable of doing so. She noticed the immense physical strength invested into the vertically descending slash. "Good... but don't use all of it unless you can rebound and maintain mobility -right- after." Her sense of feeling was aiding her in explaining how he could improve the manner that he used her.* - Fri Oct  2 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: "It" as in physical power... by the way. - Fri Oct  2 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: The only thing he didn't do was regulate his physical strength... - Fri Oct  2 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) was unable to shake her head while in katana form. "No no no... not restrain it. Limit it. Use as much as possible, but find the amount that'll remove the small pause between you slashing and your actions following. Pauses are wastes of movement. Wastes of movement are vital flaws in fighting.." The girl seemed to be a good instructor. She was very close to completely handling the speed that he wielded her.* - Fri Oct  2 00:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) gave him vocal approval, especially if he kept the manner that he was practicing going. "That's perfect! Keep up with that. When you feel comfortably enough start using kenjutsu techniques. Try performing fluent combos, too!" She'd state, joyful at Mamoru's success. The chipper girl in her katana form would continue to ensure he was properly improving his swordsmanship.* - Fri Oct  2 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) immediately took notice of his weight inclining toward her when he fainted. In a brief moment she'd shine white, reverting from her katana form. She'd find herself with her back pressed to the ground while her incapacitated partner lay on top of her.

"Mamoru!?"

She'd grasp hold of his shoulders, shaking him slightly. The girl would position the male on her back, pulling his arms over her shoulders. Chiharu started to make a quick dash to the mansion, specifically the inside if no one was in the vicinity outside of the building.

'I should've paid more attention to his fatigue... I need to be a better caretaker!' She'd think to herself, a whimper leaving her throat.* - Fri Oct  2 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hm? - Fri Oct  2 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) entered with an unconscious Mamoru on her back, his arms hanging over her shoulders. "He fainted during training... I wasn't paying enough attention to his stamina! I apologize!" She'd state, bowing. Her hands were wrapped around the male's, securing his position.* - Fri Oct  2 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) looked back toward Kuro. "If what...uh.. Mr. Medic says is right, all he needs is rest." She'd state, smiling nervously. The girl would appoach the bed that Reguel directed her to, laying Mamoru down. She'd settle down beside him, her knees pressing against the floor. Her butt was pressed to the back of her ankles as she folded her legs beneath her. She clasped her hands together in her lap, looking down at Mamoru with a small expression of worry.* - Fri Oct  2 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I never did learn anyone's names. - Fri Oct  2 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: That's good then. - Fri Oct  2 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded, lifting one of her eyebrows as she observed his actions. "Uhuh. We were training." She'd elaborate, her eyes shifting to Reguel when she stated this. She would look back down at Mamoru, a look of worry still on her face.* - Fri Oct  2 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, well I can't really use healing ninjutsu now, but I can certainly numb his pain for some time. - Fri Oct  2 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: The only reason we were able to train was because he was using pain reliever.. is it safe for him to have more medicine already? - Fri Oct  2 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I see.  - Fri Oct  2 01:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I'll need to talk to Misa about this. - Fri Oct  2 01:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm, then I'll just allow him to get some rest, if this happens again he won't be training anymore until further notice. - Fri Oct  2 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Okay.. - Fri Oct  2 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: As his partner you're also at fault. - Fri Oct  2 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I know already. I didn't even realize he was tiring out. - Fri Oct  2 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) clasped Mamoru's left hand, looking down at him. "I'm... sorry.." She'd murmur, her voice faltering. Tears would border her eyes. She lifted her free hand, wiping her tears before they could fall, and sniffling lightly. "This is my fault.." She'd utter, pressing her palm over her eyes and clenching her teeth.* - Fri Oct  2 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) thinks: I'd honestly prefer my house... - Fri Oct  2 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Or if you want I could use you as a test subject for the poison I'm working on. - Fri Oct  2 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) broke her grip upon one of Mamoru's hands to bury her face in her hands. Her low sobs would resonate, but they would be short-lived, as she was doing her hardest to fight her emotions as they revealed themselves.* - Fri Oct  2 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . I'm good, thanks for the offer. - Fri Oct  2 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Well at least we can finally talk to each other, Mamoru. - Fri Oct  2 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Ah, well let me offcially introduce myself, I'm Reguel, I'm the one who helped you two when I found you outside the mansion. - Fri Oct  2 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I am a genin who's planning to be a medic. - Fri Oct  2 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: However, I'm not as skilled as Misa seeing as welll I slacked off, a lot. - Fri Oct  2 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: . . . . . - Fri Oct  2 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: You could call me a swordsman. If you want to know my profession. - Fri Oct  2 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I already know your profession. - Fri Oct  2 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Thanks to your flashy display a few days ago. - Fri Oct  2 02:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Where do you live..? I can take you there.. if you want. - Fri Oct  2 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: O-Of course I don't really have to know your address. - Fri Oct  2 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: But it'd be convenient.. for you. - Fri Oct  2 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Yeah, that's fine... - Fri Oct  2 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I live near the mall. - Fri Oct  2 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Just south of it.  - Fri Oct  2 02:18:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Think you could help me there? - Fri Oct  2 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) nodded. She'd extend her hand out, smiling shyly. She'd allow him to utilize her as sufficient support, regardless of how much of it he required.* - Fri Oct  2 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Uhuh. - Fri Oct  2 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: C'mon then.~ - Fri Oct  2 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) approached the front door to the home, taking a quick glance at it's structure. She'd look at Mamoru.

"This is your house, right?"* - Fri Oct  2 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Yeah, this is mine. - Fri Oct  2 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Thank you. - Fri Oct  2 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Yeah... it's nothing really. Are you hungry? - Fri Oct  2 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: A bit. - Fri Oct  2 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm more thirsty, if anything. - Fri Oct  2 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Hmmmm... okay. You relax here. I don't have anything on me other than my headband... so I'll be back soon. - Fri Oct  2 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Alright. - Fri Oct  2 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Thank you, Chiharu. - Fri Oct  2 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Really. - Fri Oct  2 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: It's no problem, really! It's the least I can do. - Fri Oct  2 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) looked back at him, smiling. The female would start to head out of the house, waving back at him on her way out.* - Fri Oct  2 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) entered the home once more, assuming the front door was unlocked for her. The girl would be holding a plastic bag in her right hand, while her left hung at her side. "I'm back.~" She'd state, regardless if the male was able to visually see that she had come back into his home. She'd settle down on the bed parallel to his, resting the bag on any platform near Mamoru's bed, such as a nightstand.

Within the bag was a packet of chocolate-chip cookies, two canned coffees with extra creamer, and some pain medication. It was clear as day tha she liked being reliable, but she didn't do a good job at taking on the task. It was also noticeable that when she was in a hurry she never took the time to make logical decisions, hense the unhealthy consumables that she purchased.

"I was in a hurry... sorry if I got the wrong things.." She'd state, shifting rather uncomfortably. This was the first time she was in anyone else's house.* - Fri Oct  2 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) thinks: I should've went to an actual market instead of a convenience store... but super markets are easy to get lost in. Plus... It wouldn't have been good for me to leave him alone for an extended period of time. - Fri Oct  2 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) shifted her head slightly.

"There's no need to pay me back. And... are you sure I got the right things..?" She'd question, her hands folded within her lap. Her gaze was focused on Mamoru, as usual.* - Fri Oct  2 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) smiled shyly. "Okay.." The girl's stare would gear away from Mamoru, as she took a quick glance at her surroundings.* - Fri Oct  2 03:33:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Huh? Nothing. - Fri Oct  2 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Well actually... I'm a little antsy. I'm not sure why. - Fri Oct  2 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Hmmm? - Fri Oct  2 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Oh, you've never been in my house. That's probably why. - Fri Oct  2 03:35:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: That's to be expected. - Fri Oct  2 03:37:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I need to think of ways to train with you. I feel useless when you're training, because I just get to sit and get swung... and me trying to give you tips just tired you out.. - Fri Oct  2 03:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: It wasn't you giving me tips that tired me out. - Fri Oct  2 03:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I appreciate your tips. - Fri Oct  2 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Well... I didn't really know what to say. I was just going by feeling. I guess I can identify the way you wield me or something.. - Fri Oct  2 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Probably because you're being wielded. - Fri Oct  2 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I want to recover from these injuries. - Fri Oct  2 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Chiharu. - Fri Oct  2 22:54:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I see. - Fri Oct  2 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'll be training on my own then. - Fri Oct  2 23:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) walked up toward Mamoru, wearing a pair of maroon pants, a black short sleeve and a white jacket over said shirt. A scarf matching the color of her pants accentuated her outfit.

"Hey.~"* - Sat Oct  3 00:11:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct  3 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Great. - Sat Oct  3 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Com'on. - Sat Oct  3 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) removed her scarf, abandoning it beside her. She'd approach him, clasping his hand before shining white. Chiharu would transform into a normal-length katana, but unlike before, her blade was a shimmering shade of red. Her handle was white, but the end was black. The tip of the blade itself was black as well.

"The color of my katana form is affected by what I'm wearing. Well.. the color of what I'm wearing, hehe." The edge of her blade looked slightly sharper than before, and it was obvious that she obtained an impressive amount of burliness to her weapon form.

(18 Durability, +4 Damage.)* - Sat Oct  3 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) hadn't grown in weight. She had adjusted to Mamoru's attacking speed by now. "Something like that.." Then she'd ask him a question, "If there was any other weapon you could utilize, what would it be?"* - Sat Oct  3 00:24:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: Any other weapon? - Sat Oct  3 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: I'm fine with a katana. - Sat Oct  3 00:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: We need to work on our coordination though. - Sat Oct  3 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: True.. - Sat Oct  3 00:28:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: With chakra flow. - Sat Oct  3 00:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: Ah.. - Sat Oct  3 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) says: I can transform into things other than weapons, also. - Sat Oct  3 00:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tokisaki, Chiharu(Cheesy Cakey) eagerly navigated her way into the room, to see Mamoru getting his chakra saber shattered. The black haired female's eyes would widen as she rushed toward her partner, shouting out to him. "Mamoru!" She'd state, her entire frame shining. She'd suddenly morph into a red-bladed, white hilted, average-sized katana with a black tip and end. Said katana would spin throughout the air directly into Mamoru's grasp the moment he'd offer it.* - Sat Oct  3 06:09:29 2015
