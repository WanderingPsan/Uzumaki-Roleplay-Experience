<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Are you a resident here?
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Yes I'm.
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) walked through the streets with the scroll and notebook between his waist and arm, he headed for a big lake, a place with water would surely help him more then such a dry grassy area. '' Ah, that lake seems good. '' , he said while staring at a not to far away area. It took two minutes by foot to get there from his place so he reached it fast and easy.

'' Now then, let's do it like this. '' , he said while dropping his notebook and scroll onto the ground, his hands clapped together with a loud sound as he formed them into the Ram seal with a quick and good movement, followed up by a Tiger seal that was but slightly different from the Ram. His Chakra was send to his mouth after gathering it all into one spot. '' First to get some experience with the Jutsu before doing what I want to do. '' , he thought.

The boy shot out a large blast of water onto the lake but nothing extraordinary happened, it was a simple bubble of water, not even remotely close to what he wanted to make. '' Ah, damn it. '' , he thought.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Don't pay attention to that :S )
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Nice to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Nice to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (How long you been playing this game?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( 2 days :S )
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: Do you know where I can find your Kage or the head of the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (oh. Do you like it?)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( It's a nice Server. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( The Chuunin Exam Third Round took a long time to finish but the rest was all really fun. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: I don't know for sure.
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: But follow me.
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (you were in the chuunin after only two days of play lol)
<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) lowered his body towards the lake and stared at it, the water was almost crystal clear and nothing seemed wrong with it. '' Alright then, I'll try it this time with the actual plan I had in mind. '' , the boy grinned and stayed at his position while taking a deep breath and closing his eyes as he took a moment of sollitude to meditate.

Once Harada's Chakra was replenished and his body was ready for more training, he performed the two hand seals again, getting faster at the progress with it as it seemed like he didn't have any problem with it at the moment. The Chakra was being focussed towards a single spot of his body.

Haru took a sip of the lake's water and kept it inside of his mouth while fusing it with the Chakra enhanced water from his body as he spew it out of his mouth as he walked forward, making the place slippery with water, but it was still regular water. It was only slippery and wet, not sticky and he could still use movements onto it. '' Hmmm. . . '' , he thought.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Also ignore that Rp xD. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( It's the 1 month Hiatus time between the Semi-Finals ( Third Round Finals ) and the Actual Finals of Chuunins. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I'm one of the last remaining. ;p )
<br><font color=green>*Henju(Dart2009) says: (hm)
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: Follow me.
