<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) 's iron sand moves foreward crashing into the Raiton no Yori causing it to be broken apart. Drawing the sand backwards he looked confused at the girl. "I need to get that shuriken..."he'd be thinking to himself as he something must be special about that shuriken to break through an techniuque that stoped his Iron Sand. "Hrm..."he'd grunt as he placed his hand upon Karina's shoulder after hearing she was the Mizukage. "Then if your the Mizukage you should leave now. Mizukage's shouldn't be fighting in petty battles like this."he'd explain as his sand would begin to develop around his ankles preparing to remove the young mizukage from the battle.*

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Suicides*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: .....I guess it makes sense, I am expendable due to not being apart of this village hahahaha.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (omit)

<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I should be fine.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Your advisor can protect you as well Mizukage...

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You any good at tracking...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Not from this far...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: But My blade can sniff out high chakra sources.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Dont think it will be able to do it at such a distanc though...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and closed his eyes, his veins protruding as he activated his clan's eyes. He then said "I can have my eyes like this for about a day..Then I'm useless for awhile so we need to get moving fast..."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Nod*...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: We'll make camp in a few hours...Sun is going down soon.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Alright..Here is a good place to rest...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Nod*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) closed his eyes once more, the veins retracting as his eyes returned to their life-less state, reaching into his holster he grabbed a scroll and said "I always seal away a nap-sack..." Setting it on the ground he unravled it and began a few short seals, stomping on the scroll a smoke enveloped it and a nap-sack appeared.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm.
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would ram the tip of her samehada into the grass beside her, plopping down on the floor with a large sigh. *
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You alright...You are really silent now..
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm.....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Thinking....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: About...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Life.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: It seems to be going by extremely fast....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: How so...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Though...people should cherish it more cause they will never know when life will slip away from them..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: You understand?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hey...I'm sorry about what happened at my house, I drank a little too much and yeah...Sorry...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: What...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You don't remember..?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Not really....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: It sounds like something awkward..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I fell back from too much drinking and pulled you down ontop of me...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ......Oh now I rmember....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: but I think I fell asleep after that...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I think..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You did...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Ohh.....I dont usually drink either...sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: It's fine...I actually enjoyed it.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (back)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ............You enjoyed it?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Are you saying...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: N-never mind..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Tell me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would blush slightly shaking her head in refusal towards Evan*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) ewww... this is still in*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sashi(Typhlosion101) wonders if this is still spammable*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: What's with that blush...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Nothing..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Tell me...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Nope..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: C'mon...Pleeeeeaaaaassssseeee~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Nope..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: How do I force it out of you...Hrm...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled as he turned toward her and said "I can always torture you...." He pushed himself up and attempted to tackle her down, if he succeeded he would pin her down and await a response.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (AFK for like 10-20 minutes X,x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: Evan)
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: were u sealed to??)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply have gotten pinned down, her eyes closed this whole time which left her vulnarable. "........What are you trying to do?"she asked softly*
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: Evan you slut)
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: U there?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (He isnt)

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Wb o-O)_
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Had to go all the way to Downtown to pick up my buddy x.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Why is Alister here...?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Der)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...I'm trying to get you to open up and tell me what's up with you blushing.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Well its not working haha...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and forced his face closer to her's eyeing her up as he said "Oh really..It's making you talk more than you normally do..." He then smirked down to her awaiting a response.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Bacxk)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would avert her face to the side, trying to avoid eye contact as the blush began to grow even more."Eh What ever!~" she chimed, giving a short laugh. "Your lucky im in a good mood!" she said sharply, acting it off as if she was angry*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I wish I got my car....)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I have to use my moms all the time xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Meh, I have to pay insurence, gas, and other shit for mine X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Lmao)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (How old are u?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (19 X.x I be living on mah own C.c)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (OMG lucky)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (XD)

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (U get lonely or something :<?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Nah, I got a room-mate but my house be costing so much money X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (awww xD)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (its always about the money smh)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I wish things didnt cost so damn much these days)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and gave her a quick peck on the cheek as he said "Okay little miss sassy...Whatever you say..." He pushed himself off her and stretched as he held his smile.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (So do I X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I only have another year until im able to move out)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (ABLE)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Dont think I will though)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I got kicked out so X.x but I suggest staying for as long as you can and bank all your money.)

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I <3 my mom/brother XD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply lay on the floor, her heart racing as her crimson eyes stared up at the sky above. Everything usddenly went blank, she passed out. Her limp body would simply lie on the same exact spot*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...Eh...?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and walked over to where she laid, crouching down he placed his arms under her and lifted her up. Walking over toward his nap-sack he laid her down on it and said "Gee...Such a weird woman..." He then squatted down and propped her head up, placing the pillow under her head he moved back and folded his arms.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ...........
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would come to rather quickly, jumping to her feet and staring about, quickly walking over towards samehada and grabbing at its hilt, lifting it and tossing it over her shoulder, playing it off like nothing had happened at all. "We must find the raikage and subdue her quickly..." she said softly, turning off towards the opposing direction of Evan. "This is criticle....."*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Eh hold up, what's up with you now...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: What do you mean...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You are all ready to get up and go...And what's up with passing out like that?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I was..light headed....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: But Come on....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: That doesnt matter!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Nope, come here.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: We have to find the raikage!
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: My mizukage is counting on us.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I gotta see if there is something wrong with you...So c'mere.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Walks over towards Evan*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: HUrry now!
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) reaches out and attempts to grab her face, if successful he would pull her face closer to his and stare into her eyes. This was all to see if her pupils were dialated and if he would have to force her to go home.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply stare over at Evans eyes, her heart racing still but she had a grip on herself this time. "See...nothing wrong..." for she was indeed perfectly fine..*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and patted her on the top of her head as he said "Yep, nothing wrong with you...Hm...Guess it was just a heat flash..." He released her face and stretched once more, then formed a simple seal as the nap-sack disappered back into the scroll, crouching down he picked it up and placed it in his jacket.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Any idea of where the village would be...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (We gotta find dem D:)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: No idea...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I honestly have no idea where she could have gone...Her speed is phenominal so she could be countries away....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ......
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Kumogakure should be...)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (:<)_
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (there should be a map or seomthing)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Since she could get to kiri so easy)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kumogakure would be near a months IC travel X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (its worth it xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (And Kumo is mapped on here.)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: About earlier....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I didnt pass out because of the heat...or anything....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Oh?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Clears throat*...
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply start rubbing her temple. unable to say what needed to be said*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: C'mon don't be shy now.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: This is harder than it seems....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I cant say it....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *SIGHS*

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Even worse..

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: C'mon, you're a Jonin nothing is too difficult.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Aghhhh....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I can't do it...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and walked up to her as he said "Write it down...?"*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Have a piece of paper..?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Over by the dresser.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: And a writing tool
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ??
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Pen should be next to the paper.
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) walks over to the dresser, writing something down upon the peice of paper with a pen, after writing it she would hand the piece of paper over to evan with a sigh. The paper read. "I sort of...like you."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) grabbed the paper and scanned the five words, moving he gaze back up he said "So...You passed out from embarrassement..." He moved closer to her and said "Wonder what would happen if I did this...." He then opened his arms and wrapped them around her back, pulling her in for a hug as he kissed her forehead.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have suddenly found herself being embraced by evan,her heart almost skipping a beat as she was pulled in closer towards him.  Then, after the hug came the kiss once more, the woman this time however didnot pass out but simply grinned, enjoying this exchange. "Hn.." she chimed, a bit caught off gaurd, absolutely melting within his arms. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) chuckled a little as he said "So no heat flashes huh...." He scooped her up in his arms and said "Maybe I can get you to pass out with this!" He quickly moved his face to hers and planted a small peck on her lips, then another this time holding the kiss longer then previously.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply been caught off gaurd by the kiss on the lips, her eyes suddenly widening as the kiss on the lips was more than enough to make he go under. She suddenly went limp and numb, becoming like jello in the mans arms*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and walked over toward his bed, laying her down he bent over her and kissed her again as he said "You really need to quit that..Someone might think you're dead..." He laughed and sat beside her, staring at the wall as he waited for her to come-round.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would slowly bat her eyes open, noticing she had feinted again. Misaki would sigh and bring her arms up so that she could bury her face in her palms. "I did it again didn't I..?" she asked quietly, more embarassed than ever, trying to hide the red blush*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pinned her hands down beside her head as he said "No need to hide..And yeah, it happened...But we can always work on fixing that problem..Can't we~" He released her hands and dragged both hands across her arms as he smirked at her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin up at Evan, her eyes fixated upon his. "Y-yeah.." she said, forcing out her words as she was nothing but a nervous wreck at the moment.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Good, now you get on the offensive.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hnn...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Wut shoud I add to the water fall Village o-o)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (and how do u screen shot? xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Um...Add that big ass waterfall X.x and that one tree.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (No idea how to screen shot X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Heh...Come. And. Kiss. Me~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (kk back)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Rping)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would lean upward, aiming to close the gap between their faces. She was a bit hesitant but, she wanted to do it so only love drew her forward. Her lips would soon meet his as she neared closer and closer, planting a kiss upon him, truth be told this little kiss was not enough for her. *
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (i need somone to icon a biiig tree xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Trin might be able too.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pulled her onto his lap as he wrapped his arms around her, breaking the kiss he said "Good...Now let out any emotion you might have and pour it all onto me..." He smiled and moved his face close to her's again, but instead of kissing he snapped his head back and grinned at the Kirigakure shinobi. He was enjoying teasing her.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (trin?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (She knows how to icon?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (She iconned Kirigakure Chunin suit.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Say wut?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: You're teasing me now~ haha.
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) wrapped his arms around her, pulling her even closer as he finally kissed her. His mind going blank from the kiss as instinct took over, falling back so she was ontop of him he continued the kiss, occasionally pulling away to breathe as he mumbled "I can't seem to tease you anymore...Well this is no fun..." His breathing became rigged as he dove back into another kissing frenzy.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply been pulled forward by evan eventually ending up atop of him, kissing once more, but this time with a little bit more emotion placed into it, her eyes closed as she let herself get caught up in the moment. Misaki would pull back at the same times Evan did, simply giving off a few subtle laughs before moving back in, the kissing only resuming. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) finally pulled away as he laid his head back down on the pillow, his arms dropped to his sides as she laid ontop of him, closing his eyes he said "There we go...Not so shy now are ya~?" He chuckled.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: N-not really no.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then keep practicing...Think of me as a training dummy~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (KaY)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and placed his hands on the small of her back as he kissed her cheek and said "I'm dead serious about my offer to be your training dummy..Ya know~" He then slowly began to rub her back.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Back)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin and lean in closer, aiming to sneak a small kiss on the lips, slowly transforming it into another passionate one, only escalading from this point. After a few long...long seconds of this, she would pull back for air and simply grin, proceeding to ask the question"......Do you actually...love me?" she said softly, wanting to know the truth from his lips. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) 's face flushed at her question, his breathing haulted and he stared up at her. After a few moments he smiled and leaned into her, aiming his mouth next to her ears he said "I do Misaki...And don't ever think I don't!" He then nipped at her ear with his teeth and laid back down on the bed, beaming at her with a goofy smile.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin and stare down at Evan, her eyes taking on a much softer look. With this she simply leaned the rest of her weight upon him and embraced him, not wanting to let him go. "..." she would simply stay in this position until the hyuuga grew restless.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and rolled her over so she laid beside him, pulling her closer as he said "So little missy....Do you love me...?" He smirked and kissed her jaw line to tease her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply nod and chime"Of course!!"*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then show me how much~
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would lean forward and aim to give another long kiss towards Evan, passing off a wide grin before doing so. "You show me how much you love me..~" she retorted after taking a short breath, moving back in to kiss him once more.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) frowned as she moved her head back to tease him, he the mumbled "Oh you want me to show you hu-" Her kiss cut him off as he rolled ontop of her, breaking the kiss he immediatly attacked her chin and began to kiss along her jaw line, eventually making it to her neck.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply begin to giggle lightly, wrapping her arms around his body frame and pulling herself in closer, keeping the space between them extremely limited to almost no space. A deep red blush would overwhelm her complexion, her face now looking much like a cherry itself.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and slowly bit at the skin on her neck, as he did this he interlaced his fingers with her's and held her hands as he pulled himself back up to her face and said "Your turn...~"*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I dunno...~ My love for you.....cant be expressed without things getting.......awkward on the first day haha....
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and laid his head down on her shoulder as he whispered out "Nothing can be akward between us Misaki..." He then stuck his tounge out and sheepishly licked her bottom lip.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply laugh at Evan, a warm smile crossing her expression as she simply shrugged. "I don't wanna rush things..~" she said softly, running her fingers through his hair abit as she placed her free palm against his chest, reubbing a bit. "You understand right?" she asked softly.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (rubbing*)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and shook his hair as he said "I understand love~" He smirked and playfully growled at her then bit onto her neck again as he said "And to think, all I had to do was just tease you a little and you'ld get so worked up to where you had to write out your feelings...."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Im not so good at it....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: But you can say it now right~?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Nod*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pushed his face close to her ear as he whispered out "Then say it love...Say how you feel about me."*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (D:)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Lol'd)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (she freaked out over nothing xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Nah, she was teleporting to see if RP was going on.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply move to whisper in his ear*
<br><font color=teal>*Misaki(Miyasake3) whispers: I love you Evan, and I wish to spend the rest of my life being with you....
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shuddered as her warm breath hit his ears, his body feeling numb as the words drained his body of strength. Closing his eyes he said "Then let's get married...Not today but soon!"*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hn...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: O-oh kay!
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I g2g)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I'm going to bed too X.x)

<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: Karina is Dead.
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) pulls down Evan's pants, slowly. As Evan's pants hit the ground, Mizuki would bite his lip to conseal his laughter. Mizuki's left eyebrow would rise as he was faced to face with what seemed to be a misplaced ramen noodle. As he shrugged his shoulders slightly, he'd grasp the noodle tightly, parting his lips. He would then slowly insert the noodle into his mouth, jerking his head back and forth for about a good two minutes before a creamy white substance bursted from the tip of the ramen noodle, sending the baby-juice into Mizuki's mouth.*

He'd then bite down onto his thumb swiftly, breaking the skin causing a small amount of blood to pour from the wound. Mizuki would then exclaim, "Summoning jutsu!". He would then form a chain of handseals before slamming his left hand onto the ground, causing an enormous cloud of white smoke to form as a giagantic slug crashed through the ground, sending chunks of rock flying everywhere. Mizuki would smile brightly as he exclaimed, "Yeah! I did it!". He would then leap from atop the slug's head saying, "Well...why don't we get to this sage training.".*

<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: I fail)
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) sighs as he would slowly raise his left thumb to his lips. He'd slowly part his lips as he said, "Hm....let's see if I can get this right...". He'd then bite down onto his thumb swiftly, breaking the skin causing a small amount of blood to pour from the wound. Mizuki would then exclaim, "Summoning jutsu!". He would then form a chain of handseals before slamming his left hand onto the ground, causing an enormous cloud of white smoke to form as a giagantic slug crashed through the ground, sending chunks of rock flying everywhere. Mizuki would smile brightly as he exclaimed, "Yeah! I did it!". He would then leap from atop the slug's head saying, "Well...why don't we get to this sage training."

Mizuki would then dart toward the slug, leaping onto it's head. He'd thrust his right hand onto the center of it's head, causing the giant slug to break down into much smaller slugs, each slamming into the ground leaving small crater's from the force of their impacts. Mizuki would then form a chain of handsigns exclaiming, "Collaboration Jutsu!: Bursting Acid Collision Waves!". He'd then form a chain of handseals before slamming his hand onto one of the much smaller slug's heads. The slug would inhale deeply before spitting out a large wave of it's acidic liquid, using transfered water chakra from Mizuki.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) turned and smiled at her as he said "Mizukage's have been dying...You are the next in line to become Mizukage...See where I'm getting at....?" His smile quivered as he tried to hide his worry.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply frown and move a bit closer towards Evan, taking her arms and wrapping them around his torsoe. "Don't think like that~" she said softly. hugging him tightly, feeling a bit concerned for herself aswell, whilst trying to soothe Evan. "Nothing bad will happen..."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shivered as her arms wrapped around him he in turn laid his hand on her hips as he said "I'm thinking about leaving my village and living here...With you...." He smiled at her and pulled her in so their bodies connected.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: A-are you sure about that?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Dead sure.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha~ What about your clan back in konohagakure??

<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smirked and picked her up, kissing her gently he said "I love you too...."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply gave off a few laughs as she was picked up, returning a few gentle kisses on evans lips with a rather soft grin. "Evan...." she said softly, waitign for a response. *
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Have you ever had thoughts on starting a family..?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) 's face flushed and reddened as he stuttered out "A-a f-f-family...Eh...I um..." He took a deep breath and stared into her eyes "I've thought about it before...Like how I can pass on my legacy..."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hehe seems you are the embarassed one now~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: .....

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Why wouldn't I be?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and tackled her to the ground, laying ontop of her he began to kiss her jaw-line and said "I love you! I love everything about you Misaki!" He pulled away and smacked his lips on her's with a hungry kiss, lust and love morphing into a chaotic passion as he wrapped his arms around her back.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have gotten tackled to the ground, this sudden action catching her off gaurd as both of the fell with a powerful thud, Evan atop. With this came the kiss, although it was differnt, much more passionate and lustful. His arms now wrapped around her back as she simply put her arms over his shoulders, closing her eyes as she enjoyed this sign of newly found heightened love. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) pulled away, and held her as he said "I never thought I'ld be able to have a family...You have no idea how happy I am..." He released his arms from her back and stroked his hands over her face, eventually cupping them and holding the sides of her face as he planted a delicate kiss on her lips.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply accept the delicate kiss, raising her right eyebrow. "Why would you think that?" she said softly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) laid his head on her chest, trying to catch his breath as he said "Because...Never been loved before, I've only ever had time to train and that's it...You are the first person to love me...." He brushed his head against her chin.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha~ You are the first i have ever loved~..

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha, you are handsome, extremely, and your personality reached out to mine, you are just one who makes my world feel complete, that is why I love you~ 
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and kissed her as he said "You are amazing, your cute when you are embarrassed and you love me." He then planted another kiss on her cheek as he pushed himself off the ground and picked her up and placed her feet on the ground as he said "As much as I hate doing this....I have to go to Sunagakure and check it out...I really don't want to leave my love." He planted another kiss on her lips as he said "Love doesn't sound quiet right...How about wife...?"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply blush, moving her head to the side aiming to hide it. "Yo-your saying you want to...?" she paused, a bit distraught, the word wife almost knocking her off her feet. She simply grinned*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pinched her cheek gently as he said "Of course I do! Would wife or mother of my children be better...Hrm...So hard to decide..." He gave her a sheepish grin as he pulled her into his body and planted multiple kisses on her lips and above her eyes.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha, they both sound fine to me~.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then when should we have our little family...?

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: O-oh haha...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I was worried for a few minutes..
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and stretched as he reached back and messaged the muscles in his legs saying "I need to get going Misaki....Please stay safe for me and our future children...Kay~" He then beamed at her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply nod and grin at Evan*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Later~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Oh, and to tie you over....
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) he smiled and reached over pulling her entire body into his being, kissing her with as much force as he could muster he darted his tounge into her mouth and held it there as he rubbed her lower back, moments later he pulled away as a thin string of saliva fell from between them.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply found herself being pulled in, but just a meere second later, an intense kiss was placed upon her, evans tounge now being pushed in her mouth."M..." she groaned slightly, closing her eyes, only opening them as he pulled back, her eyes open wide, simply staring at him, a deep red blush now sweeping across her face.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Think that'll hold you till I come back~?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Mhm!
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and moved his face to her ear as he said "Wait for me Misaki...Once I get back we'll have as big of a family as you want kay~" He then rubbed her stomach playfully and released her. Then darted off toward the entrance of the village.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply say goodbye to Evan, wishing him safe travels and watching him stride away with a smile on her face*

<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin at Evan as he pinned her down, his body now once more ontop of hers. With a few simple giggles and such, Misaki would soon blush. "We have nothing to do right now....~" she said softly, becoming a bit embarassed as she closed her eyes, awaiting the response.*
