<br><font color=yellow>*Valtim, Duskrix(Shayne9989) The Sun rose over the clouds of Kirigakure, As a cry was heard in the distance. Loud and shrill, It had been immensily high pitched. In the distant valleys of Kiri, A woman layed across her bed Her legs held up onto the bed post. as she'd scream frantically. Wearing a skirt, Her husband, a Rugged Blue haired man with a stub like beard stands at the other end, His palms out and open as if he is preparing to catch something. Screaming to his wife, The Man's loud and strong voice echoed through the air "Come On Tamari, Push!" he'd encourage as the woman whaled one last time, Echoing through the air. She'd quicly relax her muscles as her head would fall back onto the pillow. Seconds after, A loud shriek would come from the man's hand. He'd quickly draw in his arms, Craddling something in his hands, Suddenly he'd shout to the nurse at his side "Quickly, A Blanket!".  The Girl ran off, Returning in moments with a baby blue blanket. The Man quickly snatched it with a single hand, With a smirk, He'd wrap what had been in his hands, Making a comfortable little wrap out of it. In his hands, The Large man held a small infant, It had been wailling and thrashing about as it cry viciously. The Woman raised her head, "Sitori,How is it? Is the baby okay?" She'd ask her face coverd with fret. "The Baby is Fine, He Is a Boy!" Said Sitori with a chuckle of triumph. Tamari's face brightenned as it would stretch into a wild grin. "What shall we name him dear?" She'd ask, Looking towards his hands.  "A Strong, Powerful name to Carry own our legacy Tamari, A Name to be remembered through-out the Valtim...Duskrix!" He'd say as he'd look down to the baby with a glimmer in his Eye's.  "That is a great name, Sitori. Now let me see my baby!" Said Tamari in Glee as she'd put out her hands,  Sitori Grinned down at his child, Gently passing him to Tamari, She'd grab a hold gently as she'd pull Kitoki to her chest. Looking down, Her face broke into a gentle smile as she'd begin to whisper to the new born "Duskrix....." She'd say, Wiping her hand across the baby's face. "You will be everything...You will represent the courage and dignity of Kirigakure.." As she'd near his small face, Puckering her lips lightly agaisnt his forehead, She'd pull back. Sitori would come to his wife's side, Wrapping his arm around her, They'd Look to their new born child with a glimmering light in their eyes.

The sands of time flowed slowly, As the young Valtim child grew in both mind and body, his discipline following with this, He enlisted in the ninja academy and  his rightful inauguration into the bussiness was about to commence. The Chunnin Stood at the Podium, Reading down a list of names, His Voice boomed across the academy  as he'd stand at the top of the stairs. At the bottom, Chairs had been set up, Row infront of row with parents sitting in them, Tending to their children.  Somewhere along the center row, A young boy. Maybe 11, swings his feet over the edge of the seat, His face coverd in a large white teethed grin. "Duskrix, Calm down!" shouted his mother as she'd bring her hands to his suit, Fixing the tie on the young boy. "I know, I know Mom. It's just...Im So excited! "He'd say in a loud voice, His smile stretching from ear to ear, While in the distance a name echoed through the hall "Haishin!" . And so, The Black Child rose to his feet. With a grin, Kitoki pointed to Haishin "There's Haishin! I cant believe he made it!" Said Duskrix with a smile,Peering at his childhood companion. Then, As Haishin walked along the sides, Making his way to the podium to put on his head band, Another name echoed through the hall, The Chunnin's voice loud and booming, Allowing the entire hall to hear "And Finally, Duskrix Valtim!" He'd say as his arm jerked upwards, Throwing the list into the sky.  Duskrix leapt into the air, Running towards the podium. He'd tie the headband around his head with a grin, Staring out into the ground, he'd ring his mouth with his hands as he'd shout out "Watch Out Kirigakure's Enemies, Duskrix is a Genin now, And Ready to Kick ass!" He'd say with a smug smile. Poiting outwards as one hand remained at his side, And So, His Story begins*

<br><font color=green>*Miyamoto, Tengoku(Self Proclaimed Savior) says: (Quite.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hayate(Deeksixx) l Given the fact that he had a good enough distance away from Haru to see him preparing his move- that gave him enough time to act accordingly and prepare some sort of a counter.

With that, the two clones shifted into a that of a sprint- each toward seperate destinations the moment he'd confirmed that his opponent was the one that'd be making the initial move. This was more of an attempt to avoid the explosion to say the least. Even if it appeared to just be an attempt to weed them out. Whilst that occued, Hayate himself simply decide to just leap back a good distance to avoid making contact. Though, that seperated him from his companions.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) stared at his explosions, they missed their targest but that didn't matter, at least the battle would get somewhere now. He had no more shurikens or kunai left but he had three smoke bombs left. '' These three smoke bombs are the only weapons I have left in my holster, I will have to use them the right way. '' , he stared at the Bunshin that was the most to the right, that would be his first target.

Haru dashed towards the clone and clenched his fists, he held one of his smoke bombs in his left hand but didn't use it as of yet. The boy attempted to sweep the clone of the floor with a kick and followed with a simple knee to the face to make it turn back into rubble. He kept his attention to both clones, for now the real Hayate didn't matter, he was to far away to get to, and he was to far away to do something to him.*

Given the fact that he had avoided his explosive kunai bullshit. With that, le clone turned to face Haru- noticing that he was moving in. And so, the moment he got in his range- he merely attempted to move out of the way by swiftly turning his body and leaping to the side in an attempt to avoid his attack.

The boy dropped the bomb after ducking to the ground, as he looked closely at the clones position. '' I'll remember that spot and at the moment that the smoke appears I'll strike him.

Harada shot forward with his body, launching his right hand towards the clones gut in an attempt to hit it and do enough damage to destroy it. He would run to the right of the smoke and run out of it afterwards, even if he didn't hit the clone.*

That would entirely fuck up the whole basis of the attack that he had planned with the smoke bomb and such. And so, he merely made the attempt to leap back yet again the moment the smoke bomb hit the ground to get himself out of the smoke and away from Haru. 

While this occured, his other clone simply took the intiative to move in towards his opponent whilst Haru probably would have aimlessly striked at the clone.

<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) jumped to the right side of the smoke to get out, as stated before if he didn't hit anything. ( -.- ) He stared at the clone that jumped out of it and ran towards it, knowing what would happen if he attacked it, the boy aimed for a feint punch to the face, likely the clone would see it as a real one and once again dodge to the back. While the other clone was inside of the smoke and getting further and further away from them.

If the clone did dodge once again then they were likely close enough to get in range with the real Hayate, the boy performed a series of hand seals and charged up chakra inside of his mouth to shoot a blast of water with great speed at him, attempting to hit his opponent, Hayate was likely tired from the jutsu and thus had his movements slowed down.*

<br><font color=green>*Kunsaku, Damien(Prince Robin) says: Sure.
<br><font color=yellow>*Hayate(Deeksixx) l Seeing as how the group was pretty much damn near across the arena, that gave them a good distance away from Hayate. Thus, allowing him to recover while Haru was busy fighting the others. Though, he was paying attention- waiting for whatever might be thrown his way.

Le clone number one decided not to dodge, but instead, he let himself be hit the moment he landed. And seeing as how Haru was busy with that, that gave his other clone enough time to get in and by now the smoke should've probably cleared. So he was fine. 

And so, whilst Haru was busy dealing with one clone and most likely couldn't transition fast enough with out proper perks, the other one took the intiative to attack the moment he got arrange- merely going in for a tackle and following up with that of a submission hold if all went as planned.*

He wouldn't let his clone get hit without a reason, he turned his head to the back and noticed the other clone getting in, he had no time to counter him with an attack himself, all he could do was drop another smoke bomb and try not to get hit.

'' He was able to dodge everytime so as I thought, he sacrificed the first one for the other. '' , he waited for the clone to come or not, likely it would but Haru had no actual plan.

<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) noticed his body being grabbed, he felt the touched around his shoulder and neck, but the moment that happene he moved his head backwards to attempt a headbutt with the back of his head against the clone. On the same time he attempted to hit his right elbow backwards before being put in hold. Through the smoke the clone would likely be unable to even see the attack, and since it was a clone it would also turn to rubble.

Haru would feel feel a great pain to his head and walk out of the smoke through the back, preventing the real Hayate from seeing him. His sight would be be a bit fuzzy but he was still able to fight, though his reflexes were now a bit worse then before.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Hayate(Deeksixx) l Continued making his grip tighter, regardless of the smoke. He could feel Haru trying attack. With that, he pulled up whilst choking him- making the hold worse and atempting to avoid his headbutt with the elbow. All about feeling. But at that, he also aimed a punch for his temple- putting whatever power he had behind that because he clearly didn't give a fuck anymore and is just le writing.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) felt his grip becoming tighter, he pinched an eye while trying to get air, at that moment he performed three handseals to use his last chance this was done before Hayate tried to throw a punch, his cheecks swell up and water filled his mouth, afterwards it was shot out and likely because of the small distance between him and the ground shot his head backwards with force and still made a headbutt that was likely not even possible to defend against without byagukan to see his attack.*

<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( I mean 0:00 maybe that's 12 AM. )
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) checked his holster. He had five kunai, ten shuriken, three Exploding Tags, and two Smoke Bombs. They should come in handy.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) slowly lifts his right hand toward his lip, thumb extended, he'd nip at the center of his thumb, causing blood to slowly drip from the point of impact. He'd then form a chain of handseals exclaiming, "Summoning Jutsu!". Out of a puff of smoke on each of his shoulders, two small slugs would arise, dripping their mucus all over his cloak. He'd then smirk slightly saying, "Go ahead and make your move.". He'd then begin transfering his chakra into each of his slugs as he formed a chain of handseals, his hands were obviously covered by his cloak.*
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( That's whut I say, I say that you guys can pretend I gave up in my next match. )
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( Meaning not yours. )

<br><font color=green>*Hayate(Deeksixx) says: buut in reality u nebber 1 wat dat legit)
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ RPing. ]
<br><font color=green>*Harada, Haru(Dopespruit) says: ( So, cya guys :S Till Tomorow :S )
<br><font color=green>*Miyamoto, Tengoku(Self Proclaimed Savior) says: (Dawn? Kevin?)
<br><font color=green>***Otokage**(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( ^ )
<br><font color=green>***Otokage**(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( Wall = Instalose o-o )
<br><font color=green>***Otokage**(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( <_< jk )
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) mused at how Mizuki began. He had summoned those two slugs again that stood upon his shoulders. Doing this consecutive times was bad variety, and clearly, he would be manipulating a similar strategy to what he did in his preliminaries versus Namano. "Well then. You're offering me the next move then? I won't deny it then. In fact, I graciously accept your offer!" He smacks his right fist into the palm of his left hand. Withdrawing a kunai and spinning it around his middle finger, he gripped it casually with a firm hold. Clearly, he mainly wanted to utilize that kunai for melee purposes. He was one that did not let out any openings in his tactics.

Reaching down with his left hand into his holster, he decided to get some equipment into the named hand's reach. His right hand was already preoccupied with his kunai, his dominant hand being his right and benefitting him if he were in a strength-struggle. He took a smoke bomb, fumbling with his holster for a while. He didn't think Mizuki would make any moves during this period, as honorable as he was in battle. Finally, three shuriken were in his left hand, a smoke bomb resting in the middle.

Quickly, he'd begin his attack. Flinging the smoke bomb right over at Mizuki with all of his might, Irui wanted to hit the ground just right before Mizuki. If it made an impact with the satin floor of the Chuunin Semi-Finals, it'd burst from the seams into purple gaseous clouds. It's color and darkness was focused on decreasing the efficiency of Mizuki's vision, while its texture tried to make it harder to get out of, seeing as it was rougher than a real smoke bomb at some areas. It was like being pecked by small grains of rice while moving through it, and showed that it was manually brewed, so the entire thing was not mixed in a fine powder. With those three shuriken he had, he flung them with precision into the smoke, at where Mizuki WOULD be. He wasn't focusing on his entity when he had last seen him. He figured Mizuki, being the evasive and elusive one, would either jump out of the smoke, or raise his guards in defense, trusting and abiding in his abnormal physical strength. He flung on shuriken above the cloud. It was moving slow, but it was very sharp, so it could still embed itself into one's being if made contact with it. In fact, saying it was slow was overestimation. It was slow in shuriken-throwing standards, moving as fast as a giant shuriken. 

It was angled so that it would fall down from the sky and try to slam into the ground where Mizuki's actual entity was standing at the time where he had thrown the Smoke Bomb. The other two shuriken were aimed to the right and left of Mizuki, incase he were to move to the left or the right. Finally, Irui jumped into the air, in order to get more vision of the battlefield. Make your move.*

<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ This is really a basic attack. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Yes. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ And except from in front of you. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ There's also a smoke  bomb impairing vision. ]
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) smirks as the cloud of smoke appears, he'd exclaim, "Fire Style!: Misty Flames Dance! Ninja Art: Fire Run!". Each of the slugs resting on his shoulder would inhale deeply, channeling the recieved Fire Chakra into their lungs, the first Slug would exhale a mist-like highly flammable gas out into the open, enveloping most of the area, mostly focused around Mizuki and Irui, the other slug would exhale a bright flame in the shape of a funnel, as it collided with the gas, it'd explode into an enormous raging flame headed toward Irui.  He'd then leap forward, evading the shuriken coming from the sky, also the one soaring toward him from the front as they approached. Mizuki would use the distraction of the giant flame and smoke to form the handseals for his next jutsu.*
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Slugs are using fire style? ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ I thought YOU used the Fire Style. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Holy SHIT. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Those are some MONSTROUS Slugs. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ Oh. ]
<br><font color=green>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) says: [ RPing. ]
<br><font color=yellow>*Rikushou, Irui(ZenoKuthric) smiled. Well of course Mizuki wasn't slacking. This huge Fireball greatly resembled the one he had faced from Narusegawa's opposition. Her Goukakyuu was quite the fearsome opponent, yes it was. But, he had developed a way to avoid it. He clasped both of his hands together, pointing towards the ground. "GALE PALM!" He jumped RIGHT before he used it, allowing what you would name as a 'Super Jump' to happen. He avoided the humongous flame, although his legs were inflicted with a raging heat, and it burned the back his pants slightly. Backflipping in mid air, he executed his hand seals.

"Rat. Ox. Ram. Monkey. Horse!" 

He lodged chakra in the middle of his throat, accollecting his chakra in an amass. He took a deep breathe. The oxygen, instead of entering his respiratory system though, transfused with the chakra inside of his throat. He compressed the oxygen balls that formed in his throat with his experience of compression. This chakra held tthe balls in smaller balls than usual, greatly decreasing their volume. However, when this chakra was let go, aka when he released the balls, the bursts would grow right back into their full size.

"FUUUUUUUUUUUUTON. AAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRR BULLLLLLLLEEEEET."

And like Shukaku, he began to rain down Air Bullets. Two in total. About the size of Katon Goukakyuus.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) widens his eyes as the enormous orbs of pressurized wind soared toward him, He'd dash toward safety as the two orbs collided with the ground, but the pressure of the impact would send him crashing into the wall, he'd slow slide down the wall as he said, "Not bad...guess it's my turn..". He'd then dash toward Irui, leaping into the air, channeling his chakra into the slug on his left shoulder, the other would begin channeling it's own. Mizuki would then form a chain of handseals exclaiming, "Prepared Needle Shot!". He'd slick back his sleeve revealing his senbon shooter, and the left slug would open it's mouth, each launching 10 senbon at a nearly point blank range, the other launching a pressurized stream of acid toward Irui's chest.*
