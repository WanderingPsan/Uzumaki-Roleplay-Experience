So if the clones had kept up with the stream of mud, it would seem pointless in the matter.

But as it was stopped the stinger would have removed itself from the ground, and in conjuction with the removal of the stinger would come a black fast moving object that would bum rush Kuro and his otther clone, ramming him agaisnt the wall before he could even get enough sand to put the creature in a coffin. And with the little light within the area the only thing that could be seen about the thing that attacked Kuro, so even if he could get sand out of the gourd he couldn't even gague how much he would need to incase the creature.

Then with Kuro and the clone being pressed up agaisnt the wall with a violent force, the clone would have been destroyed and turned into sticky mud. And while the clone had deformed, Kuro would have felt a somehting bite into his leg. And within a few seconds he'd feel his reaction time and movements to be sluggish.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shiba, Takiji(Kizuzan12) held his chakra bow out with one hand. Bringing his free hand towards the arrow rest as he channels chakra towards the palm of his hand. Then creating a ball of chakra and allowed it to touch the bow. He then pulls back on the chakra, making it longer and thinner to the point it had looked like a bolt arrow. Once it was fully drawn back, he sent a burst of chakra towards his the balm of his hand. Causing the arrow to fly forward at a large amount of velocity. Pericing through the tree and slamming right into the village wall.* - Sat Dec 12 13:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shiba, Takiji(Kizuzan12) held his bow down and walked over towards the hole that his chakra arrow had made. "Not bad not bad.... Though my chakra can't take that many uses of it......." he said to himself softly, before backing up from the tree and taking his original spot again. He'd then once again lift up his bow and aim it towards the tree. Channeling chakra into his free hand and making a ball of chakra. Then pressing that chakra against the Chakra bow, and then pulling back on the chakra untill it became longer and thinner. Then once it was completly drawn, he'd release it with a burst of chakra. Causing the arrow to spiral throw the air and peirce through the tree once more.* - Sat Dec 12 14:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shiba, Takiji(Kizuzan12) kept his bow held up and aimed at the tree as he was going to preform the jutsu once more. Applying chakra towards the palm of his hands and making a ball of chakra. Then taking that ball of chakra and applying it onto the chakra bow's arrow rest. Then pulling back on the ball of chakra, making it longger and thinner as he pulled it back. Making the ball of chakra turn into a bolt like arrow. Then once it was fully drawn back, he sent forth the chakra arrow with a burst of chakra. Sending it racing towards the tree at high speed, allowing it to tear through it with easy. Creating a thrid hole within the tree side.* - Sat Dec 12 14:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shiba, Takiji(Kizuzan12) took his bow and placed it onto his back, allowing it to rest on a magnetic plat on his back. Then with both of his hands free, Takiji brought both of his hands together and preformed the tiger handseal. With that, he channeled his chakra through out both of his legs as he  started to burst out into a run. The chakra then accelerated Takiji's speed and allowed him to run at a faster rate then he would have originaly. Then after he got to a certaint point, he came to a stop and began to feel dizzy and off balance. This was due to him not being use to being at that fast at all to the point that his body couldn't keep up with its self.* - Sat Dec 12 14:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shiba, Takiji(Kizuzan12) shook his head a bit as he waited for his body to regain its balance and corrdination. Then after recovering from the jutsu, he brought his hands together once more and preformed the tiger handseal. Channeling his chakra towards both of his legs as he began to run. Allowing him to run at a faster rate then how he would have ran if he didn't use this jutsu. Once he came to a stop, Takiji started to wobble back and forth as he tried to regain his balance once more. Filling dizzy to the point he was seeing three of everything.* - Sat Dec 12 14:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shiba, Takiji(Kizuzan12) fell onto his hands and knees and allowed himself to recoperate from the constant dizzyness he keeps getting after using the ninjutsu. Only to throw up onto the the floor. But after he finished throwing up, he stood back up and wiped his mouth a bit. "Wow that took a tole on me......" he thought to himself, before shruging it completly off and continue to train himself. He brought his hands together again, and preformed the tiger handseal. Channeling his chakra towards both of his legs and brusted off into a srpint. But witht he aid of the jutsu, he went even faster then he would have normaly in a straight line.  Once he came to a stop, Takiji wobbled his way towards a near by tree for support before he would throw up again on the floor. Allowing himself to recover afterwards from the jutsu before he moved back to his other ninjutsu.* - Sat Dec 12 15:13:26 2015
