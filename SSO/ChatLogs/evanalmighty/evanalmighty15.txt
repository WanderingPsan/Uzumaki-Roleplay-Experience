<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) Standing up on the wall near the outsides of the Hokage Mansion  he'd begin to remove remove his cloak, as toss it behind him off onto the roof, as he'd begin to remove his hand as he'd keep that in his hands as he'd look down at the cloaked man. "An Uchiha clan memeber huh? I thought you guys no longer exsisted? but for a ninja that skilled in the art of fireball jutsu, and the third level of sharingan you're more than the average criminal aren't you?".*

<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) He was casually walking up to the seen, hoping to find Lord Hokage. "Hopefully he'll stay true to his word!" Alastor thought, as a large smile crossed his face. He saw a series of people in the distance, wondering what was going on. "Hmm...might want to check that out," he said as quickened his pace, a seriouse look now crossing his face.

When he arrived on the scene, his first thought was there was a fight going on. He saw the blackened ground, and Lord Hokage facing a man whom Alastor had never seen before. "What the hell..." He mumbled to himself, back up a few steps and preparing his guard.*

<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) "I've always wondered what it's like to fight an Uchiha Clan Memeber, and just for this occasion i've been saving this technique". He'd spread his legs apart as he'd clapse his hands together as he ran down the wall he was standing on, perfectly commiting his chakra to his feet, as he'd ran down weaving a barrage of hand seals in matter of a few seconds focusing his chakra. Then after landing to the ground, he burst off in a agile speed with his arms dangling behind him as he'd ran foward toward Seithin, as he reached into his back weapon pouch, as he commenced with flicking out 5 shuriken toward Seithin Gringe.*

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (Lol the fall of the which Hokage am I?)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (1st 2nd?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (2nd)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (Yeah im the second)
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) smirks as he makes three handseals. "Edo Tensai!" He exclaims as he slams the ground. All of a sudden a large coffin would appear. It would take the shuriken being thrown at Seithin. They would embed into it. As he continues to run, a girl with white hair would suddenly launch out of the Coffin. This girl "Rose" Would swing her rather large sword, aimed directly at the Hokage's throat. Since he was running straight towards it he would have an -extremely- hard time avoiding the quick moving dead girl.*
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (oh shit)
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: (^.)

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (This negro has Sharingan, and the Edo Tensai goddamnit)
<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) As he ran moving foward he found it surprising that an Uchiha clan member could raise the dead with the Edo Tensai Jutsu "Impossible!". With his attempt at dodging the sword's attack he'd  stop in his tracks sliding against the tyrain of the ground, as he'd do a slight jump back getting hopefully getting away just in a split second of time to avoid the strike with the sword, as he'd then attempt to do a roundhouse kick to use his longest weapon against her trying to kick Rose into the her chest trying to send her chest, before she had enough time for her next swing, as he'd try kicking her through her coffin into the cloaked Uchiha man.*

<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Not gonna lie...Forgot how to change the background on Profile's again...)
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) leaps over the coffin as the attack is thrown at the girl. As the Hokage kicks out his leg, Seithin lets loose the chakra he had been building up and does five quick handseals. "Katon: Great Fireball!!" He says as he releases an assload of of chakra. The Fireball that he releases is so large that it even singes his clothing a bit. The Katon: Great Fireball is aimed directly at the Hokage. At this distance there is very little room for moving out of the way. There are three jutsu that are able to block a skill of this power at this range. And the Hokage wasn't a user of any of them.*

<br><font color=green>*Gendou(CodyShuffle) says: [Comere]
<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) With his immense mastery in handseals he could maybe easily output the number the output of seals that the Uchiha could probably do, as the Uchiha jumped up, from using the hand seals he used earlier after landing his kick he jerks his body foward as he brings his hands to his chest in the tiger seal form, as he' leans his head back inhales through his chest mustering up enough chakra himself as  exhaled, while holding one of his hands still up in the tiger position near his mouth as released a fireball as a well trying to cancel the other fireball out or possibly overpower into burning the Uchiha himself as the flames were so hot, and close that he instantly began to sweat do the intense heat of the two fireballs possibly clashing. Still at the same time Seithin, and Gringu would both yell at the same time "Katon Goukakyuu No Jutsu"!*
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( Just so you know. I just won. You started this at 33% Chakra. I started at70%. We both have monstrous chakra. GG )

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (if u started with 70 you'd be down to thirty too after a fireball)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) says: ( ...If I dropped to thirty..from 70..and u used the -same- jutsu..youd die from chakra loss )

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: (This was  a set up -_-)
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Gringu(Jack Lyzerg) smirks as the idiot attempts to use the same jutsu against him. He forces his chakra into the attack. He puts the last 25% of chakra he is willing to put in. The two attacks would cause a huge explosion. As this happens the Edo'ed Girl "Rose" Would run from around the back of the Hokage. She would then Send a huge blow directly at the Hokage from behind. She would aim directly for his neck hoping to cut his head clean from his body.*

<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) In his defense of canceling out the fireball, his chakra resolves became extremely low, as he fell to the ground on his knees from exhaustion of chakra, not thinking that the Shadow Clone Jutsu would take up so much chakra from his body. His hands on the ground as the girl attempts to come, and cleave his head off from behind.  Just getting a strange feeling that someone was behind him, trying his best to do what he could he attempts to stand up, turning around, as he'd attempt to try, and attempted to duck again, as he'd try turning his body in a complete spin motion as he'd attempt to trip the girl, as he attempt to jump back few feet as beads of sweat rolled down his face.*

<br><font color=yellow>***Hokage**(Rahie) Noticing the two Kunai Knives heading straight foward him he'd attempt to reach into his back pouch flicking his wrist in the direction of the Kunai, with two shuriken as they'd probably reflect off, off each other canceling each other, as he'd land back onto the ground with his arms hanging loosely, as he began to pant from fatigue.*

As he would land she would immediately strike at his throat with the sword. Since it's impossible to throw shuriken, fall, and change direction all at the same time, this would seem like the best choice of attack.*

<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Some dude..
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: In a cloak.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: He was at the Chunnin Exams
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I think...
<br><font color=yellow>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) suddenly leaps backwards a single step. She makes the Nara Clan's handseal and focuses her chakra. She then forces her shadow to extend. It would quickly race along the outer edge of the room. It would then quickly shoot around silently and unseen from behind Seidou. It would quickly reach him and since he probably had a very small amount of information on the clan he wouldn't know what to expect.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (.)
<br><font color=green>***Raikage**(Mrs.Pepper) says: Red Clouds ?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Si---
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>***Raikage**(Mrs.Pepper) says: Hyuuga
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes Raikage...?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I-I can't move...?
<br><font color=green>***Raikage**(Mrs.Pepper) says: Prepare yourself.
<br><font color=green>***Raikage**(Mrs.Pepper) says: And find someone to lead...fast.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: HELP!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I'm fine...Anything that happens will be dealt with...
<br><font color=green>***Raikage**(Mrs.Pepper) says: This isnt good at all
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I've been poisoned!
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: ( Waitin on Trin's RP )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Sigh....
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Same.)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: What is this poison....Was I cut...?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Don't think so...
<br><font color=yellow>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) walks into the mansion hoping to blend in with the crowd. He would then brush his hair back as if he were apart of the group casually. He would then analyze each and every person in the room, so he could write down their appearances and abilities. Shun would then think "Being a spy isnt so great...." with a scroll in his hand he would continue to write.

He noticed a jounin talking he would then think "He must be the new leader here...Or just the lead Jounin...Hmmm." He looked to the girl who seemed to be performing a handseal and saw her shadow extend thinking "Heh interesting...What an interesting group."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) clenches her fist in anger, she could not stand the downtalking of the Hokage by the young boy. She placed her right palm facing towards Sei, and her left palm faced herself, perfoming her unique one handed seal jutsu, she was about to fuck his shit back. Her anger overcame her as she yelled, "Mind Desctruction Jutsu...", sending her chakra in towards Sei, allowing her complete control over his body without projecting her own mind. Once controling his body, she attempted to make him pull out a kunai from his holster and slit his own throat, punishment for talking about the Hokage in such ways that he did. *
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: ( You wouldnt see it Shun )
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (True now that I think about it)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Oh em gee)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Omit that part about seeing the shadow)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Slit my own throat? Isn't that a little drastic o-o)
<br><font color=yellow>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) releases her hold on the boy as she realizes that her partner had activated her jutsu.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ....BOTH OF YOU ENOUGH!
<br><font color=yellow>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) stops at the sound of Evan's voice.*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: W-what was that for...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: There has already been enough blood shed, and kid you are lucky I spared your life.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Why was I about to stab myself...?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: If this kid says anything bad about the former Hokage again, he won't live t see tommorow.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Disrespect the fallen Hokage one more time and I will personally end you....
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: lol anyone realise this can be my ic way for coping with his Death?)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: o-o)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Bitch please.)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: That guy was a little bitch.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: And you are?
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (Im loling really hard right now, Imagine if this was IRL)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (That being from in a crowd holy shit)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: I'm nobody really.

<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (*3's)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (not hard to pinpoint the projectory of someones voice from behind me)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (But it'ld be obvous it's coming from someone out of this group.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^)
<br><font color=green>*Shun of the Red Sand(Shun512) says: (I didnt say it wasnt)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I was just stating the Village code...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: The Mission was to kill the man.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: And he failed...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I didn't mean to harm anyone.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: By my words.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: I hope you can understand
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then learn sympathy and keep your damn mouth shut.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Don't let it happen again.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Since..
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: .No one in the village can help me.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Can I request outside help?
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Q_Q faec)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Help in...?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (brb)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You guys obviously hate me.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: In Trainign.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Training*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You guys hate me...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: And you know nothing about me..
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Typical.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I don't hate anyone, but insulting the dead will trigger people's rage.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You don't even know my name.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because you have yet to introduce yourself.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: No need to.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You'd reject me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Believe what you want kid....
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: My brother is right...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: This village is Biased..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Biased on what? You are the one who is forcing yourself away.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You'll never understand...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Its no reason to preach to deaf ears...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because you don't try to let people understand.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You are the one who is hindering yourself not me.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Death is to be expected as a Shinobi..
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Still it is heavy on the hearts of others.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: And now you change the subject of our conversation...
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: It has all been about death.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: But you're deaf to the subjected.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You have been protected from the truth.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Even now the words which speak the truth will not reach your deaf ears.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Protected from the truth...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, oh that is rich kid. You obviously have no idea who you are dealing with.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: You really know nothing...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: And you assume something you have no grasp of.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: *sigh*
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: If the Village cannot assist me in my furtherment.
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Then I will look elsewhere.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Alright gaiz, I'm off X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: Though I will not be a rouge.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Be on in 3 hours or so X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: But I'd be useless with no training...

<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: Sir, don't you think it would be beneficial to the village...If you appointed a new Jonin?
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: Who would you recommend for Jonin?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (what village should I make my doujutsu originate from?)

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (im thinking)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (in order to limit my doujutsu, it should have stages like the sharingan right?)
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: ( mhm )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (okay)
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: ( But it need not be awakened like it )

<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: No...
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: I don't think so.
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: The Raikage knows.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: I'll personally deliver the news..
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Clayr(Wynokx) says: Alright...

<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (what if my character doesnt get into a single fight before she becomes chunnin? then wtf is so battlehardended about her?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (hardened*)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (nothing)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (It also makes no sense for a Genin to be experienced in battle like that.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Most Genin never fight.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (Kakashi was lolexperienced)

<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (And you don't have to =.=)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Okay? Average means nothing so should I lolremake?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (apparently avarage is better than battlehardened)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Lolwut.)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (I never said that ever.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (idk xD)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (I said it won't take affect until Chunin.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (but that stil doesnt make sense if i dont get into any fights icly)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (then i might as well be average)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (What fights are you going to really get into that will battle harden you?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (then wtf is the point of the trait? just to be there? )
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (so what your saying is)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (What the fuck is the point of Average?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (by the time i become chunnin or jounin)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (i will have lolfought a bunch of battles icly that didnt even happen?)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (By the time you become Chunin or Jonin you should ICly have fought enough ngrs.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (icly aint gonna make the cut)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (i dont loldo things icly unless its legit)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (also)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Other then the Konoha 11 and other ngrs that were Genin who got spotlight what other Genin lolfought ngrs to become so battle hardened?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (idk but anyway)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (if I should have fought enough battles before chunnin and jounin)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (then why isnt everyone else battlehardened?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (it only makes sense)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (your a jounin, im sure youve fought alot of battles icly)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Ask Wynny why he even put it as a perk honestly.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (its a trait not a perk >.>)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (*Trait)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (I honestly don't see any point in it RPly or ICly for anyone who isn't a starter.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (its probably for a Kakuzu scrub)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (since he bragged about his experience in battle all the time)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Cause dat ngr is like 90 years old.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (then ill make my genin 20 GG)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Fine do whatever you want X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (no)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (im not gonna loldo whatever i want)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (i just dont see whats the problem with a genin having a hard life before graduating the academy)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Battlehardened means you've been in tons of LOD fights.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (thats like never going to happen icly)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Not having a hard life, anyone can lolhard life so does that mean they are battle-hardneed?)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (cuz shit dont happen here)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (so the trait might as well be void)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Bring it up with Wynny.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (fine)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (I didn't put it in nor did I give it as a suggestion X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (>_> if you didnt put it in, then how are you lolsaying you have to be chunnin)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Because Wynny agreed with it when he, Alister, and I were talking about what the traits do and when they activate.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (oh)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (but still, wouldnt make sense since I really wont even get into a LOD fight before I become chunnin icly j/s)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (so i might as well remake)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Sigh.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (it just doesnt make sense to me)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (and plus im not a starter so)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (ya)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (.-.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (the trait is pretty much void)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (I'mma laugh if you get it again.)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (i would RQ)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Q.Q)
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: (jk xd)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: So...Any news...?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I told to Amekage to stay out of the village because of the recent attacks we have been having.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Also, the Amekage seems to be hiding some kind of power from the great nations.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: He would not reveal to me what it was.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: But it could be a threat to the village if used.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: Hm...Any news on who the assassin was?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: No...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: But whoever this 'sharingan' user is, I believe I know what he may be after.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: Tch.....And what is that?
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I mean, just look at it. He attacked the Amekage and failed, then he attacked the Hokage and killed him. While fighting he brought back a dead ninja to life and made her fight... He is collecting the Five Kage's bodies to use them in battle....
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I suggest you send some backup to Kirigakure for Misaki my Lord.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: Speaking of bodies..The best way to deal with that would be to cremate the previous Hokage's body...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I don't think it would matter.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I don't think he 'needs' his body.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Or else he would have taken it.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: True...But as a precation...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: He probably only needs his DNA, which he could have easily aqcuired in battle.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Hmm?
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (precaution*)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: It would be better to destroy the body...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Yes, I know.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Then we shall.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: Good...
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: Next time this sharingan user shows up, I am going after him.
<br><font color=green>*Yamanaka, Suzy(Trinity606) says: I may need some back up.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: He has enough to kill a Kage...I'ld suggest you bring to others as support.

<br><font color=green>*Syounara, Seidou(Jjking218) says: People live their lives bound by what they accept as correct and true. That's how they define "reality". But what does it mean to be "correct" or "true"? Merely vague concepts their "reality" may all be a mirage. Can we consider them to simply be living in their own world, shaped by their beliefs?

<br><font color=green>*Akira(Dragon33) says: (Done)
<br><font color=green>*Akira(Dragon33) says: (Post?)
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar)
<br><font color=yellow>*Akira(Dragon33) had a playful soul, he wasn't one to always have pint up rage and anger, releasing it on whom ever crossed his path. Instead he jolefully went around spreading the idea of love and peace, his free personality something his clan did not take to lightly. Akira was apart of a noble family, and he must act as such, the time for fun and games unapplicable. So, the intense training began, his happy go lucky nature attempted to be supressed.

Akira would have hit the ground with a large thud, his eyes narrowing before tightly shutting, a brash wince coming across his face as he rubbed his buttox. "Aye aye aye!" he cried over and over, rolling across the wooden floor as his father simply glared down at him and sighed. "Get up Akira....." he said with a sort of monotone manner, his arms folded within his oversized robe. "Alright alright~!" the young boy cried, swiftly hopping to his feet and flashing a toothy grin up at his father, something he did often for no reason. Akira was a short boy, even for the age of 8. His skin could be depicted as fairly peach, but not pale in any sort. He had soft white hair that spiked to the right side of his face almost perfectly, giving him a sort of innocent impression with all those who have met him, little did they know he was a trouble maker, and loved to do so. 

"No more games Akira!" his father bellowed, a large vein now bulging at the side of his temple, flaring just slightly, an obvious sign that he was indeed a bit angry. "I want you to stay here and practice the technique until you get it right, understood?!" he shouted, his voice sending a powerful echoe throughout the rather bland room, Akira malignly sticking his fingers into his ears so that he could dull the sound of the voice. "U-understood!" he said abruptly, his positon suddenly shifting, his eyes widening. 

Whilst spinning on his heel to face the opposing diretion of his father, Akira would mutter a rather airy word, a bit ticed tht he had to train instead of play like all the other children his age. Quickly, the boy would drop down into the Hyuuga clans fighting position, his right arm outstretched but bent ever so slightly, his hand opened so that his palm would face the air infront of him, his fingers tightly placed against eachother as his thumb curled inward just a miniscule amount. His body was now placed a tadbit sideways, his other arm now tucking itself closer in towards his gut but leaving a well sized gap, this hand also open palmed. "Hyah!" the young boy suddenly roared, taking out his right foot and slamming it onto the wooden floor before him, moving a pace just slightly so that he could bring his left arm out and strike at the air, his index and middle fingers now outstretched so that he striked at the imaginary tenketsu before him. With this the hyuuga would simply spin on the tip of his toes, leaning most of his weight forward so that the spin weight placed on his toes would only add to the speed of the spin, the full 180 motion now in effect. Once the spin was complete, he would crouch slightly and throw both his palms out at the air, connecting his arms at the wrist so he slammed into his "targets" chest, a fatal blow that could end a match in seconds. To his dismay however, he stumbled and tripped, falling to his knees right infront of his father whom had simply shook his head in shame and walked out the door. Akira was left sitting there, looking like nothing more than a fool.

So, his resolve, was to complete the task, no matter what others think of it, though to him, his fathers opinion mattered the most, so he picked himself back up, weary of failure and pushed on, aiming to train his body to its limit, aiming to actually please his father. *
