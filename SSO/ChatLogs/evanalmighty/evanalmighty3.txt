<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Its called strategy)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( It does Evan )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Wiki doesn't say Will can break it.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It's a Ninjutsu not a Gen.)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (No it doesn't)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Its strategy)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( eh urite )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( kay. One second )
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (did u guys rp?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) reached into her holster and pulled out three shuriken to throw at the Raikage while Evan was using his jutsu. It was only to throw her off while Evan did his jutsu and possibly aid with it working.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I used Temp Paralysis Technique on Wynny.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (So can I PR?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Or wait for Wynny.)'
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Hmmmm)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Waiting)
<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) smirks as she makes another ram seal. This time instead of dissappearing, her body is covered in a aura of lightning chakra. She literally dashes at Kurina as she does so. The jutsu catches her as she is a mere four inches away from her. "Heh, got me." She says smirking.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) looked quickly between the targets infront of himself. "They attacked you?"he whispered curiously as he looked upon the girl wearing the diplomatic uniform. "She's obviously the strongest...the other two seems like servants..."he'd think as he proccessed the thoughts quickly before raising his right hand upwards slowly infront of himself. "Heh where do you think your going?!"He shouted them truly curious, though a hint of cockiness could be heard within his voice. "You can't start a fight and then just leave!" Once saying so a river of blackened sand was released from the top of his gord quickly flowing infront of himself suspended.

Once the sand was out of its container Sotokon smirked as a collection of 5 rods shot foreward from the river of suspended sand infront of Sotokon twoard Cheren at an immense speed.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (LOL)

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (lul)
<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) is totally unharmed by the bitch sand. She grunts and spits up a bit of blood as the shuriken stab her through the gut. "Heh, such a welcome.." She says smiling.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Get that Super Genin shit outta here.)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Are you stupid..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Now then.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: If she dies...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Unseal me.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Than your chakra will be sealed forever.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: (Would that require Shape Manip training?)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I'm not killing her.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Obviously.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: At this rate. She'll die.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (IT would require chakra control which the ngr has never been trained in.)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No she won't....
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: You just peirced her chest wide open.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (I have been trained)

<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: *gut
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: The shuriken are in her stomach.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Its the second level of Elemental training)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Why don't you look instead of speaking.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Lol Malcolm, you don't auto-master Chakra Control.)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: Yes..I know.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: But still.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: It's not that fatal.
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: The stomach is worst.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Manipulator means I can control my Iron sand well)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: It could be fatal.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Anyway.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Which is a certain chakra req.)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: If not treated.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Unseal me.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Dude no matter how much you bitch)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Your not gonna nerf me)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: How the hell did his shuriken cut through.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It doesn't mean you can sustain the shape and be able to pierce Lightning Armor.)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: My my iron sand didn't.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (WTF)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Shuriken breaks though?)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (But my Iron sand doesn't)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (This is BS)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (lul)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( Iron sand = Sand + Chakra. The chakra holds it together )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( shuriken = Real Steel )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (No)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (IRon sand is real iron)

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( smfh )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: Then why can't it break through?)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (>.>)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (If a fuckin weaker shruiken can)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( It splatters as the chakra is disrupted )
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( sand doesnt lolpierce )
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: If you can't unseal me... Then you will stay here until you find a way too..
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Disrupted by what?)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( The fucking Raiton no yoroi )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (CHeren)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( -_- )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Distracted by sand causing opening in armor.)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (It pierces)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (GG)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (Have you seen Naruto Shippuden?)
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [This is stupid.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( ^ )
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (I'm not saying it could break through Raiton No Yoroi)
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( Then stfu )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Have you seen Lightning armor never being fully explained?)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (But it makes no sense)
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: (For shuriken to make it through)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) walks over towards Cheren, staring at her for a quick second, the samehada casually rested upon her right shoulder as she held its hilt firmly in hand. ".....Unseal her chakra...." she said calmly, staring her directly in the eyes, her crimson daggers all but soothing. *
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>*Eiyu Hart(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: [Why are you arguing, when you already lost and you can't take it back.]
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Do I have to?

<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: First I have to -learn- how to do that.
<br><font color=green>*Sotokon(Malcolm1rock) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Then I have to prepare the jutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: Ugh! So much work..
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........

<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: It also takes time to increase chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: Oh well.
<br><font color=green>*Akasen, Nero(OmniKage) says: Can we go now?
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: It takes time to make new jutsu...

"I need to get that shuriken..."he'd be thinking to himself as he something must be special about that shuriken to break through an techniuque that stoped his Iron Sand. "Hrm..."he'd grunt as he placed his hand upon Karina's shoulder after hearing she was the Mizukage. "Then if your the Mizukage you should leave now. Mizukage's shouldn't be fighting in petty battles like this."he'd explain as his sand would begin to develop around his ankles preparing to remove the young mizukage from the battle.*

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Suicides*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: .....I guess it makes sense, I am expendable due to not being apart of this village hahahaha.

<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I should be fine.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Your advisor can protect you as well Mizukage...

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You any good at tracking...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Not from this far...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: But My blade can sniff out high chakra sources.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Dont think it will be able to do it at such a distanc though...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and closed his eyes, his veins protruding as he activated his clan's eyes. He then said "I can have my eyes like this for about a day..Then I'm useless for awhile so we need to get moving fast..."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Nod*...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: We'll make camp in a few hours...Sun is going down soon.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Alright..Here is a good place to rest...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Nod*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) closed his eyes once more, the veins retracting as his eyes returned to their life-less state, reaching into his holster he grabbed a scroll and said "I always seal away a nap-sack..." Setting it on the ground he unravled it and began a few short seals, stomping on the scroll a smoke enveloped it and a nap-sack appeared.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm.
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would ram the tip of her samehada into the grass beside her, plopping down on the floor with a large sigh. *
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You alright...You are really silent now..
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm.....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Thinking....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: About...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Life.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: It seems to be going by extremely fast....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: How so...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Though...people should cherish it more cause they will never know when life will slip away from them..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: You understand?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hey...I'm sorry about what happened at my house, I drank a little too much and yeah...Sorry...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: What...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You don't remember..?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Not really....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: It sounds like something awkward..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I fell back from too much drinking and pulled you down ontop of me...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ......Oh now I rmember....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: but I think I fell asleep after that...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I think..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You did...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Ohh.....I dont usually drink either...sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: It's fine...I actually enjoyed it.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (back)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ............You enjoyed it?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Are you saying...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: N-never mind..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Tell me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would blush slightly shaking her head in refusal towards Evan*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: What's with that blush...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Nothing..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Tell me...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Nope..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: C'mon...Pleeeeeaaaaassssseeee~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Nope..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: How do I force it out of you...Hrm...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled as he turned toward her and said "I can always torture you...." He pushed himself up and attempted to tackle her down, if he succeeded he would pin her down and await a response.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (AFK for like 10-20 minutes X,x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: Evan)
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: were u sealed to??)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply have gotten pinned down, her eyes closed this whole time which left her vulnarable. "........What are you trying to do?"she asked softly*
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: Evan you slut)
<br><font color=green>*Nakimura, Zen(Jjking218) says: U there?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (He isnt)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Baaack)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Wb o-O)_
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Had to go all the way to Downtown to pick up my buddy x.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Why is Alister here...?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Der)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...I'm trying to get you to open up and tell me what's up with you blushing.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Well its not working haha...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and forced his face closer to her's eyeing her up as he said "Oh really..It's making you talk more than you normally do..." He then smirked down to her awaiting a response.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Bacxk)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would avert her face to the side, trying to avoid eye contact as the blush began to grow even more."Eh What ever!~" she chimed, giving a short laugh. "Your lucky im in a good mood!" she said sharply, acting it off as if she was angry*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I wish I got my car....)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I have to use my moms all the time xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Meh, I have to pay insurence, gas, and other shit for mine X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Lmao)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (How old are u?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (19 X.x I be living on mah own C.c)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (OMG lucky)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (XD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Not even.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (U get lonely or something :<?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Nah, I got a room-mate but my house be costing so much money X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (awww xD)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (its always about the money smh)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I wish things didnt cost so damn much these days)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and gave her a quick peck on the cheek as he said "Okay little miss sassy...Whatever you say..." He pushed himself off her and stretched as he held his smile.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (So do I X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I only have another year until im able to move out)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (ABLE)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Dont think I will though)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (until I find a better)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Job)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I got kicked out so X.x but I suggest staying for as long as you can and bank all your money.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (lol)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I dont wanna move out tht bad)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (xD)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I <3 my mom/brother XD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply lay on the floor, her heart racing as her crimson eyes stared up at the sky above. Everything usddenly went blank, she passed out. Her limp body would simply lie on the same exact spot*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...Eh...?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and walked over to where she laid, crouching down he placed his arms under her and lifted her up. Walking over toward his nap-sack he laid her down on it and said "Gee...Such a weird woman..." He then squatted down and propped her head up, placing the pillow under her head he moved back and folded his arms.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ...........
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would come to rather quickly, jumping to her feet and staring about, quickly walking over towards samehada and grabbing at its hilt, lifting it and tossing it over her shoulder, playing it off like nothing had happened at all. "We must find the raikage and subdue her quickly..." she said softly, turning off towards the opposing direction of Evan. "This is criticle....."*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Eh hold up, what's up with you now...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: What do you mean...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You are all ready to get up and go...And what's up with passing out like that?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I was..light headed....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: But Come on....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: That doesnt matter!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Nope, come here.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: We have to find the raikage!
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: My mizukage is counting on us.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I gotta see if there is something wrong with you...So c'mere.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Walks over towards Evan*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: HUrry now!
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) reaches out and attempts to grab her face, if successful he would pull her face closer to his and stare into her eyes. This was all to see if her pupils were dialated and if he would have to force her to go home.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply stare over at Evans eyes, her heart racing still but she had a grip on herself this time. "See...nothing wrong..." for she was indeed perfectly fine..*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and patted her on the top of her head as he said "Yep, nothing wrong with you...Hm...Guess it was just a heat flash..." He released her face and stretched once more, then formed a simple seal as the nap-sack disappered back into the scroll, crouching down he picked it up and placed it in his jacket.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Any idea of where the village would be...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (We gotta find dem D:)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: No idea...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I honestly have no idea where she could have gone...Her speed is phenominal so she could be countries away....

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I have to confess...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: About earlier....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I didnt pass out because of the heat...or anything....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Oh?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Clears throat*...
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply start rubbing her temple. unable to say what needed to be said*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: C'mon don't be shy now.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: This is harder than it seems....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I cant say it....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *SIGHS*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then show through action?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Even worse..
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Im so embarassed....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: C'mon, you're a Jonin nothing is too difficult.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Aghhhh....
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I can't do it...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and walked up to her as he said "Write it down...?"*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ........
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Have a piece of paper..?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Over by the dresser.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: And a writing tool
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ??
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Pen should be next to the paper.
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) walks over to the dresser, writing something down upon the peice of paper with a pen, after writing it she would hand the piece of paper over to evan with a sigh. The paper read. "I sort of...like you."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) grabbed the paper and scanned the five words, moving he gaze back up he said "So...You passed out from embarrassement..." He moved closer to her and said "Wonder what would happen if I did this...." He then opened his arms and wrapped them around her back, pulling her in for a hug as he kissed her forehead.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have suddenly found herself being embraced by evan,her heart almost skipping a beat as she was pulled in closer towards him.  Then, after the hug came the kiss once more, the woman this time however didnot pass out but simply grinned, enjoying this exchange. "Hn.." she chimed, a bit caught off gaurd, absolutely melting within his arms. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) chuckled a little as he said "So no heat flashes huh...." He scooped her up in his arms and said "Maybe I can get you to pass out with this!" He quickly moved his face to hers and planted a small peck on her lips, then another this time holding the kiss longer then previously.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply been caught off gaurd by the kiss on the lips, her eyes suddenly widening as the kiss on the lips was more than enough to make he go under. She suddenly went limp and numb, becoming like jello in the mans arms*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and walked over toward his bed, laying her down he bent over her and kissed her again as he said "You really need to quit that..Someone might think you're dead..." He laughed and sat beside her, staring at the wall as he waited for her to come-round.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would slowly bat her eyes open, noticing she had feinted again. Misaki would sigh and bring her arms up so that she could bury her face in her palms. "I did it again didn't I..?" she asked quietly, more embarassed than ever, trying to hide the red blush*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pinned her hands down beside her head as he said "No need to hide..And yeah, it happened...But we can always work on fixing that problem..Can't we~" He released her hands and dragged both hands across her arms as he smirked at her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin up at Evan, her eyes fixated upon his. "Y-yeah.." she said, forcing out her words as she was nothing but a nervous wreck at the moment.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Good, now you get on the offensive.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hnn...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Wut shoud I add to the water fall Village o-o)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (and how do u screen shot? xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Um...Add that big ass waterfall X.x and that one tree.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (No idea how to screen shot X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Heh...Come. And. Kiss. Me~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (kk back)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Rping)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would lean upward, aiming to close the gap between their faces. She was a bit hesitant but, she wanted to do it so only love drew her forward. Her lips would soon meet his as she neared closer and closer, planting a kiss upon him, truth be told this little kiss was not enough for her. *
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (i need somone to icon a biiig tree xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Trin might be able too.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pulled her onto his lap as he wrapped his arms around her, breaking the kiss he said "Good...Now let out any emotion you might have and pour it all onto me..." He smiled and moved his face close to her's again, but instead of kissing he snapped his head back and grinned at the Kirigakure shinobi. He was enjoying teasing her.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (trin?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (She knows how to icon?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (She iconned Kirigakure Chunin suit.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Say wut?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: You're teasing me now~ haha.
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) wrapped his arms around her, pulling her even closer as he finally kissed her. His mind going blank from the kiss as instinct took over, falling back so she was ontop of him he continued the kiss, occasionally pulling away to breathe as he mumbled "I can't seem to tease you anymore...Well this is no fun..." His breathing became rigged as he dove back into another kissing frenzy.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply been pulled forward by evan eventually ending up atop of him, kissing once more, but this time with a little bit more emotion placed into it, her eyes closed as she let herself get caught up in the moment. Misaki would pull back at the same times Evan did, simply giving off a few subtle laughs before moving back in, the kissing only resuming. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) finally pulled away as he laid his head back down on the pillow, his arms dropped to his sides as she laid ontop of him, closing his eyes he said "There we go...Not so shy now are ya~?" He chuckled.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: N-not really no.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then keep practicing...Think of me as a training dummy~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (KaY)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and placed his hands on the small of her back as he kissed her cheek and said "I'm dead serious about my offer to be your training dummy..Ya know~" He then slowly began to rub her back.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Back)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin and lean in closer, aiming to sneak a small kiss on the lips, slowly transforming it into another passionate one, only escalading from this point. After a few long...long seconds of this, she would pull back for air and simply grin, proceeding to ask the question"......Do you actually...love me?" she said softly, wanting to know the truth from his lips. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) 's face flushed at her question, his breathing haulted and he stared up at her. After a few moments he smiled and leaned into her, aiming his mouth next to her ears he said "I do Misaki...And don't ever think I don't!" He then nipped at her ear with his teeth and laid back down on the bed, beaming at her with a goofy smile.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin and stare down at Evan, her eyes taking on a much softer look. With this she simply leaned the rest of her weight upon him and embraced him, not wanting to let him go. "..." she would simply stay in this position until the hyuuga grew restless.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and rolled her over so she laid beside him, pulling her closer as he said "So little missy....Do you love me...?" He smirked and kissed her jaw line to tease her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply nod and chime"Of course!!"*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then show me how much~
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would lean forward and aim to give another long kiss towards Evan, passing off a wide grin before doing so. "You show me how much you love me..~" she retorted after taking a short breath, moving back in to kiss him once more.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) frowned as she moved her head back to tease him, he the mumbled "Oh you want me to show you hu-" Her kiss cut him off as he rolled ontop of her, breaking the kiss he immediatly attacked her chin and began to kiss along her jaw line, eventually making it to her neck.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply begin to giggle lightly, wrapping her arms around his body frame and pulling herself in closer, keeping the space between them extremely limited to almost no space. A deep red blush would overwhelm her complexion, her face now looking much like a cherry itself.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and slowly bit at the skin on her neck, as he did this he interlaced his fingers with her's and held her hands as he pulled himself back up to her face and said "Your turn...~"*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I dunno...~ My love for you.....cant be expressed without things getting.......awkward on the first day haha....
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and laid his head down on her shoulder as he whispered out "Nothing can be akward between us Misaki..." He then stuck his tounge out and sheepishly licked her bottom lip.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply laugh at Evan, a warm smile crossing her expression as she simply shrugged. "I don't wanna rush things..~" she said softly, running her fingers through his hair abit as she placed her free palm against his chest, reubbing a bit. "You understand right?" she asked softly.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (rubbing*)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and shook his hair as he said "I understand love~" He smirked and playfully growled at her then bit onto her neck again as he said "And to think, all I had to do was just tease you a little and you'ld get so worked up to where you had to write out your feelings...."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Im not so good at it....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: But you can say it now right~?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: *Nod*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pushed his face close to her ear as he whispered out "Then say it love...Say how you feel about me."*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (D:)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Lol'd)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (she freaked out over nothing xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Nah, she was teleporting to see if RP was going on.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply move to whisper in his ear*
<br><font color=teal>*Misaki(Miyasake3) whispers: I love you Evan, and I wish to spend the rest of my life being with you....
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shuddered as her warm breath hit his ears, his body feeling numb as the words drained his body of strength. Closing his eyes he said "Then let's get married...Not today but soon!"*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hn...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: O-oh kay!
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I g2g)

<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: I fail)
<br><font color=yellow>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) sighs as he would slowly raise his left thumb to his lips. He'd slowly part his lips as he said, "Hm....let's see if I can get this right...". He'd then bite down onto his thumb swiftly, breaking the skin causing a small amount of blood to pour from the wound. Mizuki would then exclaim, "Summoning jutsu!". He would then form a chain of handseals before slamming his left hand onto the ground, causing an enormous cloud of white smoke to form as a giagantic slug crashed through the ground, sending chunks of rock flying everywhere. Mizuki would smile brightly as he exclaimed, "Yeah! I did it!". He would then leap from atop the slug's head saying, "Well...why don't we get to this sage training."

Mizuki would then dart toward the slug, leaping onto it's head. He'd thrust his right hand onto the center of it's head, causing the giant slug to break down into much smaller slugs, each slamming into the ground leaving small crater's from the force of their impacts. Mizuki would then form a chain of handsigns exclaiming, "Collaboration Jutsu!: Bursting Acid Collision Waves!". He'd then form a chain of handseals before slamming his hand onto one of the much smaller slug's heads. The slug would inhale deeply before spitting out a large wave of it's acidic liquid, using transfered water chakra from Mizuki.*
