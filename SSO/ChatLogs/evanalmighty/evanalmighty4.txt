<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) turned and smiled at her as he said "Mizukage's have been dying...You are the next in line to become Mizukage...See where I'm getting at....?" His smile quivered as he tried to hide his worry.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply frown and move a bit closer towards Evan, taking her arms and wrapping them around his torsoe. "Don't think like that~" she said softly. hugging him tightly, feeling a bit concerned for herself aswell, whilst trying to soothe Evan. "Nothing bad will happen..."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shivered as her arms wrapped around him he in turn laid his hand on her hips as he said "I'm thinking about leaving my village and living here...With you...." He smiled at her and pulled her in so their bodies connected.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: A-are you sure about that?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Dead sure.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha~ What about your clan back in konohagakure??
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) kissed her on the forhead and said "I only want you...."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin and look up at Evan. "I love you..." she said softly, staring into his eyes.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smirked and picked her up, kissing her gently he said "I love you too...."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply gave off a few laughs as she was picked up, returning a few gentle kisses on evans lips with a rather soft grin. "Evan...." she said softly, waitign for a response. *
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Have you ever had thoughts on starting a family..?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) 's face flushed and reddened as he stuttered out "A-a f-f-family...Eh...I um..." He took a deep breath and stared into her eyes "I've thought about it before...Like how I can pass on my legacy..."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hehe seems you are the embarassed one now~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: .....
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin. "There would be no problem in starting a family soon..."*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...You serious?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: What do you mean?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Are you serious about wanting a family with me....?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Why wouldn't I be?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and tackled her to the ground, laying ontop of her he began to kiss her jaw-line and said "I love you! I love everything about you Misaki!" He pulled away and smacked his lips on her's with a hungry kiss, lust and love morphing into a chaotic passion as he wrapped his arms around her back.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have gotten tackled to the ground, this sudden action catching her off gaurd as both of the fell with a powerful thud, Evan atop. With this came the kiss, although it was differnt, much more passionate and lustful. His arms now wrapped around her back as she simply put her arms over his shoulders, closing her eyes as she enjoyed this sign of newly found heightened love. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) pulled away, and held her as he said "I never thought I'ld be able to have a family...You have no idea how happy I am..." He released his arms from her back and stroked his hands over her face, eventually cupping them and holding the sides of her face as he planted a delicate kiss on her lips.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply accept the delicate kiss, raising her right eyebrow. "Why would you think that?" she said softly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) laid his head on her chest, trying to catch his breath as he said "Because...Never been loved before, I've only ever had time to train and that's it...You are the first person to love me...." He brushed his head against her chin.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha~ You are the first i have ever loved~..

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha, you are handsome, extremely, and your personality reached out to mine, you are just one who makes my world feel complete, that is why I love you~ 
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and kissed her as he said "You are amazing, your cute when you are embarrassed and you love me." He then planted another kiss on her cheek as he pushed himself off the ground and picked her up and placed her feet on the ground as he said "As much as I hate doing this....I have to go to Sunagakure and check it out...I really don't want to leave my love." He planted another kiss on her lips as he said "Love doesn't sound quiet right...How about wife...?"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply blush, moving her head to the side aiming to hide it. "Yo-your saying you want to...?" she paused, a bit distraught, the word wife almost knocking her off her feet. She simply grinned*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pinched her cheek gently as he said "Of course I do! Would wife or mother of my children be better...Hrm...So hard to decide..." He gave her a sheepish grin as he pulled her into his body and planted multiple kisses on her lips and above her eyes.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha, they both sound fine to me~.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then when should we have our little family...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: When ever you feel like...~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm, maybe before I go~ hehehehe, just joking...Although a family would be worth something to come back too~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: You wont be gone that long will you? Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Well...Sunagakure is a couple weeks out.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: But, I'll run fast for you~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I better get going before I never leave.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: A family would be nice to come back to wouldnt it~.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah it would be amazing.
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Shame sunagakure is only a few weeks away haha.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Well...I don't know if I can be apart from you for months~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: M-months...?
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and kissed her as he said "Just kidding love..."*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: O-oh haha...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: I was worried for a few minutes..
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and stretched as he reached back and messaged the muscles in his legs saying "I need to get going Misaki....Please stay safe for me and our future children...Kay~" He then beamed at her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply nod and grin at Evan*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Later~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Oh, and to tie you over....
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) he smiled and reached over pulling her entire body into his being, kissing her with as much force as he could muster he darted his tounge into her mouth and held it there as he rubbed her lower back, moments later he pulled away as a thin string of saliva fell from between them.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply found herself being pulled in, but just a meere second later, an intense kiss was placed upon her, evans tounge now being pushed in her mouth."M..." she groaned slightly, closing her eyes, only opening them as he pulled back, her eyes open wide, simply staring at him, a deep red blush now sweeping across her face.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Think that'll hold you till I come back~?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Mhm!
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and moved his face to her ear as he said "Wait for me Misaki...Once I get back we'll have as big of a family as you want kay~" He then rubbed her stomach playfully and released her. Then darted off toward the entrance of the village.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) smiles. "You're welcome." He says as his robot's systems came back online. He smirks as he begins to manipulate the legs of Tenkara Futtehi. Running towards his opponent, Seithin brings the gun upwards. He activates the mech's targeting system, an image of Daemon would appear on the screen in front of Seithin. "Gotcha." He says as he flips a switch, his gun switching to fully autmoatic, nonpoisoned senbon. 

As Seithin pulls the trigger on the gun, about ten senbon a second would shoot out. They would be aimed at hitting Daemon in various pressure points, aimed at disabling him.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yoooooooo!!!!!~~
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) yawned and hopped off the mountain, pushing his feet out a blue hue enveloped the soles of his sandles he slowly began to walk down the mountain until making contact with the ground. Stepping off the mountain he placed his hands in his pockets and said "Oi, how's it hangin~"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Deathstar, Daemon(Pylar2) would smile not even focusing on the senbons. Dropping his Kunai he would quickly, grab Three explosive tags. Attempting to wrap them around Grace's senbon. As the first one hit, Daemon vanished. Dissappearing in a puff of smoke, As his fan appeared in his place. The Senbons bouncing off the outer covering, Daemon then would reappear on top of the Machine. If succeeded, with wrapping the explosive tags around the Senbon before hand. Daemon would attempt to stab the Senbon into the armor. If accomplish, he would do a backflip landing behind the Robot. Making the seal which would hopefully blow it up.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (You wrapped an explosive tag on one of the senbon that were thrown at you, caught it and lolbackflipped over a puppet?)
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: s
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hm...Sparring match huh, sweet!
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Oh hello Evan.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmkay.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: So yeah, I came to talk to you about some things that have been happening in other villages, mostly Kirigakure...
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Oh? Like what? And before you say anything, I need to know what village you hail from.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (brb fewd)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: At this time I consider myself more of a hermit than anything...But I originated from Konohagakure...
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: (back)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay)
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I see..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yep...
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Now, continue with what you were saying.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Two previous Mizukage's were killed...Both from unknown assailants, I've been asked to warn each village so here I am.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Hmmm, I see...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) says: i'll be jouninn)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I'm also here to search out villages..

<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: For?

<br><font color=green>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) says: -_-)
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: You have no current leads on who it may be?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: None..The first killer left no trace of his murder..The second used explosives.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Well.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I also came to check out how the Kazekage deals with their daily life.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I have to first and foremost defend myself and say that Sunagakure had nothing to do with the attack. And second we will make sure we stay on our gaurd for any suspicious people lurking around. -looks at Nicki- 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Such Hostility..I'm guessing you are new to this leadership game huh...
<br><font color=green>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) says: -_-)
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Not really
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Also.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: The Kazekage lives a very boring life.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: As do all Kages...But each Kage has a secret that I like to try and figure out.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Oh really? Why would I reveal something that could be a potential weakness? Do you take me for some kind of fool?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because, I'm not interested in fighting over something that has no gain to me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: And you can take that as me swearing to that oath.
<br><font color=green>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) says: ....)
<br><font color=green>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) says: (You lied)
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: But how do -I- know that? Deception is a common shinobi tol.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: tool*)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because, if I lie then you can take one of my eyes.
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: .....
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: What so special about your eyes?
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ...
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: That is my secret~
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: This nigga.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ( nigger* )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hm....?
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ....
<br><font color=green>***Kazekage**(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Blue haired woman.
<br><font color=yellow>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) After successfully setting up the traps, Aura thought she'd do a practice run in training. Wiping off the sweat from her forehead, she makes her way to a nearby tree which was covered in snow. Looking at the tree that was at average height, she says to herself "This will be a perfect training partner." seeing that it was of average height of a person or adult, which was taller then her. Aura left foot slides on the moist ground as she moves it backward as her other foot stiffen as her arms lift into the air as the palm of her hands daggered the tree as if they were in a fight. Aura is copying the stance of Kuro and Gokou (Jyuuken.) Giving herself a boost as she leaps to attack the tree. She begins hitting on the tree for countless minutes to her. Stops hitting the tree as she get tired. As she stops her injured arms make there way into her pocket, reaching a slice of crumbled bread. Taking a bite of the bread, Aura feels as if she could train harder, which she does. As Aura tosses the remains of the bread, she throws a kunai at a wire hanging from the trees. As the kunai cuts the wire, releasing three cables which released 3 logs that swung back and forth, 

Aura was starting to train her agility. As one log swirled back into the hidden trees, Aura takes time to run pass it, as she's in the middle of where it would come from, the log comes in about to hit Aura. Not wasting anytime Aura jumps forward, barely missing the log which had scratched into her kin, causing a cut on her waist….After failing that she thinks she would go back to training with her stance.

After having stopped the logs from continuing on with there movement, Aura goes back  to the tree that she was training on. There, she makes the stance once more this time she felt a little bit at ease with this stance as it started to catch up with her why other Hyuugas did it. Having done the stance, she begins striking the tree over and over with her palms. Till she got tired, Aura wouldn't stop till she felt she needed to which out of sheer will, Aura attacks the tree countlessly till she stops.

Begins hitting the tree once more, in the stance that she was getting accustomed to. Hitting the tree, her palms start to feel harden as her hands were growing immune to the hits. She was barely able to feel the palms of her hands as she kept hitting the tree, the immunity of attacking with this stance was just starting "Hii ya!" As she's attacking she begins manipulating her chakra to her hands, trying to give a move powerful blow to the tree. As she made connect the tree begins to shake as she hit it with enough force that its roots start shaking. Aura started to feel the pain, but ignores it as she strikes the tree with her right hand this time, she then begins to notice the pain, and stops training to heal the hand. Going to her bag, she reaches for a miniature pillow or puffy bandaid, and places it her the palm of her hands. To keep it there, Aura warps her entire hand and half of her arm in warping paper or cloth as its called. She begins to flex, trying to get used to it.

After an hours of trying to get into the new form of fighting style that she'd copy, and also getting into the cloth she begins training once more. After reaching the tree she's been training on, she begins to hit the tree with the palm of her hands, it was much easier to strike the tree, but less force as the padding in between the bandage and her palm was restricting damage. Ignoring it because she couldn't tell how the tree was feeling but knew how she was feeling. 

After a few minutes of training, Aura thinks about taking a break but decides not to "I came here to train… For the next few days, there will be breaks, nor naps!" As she yelled naps, a surge of chakra explodes from her hands and onto the tree, creating a deep dent into the tree, destroying the bark. Aura observes the dent, surprised that she did that "So they disable it with…Chakra. It starts to make sense as chakra could affect someone else chakra, such as genjutsu." Placing her arms downward and letting them swing in the air, she thinks more about this subject and how she could do this.

After a few minutes of thinking about how she could do what Kuro and Gokou did, Aura comes to the conclusion that she needs to test it out, and not sit there and just think it over. Instead Aura goes the a different tree seeing that the training one was heavily damaged. Going to a slightly larger tree, Aura makes the same stance she has been doing for the pass two days. She begins to strike the tree. After attacking the tree for a number of times, she begins exerting chakra from her hands, doing this Aura's attacks begin to affect the tree as the bark from the tree begins to break. Attacking the tree, she notices that she was getting fatigued quicker, as her chakra was draining quickly. As soon as she notices Aura immediately stops "Doing this is taking after my chakra… At a rapid rate." Saying to herself.  Now was the time that she takes a break, to replenish her chakra.
Has a hour break as of now.

Coming from her break, Aura feels refreshed as she had taken a short nap, and having eaten about 3 Rice balls which she had been saving for later. She finds herself in front of the new tree once more "Alright tree lets get this started!" Aura begins training on the tree, as she strikes the tree as if a tiger were attacking a small animal. Hitting the tree with the palm of her hands, Aura adds some chakra into her punches, but only hits the tree like that two times, one in each hand. She wasn't trying to drain her chakra like she normally would, but instead goes to normal training, she's going with a plan to attack normally and attack using chakra every so often, giving her chakra the right amount of time to go back to its normal status, or close to near it. *

<br><font color=yellow>*Baunton, Nicki(Guest_Girl) Walking around in the fields of the academy, happy to have just became a part of the shinobi ranks as a genin, Miya bugs seemed to move around a lot "Hmm?" Looking through her glasses, she moves her eyes downward directly to what seemed like a small tree. Able to talk to the bugs and be able to hear them talk back, Miya asks what they wanted to do, they responded by using their body movements to face toward the tree, which made Miya body move forward a little, but not visible pasted her jacket. Looking  at the tree she wondered if they would listen to her "Well I guess we can do this…" The kikachu inside her body seemed to move around, encouraged that the wanted to do that, some reason unlike Miya, her bugs where sociable or rather excited most of the times unlike Miya who frowned on everything and was socially awkward.
Glancing at the tree for a period of time, her bugs tried to rush her into letting them to go toward the tree, but they were loyal to her and didn't rush her as much as it would be annoying "Ok… Ok lets do this you guys." Still looking at the tree which seemed as if it was a normal tree that was growing at a average rate. Getting the idea that the tree wasn't actually a tree she observes it by moving around the tree seeing if there was any problems with or about the tree that interested her Kikachu "I don't se-"  Stopping on that notion, she sees that there was a fist sized hole at the back of the tree. For some reason, this hole in the tree made the kikachu in her body explode in excitement "Calm down, calm down.." a smirk comes upon Miya's face she starts taking a few steps backwards "I'm going to try something with my knowledge of chakra." Taking another few steps backward, she starts thinking on how she could maybe use chakra to affect herself.

Placing her hand on her chin, Miya tells herself "I just learned this.. I know this." Thinking harder, Miya places her hand that was on her chin to chest level. She then places her free hand on chest level as well. Bringing the two hands together, she makes a hand sign where her right index and middle fingers are on top of the entire hand. Remembering what happened in her head what her teacher told her about chakra control a flash back memory comes to mind "To control chakra you must first relax, and allow your mind to wander abit. By doing so, chakra will course throughout your body, if you are good at controlling this chakra as shown by Samona and Miya, it would take you less time to do so then others." Coming back from the flash back, Miya tightens up her hands together "Got to focus.." As Miya begins to clear her mind of any outside forces she thinks about mental and physical energy placed inside of her.
After two seconds of focusing, a bluish coloring surrounds Miya in a sharpened form which wiggled on the sides a few time but was mainly stable, Miya starts controlling the blue aura around her body. As she does did, it starts the decrease in coloring, causing it to vanish slowly. As the aura vanishes it would impact Miya's skin, creating small harmless holes on her entire body "…" Coming from the holes that were planted inside Miya's body were what seemed like bugs with hard shells which encased their wings.  These bugs came at 2-5 at a time, as they came from the holes, they moved all across Miya's body.  She raises her arms out, facing the tree "Kikachu's go outside of my coat, and appear in swarms." Arms lifted in the air, black specs start to appear on Miya's coat, specs that move which were the Kikachu's. In a short period time the specs gathered and stuck onto the arms of Miya, making only parts of her coat visible, not even her hands were seeable because the bugs gathered mainly on the hands and the center of Miya's arm "Perfect." She stated at herself and the bugs. Looking at the tree, Miya sends a telepathic thought to every one of her bugs listened to her. 

Doing as they are told by their host, the bugs  fly with an incredible speed, this amount of speed surprised Miya herself "!!!" As the bugs flew with a unknown speed, they reach the tree by the dozens "I can't believe there that fast." Watching with amazement, Miya watches as the bugs spread out slowing, as they do it had seemed as if the leaves on the tree were dying but Miya didn't take note of this at first. Watching with amazement Miya gains another smirk on her face, as the bugs slightly covered over entire tree trunk. The tree covered in bugs was barely noticeable, except for blotches that only little bugs where attached to. Miya getting tired but at the same time excited that she was able to control the bugs "Ok its time to go." Lifting her arms, Miya sends a telepathic message to the bugs, telling them to come back and return to Miya's body. It takes the entire group of bugs to listen to Miya, but in time they start to fly toward Miya.

After been gathered up and returned to Miya's body, the holes which allowed the bugs to leave Miya's body heal, the flesh would seem as if the holes never appeared in the first place. She lifts her arms down, Miya looks at the tree, not being able to notice that the leaves of the tree had turned into a dark brown color. Not being able to notice this, Miya begins to walk away from the area of the academy, leaving the academy trying to find her brother, Aburame Famas. Still walking, she didn't notice that the tree had vanished from the air. But something appeared, it was a Iwagakure jounin, who must have transformed into the tree. He must have been spying on the hidden leaf village. Still never to notice this, Miya keeps on walking telling her kikachu's that they were doing going to train harder and harder. *

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: The Raikage waltzed into Kirigakure looking for what I believe was her villager, the Mizukage asked her what she was doing, at that point the Raikage began to shout slurrs and speaking in a violent manner. During that time more words were thrown and the Raikage attacked the Mizukage, moments later I was asked to intervene and froze the Raikage with a jutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (With a jutsu*)
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: How exactly did she attack in detail?
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: With a jutsu? Weapon? Fist?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: She used her sword in combonation with the body flicker technique to get behind the Mizukage, the Mizukage used a jutsu that I have never seen before and retaliated in defense.
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>***Amekage**(CrazyTaco-NSS) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: So her actions seemed hostile? And she attacked first?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes Kazekage.
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Alright.

<br><font color=yellow>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) would listen to the whole of the accusations before hearing that she could speak. "Alright..Here is what happened." She says as she looks at the Kazekage. "I walked to the Mist Village all the way from Kumogakure...I was tired as shit..." She says as she adjusts her posture. " I had come in search of Nero, one of my more..Wander prone shinobi...When I found him..I was surrounded by a bunch of Mist Ninja. I was simply speaking to Nero when I was accosted by this female shinobi. I had planned on coming and giving the Mizukage the same thing I gave you...But of course I couldn't find anyone wearing the robes of the Mizukage as they are supposed to." She continues.

"So I simply got angry because after that walk, I was quite tired as I said. So I go mad at her and I simply drew my blade and shunshined to a point beside her. I drew my sword and placed it, pointing at her neck. Its not like I was holding her down or anything, It was simply aimed at her. I was then attacked by her because she assumed I wanted a fight. I at the time didn't know she was the Mizukage because like I said...She wasn't dressed correctly." Cheren says rather calmly. She actually sits down on the ground and stares up at her. 

"I activated my defensive jutsu, because I knew at that point that Kirigakure was a stupid place. So after this...Wait.." Notices that Evan is a Konoha shinobi. "This MEDDLER! In the affairs of others! Captured me in a paralysis jutsu while I was rushing the girl...I hadn't planned on killing her at all...Just scaring her so that I would be able to find the Mizukage whom I had been told was a male." She says 

"So...Upon me talking them into releasing me. I simply shunshined and ran away..Going towards my village."*

<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: So in your defense.... You didn't know she was the Mizukage?
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: No, no I didn't..So I'd have no reason to even go back and attack her....
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: I was -looking- for the Mizukage.
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: That still doesn't explain why your blade was drawn.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...But you admitted to attacking...
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: ...It was drawn to intimidate her..As far as I was concerned...She was just another Kirigakure shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: There were other non violent actions you could have taken before drawing your blade.
<br><font color=green>*Kimia(TakeTheCondomOff) says: Such as simply 'asking' who the Mizukage was.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: I did.
<br><font color=green>*Ouendan, Cheren(Wynokx) says: She refused to answer me.

<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) kissed her stomach once more and said "I hope they do too love...I know they will!" He moved his head away from her stomach and smiled at her.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Heh.....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: When do you want kids by the way...?
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: When will you be ready....? To actually become a father..
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Hahah~you first.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Anytime love~
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: .......Hm....I dont want to start old...
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and pinned her down as he laid ontop of her, staring down at her he said "Whenever you want love, just tell me~" He kissed her neck and interlaced his fingers with hers, holding her hands as he moved his lips up to hers.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin at Evan as he pinned her down, his body now once more ontop of hers. With a few simple giggles and such, Misaki would soon blush. "We have nothing to do right now....~" she said softly, becoming a bit embarassed as she closed her eyes, awaiting the response.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smirked and brought his head beside her ear, his breathing low as he said "Then make the first move...Show me what you want~" He then nipped at her ear with his teeth and brought his lips down on her ear-lobe in an attempt to tease her.*
<br><font color=teal>*Misaki(Miyasake3) whispers: Not right here...hehe
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Then lead the way to where ever love...~

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Wait lemme type something before i brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would get up and grab Evan, leading him over to her apartment, a rather fancy one given kirigakure standards, there things would resume.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (now brb)}
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (XD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ....So this is your place huh....Heh...Well show me what you want now~

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Was fixing myself some tacos :D)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I had a burger for dinner X.x)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply grin over at Evan, grabbing his by the collar and bringing him in closer, twisting her head to the side just slightly and planting a long, passionate kiss upon him, inserting her tounge into her mouth as she leaned forward, hopefully leading back towards the bed before them*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (burgers are alright)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I tednt to only eat them like)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (every so months)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (ROFL)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (they are so fattening)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Nah, not if they are home-made.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Im not a size 0, i have weight but im not fat, i have a shape XD, i try hard to kleep it :<)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Meh, I work outside all day so it keeps me in shape lol.)_
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (What do u wrok as?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Depends on what I have to do, like today I had to go help a friend take apart a shed and my actual job is a life-guard at a water park.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (L:ife guard)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Cuul :D)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) 's eyes widened as her tounge invaded his mouth. Pushing his tounge against hers he began to wrestle with it, eventually ending up at the bed. Falling forward he pinned her down, never breaking the kiss as he continued to wrestle with her tounge.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I'd rather not say my job xD)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Or used to be my job)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Go ahead lol.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (:< i worked at subway)

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Ok I abosultey would kill for a pizza)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (typing btw)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have eventually pulled back for a few gasping breaths of air. "Show me what you want aswell...~" she said softly, just giving a grin as she moved back in to form another long passionate kiss. She was but a rookie with this love game, and she was indeed unexperienced. *
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brbs)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) pulled away with lust as he growled out "I want you...I want all of you!~" He then reached forward, unzipping the chunin vest she wore and cursed under his breath as he said "I always hated the jumpsuits we had to wear..." Eventually lust grabbed him once more, reaching out he attempted to rip the jumpsuit open, if successful he would lower kis head and lick her bare stomach.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would have simply lied sprawled out upon the bed below her, the unzipping of her chunnin vest ensuing, before suddenly, her jumpsuit was ripped, revealing her underclothing, ranging from slight hints at her bra, and the linging of her panties. "Wow~" she simply said softly, grinning down at Evan as he proceeding to lick her bare stomach. "A little kinky there aren't we...~" she would say, teasing him a bit.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Im guessing ur name irl is Evan)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (RofL)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Meh, wouldn't care if you were a creeper lol.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (And it's Copeland.)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (ok, if u dont wanna tell me, tell me ur ethnicity)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) lifted his head up and mumbled out in a shaking tone "Y-your turn...Show me what you want....~" He sat up and waited for her response.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (:O copeland )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Thts a cool last name :D)

<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (thts cuul too)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Im like a freakin)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Hybrid)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I'm Irish, Scottish, German, and Native American so X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I think my great great great gandpa is Polish too X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I have native american in me too :D)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply leann upward and stare at Evan for a bit. "........HAha....How about, we just show eachother at the same time..." she said softly, leaning forward and placing her hands on his chest, slowly making her way past the clothing and onto his bare skin, letting her fingers trail down, lower and lower, and even lower, past his abs and finnaly into his lower region. "I've never done this before..." she said softly, passing over a grin at Evan*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Im White/Native american/Hispanic and I think I have a bit of african american in me o-o)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Sweet)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: ()I hate my last name xD)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Its so plain)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (:<)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Ill tell u in a sec xD)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shuddered from her touch, her hand down near his groan he closed his eyes trying to control his heart-rate and breathing as he said "N-neither have I...." Opening his eyes he reached out and cupped her breasts, squeezing them gently as he said "Soft..." Swallowing down his embarrassement he reached back and unclapsed her bra saying "If you show I'll show..."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply pass off a laugh at Evan, a deep red blush now overwhelming her face. "We'l eventually have to...~" she said softly, gently pulling off her bra so that her breasts could be left to hang freely out in the open, her fingers slowly pulling at his pants so they would begin to slide down a bit lower, revealing his groin a bit. "...." she simply stared, tryhing to force back the blsuh*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) groaned as he said "It really wants to say hello to you..."He then reached forward and pulled her closer, to the point she was ontop of him, the buldge would press against her groin as he kissed her deeply. Laying his hands on hers he helped her push his pants down, his member springing free and out in the open as a red hue fixated on his face.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply pull back just slgihtly, feeling something in the lower area pressing against her. "...Hn...?" she would look down to see that he was somewhat fully exposed at this point, a large grin beaming on her face. "Lets just let instinct take over...." she said softly, waiting for a reply.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled as her and pulled her up, her chest in his face as he muttered "Yeah...Instinct..." He then opened his mouth and wrapped his lips around her left breast, his hand reaching back and cupping her ass as he squeezed. His member twitched from wanting company as his mind began to go blank, instinct actually taking over.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply give off a discreat groan as his mouth wrapped around her left breast, a warm and soothing sensation now traveling through her body, the same instant his other hand reaching back and grabbing at her ass, another sensation jolting and colliding with her already pleasurable feeling. Evan actually seemed experienced at this, so as she thought, she would let him do most of the work, until thus her ability called to do something to pleasure him. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) pulled away from her chest as he groaned out "Please...It needs some love too..." He then lowered her body down so that his member was poking her stomach, slowly he tilted his head up wanting nothing more then to be pleasured as his member twitched in acknowledgement.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply lift her body slightly so that she could get a glance down at his member twitching slightly. "W-what do I do with it...?" she asked, feeling a bit stupid as she blushed slightly, glancing up at Evan with a questioning look. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) swallowed, trying to wet his throat as he said "Anything...I don't know this is my first time too....." He closed his eyes as his member rubbed against her stomach, a groan escaping from his mouth.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (How big would it be x.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (8-9 inches?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (k)
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply glance back down at it before glancing back up. "Anything?" she thought, moving down upon it even more so that her head would be placed right next to it. She would simply swallow her embarassment and try what he had done to her breasts just seconds ago. Opening her mouth wide, she would wrap her lips around it, taking in about 4 inches of his member, making sure her teeth did not scrape against it. With this done, she would begin to slowly suckle upon it, moving her head up and down, instinct now driving her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) groaned out in pleasure as his hands reached down to her head, his member pulsing from the attention as her mouth was clammped over it. He then mumbled out "Whatever your doing...It's great..." His body took control and forced his hips to start moving back and forth at the same pace as her bobbing.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would eventually take in to much of his member and gag at some points as it reached the back of her throat. All in all however, she would maintain herself and wrap both her hands around it and stroke as she bobbed her head, and he thrusted just ever so slightly. It had no odd taste, just the taste of skin thats all, so she didnt find this all too bad. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) increased his pace as he said "It feels soooo good~" Eventually pre-cum shot out, his member throbbing in response to her lips and hands. His breath became rigged and shallow as he began to pant for breath his fingers rand through her hair as he held onto her head. Moments later he said "Somethings coming out...Gah!" His warm liquid shot out, if she didn't move her head away it would fill her throat and continue to shoot out in strings.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would suddenly feel some sort of warm liquid breach her mouth, slowly filling before she eventually let some of it seep out back onto Evans member, with this Misaki would remove her head and stare up at Evan. "Hn....?" she hummed, simply proceeding to ask the question. "Did you enjoy that..?"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) began to pant as he said "Y-yeah...You have no idea....Just give me a minute....Come lay up her with me..." Trying to control his breath he laid his arms over his eyes, his member still hard as he closed his eyes trying to regain his composure. Moments later he said "I need to repay you...Hey...Take off your panties for me...~" He grinned at her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply stare at Evan for a few seconds as he asked her to remove her panties. She would simply nod and do such, sliding them off so that her whole lower body was exposed, taking the remainder of her clothes and tossing them aside, seeing as how they would only get in the way. She would simply lay there and grin, blushing over at Evan as she simply sat with her legs crossed a bit. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) pushed himself up and spread her legs apart, moving his body closer to hers his chest connected to her. Kissing her deeply his member rubbed against her groin. A few moments later he pulled away from the kiss and said "I'm going to pay you back now..." He smirked then pushed her down on the bed, kissing her neck he lowered his lips down to her breasts and kissed both of them. After he continued his journey and kissed her stomach then finally stopped abover her slit and kissed it. Reaching out with his hand he spread her slit open and rubbed his tounge against her inner walls, savering the taste as he mumbled "Hope you enjoy...~"*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply peer down at Evan as he resumed to speak, the gentle kisses coursing down the length of her body now causing her o release subtle giggles. "pay me ba-" she began to say up untill the point the licking had ensued, a jolt of pleasure now coursing through her body with each gentle rub, her eyes closing as a deep red blush swarmed her, moans now seeping through her mouth as her top teeth latched onto her bottom lip.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) continued his assult on her slit, pulling back to make short gasps of air and immediately diving back in as he continued to enjoy her. Eventuallly he moved his mouth up and began to slowly suckle on her nub even going as far as to nip at it with his teeth, his saliva mixed with her juices as his member throbbed near her face once more. He truthfully didn't care if she pleasured him again, all sense of wanting and reasoning escaped him as the smell from her groin invaded and probed his mind he just wanted to pleasure her as much as he could.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply begin to moan even louder and louder. She eventually grew wetter and wetter, almost nearing her climax until she took a large breath to speak. "Evan....I want to see...if your thing will fit inside..." she asked softly, waiting for a response*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Sorry made something to drink0
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It's okay X.x)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) pulled away, swirling his tounge around it retracted back into his mouth as he gulped down her juices. Swallowing his breath he said "O-okay...." He then positioned himself inbetween her legs and grabbed her hand. Placing her hand on his member he said "You put it in then...That way if it doesn't fit you can pull it out quick..." His mind still fuzzy from her scent as his member rubbed against her slit.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply shake her head. "I trust you to do it.." she said softly, awaiting for him to make his action, whether or not it hurt, it would probably do her justice and provide pleasure aswell. She decided to go with the fact that it might give her a wonderful sensation, and entrusted evan with the task to place it in. *
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shuddered as her voice seemed to trigger him, slowly pushing the head of his member in her slit he said "If it hurts...I'll take it out...Okay?" He then continued pushing until he felt resistance, taking a deep breath he leaned ontop of her his neck near her mouth as he said "If it hurts bite me..." He then finally pushed his member in, blood flowing out of her as he deflowered her.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply yell out in pain, but what was odd was that she also yelled out in pleasure. The pleasure recieved from him pushing his way inside only negated the pain, making things suitable for their position. Misaki would simply nod and clamp her eyes shut, wrapping her arms around his neck as she gently rested them there, moaning slightly as he pushed even further in. "I-it feels good.." she murmered, unable to contain herself.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) groaned out as her tightness squeezed his member. Slowly his hips began to move in a rhythmic pattern as he said "So...So..So good...I can't stop...~" Saliva escaped the corners of his lips as he continued to assult her slit with his member, never breaking pace he planted his lips on hers forcing his tounge to break through her mouth as he licked the roof of her mouth.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply allow evan full access to what ever bodily pleasures he wanted to ensue, whether it be violating her lower half, or upper, it didnt matter in the end. She would openly accept the kiss, evens tounge forcing its way into her mouth a the subtle moans she gave off now began even more muffled than before, her tounge slightly rolling under his as they broke into a passionate kiss. Fluids would seep from her lower area as Evan continued his rhythmic pattern, the sensation only growing in intensity.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (I have to sleep in about 15 minutes :<)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (I'm about to pass out too X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Want me to end it?)
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: (Sure
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) groaned out as their tounges wrestled, his member tensed up as he pulled away from her breathing deeply he said "D-do you want it in or out...Hurry and tell me, I'm close..." He continued to assult her as the liquid began to build up sinking his teeth into her neck he tried to not think about releasing until she told him where, after biting her he moved his head up and licked her lips.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply moan, unable to answer correctly, in her mind she did not care, but her body begged for me. "Keep...going....in me.." she said softly, through her intense moans and groans, and the sensation brought upon by evan biting her only sent her over the edge, the woman reaching her climax as fluid now rushed out at an intense rate. She grabbed at the back of evans head, wrapping her fingers within his hair as she simply latched on, cringing as he continued to thrust*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shivered as her fluids rushed over his member, her slit tightened due to it which caused his own release as fluids shot into her slit. His body began to shake from the sensation as he wimpered, pulling his member out it continued to shoot landing on her breasts, stomach and thighs. He cringed and fell over beside her as his member laid across her thigh strings still gushing from his member.*
<br><font color=green>*Misaki(Miyasake3) says: Ngh...

<br><font color=yellow>*Misaki(Miyasake3) would simply return the kiss on his lips, giving a warm grin and replying. "It was no problem, couldnt let you go anywhere else~" she said softly, returning another gentle kiss upon his lips.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smirked and held her as he said "Well you coulda made me sleep on the floor or outside~" He chuckled a little as he kissed the top of her head.*
