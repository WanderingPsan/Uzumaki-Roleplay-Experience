<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: I will be back soon to discuss political matters Hokage.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Y-yes...Sir.
<br><font color=green>*Ryuugami, Ryo(Torball) says: good, because i need training...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Go on off toward the training fields.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: You too kid..
<br><font color=green>*Ryuugami, Ryo(Torball) says: Crap, I'm lost...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...Go down and take the first right...Follow it all the way until the fence ends then take another right.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Im still wondering what my elements are...
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: How about yo---
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Welcome back Sir..
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I don't really care.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: And welcome back.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: But what if you can save the world?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: What...
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Alright...Which one of you can tell me about chakra control?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I can.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Like walking on water right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: In depth what is it.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: I'll let Dawn explain I have the next one.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Chakra control is what is necesarry to perform the ninja arts. Certain techniques require more chakra control than others, and vice versa. The amount of chakra control a person has determins what kind of jutsu they are able to perform and how well they are able to do it.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Good job.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Now...Who here can actually use chakra control?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Not me.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Me neither.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Kiye rolled)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: o-o)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: We've only had basic academy leaf training.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Boil)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Q_Q)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Leaf concentration training that it.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: is*)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm, well today you will learn how to use chakra control...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I want you both to stand ontop of the fence behind me, once done you will both force your chakra to your feet hold the chakra and then walk up the mountain.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Rps?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: _
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: )
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (3)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Can you give a demonstration please?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Yeah what she said
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and walked over toward the fence, reaching up he threw himself ontop of the metal and maintained his balance. Clapping his hands together he said "Watch my feet.." a few mere moments passed until a blue hue enveloped the soles of his sandles, after he slowly began to walk along the mountain until he was horizontal, looking up he stared at the two and said "As you practice this will progressively get easier until you notice no drain and are able to control your chakra subconsciously."*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Okay.
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: ^same)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Btw)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: tell the hokages Shunshin/Sui isn't basic)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Kages*)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (^)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Mah OOC is off X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (ill do it
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm, I really need a vacation...Sigh..
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) watched her sensei climbed the mountain using nothing but his chakra control alone, a feat that seemed impossible to a regular person. Dawn walked up to the fence and climbed the metal gate, using her balance to stay on the gate for as long as possible. She closed her eye and began focusing on her chakra, trying to get a good feel of it, however she was unable to. She assumed that the small spark of feeling she felt was her chakra, but it was really just her stomach growling since she was hungry. She took one small step on the mountain and immediatly came crashing down to the ground below, hurting her arm a little from the impact. She knew not what she did wrong, scratching her head and remembering that Evan's feet had illuminated with the glow of blue chakra, something that Dawn had overlooked herself.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Word to the wise...Too much chakra and you'll blow a hole in the rock..To little and you don't stick, you have to find the perfect amount~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm, I'll be right back keep training~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hokage.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I have something to request.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I'ld like to take my squad on a little vacation it'll also help with their training...
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: Hmm where is this vacation too?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Kirigakure...I'm teaching the kids on how to control their chakra and the beachs have the perfect amount of water to help them.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: Ah perfect it sounds like an excellent idea!
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: Just make sure before you go to take.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: To get a permission pass to enter into their village.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I know..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Alright, then we are off. We will be back in a few weeks.
<br><font color=green>***Hokage**(Rahie) says: Alright well send a message over once you've made 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Baaaack~
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (on my third rp)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (You both done it yet?
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Ditto)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: on my third)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Once you both are done I have some news~
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) would watch Evan as he stood upon the gate, watching him channel his chakra into his feet. Followed by him standing upon the gate, Dusk would crack his knuckles. Slowly approaching the gate, as he chuckled. Placing one hand on the gate, pulling himself up. As he looked at the mountain, focusing his chakra into his feet. Furthermore, Dusk hoped to reach his goal to reach the level of Jounin. As he looked at the moutain , leaping into the air he attempted to place a single foot on the moutain testing its stability. As he attempted to place his other foot on it, as he simply fell back on the gate. Followed by hitting the ground.

Dusk would slowly get up dusting himself off as he listened to Evan's words"Word to the wise...Too much chakra and you'll blow a hole in the rock..To little and you don't stick, you have to find the perfect amount." As he closed his eyes, inhaling then exhaling. As he once again leaped to the top of the gate, reopening his eyes. He stared at the gate with a fierce determination, placing his foot on the mountain. Then concentrating his chakra into his foot, he attempted to regulate it so it moved with the moutain. In the case a pebble fell it wouldn't throw off his balance. As he placed his second foot on the wall, instantly he fell backwards. His first foot hanging on to the wall as a suction cup of some sort. Sighing, he released the chakra from his foot, falling the the ground head first.

Would once again, dust himself off slamming his palms into the dirt he said to himself"I must do this..." As he sighed, balling his fist standing back up again. Closing his eyes he placed his hand on his chest,  concentrating on regulating his chakra. Followed by regulating his breathing, As he would place his hand on the gate. Lifting himself up onto the gate, he would stand channeling his chakra into his feet. He would place his first foot onto the mountain, Regulating the chakra in the sole of his foot to the movements of the mountains. As he placed his other foot onto the mountain. Standing back he looked at Evan, Smiling he said"I got it!" Moving further up the mountain, he would release his chakra doing a flip in mid air, he would land on the ground. IN a kneeling stance wondering if Dawn has also completed the training. Which he realised she was done before him.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) took a deep breath and she began an attempt at her third try, fully confident that she would get it this time. She looked over to Dusken to see how he was doing before continuing to finish her own try. She closed her eyes for a third and final time, focusing the chakra that was within her body. Now that she had tried a few times, she figured it would be fairly easy to get it down. Climbing ontop of the gate once more, she allowed the chakra to take form under the soles of her feet, finally getting a good balance and being able to do both feet at once. She took one small step onto the mountain wall, a bit nervous about her attempt. She completely shrugged off her sensei's words at the moment and continued to concentrate as hard as she could, placing one foot on the wall and making  it stick. Once she first foot was up on the wall, she placed the second foot, hoping she wouldn't fall back down to the ground. The balance of chakra being sent to her feet matched the ruggedness and roughness of the wall with each step, allowing her to walk onto the wall freely and without falling. Since she did not have that much chakra control, she jumped from the wall and landed back down to the ground, looking to Dusken to see how he was doing.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (kdone)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: Reason I put dawn was done before me was)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: We are going to the beachs of Kirigakure.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (God damnit)

<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Why are you doubting yourself?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (How long does it take to travel from Konoha to kiri)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because I'm not a teacher...

<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and hopped ontop of the desk, squatting down he leveled his face with hers and said "Well Mizukage...I don't know how well your village will deal having a Hyuuga baby..." He smirked and kissed her forhead before reaching down and rubbing her stomach.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (Imagine, Twins, One had hyuuga bloddline, other had roflhuge chakra)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (X.x)
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would simply lean backward, sighing a bit as she felt the small tap against her forehead, her eyes closing as Evan rubbed upon her stomach. Her stomach was quite large, indicating she was far into the stages of her pregnancy, just a few more months to go and she was ready.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (Wuts wit da X.x face)

<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (Whuts a matter with tht?)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) crossed his legs and sat on the desk as he said "How many months has it been...I've lost track lover~" He crossed his arms and smiled at her.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (XD)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Just X.x)

<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) enters the Mizukage's mansion after a long journey...Wide and far he had travelled...His village, destroyed, his mech all but ruined...Seithin had managed to repair it, but it had taken him quite a bit of effort.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Guests guests and more guests....Ah the life of a Kage..
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (Back)

<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: Pilot.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Pilot?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Where do you come from?
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: Yes...
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: I..Have no village..
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: I'm a wanderer.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Did you HAVE a village?
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: ...At one point in time...But that is meaningless now..
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) spun around on the table to face the kid as he said "So either...You're wanted, or your village abandoned you..."*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (stripper much?)
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (Jk <3 xD)
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: ...Neither, why are you even speaking to me..
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: Im here to see the Mizukage.
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: Not some..-leaf- Ninja.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm, you need to learn mannerisms kid.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: And going by that tone you either came from Kumogakure or Sunagakure...Considering they were wiped off the map.
<br><font color=green>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) says: Grr...
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) turns around and leaves the mansion.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Jeeeeeeeze kids these days...I hope ours isn't going to turn out like that...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Lover...~
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Find any place for me and my squad to stay at?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Here follow me.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: USe any of these here.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Can't I stay in yours...?~
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: They are all vacant.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Sure~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Heh, it might be bad if I do though..~
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: How so?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Because we. Wouldn't. Sle-eee-p~
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Haha....bealive it or not....being pregnant...makes me real tired...
<br><font color=yellow>*Seithin Grace(Jack Lyzerg) grunts in anger as he summons his mech from its scroll. Seithin gets inside of the machine and turns to the Mizukage's mansion. He would surge is chakra in it, this would cause the mech to activate to its full power. The boy then causes it to hold up its gun and aim at the Mizukage's mansion. 

"I hope you all burn in hell." He says as he pulls the trigger. The gun would fire about 500 senbon at the building. They would rip through it and tear through the place, damaging and destroying just about everything inside. 

As Seithin's gun begins to overheat, he stops firing and deactivates the mech. He leaps out and reseals it to its scroll. "Rose...If you have any respect for yourself or your village...You'll leave with me, right now." He says as he begins to run from the village.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ....Stay here...
<br><font color=yellow>*Dusken(Jjking218) follows in pursuit of the Mech Boy.*
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: :D)
<br><font color=green>*Dusken(Jjking218) says: lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...The hell happened...

<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Incident?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: What kind?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Your mansion is ruined by senbon...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hmmmm
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Do you know who did it?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...Probably that kid...Or whoever assassinated the second Mizukage..
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: *Sigh*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Lover....
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: ??
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Everything always turns out terribly when I'm around...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: My Genin seems to have also gone off to fight the suspect..
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Your genin.....?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: *Sigh*

<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Stop the before they do anything to...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Stupid..
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and planted his lips on hers before crouching down and kissing her stomach. Standing up he said "I will...Be back in a flash~" His veins already exposed around his eyes as the Byakugan was active.*
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would simply nod, the stern expression on her face easy sign that she was indeed a bit ticked off.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Later~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: No luck....
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: *Sigh*

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ..C'mon, for me?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: *shakes her head*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Im just a bit irritable...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: thats all...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Nothing to worry about.
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and folded his arms as he said "Let's go back to your apartment, I got a thing that just might fix ya up~" He smiled and wrapped his arms around her waste from behind.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: I suppose..
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (gra)
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (grab*)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Now lover...I can give you a nice massage to get out the irritability...~
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Alright...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and sat down on her bed, grabbing her by her sleeve he slowly pulled her onto his lap with her back facing him. Bringing both arms up he placed his palms on her shoulder-blades and began to make swirling motions in an attempt to smooth out her tension as he said ""Relax my love...Just relax..."*
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would have simply relaxed as told to do so, her eyes closing as evan began to make slowl swirling motions, the tension built up in her muscles slowly fading from existence, the woman giving slight groans as he did so. "Thanks...." she said softly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and reached around, rubbing her belly as he said "Tension in a mother to be affects the child to..We don't want an angry baby now do we love...~" He smirked and began to laugh as he kissed the back of her neck, he then said "Lay down with me~"*
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would simply nod, moving over to Evan, getting a bit closer but at a slower pace, due to the roundness in her stomach putting on quite a bit of weight and strain on her body. "*Sigh*..." she sighed softly, aiming to lay with him. *
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Awww, my poor Mizukage~ Heh...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm, what should we do?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Dunno~
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Well, there are things we both miss...~ But I don't know if we could...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: I-i can't do that ....
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Sorry..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I know lover, but I can pleasure you.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: I dunno...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and kissed her neck, lowering his head down he continued his trail of kisses, brushing his lips over her robes as he said "Say the word...And I'll do anything you ask my love...~"*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: ........*Nod*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Evan.....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yes lover...~
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: What If I have twins....?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (*evil face*)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Q.Q)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I guess I'll have three mouths to feed then huh...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hah..

<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: But my stomach.....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I don't care lover...You are beautiful.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: What do you want to see,,,?

<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Do as you wish....but l
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: allow me to just..lie here...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Im feeling tired  still..
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) frowned and pressed his lips against hers as he said "I miss you being so energetic lover~" He then reached down and pulled her robe up past her growing stomach. A pleasant sigh escaped his lips as he said "There it is...There is my baby..." He crawled down and kissed her stomach, laying his head across it as a tear escaped his eye. It rolled down his face and landed on her belly as he just smiled.*
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would simply lie there and utter the word sorry, her eyes fixating their gaze upon evan as he placed his head upon her stomach, the sensation of a small amount of liquid hitting her stomach coming true. "W-are you okay?" she asked towards the teary hyuuga*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) shook his head yes as he said "I just can't believe it's finally happening...I'm going to have a family..." More tears escaped his eyes as he pulled away from her stomach and sat there staring at the ceiling.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Hm....Have you always dreamed of having a family...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I-I told you that silly...Remember...?
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Right...sorry..my mind is at a blank....
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Having a baby is no joke haha....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I know...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: I feel so...useless and tired all the time now...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ..I can release some of your chakra to release the stress lover...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Its alright...~
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled as he pulled her closer, he then kissed her his lips smashing against hers as he said "I love you...So much Misaki...~" He then brushed his tounge against her lips, trying to invite himself into her mouth as he continued to lick her lips waiting to see if she accepted his tounge or not.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (brb)
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (sorry.)
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (been going around cleaning for my mom etc..)

<br><font color=yellow>*Kugayashi, Saito(Shulker1000) lays down within his bed wandering what to do. He seems to be alone for the time being within his village. Everyone else but him seems to be alseep or away somehwere he's not sure what to do right now.*

<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: .....
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and pulled out a blank peice of paper. Throwing it toward her he said "Apply your chakra to the paper and one possibly two of five things will happen...: One, it will set a blaze meaning Fire. Two, it will crumble meaning Earth. Three, it will it will wrinkle meaning Lightning. Four, it will split in two meaning Wind. Five it will become damp meaning Water..." He inhailed and folded his arms, staring at the girl.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) looked at her sensei as he pulled out a peice of paper. Since paper couldn't be thrown, it fell to the ground infont of her, she bent down to pick it up while listening to his words. She looked closely and carefully at the paper, focusing her chakra into it and awaiting the effects. Suddenly the paper burts into flames,  turning into mere ashes from her hand and falling to the ground. "It looks like I have fire.", she said, returning her field of vision to her sensei.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Well...That is a bit of bad luck...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Why is that?

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Lil Hyuuga baby lol)
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: You want to hold him??
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I don't know...I've never held a baby...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Haha, here just hold it like this*Demonstrates*
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would then get up from her seat and walk over to Evan, gently handing the baby over, making sure he got a good grip upon the child before retracting her own arms*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Oh...O-okay...
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) grabbed the child, craddling him in his arms as he said "Hey there little guy..." He smiled down at the baby and rocked his arms.*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (He is a few months old seeing as how we ts'd xD)
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: He looks alot like you~

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Heh....We finally did it~
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: *Nod*
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Sure did haha.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: (Brb)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: ...

<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Are yyou alright?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah....
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: You sure..?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Yeah...But um, do you know anyone who has a fire element.
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: No, why?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I need one for my Genin...
<br><font color=green>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) says: Dont know anyone at all.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Damn...
<br><font color=green>*Frozen, Ice.(Pylar2) says: CAN I BORROW SOME CHOCOLATE?
<br><font color=yellow>*Frozen, Ice.(Pylar2) is streaking.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) smiled and handed her the baby as he said "That's a bummer....I need to get back to my Genin though..."*
<br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Miyasake3) would simply cradle her baby and nod over at Evan. "Okay~" she said with a grin, staring down at their child*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: I'll visit you later~.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Bad news.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Hmm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: No one in Kirigakure has Fire as their element...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Oh, I see.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: It's alright.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: But thank you for searching, I appreciate it.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: This is such a bothersome thing...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: It is alright, don't worry about it. -smiles-
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm....There must be something I can teach you...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (lol temporary paralysis-
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Ohhh yeah.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hm...There is one technique I can teach you...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Hmmm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: It can help you guys in the exams...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Really?
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: What is it?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: It's a ninjutsu that is able to paralyze an enemy.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Hmmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Sounds pretty advanced
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: It's called Temporary Payalysis Technique.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: I see/
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: .*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: It's a D-rank jutsu that is able to hold anyone as long as you are able to maintain your chakra...This technique drains at an insane rate so be careful...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Hmmm, alright.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Now you will be able to attack once they are restrained...But it might not be wise to.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Alright, I shall use it wisely than.
<br><font color=green>*Momo(Momodakid) says: (Lemme come and Yuki some people up)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Good...I guess I'll show you a demonstration...
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Right.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Hoe, don't even I will lolfuck juu.)
<br><font color=green>*Momo(Momodakid) says: (o.o)
<br><font color=green>*Momo(Momodakid) says: (i just wanted to make friends, gosh)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (*just made Evan mad :D&)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (No, it's hard to make me mad lol.)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (damn, he not mad)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (WHY AREN'T U MAD)
<br><font color=yellow>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) sighed and stared at his Genin, he then said "What is about to happen is, your body will be restrained by what feels like steel rope being tied around your body. No matter what you do it is impossible to break free from this jutsu which makes it perfect for capture missions as well as assassination missions..." He then began a small string of seals as he forced his chakra out toward the Genin, the chakra would make it feel like he had described as he said "You can try moving if you like..."*
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Hey~
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (Evan nigga)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (Why u leave)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Because, power outage.)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (o.o)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (well, Trin did a RP, o.o)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay, where is Trin?)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (she logged)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (X.x waiii.)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (anyway)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (i responded to your rp when you logged)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (it was basically just be being caught lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Before my power went out I RPed letting you out X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (kay)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) was released from the jutsu. She awaited her sensei to show her how it was done.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: There are just three seals to complete the jutsu...The Rat, Ram, and finally Tiger.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Once you are done, expand your chakra and push it toward your opponent.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Right.
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (how many rps for that D rank?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: )4.)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (k)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) nodded as she heard Evan, she raised an eyebrow and thought for a moment how the jutsu was done. Once she figured she could do it, she decided to give it a try.  Perfoming the rat, ram, and tiger seal, she attempted to expell her chakra outwards, attempting to bind Evan with it. However upon performing the seals, nothing had happened, it was as if she performed the seals for nothing ."Hmmm...", she thought to herself, scratching the back of her head and wondering what she may have done wrong. Right after her failed first attempt, she tried once more.*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmmm...Keep trying Dawny~
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) closed her eyes and focused on her chakra, trying to manipulate it to the best of her ability. Upon opening her eyes, she performed the seals once more, confident that Evan would be trapped her the jutsu. Once again her jutsu had no effect, not even the slighest tingle of chakra would be felt by Evan at all. She stood there with her arms folded, wondering what it is she had to do. Suddenly a light bulb appeared within her mind with an idea on how she might be able to do it, and it was probably what she was supposed to do anyway.*
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: To get my contract wit teh Slugs...what ish neccisary, will that be done by admins, or ICly obtained through training of sorts?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (You already have it X.x you're able to summon a small slug. Like what the Slug Boss's mini form looks like.)
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: I see.)
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: I need the jutsu and the perk then)\
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Cuz I haz neither.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (What perk X.x)
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Thought there was a perk for Contracts)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Ders your jutsu.)
<br><font color=green>*Mizuki(Keyarus1) says: Thanks.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Hang on, use it real quick.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Kay.)
<br><font color=yellow>*Dawn(Trinity606) smiled as she performed the hand seals once more, molding her chakra and sending it towards Evan, and hopefully binding him. She did the jutsu perfectly this time, sending her invisible strings of chakra in his direction, molding the chakra so that it restricted him and paralyzed him. Dawn felt the chakra drain of the technique and quickly ceased her actions, letting go of the bind and placing her hands on her knees gasping for air.*
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (my last rp)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (check my logs for the last rp before that)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (what time is chunnins?)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (do you think we should do 2 man squads in the FOD? since the pb is a bit low?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yeah, we will.)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (It'll be in randomized groups more then likely.)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: (should i give myself the jutsu now?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yar.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Dats what needs to be in the description.)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Good job Dawn, I'm proud~
<br><font color=green>*Dawn(Trinity606) says: Thank you Evan sensei.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (Evan)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (?)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (Would u care if i move to Konoha ICly?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Yes.)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (Why?)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (No IC reason to move lol.)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (no one here o.o)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (not gonna sit in an abandoned village)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Theres like 4-5 Kiri shinobi...)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (Momo, you JUST now started playing.)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (o.o)
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Momo(Momodakid) says: (guess i'm gonna stay here with no one to help me D:)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: (X.x)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Evan(Evanalmighty) says: Mmm...Dawn you seen that Dunken kid...?
<br><font color=green>*Kagami(ShinyPierce4) says: Didn't think a fisherman like me could be fooled by a couple of girls on their periods.
<br><font color=green>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) says: I'll be back in a second...
<br><font color=green>*Kagami(ShinyPierce4) says: Unless they just naturally smell like that...
<br><font color=yellow>*Kagami(ShinyPierce4) shivers*
<br><font color=yellow>*Kyanberu, Alastor(LordxPatrick) Runs off towards the shops, smiling to himself and mumbling under his breath.*

<br><font color=green>*Natsu(Guest-1084507334) says: When can we begin?
<br><font color=yellow>*Herakuru(Dillion13) was one of this best Hyyuga in his clan, he was alway's training on his most famous Jyuuken Gentle fist stlye, one day he was hitting a log "Huff, Huff" Herakuru would say as he would begin to get dazed from all the training that he does, but he does not give it he keep's hitting it more and more until, 'SNAP!" The log had broken in half this had shown how strong Herakuru had become in the day's back then he could not even leave a mark on a log. Falling down he had begin to close his eye's falling off into the sleep. Thinking about the Main branch and the side branch of the Hyuuga clan.

He opened his eye's to find out that it was night, he was worried tha the missed his meeting. He had heard some rumbuling in the bushes he had looked around and claped his hand's together. 'Byukugan!" Herakuru had said. He looked around and had seen somoenes Charka. He then got into his Juuyken Gentle fist style.

The stance he had been training on all his life, well not all but most of the time. He used this stance in all of his fight's it would be able to take away you're use of Charka if it hit you. Herakuru threw a Paper bomb into the bushes where he had seen the man's Charka.

It had exlpoded and Herakuru watched as the man jumped up into the air. He was very weird looking, the man landed on the ground right infront of Herakuru, he did not waste any time the man tryed to hit him right in the face, but with his Gentle fist style it was a easy thing to dodge it.

He moved right under the attack hitting the man in the stomach trying to stop his Charka flow, hitting he Herakuru kept on going he would not stop he would hit him on the arm and the shoulder, then doing a 360 spin he come's back around and hit's the man with his palm.

Making him go flying. This was so eas for Herakuru but then he was caught off guard getting hit in the face he flew back, Herakuru was very injured and he was not able to move as fast as he could before, he knew now that this guy was a heavy hitter. Herakuru waited until the man had come closer.

Then putting one of his hand's down close to hit shoe's and the other one high up he then would get into his new found move stance, a Green circle would apprear right around him and Herakuru would begin to hit the man "2 hand's 4 hand's, 6 hand's, 8, hand's 16 hand's, 24 hand's, 32 hand's, Ahh!! 64 hand's!" Herakuru would say as he would hit the man with his palm making him go flying. The man was out cold or maybe even dead. Herakuru had realized tha this was just a test. To test his Gentle fist style.*
