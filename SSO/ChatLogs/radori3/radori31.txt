<br><font color=yellow>*Hozuki, Sirozan(XxkasukuxX) Sirozan begins wondering the outskirts of The Hidden Mist at dusk, Which his superiors tells him that it's dangerous, Blowing them off and begins looking for a massive water source, Since his village is running low on A hydratation liquid. He begins walking and thinking about the lectures he'll hear from his superiors when they hear he returns from outside the village, Before he can remember, he looks up and it;'ss very dark out thinking, "Well, I need to hurry before wild animals start thinking they can attack me..." after this statement he is very cautious walking about. Looking back and uses his peripheral vision to his advantage. After walking several minutes he gettings very bored and even considering returning home. But, this actually made him want to travel faster, he then crouches down and begins to scout a tree branch and locks on and releases his stance and goes soar towards the branch, then begins to get a rhythm taking one foot at a time on branch consecutively. He then hears something like someone following him, lashing out his kunai and attaches a wire on it and fires it's behind him as a trap wire. He then feels this same wire move and stops and gulps thinking, "As my predictions was right." and says in a calm voice, "Come out, I can tell your there...". He then gets into a basic fighting stance cleching his fists and yells, "COME ON NOW, YOU CAN'T HIDE!" then he hears a tree branch breaks close to him and his heart begins to beat very fast. The figure begins to appear from what of the dark with Sirozan's kunai stating, "This trap was successful, Your senses are redefined, But You Should have stayed home, Boy." Sirozan's teeth begins to clamp hearing, "Boy." He begins to walk from the darkness smirking, touching his headband and swinging Sirozan's kunai on a finger. He looks like clan from the Hidden Mist called "Hoshigaki" with a rogue headband and with rags on his back. Sirozan then comments on his headband, "I see your -where- from The Hidden Mist...?" with his guard on even more alert. The Hoshigaki then asks, "That trash of a village? Psshh, Anywhere is better then there..." Sirozan then jumps down from the tree on to the ground with the Hoshigaki following him. Sirozan then thinks, "He's following me so he must be a lethal threat...I have to attack off-guard so i can continue searching." The Hoshigaki then pulls out a jar from his kunai holster and begins to consume the contents of it saying, "Ahh...That's goood water...Now, This is what's going to happen. Your going to give me all your suppiles or Die...or, i can rob you AND kill you." with a maniacally laugh. Sirozan says, "You won't do either you punk!" and picks up a giant stick the size of a 4x4 and perpares to attack the Hoshigaki. The Hoshigaki then throws the jar to the ground and shatters it perpares a defense. Sirozan then begins swinging the stick violently with relatively ease matching the Hoshigaki's stolen kunai. Sirozan then props up the stick on the ground and throws his body weight into a kick towards the Hoshigaki's gut. The Hoshigaki then wipes the blood from his mouth and leans up and perfroms some handseals and shouts, "Water Style : Water Clone Technique!" then punches the clones expelling all of the water onto the ground. Sirozan suprised kneels down and uses his finger to lick up some water and he starts to sulp it up saying, ' AHHHH! Water taste so good...This is going to be clockwork now!" then his muscles begin to pump alittle with every sip. The Hoshigaki then tells Sirozan that he better look up and Sirozan sweepkicks The Hoskigaki, The Hoshigaki is suprise by his speed and elbows his jaw and begins to start flying backwards. Sirozan then grabs his stick and begins to walk and stops to zooms into the place he elbowed The Hoshigaki, barely hereing the Hoshigaki annouce his Water Style : Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave trying to outrun it then getting hit dead on to the back,"W-What..NOOOOooo..."when the blast settled he found him self inside a bubble of water. The Hoshigaki then pops up with a ripped shirt and taking deep breaths looking fatigue saying, "I underestimated you, Now it's time to see the real power of the Hoshigaki Clan!" rushing into the floating injured Sirozan perform and landing harsh connecting chains of combos with very loud grunts then Hoshigaki says, "See you are weak, Hidden Mist trash..Should have stayed home child, Heh.." Sirozan then begins to wake softly saying, "Well....I told you wasn't going to kill me...or rob me......NOW TO KEEP MY PROMISE!" with a electric voice. With Sirozan's rage on a new peak his body begin to liquify and he comments on his teeth saying, "My Teeth...I'll Rip You Apart!!!!" The Hoshigaki then is stunned by his transformation. Sirozan races towards the Hoshigaki and throws everything at him with bashing combos connecting and breaking every move the hit touches. Sirozan then picks up the nearly dead Hoshigaki and states, "You gave me a fight i thought i wasa going to lose...Thank you, For this Great Fight, But you have to die...But, Before that. I'll tell you my name, I am Sirozan from the Hozuki clan, Hozuki, Sirozan!" he then tosses the almost lifeless body of the Hoshigaki then, soaks up the water like a sponge. Then, swims up towards the sky and goes shuffling into his pockets and hosters thinking, "It's -gotta- be in here..." and then opens a pocket wide and finds a underwater lighter saying, "Yes, Now I can finish this." after he flickers the lighter and surrounds it in a small water bubble putting one hand on the bubble performs couple of handseals and shouting, "Water Style : Water Dragon Bullet!!!!!" a large amount of water formed into a giant, powerful dragon with the underwater lighter infused into the water is rushed at the almost-lifeless Hoshigaki the size of a large oak tree is expelled into the  Body of the Hoshigaki causing a large devasting wave of water covering alot of the forest with a small explosion of the underwater lighter inploding. After the water settles, He slowly floats down reverting from his Water Hydration Technique, Looking at the now officially lifeless corpse, with complete white eyes with -no- iris. of The Hoshigaki. Sirozan didn't waste no time giving the Hoshigaki pity and limped and buckled towards the Hidden Mist Village with required water inside his body.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Kalen(Deeksixx) 

Lightning Seals: This character is capable of completing strings of handseals within a few seconds so long as it doesn't extend beyond ten handseals. Anything more can completed in half a minute. 

Lightning Reflexes: This character's reaction speed is impeccable. They can contend with a gate user within the first four gates and dodge a number of their strikes. They can dodge large projectiles at close range, though they are incapable of dodging consecutive weapons; and fighting a gate user of the fifth gate forces them to block a number of strikes, as dodging becomes harder consecutively. 

Strength: This Character has a great deal of body power. Their physical power is more than just impressive. Their strikes are capable of rattling bones, and an unguarded strike can break bones. This character has enough strength to take on medium sized beasts such as those who are summoned via contract on equal grounds. Note: This perk is not compatible with Oukashou or any other strength replacing techniques.

Tailed Chakra: This character's chakra pools are so immense, that it can match that of a tailed beast once matured. An untrained student easily has the reserves to match an untrained jounin. The character with this perk's reserves appear endless, at times, and once they've hit the rank of jounin, their chakra levels easily tops that of the average kage. The chakra pool pushes the character four untrained ranks upward when they are untrained, and five untrained ranks when they are indeed trained.

<br><font color=yellow>*Sozen(Radori3) Heightened Reflexes: This character's reflexes are even more impressive than that of a character with the reflex perk. They are capable of dodging projectiles at medium range, and are capable of trading blows and blocking effectively with fast characters. 

Speed: This character's speed is amazing. They can move like the wind, and breeze by the competition with ease. 

Blinding Seals: This character can complete up to thirty handseals within a minute.

Will of Fire: The Will of Fire is found in Konoha Shinobi who embody the fire that drove the ancient Senju Clan to greatness. They never give up on their philosophy, and have the strongest resolve. They fight on, and will never give up, finding the will to fight even after their body has failed them. They are capable of rising to fight against once after they've been defeated. After they've been put down a second time, their body will no longer move, until they have been healed, though this rarely stops them from trying

Exotic Weapon Proficiency: This character can handle a number of exotic weapons that don't have a specific perk set to them.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Sozen(Radori3) 's eyelids fluttered momentarily as a maniac-esque grin that displayed his feral nature in a manner that couldn't be done any better. The shinobi's hair hung over his brow subtly, conjuring up a shadow of which casted over his frame that only added to his animalistic nature. Sozen's shoulders hunched over and in that moment, they'd begin to rise and lower in an erratic fashion. Strained laughs could be heard from the throat of the Uchiha; he threw his head back, hand covering his face in attempt to ease his fit of laughter. 

In a moment or two his goal would be met, chest heaving as he'd take in a number of consecutive breaths inwards through his nostrils. "That was pretty funny. .You? Defeat. .An Uchiha?" Sozen muttered through deep inhales. His tone was mocking to say the least. He'd stare down at the man before him as that same, maniac grin split the lengths of his cheeks, revealing a full-row of teeth. 

And then, he was silent. Sozen's eyes widened, his sclera apparently blood shot as the man's once jet-black irises transitioned to a deep hue of red. Three tomoe-like figures emerged from the sea of said color, spinning rapidly for a few seconds before coming to a stop. "You. .Defeat an Uchiha," Sozen reiterated with an amused grin.*
