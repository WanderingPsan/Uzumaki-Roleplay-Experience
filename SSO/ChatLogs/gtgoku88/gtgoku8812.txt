<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: Food, food, food, food. - Mon Oct 19 03:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: Let's have fun! - Mon Oct 19 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Well this was a rare occurence.

Someone who actually was slow enough that he could feasibly respond to? Swiftly, he falls into a stance of his own, ans as Shoji closes in, the brute's right forearm shoots, aiming to parry off Shoji's blow.

Assuming success, a right handed haymaker is delivered, intent on punching the boy square in the chest. Clearly, just as Shoji had done, Maloth didn't seem keen on holding anything back.* - Mon Oct 19 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Well. . This was strange!

On reflex, his head jolted back, clearly he's more than a little startled.

The full limit of his battle stance is employed, nevertheless, prompting his hands to move with heightened adrenaline, grabbing at the shinobi's tongue before it can strike. Using that as leverage, and taking full advantage of his herculean strength,  the brute hopes that this limits Shoji's mobility.

Moving in now, his right hand is again launched, all with the intent on striking the strange specimen square in the chest. Notably, his strikes seem to be a bit faster.* - Mon Oct 19 04:16:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. 

Well this was crazy. . .The intestines speed around his body, and admittedly they give Maloth actual trouble. He struggles, each muscle being used to pry himself free. ". . .! Is monster!" 

Yet, it was becoming eerily apparent. Even as the intestines were being pried away, it was going to take far too much time -- the opponent had to be dealt with as soon as possible. In no time at all -- considering how accustomed the brute was becoming in the application of this jutsu -- the first two Hachimon states are activated, revitalizing his body, and prompting the beast to propel forward.

By now, he's greatly empowered, and easily rips through the bondage. 

With a hammer in hand, the brute closes in, aiming to slam his demonic weapon against the head of the zombie.  Considering his rapid growth in strength, and the power being augumented by his hammer, Shoji's head was likely to be crushed like a grape. 

The floor suffers damage as well, as the momentum travels, forming a crater.* - Mon Oct 19 04:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The acids actually do nothing actually.

In the event that some actually are flowing to his eyes, the male dips or uses a limp to shield his face. Nevertheless, the battle was to continue onward.

They sizzle and burn, but at last, there isn't anything that's going to truthfully get past his hide.  Considering his defensive act against the attack, the brute continued onward, aiming to slam the hammer harshly against Shoji's frame, again clearly aiming to reduce the zombie to mush.
* - Mon Oct 19 04:33:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Shoji was too fast. 

In spars, the brute never really enjoyed having to chase his opponent. As Shoji flees, he depowers and simply begins with cautious step away. 

"No wan' figh' 'nymore. Is no play chase," Maloth declared in his exit. He motions for Paine to come with -- since he wasn't exactly going to leave the girl with these demonic maniacs.* - Mon Oct 19 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: He is strong. - Mon Oct 19 04:47:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) thinks: And take little pieces of his meat and rub them through the bone flakes... - Mon Oct 19 04:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||It paid to be a tank.

None of the attacks really seemed to phase him, and with cautious steps backwards, Maloth continued to move towards the exit. He gives odd glances to Baylae, as it was pretty clear. . . The dark skinned woman played in a part in this. 

Regardless, if not stopped, he and Paine would be off.* - Mon Oct 19 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) whispers: Wan' go home. - Mon Oct 19 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) gives a glance to the Concealed Figure.

". . .Yo! What be name?"* - Mon Oct 19 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What's up? - Mon Oct 19 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He wasn't talking to Baen.

"Is tal' for Mask man! Get tell. . Be one make Maloth sister go 'pear!"* - Mon Oct 19 05:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: ...It's like he's trying to speak to me...I know it. - Mon Oct 19 05:11:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continues to point towards the ANBU Agent!

"Wha' be name!?"* - Mon Oct 19 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: What be name? Names are things we call things so we know what they are. Silly Maloth. - Mon Oct 19 05:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) squints.

He gives a glance to Baen -- having his own source of animosity towards the Kaguya. But. . . more attention is given to the Agent.

A grunt is given, and a hand falls onto his hammer. "Is thin' get tol'. . . Kill Lyala! Where be Lyala?!"* - Mon Oct 19 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He knew the struggles of understanding people just like him.

He pauses for a bit. . . Unsure how to truthfully respond. Hell, the giant is unsure what the fuck had even been said. ". . .Is sister! Nee' find. . .!" Maloth says, grunting again. His hammer is settled back on his back, and casually, the brute is prepared to walk away.

"Keep look. . . Is 'member body. . Is 'member fae." If not stopped, the fiend would have exitted the mansion and began en route home. He had come to Konoha for no reason considering there was no dual training exercise.* - Mon Oct 19 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) returns to Kumo at last.

He falls by Khalil's side.* - Mon Oct 19 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) is mildly surprised at Khalil's sudden affection.

"Hrm. . ? Is no nee' fo' sorry. Maloth jus' have thin' do! Is get tire o' Konoho," the brute admits. Outside of a few good fights, the village didn't really have much to offer.* - Mon Oct 19 06:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) allows such to happen, he has no squalms with the affection.

As a note, he still suffered from burns, which were less noticeably by now. . But the brute never once bothered to get tended too, forcing his flesh to be hardened a tad.

"Mmm. Can cook?" he says in reference to Khalil.* - Mon Oct 19 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Yeah, I will cook. - Mon Oct 19 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I will even wear a maid outfit!  - Mon Oct 19 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Come on! - Mon Oct 19 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) raised a brow.

Khalil seemed different -- and not just in terms of hair color. Whatever had happened, it was a welcomed change, as the Yamanshi's act inflated his massive ego. At the woman's behest, Maloth would head towards the bathroom. 

"If say so. No take long," the brute declared. He practically kicks the door down, and heads right on in. As claimed, the bath tub is filled with hot water already. Stripping, Maloth is briskly heading into said tub, allowing his own filth to be washed on off.* - Mon Oct 19 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The bath would take ten minutes tops.

Once cleansed, the brute wraps a towel around his waist and make way towards the kitchen. His eyes shoot open briefly, mesmorized by the enarmoring sight of heaven -- which was a giant buffet of food to Maloth.

Eagerly, he takes a seat, mouth practically salivating at the thought of devouring the entirety of the meal. Briefly, his glance falls over Kahlil, who seemingly wore a partially skimpy maid dress. The new look was approved of, certainly enough. Still. . . the entire sequence was surreal, and made Maloth somewhat suspicious.

". . Wha' happen? Khalil am . . act differen'. ."* - Mon Oct 19 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) proceeded to eat in the only way he knew how.

Fast. Greedily. On occasions appearing as if he was going to choke due to taking too big of a bite.

Amidst the rapid eating, the brute nods along, clearly finding the new look to be appealing. "Is better look," Maloth b riefly comments, giving Khalil the ol' up and down. The change in looks, and the change in personality, it was a welcomed changed sure enough. Maybe Khalil was finally warming up to her new role.* - Mon Oct 19 07:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued to gorge on the delicacies that Khalil had to offer. 

He grunted and mumbled excitedly, clearly taking pleasure in the flavors and sensations that were stored within the treat. 

A single eye follows the Yamanshi, as the andrognyous individual makes their approach, their tongue lashing and lacing Maloth's flesh with saliva. It trailed, going in a downward path, up until Khalil had reached his crouch. The action is swift to sprout arousal for the combative-minded behemoth.

With two hands latched along his schlong, Khalil would easily be able to feel an increase in heat, size, and hardness. Slowly, Maloth's cock was swelling like a blimp, his lower body fidgeting on instict as the pleasant feelings ran wild.* - Mon Oct 19 07:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) hummed softly as Khalil displayed impeccable skill.

For the trap's effort, Maloth is swift to reach full size -- a ridiculous, gargantuan length of thirteen inches. Unfortunately for the apparent soul-suvivor of the Yamanshi clan, the swelling occured as he sought to deep throat Maloth's oversized member. It enlarges amidst the process, no doubt making the entire ordeal more uncomfortable or difficult, and stretching the poor soul's throat to the max capacity.

Fully erect, the brute is grunted with a bit more vigor, his hips moving on reflex to push or prod more of his cock meat into the trap's mouth.

Muscus-filled saliva inevitably trickles along his sexual member, making his length slick and slimey, lubcricated for continued lewd acts. Considering his enthusiasm and forwardness, assuming no outright resistence, ten full inches of cock would have forcibly pushed into Khalil's cranium -- hopefully he could react well enough.  Meanwhile. . more eating ensues.* - Mon Oct 19 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Given Khalil's detailed attention, Maloth is no longer able to hold back.

By the time she's reached his golf-ball like nuts, the brute is grunting, moaning even -- in pure, unfiltered pleasure. A hand rushes down, holding the feminine figure in place, allowing Khalil additional time to pleasure his scotom, suckling on each of the testicles. 

The lewd, sloppy sound effects of the suckles  echo throughout the room, and only serve to futher entice the beast.

By the time Khalil had once more returned to the tip, in his moment of weakness, Maloth gives in. His cock contracts spontaneously, releasing thick cum from his cock slit, that roars out to plaster itself onto the trap's face and clothes. There was slight embarressment. . . He didn't usually reach his climax so swiftly -- in ten minutes by now.* - Mon Oct 19 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He was getting a bit fatigued himself, and seemed to be nodding off.

"Mm. . 'Kay. Not nee' ask 'gain," Maloth replies, being more than happy to invade Khalil's body again. Once the Yamanshi had dozedoff, he carries him off to bed.* - Mon Oct 19 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Maloth! Hey hey. - Mon Oct 19 20:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) makes his approach, dragging his hammer along the way.

"Hey! How do?"* - Mon Oct 19 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I do good! Mmm! Hey hey.  - Mon Oct 19 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: C-Can I carry that hammer? - Mon Oct 19 21:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks.

He holds the hammer ahead. "Is can try. . No touch spike," he says, referencing the spikes that ran around most of the hilt. Of course, the very end was devoid of such obstacles.* - Mon Oct 19 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) gives a blank glance. He didn't see any blood, and thus wasn't all too worried.

A hand stretches out, calling for the item. 

"Is 'kay. .?"* - Mon Oct 19 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Pft... I am fine.. - Mon Oct 19 22:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Can use. .? - Mon Oct 19 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: N-No. - Mon Oct 19 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head and gestures to the mountain.

"Try! Hit mountain har'."* - Mon Oct 19 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: -- - Mon Oct 19 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: W-What? - Mon Oct 19 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm? Try. - Mon Oct 19 22:14:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Fine.. - Mon Oct 19 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was mildly impressed. The hammer wasn't an easy thing to wield at all.

As the femboy struggled, the brute made his approach, grabbing the hammer away from Khalil once the blow had been developed. "Is. . mo' stron' than Maloth is thought! Li' master, Paine," he notes. Had Khalil recalled Paine's appearance, she'd clearly be able to note that the skinny woman could hit on par with him , even if she was a tenth of his size.

"Maloth e'er teach move?"* - Mon Oct 19 22:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Uhh... teach what move? - Mon Oct 19 22:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Know lotta move! Paine is teach. - Mon Oct 19 22:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Oh! Paine can teach me? - Mon Oct 19 22:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Noo. Maloth teach what is get show. - Mon Oct 19 22:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) makes a quite step forward. His body is held in an erect position, allowing his right leg to shoot ahead. It's an upward kick -- and while there was no actual target, the form as perfect.

"See? Is special kick. Send people up."* - Mon Oct 19 22:41:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Oh.. - Mon Oct 19 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: So all I have to do is just kic my leg upward? - Mon Oct 19 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Sure!~ - Mon Oct 19 22:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

Although, this was a lot more than just kicking upward.

It was a skill that was based on combining flexibility, balance, and strength. He got into a ready pose, and by now, an object had been set in the center of the road. A boulder. 

"Watch Maloth do 'gain. . " 

Without a second word, the giant makes his approach steadily, both feet diligently planted onto the ground, The bulk of his focus was going into the sequence, clearly enough. At once, the right leg juts in an upward fashion again, his appendagescurrently acting as if there were no actual joints in his body to serve as a detriment. Indeed, speedily, the leg would have moved from it's rest position, striking exactly at a ninety degree angle.

Giving Maloth's monstrous strength, the kick is enough to send the boulder flying twenty feet into the air, before eventually crash landing onto the ground. The floor quakes underneath the objects weight. "Is get?"* - Mon Oct 19 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Sheepishy, he smiles, finding the entire sequence amusing.

After a good chortle, Maloth's hammer is set back onto his back, and he's making an approach. A hand rests onto Khalil's shoulder, giving a gentle rub. "'Is kay. . .?" He asks with a genuine concern -- even if he was laughing.* - Tue Oct 20 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I-I'm fine.. - Tue Oct 20 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Good. . ! Village is ge'. . Mucha quiet. - Tue Oct 20 00:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Sigh, so quiet. - Tue Oct 20 00:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Tutu. - Tue Oct 20 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm. .  - Tue Oct 20 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Wan' have mission? - Tue Oct 20 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Sure sure. - Tue Oct 20 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) digs into his pockets, retrieving a series of notes and missions that had yet to be completed.

This had been swiped long ago, considering Amaya was hardly ever around to keep track of things. Eventually, a simple mission was drawn. Given his inability to read, write. . . count -- or anything academic for that matter, Maloth just hands the scroll on over.

It depicts a simple mission, finding someone's lost pearls. 'When Kenshin came to town, the entire village was in disarray! I was running towards the Monk Temple, hoping that I could find shelter or protect there. But the tremors from the Speed Star's strikes forced me to trip. I lost my pearls within the rubble. . .Please, help me find it!'

A simple mission to uncover pearls.* - Tue Oct 20 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Banodo, URAIN(RoboCat) says: I want youi to take my special bones and make weapons from them. - Tue Oct 20 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) yawns.

These days had been long, hard and partially boring. He falls by Khalil's side again, a hand tapping against the trap's lower back to gain attention.

"Yo. How be day?"* - Wed Oct 21 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunted a bit, although the slap really did nothing to harm his body.

His hand continued to move before resting at Khalil's ample bum, and giving a decent squeeze. In no time, Maloth was standing up, and giving the area a survey. The Yamanshi wasn't lying. . . that was for sure.

Kumogakure had seen better days -- especially after Kenshin had come into town and devestated the entire village.

"Yes. . . 'lways quiet. Feel li' jus' Maloth an' Khalil be here," the brute replies, of course ignoring the NPCs that likely roamed around. "How think 'pose fix?"* - Wed Oct 21 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) abruptly moves to pound his own chest a few times.

"Is li' chief! No touch pap'er. . . But can give mission thing!" Maloth replies, a bit proud of his positioning -- even if it wasn't absolute power, at least not yet.

"Mm. . .Coul' try get mo' power. Wha' think Maloth should do for make village have people more?" The dimwit questioned, his eyes shifting to meet Khalil's. Clearly, he valued the Yamashi's opinion.* - Wed Oct 21 19:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Mmmmm...  - Wed Oct 21 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: We could have some sort of... party or celebration in this village and invite many people? - Wed Oct 21 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Party. . ? -- <*Turns to face Kuro*>? - Wed Oct 21 20:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) gives a glance to Khalil, then back to Kuro.

"Mmm? Why no work?"* - Wed Oct 21 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyu&#39;Mc(Sorasen) says: Hm...? - Wed Oct 21 20:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Well, I don't know... seems like we will have to do something in-order to get this village back up. - Wed Oct 21 20:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Considering the lack of activity in Kumogakure, Maloth once more sought to further his training. Taking off out to the outskirts, the giant lug of a man eventually breaches a secluded area -- one devoid of all human life, even Khalil's. He knew that to achieve the next state would require an exceptional amount of focus and drive, and thus having distractions around would certainly detract from his overall ability.

Taking a seat, the 'shinobi' or barbarian first begins with the mental exercises.

One leg crosses over the other, and his oversized eyes promptly shut. Already, he could feel goosebumps manifesting aroundh is form, as the simple thought of actually achieving the 3rd Gate filled him with overwhelming joy. "Nee'. . . Get mo' stron'. . ." the giant muttred to himself.

His mind briefly wandered to the past, recalling his initial struggles to unlock the almighty Hachimon. Subsequently, it also drifted, recalling the eventual triumphs and success in the endeavors -- and clear that was just the tip of the iceberg. Already, his chakra was roaring on the inside, fluxuated in a violent, unrestrained process. It continously builds up, before each fragment of his ethereal energy source communes into one spot, and begins to forcibly overload the first Chakra Gate point.

By now, this is a trivial task, as Maloth was accustomed to breaking into the gate on am oment's notice. He regularly used the state of power to aid in his spars of battles, considering the lack of versatility that came with being a purely taijutsu-minded behemoth.  Indeed. even his muscles had grown conditioned or accustomed to the rapid and habitual application of the state of power, to the point that his stamina was steadily rising to accomodate for the constant usage.

It was great, and thus effortlessly, as the first state of power is broken through, Maloth is pushing on, movingonto the next. It's closely located nearby, thus the chakra carries with the momentum and again begins to pry away at the nextr restrain. This was a sequence not based on chakra control, or your overall amount of energy -- The only reason chakra was involved due to the fact that it carried your consciousness or Will Power.

And that's what was key.

It was about how much dedication you placed forth, and how badly you wanted to achieve the greater level of power. Just as with the last, Maloth is casually able to break the second restraint, albeit it takes a lot more effort than you would anticipate. Regardless, once that's completed, there's a greater level of power added onto his already gargantuan levels of strength -- and alongwith that, his body releases the stored physical energy, revitalizing his frame.

This was particularly important, as prior to this, Maloth's frame was experiencing a slight state of being overheated. There was a very subtle glazing of bodily fluid -- sweat -- pooling around his dark-skinned flesh. Nevertheless, the second the Gate of Healing had been achieved, a soothing sensation overcomes each cell in his body. It was as if someone had released a calming hot springs internally to calm with the endeavors.

But alas. . . There was no time to sit and wait. He was a man on a mission. "Now play real for!" the brute declared mentally. He was ready. From this point, the chakra moved ahead, traveling and searching the body for one specific tenketsu, or chakra node -- the Gate of Life. 

The metaphysical entity shook and quiver in recoil, resisting the un-natural act of being busted open. Regardless of the insubordination, Maloth was relentless and uncompromising, continuing with his mental efforts to break and access the third state of power. Metaphorically, 'cracks' could be felt spawn, forcin g just a smidget of the power to be felt.  His muscles were contracting, and gaining a wealth of strength.

But more importantly, the blood flow along his body was accelerating, perhaps as a natural mechanisms to allow nutrition to spread a faster pace. The change in blood flowage is enough to force the coloration of his flesh to take on a reddish tint. It was faint, but still noticeable, even with his darken skin. Sweat was building up, although it hadn't yet reached the point where his 'sweat' could be confused with a viel of chakra. 

All through this, Maloth wore a pained expression, unable to take on the added discomfort, even with his penchant for pain. For several minutes, even as Khalil had approached, the brute kept at it. Clearly, he wasn't just meditating either, as his body was clearly under a great deal of stress, and was overworking itself. Having failed, in the end the hulking beast comes to a hault, a light pool of sweat building up underneath his bottom.

It spreads a tad, perhaps getting onto Khalil's shoes. WIth both eyes open, his gaze shifts on over to the feminine figure, a faint smile on his face. "How is be goin'? Is all good?" asks the beast, making small talk. The two didn't often get to converse nowadays with how busy he's been.
