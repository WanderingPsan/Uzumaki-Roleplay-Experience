<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) would be the judge of this entire commotion. He stomps on over towards Khali. Both hands speed ahead, grabbing the young male-trap by the hips or waist. Assuming success, Maloth indiscriminately flips the boy upside down, in attempt to examine his feminine frame. This entire thing was baffling. . How could Khalil be a boy, but appear so much like a girl?* - Thu Oct  8 19:27:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) isn't really listening to anyone right now. He's focused moreso on the anomality that was Khalil. Just from looks alone, it would be really hard to distinguish  the young YAmanashi from a legitimate female.

Eventually, one hand is all that's required to hold Khalil upside down.

Next, with the hand that's free, he's poking around the male's body. First at the chest, to see if he held a girl-like bosom, no matter how flat.* - Thu Oct  8 19:42:17 2015

"Tch. . No is man. Scream like girl! Is girl," Maloth states with a nod. He quickly turns towards the south and moves to lean back against the wall as previously done. A nod of the head is given towards the amazonian warrior known as Bremusa.* - Thu Oct  8 19:55:56 2015

It seemed Bremusa was from a tribe that held opposite morals than Maloth. His undermined females. .. Her's undermined males.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||As Bremusa had likely anticipate, the attack did little to deter his body. Instead of actually harming him, she found herself punching a literally wall of muscle. Maloth hardly  budged, and merely stared ahead at the futile attempt. Chest still puffed out, the brute begins to speak, wearing an arrogant smile -- even if he had just been defeated by a Suiton user a few moments prior to this. "What say 'bout mans? Nee' know. . . man more strongah than woman. . . Jus' how nature be. . . " the brute notes, shaking his head.

A hand goes to pat the dark-skinned amazon on the head. Heh. . . she tried.* - Thu Oct  8 20:22:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) doesn't even flinch. His body -- even his scrotom -- was hardened and refine. Along with this, he has immense tolernace for pain.

In no time, a hand speeds ahead, clutching at her neck -- not tightly. "Is no goo. . .  Real man know train nuts. . . Know be weak poin', so make no weak!" A clear reference to Saiyans training their tails.* - Thu Oct  8 20:29:13 2015

Just as he'd expect if this was one of the amazons that had roamed his clan. The grip is released, allowing Bremusa free mobility, before his gaze shifts on to the north. "Glad know what be. . . Tell Maloth. . .where from? Nee' go find 'ther people," he says, referencing Bremusa birth place. Indeed, he had every intent on tracking down these amazons to see what they had to offer, or what their culture was like.* - Thu Oct  8 20:38:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) scrunches his nose. If Bremusa was like how he thought, then this could be settled in one of two ways. Violence or a showmanship of superiority. An arm wraps around her waist, and is used to tossed the amazon over his shoulder.

"Nee' be quiet! Am man! Is woman," he shouts, feeling that Bremusa needed to be put into her place. Ah. . . the sexism that he grew up with, it was starting to show a little, especially since he knew he could win.* - Thu Oct  8 20:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) would have dragged Bremusa off against her will. She's set onto the sandy floor. He skips back, while doing a few stretching exercises to get his body back into a fighting move. This. . . was going to be fun, that much was certain. Of course, Maloth had no intention of going out, as that would certainly make the battle short-lived, and thus less exciting. Having done the proper exercises, his body begins to shift.

It lowers into a crouch, and both fists rise, giving a boxer-like stance. Eyes train onto Bremusa form. As his fist tightens, he gestures for the amazon to come at him. "If bea'. . . Maloth is make tell 'bout people. Like how village be! O' where they live," he says with a grin, though is clearly serious in his demands. Bremusa was a savage just as she was, even if titled 'Amazon.' And everyone knew brutes such as they handled things in one or two ways. Battle.* - Thu Oct  8 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) thinks: My money is on the winner. - Thu Oct  8 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) kept holding the stance up. His anticipation was steadily rising, until he simply could wait no longer. Thanfkully, Bremus hadn't yet attack, nor was she in the distance-- up until now. The second the Amazon is within range, his right palm shoots ahead, slamming righ into the center of the girl's chest. On impact, he pushes forward, aiming to send her body launching along the ground.

Of course, the main damage that was to spawn was going to be from the collision with the sand. As this happens, dust kicks up, briefly providing a cover over the region. ". . . Is not see?! Maloth lot more strong! Men be strong by nature. . . Is make sense. Men 'pose hunt an' figh'. . . woman jus' for cook, clean an' mate," taunted the brute. It was amazing how sexist these warrior tribes could be. Both eyes fall back onto Bremusa, waiting to see how well she'd respond. Muscles still are tensed to potentially be able to defend.* - Thu Oct  8 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||It all mattered little. "If what say be true. . . Then can bea' Maloth!" He taunts, the grin growing more wide. To met an amazon was perfect, as it would grant him the perfect opportunity to show that men were simply superior to woman. This wasn't opinion, it was fact that the male species was built to be more physically dominant or power. The dust had settled, and Bremusa was back at it again. Rather than take defensive measures, Maloth stood in place.

The kick comes straight forward, slamming against his stomach. . . yet it was all to no avail. Just as with the last blow, Bremusa would come to realize that Maloth's size and thickness wasn't just for show. A brick wall, the brute doesn't budge a single inch. "Is need hit more hard. . . Is all got!? Keep try hurt Maloth. . ." the tone is ooddly casual, which was odd considering how eccentric the beast tended to be in most scenarios. Was this all Bremusa had to offer?

Both eyes continue to train on her curvy, endowed frame. She could make a nice trophy once she had been broken down at least. That attitude. . . the sexist attitude, it had to be eradicated though. ". . .Is see how fight? No' think shoul' try learn from Maloth. . . Liddle 'man' no close strong 'nough fight this like," he says, having a leisure chat with Khalil while enduring the weak strikes from the haughty amazon.* - Thu Oct  8 21:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||"No matter. . .! Is can beat all amazon! Maloth think .. . Bremusa is mos' stron' . .?" He continues to chat even as the built female continued to send blows or strikes against his iron-like frame. It was all for nothing really. She lacked the proper strength and conditioning. 

Finally. . . He's tired of the games. Two massive clubs of hands move outward, grabbing underneath the girl's armpits. Eagerly, she's lifted up, and held over his head. His eyes are casted onto the floor, yet no actual movements are made. Instead, while suspending the girl in the middle of the air with one hand, the appendage that remains free is taken out and tossed onto the ground. 

It's a fuuinjutsu scroll rigged to be released upon touching the floor. Water and mud comes flooding out, making the floor cushioned, and primed for wrestling manuevers. It's quite thick as well, mind you,enough to submerge Maloth's feet entirely. Assuming that Bremusa remained unable to pry free, she's literally slammed from the air. Powerbomded she was, right into the pool of mud. Even with the liquid cushioning, the blown was strong enough to leave her shock.

A glance is  granted to Khalil shortly after! "No! Is no boy! Is lady, not man like Maloth!" protested the brute. There was still no way he was believing a feminine individual like that was actually a man. Ifa nythign, if Khalil actually was a male. . . then he was fortunate enough not to grow up within the brutish society Maloth held the misfortune of dealing with. In that scenerio, even as a male, Khalil would be treated just as a weak, untalented woman would.

Having chewed the Yamanashi out, Maloth's gaze falls back onto Bremusa. A slick grin is worn. If she remained in that position, shook, the giant prances ahead, planting a foot onto her chest, and pinning her onto the muddied ground. "Is give up . .?"* - Thu Oct  8 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) thinks: Maloth is scary.. - Thu Oct  8 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||It was all over from that point. As she slams into the ground, droplets of mud splash onto the scene. Some rushing onto his frame, other droplets perhaps getting onto Khalil. One thing was  certain, however. . . That Bremusa was thoroughly covered and perhaps even humiliated.

After looking down, his arms swiftly latch onto her shoulders and uses that grip to set her onto his shoulders. "Is over. . .Now Tell Maloth what wan' know! Tell 'bout amazon people! How they live! Where they live!" The brute demands. Once she was in position, Bremusa is literally lifted up and shoulder-pressed, repeatily. He had to thoroughly show off his dominance.

Before all of this, his veins were subtly popping out of his form. The tension had risen, and instictively, Maloth had again slipped into a jutsu he deemed the 'equalizer.' A technique that empowered him and placed him more on par with actual ninjutsu user. It was a fair concept, as he was very limited in terms of combative ability. 

Nevertheless, the first gate would subside shortly afterwards, placing his body back at ease. The tension in the battle was no longer apparent, thus his application of the technique was no longer needed as a direct result. There was no sign of fatigue on Maloth's behalf, considering the technique had been so short lived. Instead, he moves on over to Khalil, while awaiting for Bremusa to hold her end of the deal ". . .Learn thin' from Maloth figh'? See how beat to mud?"* - Thu Oct  8 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. Was this girl for real?

Looking away from Bremusa for a second, Maloth looked on over to the young lad crying over the mud. ". . .Is jus' mud! Not nee' cry," the warrior bellows out, not at all taking a male's cries seriously. A brief glance is given to Geralt, though nothing is said.* - Thu Oct  8 23:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: You guys seem to be having fun. - Thu Oct  8 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm. . ? - Thu Oct  8 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He didn't like how soft Khalil was being at the moment.

"Keep talk!" Maloth demands of Bremusa. Meanwhile, his feet rises and falls, kicking against the mud below his body. Considering the strength behind the kick, it sends a wave of mud flying on towards Khalil. If struck, the sticky, muddy substance clings to his body. "If man, nee' be tough!" 'Course, Maloth still had no doubt that the Yamanshi was a female. Unfortunately enough for Geralt, being this close, he likely would be caught as well! 

"Mud no bad. Is good." Being dirty and smell. . . That was step one of being a true man!* - Thu Oct  8 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||"If say is man. . Nee' act like! Not no, cry! No 'fraid o' get dirty o' stinky! Need be real man, like Maloth!" He raises a single arm up, allowing his overwhelming odor to protrude into the area. It was a musky scent, one that could literally melt paint off a wall.

Taking offense to Geralt's interference, another wave of mud is kicked up, aiming to splash the fem-boy that sought to confront him. Maloth doesn't yet notice Paine, thus he doesn't say a thing. He's far too busy toughening Khalil up. . . Or rather, trying to make the 'boy' admit to being a girl.* - Thu Oct  8 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bremusa(Ej247) says: We amazons are raised up on to be warroirs, how to hunt, how to well previde for our selfs. Though we all care very much for one another and when there is trouble we all fight to deffend and protet our home. - Thu Oct  8 23:48:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's brow twitches.

Why was this guy being cap'n save a hoe?! Maloth just wanted to have a little fun every now and then. It isn't long before Geralt is releasing a few demonic incantations and opening up portals to hell itself. From said portal, a Gargoyle pops up. . . 

The entire sequence is bizarre to the warrior all together. 

Nevertheless, he hadn't the thought to backdown, at least not yet. Using the Devolving Hammer' his hands repeatily swing, smashing down onto the Gargoyle. . . yet to no avail. Surely, the skin would fracture, but without the use of his chakra gates, getting through to the summoning would damn near impossible. After realizing the durability was too fierce, the hulking beast just turns around, and grasp Bremusa once more.

. . .He pretends like that epic failure didn't even happen. "Is good. Tell mo' 'bout people." By the, the behemoth had at last taken notice of Paine. Eagerly, he approaches his master, hopeful that she would have a treat to pass on to him after he had spent weaks mastering the basics.* - Fri Oct  9 00:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Finally, he was learning another skill to add onto his repetoire.

The skill in question was pretty neat. It wasn't one governed around actual movement speed. Rather, it was just about finesse and actually physical power. In an awkward fashion, Maloth breaks into a crouch, mimicking Paine's own crouching. Sadly, it lacked the fluidity and swiftness that her motions did. Rather than blurring, he was as slow as a golem. 

Nevertheless, in Maloth's movements, he does manage to mimick Paine's attack -- although there was a clear difference in skill. Showing off some flexibility, his right leg kicks off into the air, going into an upward motion. Before it can be completed, he loses balance and falls right on his ass. It seemed that the brute wasn't the most graceful of warriors. .. 

Then Kenshin came into town. Considering all of the shinobi were getting wrecked? Maloth figures it's a good idea to get the fuck out.* - Fri Oct  9 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||With Bremusa in tow, Maloth continued to run. They were getting the hell out of Kumogakure, that;'s for sure. As the hundreds of citizens were being annihilated, one giant brute moved through the crowd. He was tough, perhaps one of the toughest in the world -- yet not even he would try to take on the might of the Speed Star. In time, this leads him towards the outskirts of the village, and into the distance.

By then, they'd run for several more minutes. Eventually, the grasslands of Konoha are nearby, prmpting Maloth to nod. "Yes, is goo-- Forget Layla! Maloth be back! Take girl, he show up for later!" the brute declared, having forgotten about his dear sister!* - Fri Oct  9 01:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Yesterday was hectic. Thankfully, all had ended on a pretty positive note. . .

Well no, thousands were utterly slaughtered admist the Speed Star's rage. Luckily, anyone of significance -- to Maloth -- had been spared, excluding Kojiro. It was a damn shame. Regardless, all of the brute's kinsmen had managed to escape imminent death.

In the giant's approach, he could see that the woman was again undergoing intense training, as she usually does. "Is fas' an' stron'," the brutes notes, his eyes looking her up and down, examining her form. Indeed, complimenting her skill, it seemed she was bulking up physically, at least from what Maloth could gather with that cloak.

"Yes'day. . . Be scary, right?"* - Fri Oct  9 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
"Yes! I stron' man! Maloth make back to village when 'splosion is go on! Thin' not bad in Kumo no more," he articulates, hoping to convinced the taijutsu specialist to eventually return home to Kumo with him.

"Is thin' go back for Kumo. Is have sister there -- Paine ne'er e'en get meet sister, no? Shoul' come back with Maloth when he leave," he continues, of course his voice seems to be a bit more demanding rather than asking. By now, Maloth was well within the opinion that Paine was a psuedo-clansmen, and thus she'd do well to stick with the brutish warrior. 

Still standing, he turns to face the water fall, and gets into a rookie stance. "'Nyway! Ne'er finish train for skill. We keep go? 'Fore we leave," the hulking figure says with a slight grin. He greatly anticipated learning yet another technique.* - Fri Oct  9 14:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) quickly, he turns, facing Paine now. 

As she'd request, Maloth backs up, and lowers into a crouch. His leg muscles tensed, using every ounce of power in their small cells to support his weight and prepare for the next attack. This one in particularly proved to be far more difficult than the last, as it required more flexibility, strength and actual precision. Like a spring chicken, he moves forward, sending a right kick upward.

In a straightforward sequence, the kick strikes into the air -- presumably being potent enough to send an opponent into the skies. Of course, considering this was Maloth we're talking here, and the fact that he lacked skill, the technique is botched pretty badly. The kick doesn't go nearly as high as it needs to. In addition to this, as he's in motion to produce the strike, Maloth inadvertently falls onto his ass, due to a lack of balance.

Stumbling further, the brute collapses into the river, barely avoiding being swept away. Luckily, his hands had found the bridge before that poor fate.* - Fri Oct  9 15:25:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wasn't really in actual danger.

Regardless, Paine's actions aren't opposed. As he's taken and man-handled, some water admittedly is coughed out. It was a fortunate thing that Maloth was sturdy enough to endure the strikes from the taijutsu specialist known as Dissida. Due to her actions, any excessive liquids in his body is expunged, saving him from any future issues.

Now the brute is hung upside down, seemingly unalarmed  by the positioning! 

"Uh! Is 'kay! Can put down!" roared the beast. What an unorthodox way to perform CPR, I might add. Nevertheless, Maloth just hangs around, awaiting his body to be rested back on the bridge for the time being. * - Fri Oct  9 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He stands up almost as if nothing had happened.

Quickly, Maloth leans in, scooping up the woman in a bridal fashion and turning about face. With a jog, he's heading on towards the west, eager to reach Kumogakure at last -- even if the city was in complete and utter disarray. No obstacle would be able to stop the giant from his path. Be it rain, snow, thunder, or even the landscape itself. As they travel, thoughts roam through Maloth's mind, prompting him to look downward, eying Paine curiously.

"No get. Why 'lway lone? No have family 'nymore? Ne'er have person care 'bout?" he says, referencing the Concealed Figure's genetic relations, or any significant others she may have had in the past. Tirelessly, as the answers are awaited, the brute is covering a lot of ground. He was pretty swift for a giant, hulking wall of muscle.* - Fri Oct  9 16:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued to carry her in a bridal fashion.

For days on end, the two manuevered along the landscape, up until the mountainous terrain of Kumogakure had been reached. Still, there was something that was bugging him. . . Why did his taijutsu sensei remain so cryptic? It was irritating.

"If have family. Where be they? An' why chose for be 'lone! Not sense make!" The brute declared along the way. The entire notion was baffling. Had he any living relatives left, he would cherish them, which is why he cared so greatly for his sibling, Lyala. By then, the lazy taijutsu specialist is settled onto the ground so that she could walk around on her own two feet. 

Assuming she answered the questions, Maloth went further, again pressing for more training. He had to learn this new taijutsu move after all.* - Fri Oct  9 17:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||"Is want to know," Maloth states, pressing at the issue, perhaps against the taijutsu specialist's wishes.

That settled, he did precisely as he was told. Just as Paine instructed, the brute's body into position, demonstrating his proficiency in the multitude of kicks that had been taught. Each time they were demonstrated, theire seemed to be no flaws, showing just how skillful Maloth was becoming in terms of taijutsu. Although, his movements were still a tadbit sluggish.

'Course, sluggish in terms of Paine's own standards. Compared to his attack speed beforehand, this was unbelieveably fast. Having done the brief warm up exercises, the brute moves on to pracctice the latest technique -- the Creeping Leaf Shadow skill. It was a manuever that put to the test a warrior's ability to analyze an opponent's movement, as well as mimic to find an opening.

Like a prancing tiger, the uncoordinated brute moved around, aiming to have his body as loose and fluid as can be. But. ..  as per usual, there is a clear struggle in performing. Perhaps if Paine demonstrated firsthand once more? "Hng!" he roars, having tripped up and fallen onto the floor again. "Nee' see Paine do move one-gain time. An' need be partner for it. . ." Maloth suggests, as the technique would work best if he had someone to try it on.* - Fri Oct  9 18:13:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(LavenderTown) says: . . . - Fri Oct  9 18:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) thinks: These two seem b usy... got to find someone else. - Fri Oct  9 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And now it was finally time. 

Just as Paine demonstrates, his eyes pick up on the movements, absorbing the information like a common sponge. Upon watching her blurring motions, the brute's face lights up as she gestures for him to mimic.  It isn't long before Maloth is copying the process perfectly.

His body moved with a great deal of fluidity, even if Paine was in the same motion. Assumning she doesn't move, a stern kick is sent -- although not enough to damage her body seriously. Assuming success, her frame is sent flying upoward, leaving her in perfect positioning for the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf technique to be used with significant efficiency. 

The brute defies all laws of physics, and moves with grace. His bulky body propels upward into the skies, getting right onto Paine's rear -- although he doesn't act on it. A grin is being worn. . . Even if the technique required some clear refinement. There were issues that a maestro like Paine could certainly pick up on, that's for sure. In time, they both descend, and he's looking on with eager eyes.

"Is do good?"* - Fri Oct  9 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Repetition after repetition. Paine's training sessions were commonly like this.

Just as the maestro had commanded, Maloth gets into a stance, and proceeds to resume with the kicks she had taught him prior -- the Leaf Whirlwind technique. A brief glance is given towards Khalil. . . "Hng. Is here 'gain! Nex' time, try keep man from stoppin' Maloth teach-lesson!" He says, still sour that the necromancer had intervened when he was seeking to force Khalil into mud.

THat said, the brute begins to whip his right leg forward, while the left was the crutch that kept his balance. The initial strike is an upward kick, meant to serve as a feint in actual combat. Following up the blow, the brute's kick goes right on under, attacking the arae where an ankle would normally be. Paine would certainly take note of the improved speed, considering his mastery of the taijutsu technique.

This was the byproduct of weekly repetition. His muscles were growing used to the typical motions.* - Fri Oct  9 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Finally!

He had progressed enough to be deemed fit to use a higher level taijutsu. Even if the technique was just 'fluff' in a way that it had no spectacular or extraordinary effect. Having settled with the training, his attention falls back onto Khalil who was seemingly giving him more lip.

"If is boy. . . Nee' learn act like one. Why no act like one?" Maloth declared, still skeptical of the Yamanashi's gender. The guy looked too much like a chick, at least from the brute's persective. Looking down, you could see another scroll on Maloth's belt, which would imply where this was going to go eventually.* - Fri Oct  9 20:17:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. Was it not obvious?

"Is look one like. . Is act one like. . . " He says, stating the clear facts. Even if Khalil had been a male, just from his physique alone, he'd forever be female to Maloth.* - Fri Oct  9 20:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Huh? - Fri Oct  9 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Not understand. .? - Fri Oct  9 20:57:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) scratches his head.

"Is like Maloth?" He says with a blank expression, seemingly ignoring Khalil for the time. His gaze is strictly on Paine.* - Fri Oct  9 21:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) scratches his head again.

This was weird. Finally, Maloth gaze turns back onto Khalil. "Is sense make. .  Lyala is tell Maloth, be handsome," the brute says with a nod. 

Somewhat smug, the brute folded his arm, and casted a gaze onto Khalil. "Tch. . . Is think handsome?" He doesn't seem too alarmed at the less than heterosexual undertones. Why? Who knows.* - Fri Oct  9 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. 

Did Khalil really expect to be let off that easily? Considering he had no one around to stop him, Maloth's hand shoot out, catching the fem-boy by the waist and lifting him up into the sky shortly after.

". . . Why tal' this like? If no be problem, no nee' be like thi'," he says, reasoning that the Yamanshi's entire demeanor seemed a bit suspicious. A glance is given back to Paine briefly. "What be think?"* - Fri Oct  9 21:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: sorry - Sat Oct 10 00:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He was unsure to what Paine meant.

As Khalil squirms, Maloth just looks on amused. "Is do 'cause can. . . Is have choice. Can try be like real man. . . O' jus' get treat like lady," he says, still holding the femboy captive, he had no intent of letting them go clearly. And it was obvious that Maloth certainly had the capacity to keep the weaker Yamanshi in his grasp if desired.* - Sat Oct 10 00:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I don't know how to act like a real man, just let me go! - Sat Oct 10 00:39:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ponders on it.

For -now- he would allow Khalil to be settled down. A glance is given onto the arriving party, Marissa and Amaya. 

This was going to get awkward clearly enough. "Hrm. . ? 'Lo. What need?" he asks to the two women.* - Sat Oct 10 01:01:00 2015

He gives a moderate slap Khalil on the back. "Is joke real good. . .  Know no' be stron' 'nough for do taijutsu! Hahaha!"* - Sat Oct 10 01:10:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: We can go eat? I'm hungry.. - Sat Oct 10 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I like meat!  - Sat Oct 10 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Mmm.. - Sat Oct 10 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Paine. Is wake? - Sat Oct 10 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) goes to pick up Khali again.

"Mmm. 'stead go restaurant. Maloth show how hunt, no?" He was going to teach the Yamanshi the way of being manly one way or another. Either that, or force him into the role of a woman. 

We'll see.* - Sat Oct 10 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: ? - Sat Oct 10 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) sighs. 

Khalil had a point. Plus, Maloth was super hungry too. 

That said, the brute heads off in direction to the restaurant. It was good to have a new member in his psuedo-'tribe.' With the fem-boy still in hand, the brute kicks off the ground, performing a Hulk-like leap. They're soar through the skies, resisting any turbolence, or opposing currents. 

Upon landing, the ground shakes heavily due to Maloth's inhuman level of weight. Cracks riddle along the floor, and a crater is left in the aftermath. They were near the restaurant by now. "Is lot o' meat for worl'! What type like more?"* - Sat Oct 10 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks.

He thinks on the matter. Considering he had strong armed Khalil into being a 'minion.' "Hrm. . . Fine! Jus' want one?" He doesn't even wait for an answer before calling over the familiar employee and handing over a heap of cash. As usual, Maloth goes overboard, ordering not only the steak, but dozens of other dishes.

When he ate, he ate like a king.

Oddly, even as a non-shinobi, nor having any real jobs, the brute always remained loaded or stacked with cash! Why? It's a mystery. . .!* - Sat Oct 10 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Immediately, as the dozens of dishes are delivered, Maloth digs in.

Unlike Khalil, his eating process is a lot less dignified. Hell, the brute doesnt' even using any eating utensils. It was as if the giant hadn't had a good meal in months -- although this was FAR from the case. Greedily, he's practically inhaling the treats, some deserts, others being more standard meals -- like pasta. In time, the beast had moved onto the rice.

It was glazed with sauce, and riddled with juicy meats. The bowl is in hand, and is being poured into his mouth -- up until Khalil had asked. Of course, due to the greedy eating habits, some saliva had been inevitably lingering within the bowl of rice. Nevertheless, without hesistation, it's held towards Khalil.

"Eat."* - Sat Oct 10 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was impressed.  He takes pleasure in Khalil actually mimicking his manner of eating.

As the boy clearly struggled, Maloth gives a hearty laugh, moderately slapping the male on the back for a good attempt. "Is not 'ble eat for-like Maloth! Hahaha! Is try goo'!"He looks ahead, wondering if Khalil was enjoying the meal.

Meanwhile, the oft hungry beast continues to indulge in the his treats, this time a giant chicken wing. Mouth full, the barbarian speaks. "Tell Maloth 'bout sel'! Why is be shinobo? Why is dress like gir'?"* - Sat Oct 10 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nodded along. He was having a decent time. In less than half an hour, half of the food had been devoured, prompting the man to stand up right.

"We go now! Firs' need train! An' if go dress like woman, need dress mo' better," he says, referencing a wardrone change for Khalil in the near future. If the 'boy' wanted to be a taijutsu specialist, he'd have to prove himself to Maloth, that was for sure. 

"An' need make up min'. If want be man, dress like man. If wan't dress like woman, then is woman.'

Without another word, he'd grab Khalil and proceed off towards a private area for training.* - Sat Oct 10 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Then... I don't know, call me a girl then, I guess... - Sat Oct 10 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: I like dressing as them. - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: So, we train? - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Yes! Want see how stron' be! - Sat Oct 10 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: How would we do this? - Sat Oct 10 03:11:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was going to do this the old fashioned way.

His hammer is taken and tossed to the side. It slams harshly against the floor, forming a dent along the hardened, Kumogakure terrain. Once more, Maloth takes out a scroll, and tosses it onto the floor.

It spews out a gathering of mud and water, morphing or terraforming the terrain. in this condition, he can fight Khalil at his leisure. Meaning. . . slams and such, without worrying too greatly about killing the fragile person. "No hol' back! Hit Maloth hard as for 'ble do!"* - Sat Oct 10 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stood strong. His chest contracts, hardening in preparation for the contact. The second Khalil's kick had landed, he'd find himself bouncing harmlessly off of maloth's chest. Indeed, the brute was like a brick wall, unphased by weak attacks such as those.

Still not yet moving, the behemoth looked ahead with a grin, as the boy certainly fell onto the floor -- whether his body crashed into the mud or not remained to be seen.

"Is no do righ'. . . Need lot practice! Keep try hurt Maloth! Wan' see wha' 'ble do!" The brute roared, his voice loud enough to kick start a dust that could blow away leaves. Hell, for a second, it looked as if the Yamanshi's locks were fluttering in the wind themselves. 

Through the commentary, he seemed to have lost his stance, and simply stood around with arms folded. By now, due to the tutelage of Paine, the beast was becoming quite savvy when it came to all things close-ranged. As such, his eyes are trained for detail, and judging from the poor outing, what Khalil had just attempted was a poor man's dynamic entry...

That would be the first skill taught to Khalil -- assuming the trap proved his worth. "Kee' go!"* - Sat Oct 10 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||It was a good try. He smirked, watching as the male came back for additional punishment.

Then. . . as the kick is coming, it sways off course. Without resistance, Khalil is able to land a fierce strike on Maloth's crotch, but the brute still remains unmoving. Tolerance for pain was something he excel in, as per usual. Having enough of the fun and games, the beast deems enough time had passed to try and end the battle.

Without a word or comment, he reaches out, aiming to grasp the shinobi by the arms and shoulders, lifting him overhead seconds after. Assuming success? Khalil would be hammered down into the mud, which thankfully served as a cushion. There was no risk of bone being broken, but at the very least, the feminine shinobi was going to be shaken up, dizzy even.

In the event that the battle was now over, Maloth steps ahead, planting a boot onto the trap's chest, pinning him into the mud, his body partially sinking. "Is bad. . . Bu'. . . 'ble get better! Gues' Maloth is teach. . ."* - Sat Oct 10 03:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was relatively impressed. He scanned over Khali's form, pleased now that the boy had finally gotten down and dirty.

"Mud. . . good, yes?" he comments, wondering if the Yamanshi had truly come to enjoy the feeling of no longer remaining as clean as possible. The foot on the boy's chest is removed, granting him the ability to stand up should he chose.

"'Nyway. . . Maloth try teach stuff. . . First, is go teach kick!" He announces with some enthusiasm, referencing the Dynamic Entry. Of course, he awaits a reaction first.* - Sat Oct 10 04:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||His eyes scan Khalil's form. It was feminine for sure, and mildly intriguing. But, he lacked the endowment or amazonian muscles that Maloth's culture coveted so much. Regardless, there's a primal glance gievn towards the Yamanshi, clearly with less than honest intent. 

He takes a seat after grabbing his hammer, seemingly not at all carrying abotu the muddy terrain.

"Hng! Fine. . if need break. What is do, lay on groun'?"* - Sat Oct 10 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Yeah! We can lay on the ground. - Sat Oct 10 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . ! Is good. - Sat Oct 10 04:50:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: How much do you have? - Sat Oct 10 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs.

"No' can count." He puulls out a bundle of dirty bills. If counted, it exceeds one-hundred and fifty thousands. Mind you, this was a man that never worked.* - Sat Oct 10 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: --- - Sat Oct 10 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) raised a brow. He hated when people finmished a sentence prematurely. 

Curious eyes are apparent, prompting the brute to look ahead. "What is go say? Need go mo' organit?" That wasn't even a word, but Maloth wasn't too smart to begin with. He was really just taking guess. "Wha' is mean?"* - Sat Oct 10 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Organize... - Sat Oct 10 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Need to be a bit more organized. - Sat Oct 10 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Eh. . .  - Sat Oct 10 05:23:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Yeah, sure.. we can go do that. - Sat Oct 10 05:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) goes to grab Khalil's muddy frame. He's dragged off to the clothing shop.* - Sat Oct 10 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) walks on by with a muddy fem-boy on his shoulder.* - Sat Oct 10 05:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) sets the male down.

Maloth goes, leaning against the wall, arms folded. "Is no nee' struggle!" He didn't appreciate the apparent lack of appreciation of him carting the Yamanshi around.* - Sat Oct 10 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looked around. He was mildly content. Regardless, Maloth goes to pick out his own clothes, considering he now deemed Khalil to be an underling. The scenario mirrored his upbringing. The males that were weaker -- at least to this extent -- were made to be subservient. 

Several clothes are taken, some often being a tad small or skimpy. Without even paying, the brute absentmindedly heads off.

"M'kay. Where is live?"* - Sat Oct 10 06:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Uhhh, follow me. - Sat Oct 10 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Here we are. - Sat Oct 10 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looks around.

This place stunk. "Ergh. . .No is good. . "* - Sat Oct 10 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Huh? - Sat Oct 10 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You don't like it? - Sat Oct 10 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: <*Shakes head*> To liddle.. - Sat Oct 10 06:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: But what were you going to do? - Sat Oct 10 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs.

"Jus' wan' see house for now."* - Sat Oct 10 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) tosses the bought clothes onto her mattress.* - Sat Oct 10 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You can change your clothes, you know. - Sat Oct 10 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I'll look away. - Sat Oct 10 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looks down.

These were really his only pair of pants. "Is dirty 'nyway. No point have," he says, referencing his mud consistently dirtied body.* - Sat Oct 10 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Well, you can go take a shower... if you want? - Sat Oct 10 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I'll uhhh... - Sat Oct 10 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Wash those pants for you. - Sat Oct 10 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: And get them dry, and then you can wear them again! - Sat Oct 10 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugged. He had no qualms with taking a shower -- just this once.

Quickly, he begins to unbuckle his pants -- which was stained completely brown to the amount of dirt that had managed to stick on it. His underwear is equally as stained, making it hard to determine it's original color. Maloth is shameless, not out of perversion, but simply ignorance.

He turns about face, and heads right on into the  bathroom.

His flesh, for reference, is painted thoroughly in smudged dirt. As you would expect, every part of Maloth's body seemed to have been drawn -- Drawn by a god of war, hoping to one day craft the perfect warrior. Muscles cover every inch of his frame, and of course, his pelvis region showcases an endowed appendage. It seemed to be fitted to accomodate for his superhuman genetics that dictated him to be as tall as Yao Ming, but buffer than Brock Lesnar. (If you know who they were.)

Before long, the brute enters the bathroom, and turns on the water. It's hot, as that's how he liked the temperature to be. The tub is filled to the brink, but lacked soap. For a moment, Maloth contemplates before eventually diving in face first. The 'pool' of water immediately changes color, becoming muddied. He'd sit in this for about ten minutes, never once opting to rinse.

Nonchalantly, the water is kept running, oddly enough. It forces the tub to overflow, and run along the ground -- but also serves to clean the potentially dirty container as well. Needless to say, it isn't a stretch to believe that Khalil would begin to see the water seeping underneath the cracks of the bathtub after several minutes.

"Mm. . Mmm. . Mm. ."* - Sat Oct 10 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Seconds turn into minutes.

After about ttwenty five minutes of indulging within the water, Maloth exits, his body soaked from head to toe. One of the towels are taken and wrapped about his frame, just barely being able to keep him decent. Althoough the tightness leaves little to the imagination. 

He comes out in style!

Which is just by kicking the door down, forcing it off the hinges. Water continues to flow out, rushing into the adjacent room. Carelessly, Maloth proceeds out, and glances to Khalil.

"Where cloth?"* - Sat Oct 10 07:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) moved to get dressed shortly after.

He removes the towel vasually, caring not for his naked form being viewed. The underwear and pants are slipped right back on, now being freshly smelling and clean. But that wasn't going to last long, let's be real.

No mention is made of the mess in the bathroom. Casually, he moves, patting Khalil on the head. "Good that know role is," he says towards the young Yamanshi.* - Sat Oct 10 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Heh... - Sat Oct 10 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: So, are you going to treat me like a girl now? - Sat Oct 10 07:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Is gir'. - Sat Oct 10 07:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You can sleep here if you want. - Sat Oct 10 07:29:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Haha, come on stay here.  - Sat Oct 10 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You'll enjoy sleeping on a bed. - Sat Oct 10 07:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) approaches.

Was there two beds like how the map depicted?* - Sat Oct 10 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) allows himself to be led, somewhat like a cattle.

He takes a seat, and sets his hammer onto the ground. It wasn't often that Maloth laid in a bed.* - Sat Oct 10 07:42:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Lay down, you won't die. - Sat Oct 10 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) leans downward, allowing himself to lay.

His eyes remain open. "Is good feel," the brute remarked.* - Sat Oct 10 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: ? - Sat Oct 10 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

"Ergh. . No sleepy. . Maloth jus' watch," he says calmly, figuring that the best he can do is guard until he actually is feeling a bit fatigue. An eye glances over onto Khalil's form, taking note of the shinobi's endowment. 

Nevertheless, as the Yamanshi is sleeping, Maloth is out and about, checking out the small house himself. The bathroom is left in more of a mess, every ounce food in his refrigerator is devoured, and clothes are left all over the floor.

After a few hours, he'd grow tired and sleep for the night.* - Sat Oct 10 08:05:58 2015

"Yo! Is one tal' for be leader!? Wha' can do?" He was skeptical. Why support her? She could be just as spineless as Niza himself. There would have to be perks, promises even.* - Sun Oct 11 14:49:10 2015
