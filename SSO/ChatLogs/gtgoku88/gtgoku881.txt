<br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) yawns. He had a sling on, yet could still move his arm if need be. The sling was just to prevent unecessary mobility.

"Mmm. . . Not beat more hard than Maloth get beat 'fore.."* - Wed Sep 02 19:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs.

"Maloth think . ."* - Wed Sep 02 19:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs.

"Am bowed. . . Not find good fight. Kumo not do nothin'. . ." The simpleton complains.* - Thu Sep 03 05:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head in disbelief. 

"Amai never not for get bore. . .? Hng. Need mo' better thing do. Maloth like people ol'. . . 'Member able for find mucha people fight an' wrestle," he says bitterly in memory of his fallen tribe.* - Thu Sep 03 05:58:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) flexes bicep muscle. You think he can tank for no reason?* - Thu Sep 03 06:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) tilts his head. A hand had risen, rubbing his cranium in defeat.

"What. . . - -What talk 'n for-bout?"* - Thu Sep 03 06:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. 

"Hard. . ."* - Thu Sep 03 06:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Boredom was seemingly become entrenched in Kumogakure's culture. As Emiko sat, the giant brute known as Maloth made his way through the area. His feet stomped along the ground, forcing the mountainous area to quiver and shake -- as if in recoil or astonishment as his gargantuan size. 

Swiftly, the brute had made it upon the clerk away. 

"Maloth want. . .! He want all thing able for-get!" A large sum of cash is literally tossed over, and he glared with venom. Eventually, perhaps out of fear, the clerk is giving droves of food on a cart and allowing the beast to cart it away. In an unhurried fashion, Maloth is carting away, though seems more distracted with stuffing his face.* - Thu Sep 03 22:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's ears flickered at the comment. 

For a moment, the fiend stops in his gluttonous devouring of the meals. Instead, his eyes move an d fall onto Emiko. To him, she was like a helpless sheep --judging by her physique. "Hrm. . ? What say to Maloth?"* - Thu Sep 03 22:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Squeak.

The cart wheels over, and soon the hulking figure is standing over Emiko. A shadow is casted onto her frame. ". . .What mean. . Is bad thing say Maloth is?" On the inside, the giant's soul is churning, ready to rage in the assumption that his physical apperance or intelligence again was being belittled.* - Thu Sep 03 22:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 

We're now checking on your genes~

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
". . .What? .. . What weird person 'talk about?" He looked ahead with an inqusitive gaze. A hand had finally left the food and went to rub his head. It was too much to take in..

"Makin' head hurt. . " complained the simpleton.* - Fri Sep 04 00:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head.

"Not need be smart! Is. . . Smart 'nough!" The brute declared, as if offended. His right arm bends, allowing his bicep to flex and be made apparent. 

"All need be muscle. Maloth mucha strong."* - Fri Sep 04 00:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wore a skeptical glance.

"Why need team? Maloth much stronger. . . Lady not look strong. . "

His giant mitts move forward, aiming to grab the girl by the shoulder. Assuming no opposition, he'd lift Emiko's frame, allowing her body to be lifted up into the air, and free to be examined. 

Was there anything of significance?* - Fri Sep 04 01:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued with his examination.

Her body is eventually flipped over, and she's held upside down curiously. "Hrm . . .? Not look much strong. Not get. . . Why Maloth should follow?" The brute inquired with legitimate curiosity. He came from a savage culture, one that held power over everything. To rule, the strongest would have to be deemed.

Likewise, it was shameful for a man to be under the rule of a woman. Thus, you can imagine why he's skeptical over the proposal.* - Fri Sep 04 01:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugged. He allowed her frame to be settled down.

"ShowMaloth, then. Why should listen to lady?"* - Fri Sep 04 01:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He was still clearly a bit banged up yet his health was leagues above his previous state.

"Guess is."* - Fri Sep 04 20:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: Gezo? - Sat Sep 05 17:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) rushes ahead. He jumps onto the Ink Bird and prepares to take off.* - Sat Sep 05 17:54:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stares.

"Name Maloth." He speaks essentially like a neanderthal. A caveman even.* - Sat Sep 05 19:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) doesn't need to be grabbed. He can just go.* - Sat Sep 05 20:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) quickly moved to intercept the blow. To him, Amai was like family -- or well, at least the only person that paid him any damn mind.

Hopefully the interference would grant enough time for the scroll to be activated.* - Sat Sep 05 21:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) would now have a broken jaw.

He damn near doubles over in recoil, but has little time to recooperate. In no time at all, the Mizukage would have grasped and used his oversized body as a meat-shield. Although it remained to be seen, were the snakes restricted to just one person? Still defensely, Maloth is likely retrained in short order, while groaning weakly.

No words could be spoke, 'cause y'know. Broken jaw.* - Sat Sep 05 21:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) has a cast on his jaw.

His fist balls, and it's clear the brute is angered.* - Sun Sep 06 11:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He can't really speak words -- and that really TICKS him off. His fist clenches.* - Sun Sep 06 11:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He was in that belief too. What didn't kill him made him stronger. Silently, the brute broods on.* - Sun Sep 06 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He -hated- this.* - Sun Sep 06 11:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He'd very much like to join the war.* - Sun Sep 06 15:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) has a broken jaw. He can't really talk. Inaudible, caveman-like grunts are given.* - Mon Sep 07 12:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanzo(Alradaev) says: Meh... - Sat Sep 19 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Mon Sep 21 16:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Maloth! - Mon Sep 21 16:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: I just need my C- - Mon Sep 21 16:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) yawns lazily. By now, his jaw had fully recovered. The gargantuan monstrosity sat along the flooring, with a giant bowl of ramen in his hands. The bowl steamed, sending a pleasant aroma from the container to his nose. Oddly, Maloth didn't even bother to use any utensils. Rather, he quite literally chowed away.

"Hrm? --! Oh. Thought be for dead. . .!" He blurts out, shooting some noodles out of his nose due to the surprise.* - Mon Sep 21 16:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Suddenly, a dainty teenager had leaped onto his back.

Had it not been for the massive size difference, and weight difference, he'd be toppled over. Thankfully, Maloth's physique allows him to stay put. And for a moment, he actually smiles.

Although, that smile is quick to fade considering. . . Strong ass, manly vikings don't need to smile.

"Good see be 'live. Thought be dead for war." A massive club takes his saliva-infested ramen, and holds it in the general area of Amai's face. Clearly, he gestures for her to eat. The giant was in good spirits at the moment.* - Mon Sep 21 16:22:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) yawns. He continued to vehemously chow down, devouring the fuck out of that ramen bowl.

"Chew. . . knee? Mmm. .  Need make Maloth chew-knee. Most strong body for village. . . Able get hit lotta time," he says, still having no actual implication of what being a chunnin entailed. He simply saw as a title for those that showcased great strength.

And everyone knew the behemoth was an egomaniac.

Eventually, that bowl is done, and he frowns. ". . . Food done. ."* - Mon Sep 21 16:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: That's fine. - Mon Sep 21 16:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Losing is important to growth. - Mon Sep 21 16:38:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: No. - Mon Sep 21 16:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Awe. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Nod* - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head.

"Amai cheat. . .Alway use thing keep Maloth 'way. ."* - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Maloth, I won't use the big-one I used last time. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You'll find a way around it Maloth, I'm sure of it. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm. . .Then we fight. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Let's all go to the arena. - Mon Sep 21 16:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: C'mon, Niza. - Mon Sep 21 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I'm fine here. - Mon Sep 21 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Then we'll spar here. - Mon Sep 21 16:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Immediately, he takes off.

His bulky legs stomp along the ground, sending quivers as a result of the immense weight. Eventually, he's closing in the distance and meeting the inkcreatures half way. A club of a hand crashes downward -- and again, a clear issue is Maloth's less than stellar attack speed. 

"Need kill thing. . .Not like keep have fight Lion. ." the sturdy simpleton stated casually.* - Mon Sep 21 16:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He was damn near inhuman.

The tigers, considering grossly outnumbering him, are able to launch about and latch onto his arms andlegs. Yet as their ink-spawned fangs sought to bite in. . . Nothing would come of it. Indeed, the male's cells had been especially conditioned, and were akin to rock, even if softer.

Regardless of his ability to endure, there was still wave of pain coming over his frame. Angrily, the viking's massive arms swung about, grasping for straws really. It remained to be seen, would he even land a strike?

If not, considering the close range, two arms eventually descend and seek to grapple one of the annoying creatures. "Amai know not can hurt like this!"* - Mon Sep 21 17:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
And here comes the swarm.

All was futile, considering his immense slowness. It was no use, considering just how badly Amai could bring out the swarm.

Slowly, the behemoth is hard at work whittling away the forces. Each successful hit reduces the Yang-spawned entities into lifeless ink once more. The bulk of which splatters onto the nearby pavement. Due to adrenaline, Maloth is attacking a bit harder than normal, and faster. . . Yet it's all for naught.

Considering hte distraction, the snakes rush on by, aiming to bind his limbs -- which they succeed in. "Arrggh! To much for fight!" complained the simpleton. His head would kneel done, hoping to bite along the ink's 'flesh' to force a disperse.* - Mon Sep 21 17:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He'd likely have been able to keep this up for extended period of times.

But in the end, this was pointless. "HNNNG! Too many. . . Maloth need learn fight more than one. . " He complains, still irritated with Amai's tactic of overwhelming an opponent with sheer quantities.* - Mon Sep 21 17:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: He is never going to give up... - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Guess we'll go at this for a few days then. - Mon Sep 21 17:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) frowns. He hated losing -- especially considering the circumstance.

"Still more strong than Maloth. . ."* - Mon Sep 21 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..You'll get stronger. - Mon Sep 21 17:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: You need to be faster. - Mon Sep 21 17:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) falls onto his back and exhales.

"Not get strong 'nough fast 'nough. . "* - Mon Sep 21 17:48:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mm.. - Mon Sep 21 17:49:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) scratches his nose.

Cleaning sounded tedious, but who knows, maybe he'd find something cool there. A brief glance is given towards the adolescent medic, but he says nothing in regards to her presence.

"Ergh. Guess be good. What think for teach Maloth. . ?"* - Mon Sep 21 18:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Mon Sep 21 18:49:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You find that book... - Mon Sep 21 18:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: And I'll give you a mission reward. - Mon Sep 21 18:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) raises a brow.

"Who be tryin' hurt. .?"* - Mon Sep 21 18:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: This scythe guy. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Erebus. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yea. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Erebus. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: How is he on our side. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I presume, he'll be coming to collect something. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: If he's trying to kill me? - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Because. - Mon Sep 21 19:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: As an individual, you are his target. - Mon Sep 21 19:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Overall, as a village...He is an asset. - Mon Sep 21 19:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) clenches his fist.

"If try kill. . .Maloth kill first," he gives a growl. Quickly, the brute turns to face Niza.

"Say be chief for village, yes?"* - Mon Sep 21 19:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Mon Sep 21 19:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) took evengreater offense then. His soul was inevitably being filled with unadulterated rage. . .Yet he manages to retain his general calmness.

"Then be chief. . . Need act one like.  Amai be soldier. She have listen -- but you be chief. . . Have make sure no bitch-man able come, mess with soldier," the simple-minded beast states again, with yet another growl. * - Mon Sep 21 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well. - Mon Sep 21 19:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I never said I wouldn't. - Mon Sep 21 19:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: As I said the night before. - Mon Sep 21 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Should he attack when I am present, he will face punishment. - Mon Sep 21 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: If I'm not? Then there is nothing I can do. - Mon Sep 21 19:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Mon Sep 21 19:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shifts his gaze on over to Amai.

"Not like this. We just make sure man not can 'tack."* - Mon Sep 21 19:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright.. - Mon Sep 21 19:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: When be coming? - Mon Sep 21 19:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Soon. - Mon Sep 21 19:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Then we go. - Mon Sep 21 19:11:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Mon Sep 21 19:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: One.. - Mon Sep 21 19:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Two.. - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Why did you give him things..Niza? - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Three. - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Four.. - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Five.. - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Seven.. - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had some big nuts.

He turns upon hearing the omnious voice pierce through the skies. His eyes would lock onto Erebus, and just from a single gaze, chills vibrated along his spine. But those feelings would be ignored, considering his bond with Amai. Rather than cowering with fear, Maloth provided a gaze that was reminiscient of a bull staring down an annoying matador. Amai was essentially apart of his pack, and he'd be around to serve as protection, that's for sure.

Defensively, the brute even takes a step ahead, shielding the blonde's frame to be blocked by his bulky body.* - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Eight.. - Mon Sep 21 19:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Don't worry. - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It's fine. - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: He's trying to kill me. - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: How is it fine? - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Well... - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I've told you multiple times... - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: To run... - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) thinks: This be. . chief? - Mon Sep 21 19:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I have no sins to repent for. - Mon Sep 21 19:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Interesting. - Mon Sep 21 19:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stood his ground.

His muscles tensed, strickening as if a form of intimidation. It also served to leave him prime condition to take action should the situation continue to escalate. 

"Leave lone. Not should be pity woman. Need pity chief o' village," the brute states in his usual caveman fashion. He gives a brief gander to Amai -- who hid behind him, to ensure that his defacto tribemen was holding up okay. 

"If say have sin. Tell what sin be!"* - Mon Sep 21 19:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Tsk... - Mon Sep 21 19:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: We still need to have that talk... - Mon Sep 21 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: We'll see about 'having no sins' then. - Mon Sep 21 19:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: Me? A saint? - Mon Sep 21 20:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: I impregnated a whore and got in my feelings over it...I am no saint. - Mon Sep 21 20:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Erebus(DhatBoiNick) thinks: And this my lord, is where she perish. - Mon Sep 21 20:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: That's laughable...considering what he's done... - Mon Sep 21 20:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: Well Quan, I might be joining you and roki soon bud. - Mon Sep 21 20:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: //// - Mon Sep 21 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Mon Sep 21 20:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wrinkles his nose.

Erebus' mere presence was enough to invoke anger. "Not get. How be chief. . . But let thing this like happen. Wonder what soldiers say. . If know chief do this," Maloth grumbles. He turns towards Amai. 

"Need not stay in village. What if man come back. No one 'round. . ?"* - Mon Sep 21 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Niza.. - Mon Sep 21 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: What should I do? - Mon Sep 21 21:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I don't think he cares anymore for your presence. - Mon Sep 21 21:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Matters not if he doesn't care. - Mon Sep 21 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: But.... - Mon Sep 21 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: You should heed my words. - Mon Sep 21 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Considering...I did give you time...to leave. - Mon Sep 21 21:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm.. - Mon Sep 21 21:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Indeed. - Mon Sep 21 21:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: It's just a few questions is all. - Mon Sep 21 21:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 21 21:07:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: We can speak here. - Mon Sep 21 21:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: I just didn't want our conversation to be interupted by...thirty people. - Mon Sep 21 21:08:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm.. - Mon Sep 21 21:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I heard he was killed in one of zetsumo's attacks. - Mon Sep 21 21:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: But that's all I really heard. - Mon Sep 21 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: ...Alright. - Mon Sep 21 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Next question. - Mon Sep 21 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: Did you try and have Kronos kill Hanabi? - Mon Sep 21 21:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: In a way, No..And Yes. - Mon Sep 21 21:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: I brought him with me incase anything happened. - Mon Sep 21 21:12:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: So niza..Will you please teach me some more techniques for close quarters? - Mon Sep 21 21:54:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: If you don't mind, May I teach him those two...Basic combat techniques you showed me? - Mon Sep 21 21:58:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Then shunshin. - Mon Sep 21 22:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: Speaking of techniques... - Mon Sep 21 22:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: I should try and imitate Mae's technique... - Mon Sep 21 22:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) thinks: To pay my respects of course... - Mon Sep 21 22:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. 

Was this really considered taijutsu? With narrowed eyes, Maloth aimed to mimick. His massive right arm rises up, and thrusts ahead. That was simple -- but he didn't feel as if anything had been accomplished.

"Not know if work. . . Come try on Maloth. Maloth want see if able do same. . " Again and again, his arm fidgets, preparing for the motions that would make the mis-direction a  success. Muscles stricken, bulging and fidgeting oddly in preparation.

"Come."* - Mon Sep 21 22:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The moment her hand thrusted forward, Maloth sought to enact the redirection.

His forearm clashes against the incoming fist, ensuring that it's pushed harmlessly away. Of course, he takes it too far. As Amai's body inevitably recoils, a palm thrust is delivered towards the center of her torso. It isn't exceptionally strong, but it's coming nonetheless.

"Much easy!"* - Mon Sep 21 22:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Niza(Chevy Malibu) says: to get - Mon Sep 21 22:31:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Maloth. - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: This. . . Really is jutsu? - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: Or..Not really a jutsu.. - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's uh.. - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: A basic style of fighting. - Mon Sep 21 22:37:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm. Fine.. - Mon Sep 21 22:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) eyes the girl casually as she performs yet another basic ass taijutsu skill.

After a few moments of observing, Malooth pauses in attempt to commit what had been seen to memory. It was a basic taijutsu manuever, nevertheless, and certainly was well within his ability to accomplish. 

Finally, the giant's arm sways through the air, withthe back of the hand being geared towards Amai's throat. -- Although it doesn't actually make contact. "Hng. All thing. . . Look easy. Need somethin' harder, for Maloth make biiiggg 'splosion' for when fight," the simple-minded savage declares, his voice suggesting irritation or disappointment.

After all, a man of his size or stature deserved something more fitting for close-ranged combat. How else was he going to overcome these god damned ninjutsu and genjutsu users?* - Mon Sep 21 22:46:49 2015

Hulk leaps.

His goal? To get right on that damn bird. If capable, Bean would be in for a surprise. The surprise being? Maloth's giant body slamming against the Kaguya's frame. 

Assuming success, the brute roared. 'Not let happen! Is stupid!" * - Tue Sep 22 00:03:37 2015

Perhaps maybe next time he'll think twice before going 'Leeroy Jenkin'-ing the scene.

Indeed, rushing ahead heeds horrible results. The bones that had suddenly developed punctures against his frame, forcing stab wounds to be riddled about his lower-torso. They go pretty deep as well, but by some miracle each of the sharpened bones manage to avoid fatal areas.

Still, Maloth is left bleeding. 

A hand rises, balled into a fist and seeming prepared to strike. Sadly, Baen's nature as an essential, human-sized porqupine deter any more taijutsu assaults. 

Indeed, after pulling away, the brute falls onto a single knee, while possessively looking towards Amai. A girl that happened to be his only true friend. The giant felt not sorrow -- but rage. Rage that her own village failed to offer a viel of protection. Niza was the chief. . . Yet he casted the ink-user off into the lion's dens. "Amai. . .Not die!"

He had witness much death in his life time -- and had no intent on losing another tribemen. Shakingly, the savage is rising to one knee.* - Tue Sep 22 00:36:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Casts a glance towards the Kaguya for a brief moment.

Each word spoken had fallen on deaf ears. He was filled with rage -- but knew better than to throw his life away.

Indeed, the beast sped on over, falling towards Amai's side. Two massive clubs press against the Ink User's chest, and proceeds to pump, as if pushing life back into her body. "Not die. . . Not die like 'ther tribe people. . ." the simpleton muttered with a frown. Blood, of course, crawls onto his body.

Likewise, the 'speeding' over was far from fast. He moved with a clear limp, and could easily be stopped.* - Tue Sep 22 01:02:30 2015

"Chief jus' bitch coward. Not need be village in tha' have coward. . ." The brute continued, still clearly having no damn intent on remaining in a village filled with so many sociopaths. What would be stopping them from randomly killing him someday as well? His mind was made up.* - Tue Sep 22 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
". . .Not get what mean. . . This how tribe work. People kill? Then get kill back. Never jus' gon' let Amai die for n' reason," the brute says with a huff. Philosophical commentary was futile -- considering he lacked the intellect to truly grasp the concepts.

Assuming no stopping, off Maloth was, ready to tackle on the next adventure.* - Tue Sep 22 20:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
"Is wrong. . Anger be what make Maloth strong. Think death be good thing in way. . . It teach Maloth where come from. . "

His mind flashed back to his more tribal days. Growing in a tribe of savages, it was clear Maloth was no stranger to violence or death. Yet, his time in Kumogakure had served to pacify his rage, as there were "laws" and "regulations." Sadly, this had made him weak, and forcedh im to lose sight of his training.

As the fcomment went through, the titan continued to move in stride, his massive weight practically forcing the ground to cry out in pain. Assuming he wasn't stopped? The brute would have been on his way -- at last.* - Tue Sep 22 20:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Masayoshi, Mamoru(KingSoraHearts) says: ..... - Tue Sep 22 20:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
And finally, he had managed to escape the hell was that Kumogakure.

His bulky body indiscriminately pushed through trees and bushes. It leaves green stains and cuts all around his body. Although the cuts were minor, and could really just be seen as intense friction that forced the skin to dry up. Anywho, after some time traveling, the brute was finally upon Konohagakure. Hopefully, this village would grant a better atmosphere.

After the lengthy travel, the brute is forced to take a rest. His gargantuan body leans against the tree that were placed along the forest. Both eyes remain open on instict, considering this wasn't exactly an opportuned area to rest.* - Tue Sep 22 22:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued with his travels.

For days on end, the barbarian had manuevered along the thick forests that bordered Konohagakure.

And it's only by chance that he's actually able to come upon Konohagakure. Baffled, by how bustling the city proved to be, the brute is swift to enter and get comfortable within the growing kingdom.

Sadly, as a result of his lack of knowledge, or in-experienced with real societies, Maloth. . . causes quite a ruckus. For the next hour or so, the brute is running amuck, stealing from shops -- mainly food. And randomly wrestling with civilians as well. Given his fun, the savage eventually finds his way towards the mansion. His body is covered in sticky sweets and alcohol.

Likewise, in tow are two individuals. One a chubby old man, a well-known baker of the village. While the other seemed to be a woman -- perhaps a model judging by the looks. They're both being carted over the hulking creature's shoulders, while crying out with futility.

"Help me! I just want to do my job!"

"Keep this pervert away from me! Helllpp!" 

Maloth seems to be amused, rather than alarmed at the screaming. His eyes fall onto the mysteriously cloaked figure. "'Lo. What name is be place?"* - Tue Sep 22 23:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yo. Put those people down. - Wed Sep 23 00:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) possessively tightens his grips about both of the individuals.

Why couldn't he keep them around for a little while longer? The two captives continued to squirm, though their tension seems to descend upon seeing that both Paine -and- Baen were coming to their aid.

Before responding, Maloth's head dips forward, licking some dried chocolate off of his own shoulder. "Mmm. . . Tasty--" Then it occured to simple-minded warrior, these two people they took offense. One in particular caught his attention, and that was of course the Kaguya. Immediately, the model and chef are dropped onto the floor.

Maloth's eyes narrow onto the fiend, and his rage was again boiling over. He had left Kumogakure due to the murder of Amai -- obviously, there was no intention on actually mingling within a village where the murderers had been staying.* - Wed Sep 23 00:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . .Hng! What do here. . ?! - Wed Sep 23 00:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Living. - Wed Sep 23 00:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Not like Amai though... - Wed Sep 23 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) thinks: Savage. - Wed Sep 23 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: But why are you abducting people? - Wed Sep 23 00:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) clenches his fist.

Each syllabel that escaped Baen's mouth only served to further aggitate Maloth's inner beast. The world was fortunate, however, that he wasn't as powerful as his physique would suggest -- at least not yet.

"None business."

-- The two that had been abducted, speak up quickly however. "He said he liked my food! So he wanted me to be his chef!" THe elderly man roared out. Judging by Maloth's body, which remained covered in sweets, you can likely infer that the assumption was true.

"I don't know why, he just grabbed me and started laughing as he left!" The model blurts out herself. She was a looker, thus it wasn't hard to imagine why he'd want to grab her as well -- just for the sake of eye candy.* - Wed Sep 23 00:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Well, since you're not from around here and essentially retarded, you should know that abducting people isn't good. - Wed Sep 23 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: So don't abduct people. - Wed Sep 23 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Or i'll have to poke you full of holes like your friend. - Wed Sep 23 00:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He didn't like being bossed around.

A glance is given towards the two that had been kidnapped. They get up and haul ass on a moment's notice.

"If say so." He turns around, giving attention back to the Concealed Figure. After all, he and Baen were not pals. Hmph.

"You. What there do here?" For reference, this was his horrible way of asking what was there to do in Konoha.* - Wed Sep 23 00:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continues onward towards the table.

His hands press against the table as he peers on over to the masked figure. "What mean.. . Hrm, like eat. . " That much was obvious, as he was -- again -- covered in dried chocolate and other sweets. "And train. How train?" Those were the only things he really shows interest in. Eating and fighting.

Conversation, dancing, missions -- none of that junk really appealed. * - Wed Sep 23 00:50:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wasn't a shinobi either. That much was -clear.- 

He was simply a brute that traveled along, living the life of a savage. Or at least trying too. . . societies placed far too much restrictions. 

"Mmm. . .Yes. Maloth think good idea is. . . Yes, he go punch tree! Beat tree to mud!" the male declares. Quickly, he rushes south, but not before granting a glare to Baen. This. Wasn't. Over.* - Wed Sep 23 01:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-umm have fun.. - Wed Sep 23 01:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The scene was simple.

There were various, larrge rocks that had been seemingly carried towards the area. The ones out infront seem to have cracks riddling along their frame. Along with this, the edges of the boulders seem to be chipped off.

The reason for this is all to clear, however.

In the epic centre, Maloth was hard at work, now preparing to actually take his training serious. His arms thrusted back in forth, allowing massive fists to repeatily clash against the center of the latest boulders. Due to his thick bones, the male was able to take on an increasingly high level of stress. For now, there is no attention paid to the surrounding.

"Hng! Hng! Maloth beat to mud!" the savage roars, trash talking his 'punching bag.'* - Wed Sep 23 01:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Boom!

One final haymaker is given! The boulder itself shook, crumbled, and even cracked under the might of the behemoth's increasingly potent strength. His muscles was flowing with adrenaline as it sought to not only reach the peak of the natural limits of a human's body. . .But to go further beyond. "Argghh!" Maloth roars, unleashing a battle cry that honestly puts him in a better mood, one more fit to continue with the rigorous exercise.

And what great timing. . .

By some stroke of luck, Yan was able to time his Earth technique in unison with the punch. On impact, the boulder goes flying, and slams -just- short of the gate that sat towards the east. As it falls towards the floor with at hud, Maloth can't believe his damn eyes. Sure, he was training hard. . . But that sudden progression, it was almost surreal. 

". . .Woah. . . Maloth get mucha stronger. . ." His gaze is casted towards the skies, and back arches. Both meaty clubs he called a hand are balled into fists. Like tarzan, the giant begins to yelp, yodeling into the skies while passionately pounding against his chest. 

"FEED! MALOTH MORE! FEED MORE! FEED MALOTH MORE!" 
* - Wed Sep 23 02:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The sudden yell breaks him out of his trance.

THe stoppage is abrupt, and you can tell Maloth is mildly disorientated as some yellow-haired punk just broke his vibe. Quickly, the male turns about face, and eyes the target. It -had- been a while, thus recognizing Yan was going to be a bit difficult.

Peering closer, the simp asks one thing.

"Who you?"* - Wed Sep 23 02:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Slowly, the memories involving Yan was beginning to pop back in. 

While it had been a long time, the brute does vaguely recall the game of dice. Although, it leaves a sour taste in his mouth considering he just kept losing and losing. 

"Oh. .. Now 'member. . . Think be from sandy place. Yes. ..  Why not still in sandy-place," articulated the mentally challenged giant. He huffs, and opts to take a seat after the long day of training. Considering the hard work, his body was pretty musky, and layered in salty sweat.* - Wed Sep 23 02:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's brow furrowed, and his face developed into one that suggested curiosity. Get strong to go to Sunagakure?

"Why need be strong?" -- The question, is quickly forgotten once Yan had made an inquiry of his own. Immediately, Maloth's body tensed up as the angst that spawned from losing his own friend proceeded to elevate. 

"Hng. Maloth do lot thing. . . Run in wild. Beat up lotta people, make lotta money. But now. . . Now, Maloth train for can be strong. Need be strong for soon able beat people to mud! Not need be looser, make ol' tribe people proud for what Maloth able 'ecome," his articulation while still botched in various fashions, is growing more spirited. 

To him, Amai was perhaps family. Or well, his new family ever since the annihilation of his othr savage or viking-like brethrens. Then she had just been ripped away from him, right infront of his very eyes.

"---Wait. Why need get strong for-gain?" (for-gain is a shitty way of saying again.)* - Wed Sep 23 02:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. The vague memories just kept pouring in. Tatsumi. . . a gent that could summon frogs, no? Maloth had personallity witnessed his death. 

"Ooooh! "member this, yess. Come with lady. . she got," he cups at his chest, as if to mimick massive breasts. Clearly a reference to Rymei, who had aided in the slaying of Tatsumi. 

"Yes. Hrm. . . Maloth see. Not just get people, go beat man to mud?" Maloth shrugs, figuring the issue with Edge to be a trivial matter. If Edge was too strong? Then he was the rightful ruler until someone could rush in and kick his ass. That was the way of the barbarian-like individuals that Maloth grew up with. * - Wed Sep 23 02:41:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. 

A fist pounds against his palm. ". . Guess if want lose. He take challenge-- Oh. . . Yes, Maloth think live here now," the brute mentions after his abandonment of Kumogakure.* - Wed Sep 23 02:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then we will spar the next time I see you. I'd like to see how strong a man of your size is or if he can fare against me and my clones...There hasn't been a taijutsu-foc--...There  hasn't been a ninja that has bested me yet to be honest. - Wed Sep 23 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Maybe you'll be the first one. - Wed Sep 23 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Anyways, til then. - Wed Sep 23 02:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since when did you leave Kumogakure? - Wed Sep 23 15:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Know what . . . Nevermind Maloth . . . Good to see you. - Wed Sep 23 15:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) walks into the area. His fists are covered in cuts/scars.* - Wed Sep 23 17:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: lo. - Wed Sep 23 17:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) just stares.

He was bored, and was looking for something to do, of course.

His eyes fall back onto the two women sitting in the chair. They likely knew nothing of him -- although, it wouldn't be a stretch if they had heard of a hulking man disturbing the peace. Even after having been given a stern talking too. 

Thankfully enough, the peace disturbance wasn't abductions, but simply training that damaged property or other landscapes. "Mmm. . .Village start bore Maloth. . ! What do here 'gain?"* - Wed Sep 23 18:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Zenaki. . . - Wed Sep 23 18:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Either she's in trouble, or she's very rude. - Wed Sep 23 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: If it's the latter, she better not ever ask me for favors. - Wed Sep 23 18:34:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
". . .Spar. . You?"

It's clear he isn't keen on battling the Concealed Figure, nor Katsune. After all, both of these dainty women were less than half his size. Certainly, any sane man would automatically assume them to be weaklings, no? 

". . .Hahaha. Not need beat lady for mud," mocked the behemoth.  He folds his arms, however, and gains confusion mostly at Figure's strange expression. Her face remained covered, but that same, nervous smile reigned supreme. ". . .Two. . .Gether. . .Ness? Maloth use for to. . . One-gether," He was lone-wolf.* - Wed Sep 23 18:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
"Not no like. . . Jus'. . ne'er able for get help. .! If think able handle Maloth, Maloth guess can fight. Promise not cry when he beat to mud?" He seemed wary, considering the clear difference in size.

Nevertheless, at the Figure's behest, the barbarian would accept training.

"We go. . " Giant legs press against the ground, allowing his frame to move towards the exit. ". . .An' take off hat. Need see face." Of course, assuming the Figure complies, Maloth would wait, allowing her to lead the way, and guide him in more traditional training.* - Wed Sep 23 19:04:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Yo. - Wed Sep 23 19:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had been again hard at work.

In the duo's approach, they'd find Maloth in a push-up position. His body gleamed in sweat, and he again had a musk to him.

"Hrm. . -- Oh! 'Member person. . Yes. Be Amai friend."* - Wed Sep 23 19:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Long time no see big guy. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: How have you been. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: And I would not say I am Amai's friend. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: She tried to have me killed. - Wed Sep 23 19:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts.

He frowns upon recalling just why he had ventured ontoKonoha.

"Amai. . . get dead. Leave Maloth all 'lone. . "He ceases the push ups, and gets into a sitting position.* - Wed Sep 23 19:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Yo. - Wed Sep 23 19:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wore a frown. He didn't take kindly to Hanabi's apparent happiness at Amai's demise-- but wouldn't act against the woman just yet.

His gaze shifts onto Misa. "'Lo. Name be Maloth--"

Then the Concealed Figure ran back up. "Hrm? Oh. Thought be sleep. So Maloth leave"* - Wed Sep 23 19:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I don't know, and I don't care right now. - Wed Sep 23 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: But, you're welcome. - Wed Sep 23 19:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shifts his visage back to the Figure.

"We train?"* - Wed Sep 23 19:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: Hmm the behimoth behind us is Maloth, he is from Kumogakure. - Wed Sep 23 19:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: I know, I killed his friend. - Wed Sep 23 19:55:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He rose a brow, unsure of what the Concealed Figure meant.

"What mean. . . -- Yes. Can 'tack," he says, upon realizing that the strange figure's method of training was simple sparring. ALthough, that mask still irritated him -- why in the world was she so insistent on concealing her face?

Quickly, Maloth falls into a small stance. It was an original creation. Generally, the stance very much mirrored a basic boxer's. Although, there existed clear differences, mainly in how stiff his body became. Muscle tensed, prepared to cushion any incoming blows. Sadly, the boost to defensive ability left much to be desired.* - Wed Sep 23 20:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He had no counter whatsoever.

The man was just as he was depicted. A massive wall of rigid muscle. His body movements were sluggish, and as the Figure would soon see-- his taijutsu prowess were raw. Even as a physical specimen, Maloth lacked one or two attributes. Skill and finesse.

The first blow lands with surprising effectiveness, enough to pierce through this rugged skin and actually send shockwaves along the bone. "...! Woah! Hit hard 'nough actually hurt Maloth!" the brute yelled. His body rocked back, but yet. . . the giant wasn't at all deterred. Instead, responding quickly, his right arm swings, intent on clotheslining the Secret Entity along the neck. 

"---But not strong 'nough, hahaha!" 

Sadly, the strike delivered was slow and easy to dodge. Even as his muscle mass added force, the overall lack of speed made the attack damage only moderate -- if even landed.* - Wed Sep 23 20:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: This nigga is THICK - Wed Sep 23 20:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: I wish I could tell you it will get better but you will continue to feel like this Misa. - Wed Sep 23 20:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: That wont really help you. - Wed Sep 23 20:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
And the block comes in hard.

However, considering the Figure's willingness to make this engaging, the attack seems to move in slow motion. COupled with Maloth's above average perception? The brute is actually capable of reacting in a positive fashion. As the kick was closing in on his ribs, a forearm shoots, clashing and parrying against the lass' shin. ". . .! Is good. . . kich mucha gooder than Maloth," roared the fiend -- impressed with how easily the mysterious entity had outclassed him in hand to hand combat.

Assuming success, his arm quickly manuevers, allowing a hand to wrap about the girl's ankle. 

And it was at this point, Maloth decides to take the taijutus specialist in for a ride. After establishing a firm grip, he begins to spin, hoping to not only knock off that damn 'Hat', but also force his opponent's body to endure the fierce velocity that hadb een conjured.* - Wed Sep 23 20:59:18 2015
