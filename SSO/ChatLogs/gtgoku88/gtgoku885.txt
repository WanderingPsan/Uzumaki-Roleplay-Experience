<br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turns once Paine had seemingly awoken from her thousand year nap. "Hrm. 'Kay, think person try fight," he says to Lyric, referencing Marissa's challenge. Swiftly, the shinobi turns about face, eying Paine who seemed prepared now to teach him a new technique. It was another one of her patent kicks -- perhaps the greatest skill in her arsenal.  At the girl's behest, the brute enter his general stance once more, leg muscles tense.

Quickly, he makes an approach, while entering a half-crotch. Upon being close enough, Maloth's bbody begins with a rotation, one leg being jutted out in the forefront. Twirling, he sends an upward kick, hoping to strike the Concealed Figure right in the jaw. Of course, as the technique was designed, this proved to be just a faint. Hit or miss, the rotation contined in stride, soon coming for a lower portion of the body -- the ankles. All in all, if successful, Paine would find herself being tripped up.

There were some issues with the skill, nevertheless, as the brute heldsome difficulties. His overall speed was still pathetic at best, and left much to be desired. Thus, the kick wasn't all too fast, and perhaps was an easy move to evade. "Hnng! Not tire. . .Ne'er get tire for train!" The comment from Paine before seemed to have been a taunt, and it worked effectively to grant some level of motivation.* - Thu Oct  1 06:28:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) quickly, he turns to face the south just as Paine had instructed. Before long, the 'shinobi' -- Read: Person tricked by Katsune to wear a headband -- lowers into another crouch, following the steps of the technique in a systematic formula. His body soon is standing on a singular leg, while the other is thrusted out, prepared for the application of the jutsu. He had to stand in a singular spot, thus Maloth did the best impression of a statue that he could quite possibly manage. 

Instantly, he does a slight twist, giving his body a slight rotation. As it goes, there's first an upward kick, meant to serve as a distraction. Paine would likely notice the glaring differences between this, and when he had first been being tuaght. Moreso, the fact that Maloth held a lot more fluidity, even if his attacking speed was piss poor. As that comes over, the brute continues in stride, subsequently launching a kick with that same leg from that motion, this time it's geared towards the bottom.

On the first kick, there's a slight leap, to help with the leg's elevation. ANd towards the end? He's crouching to aid in attacking the lower region of the body. Again and again, the tired, sweaty, and smell beast kept going, his gaze occasionally going onto the concealed figured to gauge whether or not she approved.* - Thu Oct  1 06:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) || It was simple. If what Paine said was that his current level of work wasn't good enough? Then he simply had to be better. There was no ifs, ands, or buts. To truly ascend into the level he desired, Maloth had to work overtime. As she spoke gently, the brute re-assumed the stance, still sweatied and overwhelming aroma still lingering in the area. "Maloth 'stand. Paine can sleep. . . When see time next. . . Maloth have more better in use skill!" He comments with enthusiasm, a fire being lit in his belly.

Once more, the brute leaps, sending a kick. There's a second sweep of the legs following, geared towards the lower area of the body -- or at least, towards where a body would logically be. He repeats the process again and again, in order to gain a greater level of muscle memory or comfort in utilizing the basic level taijutsu skill. 

For a brief moment, his eyes fall onto the ground, taking note of the items that had fallen onto the ground. "Why give?" the male asks inbetween kicks. The comment is clearly dished on over to Marrisa, who seemed relatively charitable for the time being. Other than that, Maloth is continuing with his tirelessly training session. The goal was to do one-thousand kicks repeatily without a moment's rest. The requestion remained. . . could he?* - Thu Oct  1 07:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued with his kicks all the same. It was odd watching such a giant and muscular creature perform an exercise that demanded fluidity and limber body parts. But what he desired was power, thus he'd do anything it'd take to achieve the dream. Maloth's manner of breathing still suggests immense exhaustion, to the point where actual unconsciousness being induced wouldn't exactly be a suprised. By now, he's lost count of how many reps were completed -- not that the brute could even count. "Maloth see. . . " 

He exhales, unable to really keep the process up for too long. After all, stamina wasn't exactly the taijutsu specialist's strong point. He trips up, landing right on his ass, thus suggesting he rests along the sand. Eyes towards Marissa, the hulk-like creature speaks up again. "Not see 'round lot. Who be this. . .?"* - Thu Oct  1 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) catches the pill. He hesistantly inserts it into his mouth, and ingests it. On cue, additional blood cells are being produced, and his body feels partially rejuvenated.* - Thu Oct  1 07:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The brute sauntered from the west, his body covered in the usual layering of smell. He had been working as usual, as evident by the trees that had been 'cut' down. However, the cutting wasn't with any tools, but simply through the collision of Maloth's heavy fists. Musk aside, the traveling leads to his entrance to the local plaza, where two familiar faces are noted. Not a word is said to Suintegu, however, the brute's gaze eventually fall onto the bodacious kunoichi to his right.

There's a blank, thoughtful stare being given. And no, it wasn't due to reasons of perversion, but simply familiarity. ". . 'Lo. Not see 'long time," greeted the brute in a husky voice. The comment  clearly directed towards Lyala.* - Fri Oct  2 04:00:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) hadn't been able to see the impressively display of vigilante justice. But had he? The brute would be exceptionally proud, enough to pat the girl on her back.

As she rushes up, Maloth wears a brief simper, legitimately estatic to see another one of his half siblings. It had been a while, and certainly, Layla had grown -- but just from looks alone, she hadn't grown enough. His eyes shift back to the Demonic-hammer he wore, one especially crafted by the Huevo De Diablo. Along the hilt were spikes, and at times, there seemed to be an organic eyeball making itself known, only to disappear moments after.

"Hrm? Is Weapon. Make fight in battle mo' bettah fo' Maloth. . . Want hold?" A hand had already been drifting to wield the weapon, when Lyala intelligently changes the subject. Speaking of her desire to be Hokage. At the questioning, Maloth shows legitimate skepticism. The young girl didn't -seem- all too powerful, not in the least.

"Not know. . . Need show Muscle. . If be Chief-person o' Leaf place. .  .Need be strong, no?" His bicep flexes, showing off an oversized bulge in the center of his arm. Indeed, the brute was ripped, having place a lot of time in refining his own body, to one day be truthfully unmatched in hand to hand combat. Before long, his hands speed down, aiming to grab the girl by the waist, simply to aid in his examination. 

Assuming he had managed to get an iron-clad grip? Maloth begins to contort Layla's frame, flipping her all about, while still maintaining great gripping -- most likely to her chargin. "Not is look strong.  ."* - Fri Oct  2 04:48:51 2015

The brute wasn't phased, nor even worried at what harm could come -- Lyala didn't look like much of a threat, after all. The battle cry pierces through the air, making it clear that combat had finally began. Fist still clenched, Maloth's chest muscles contract, strickening to produce a higher level of defense. As the blonde punched? She'd find that attacking him was like coming at a brick wall -- it did nothing unless you came with some actual punching power.

He isn't even going to wait. As the girl is kicking at his leg, a simple palm thrust is sent to the area just below the neck -- her upper chest. It's packing a bit of power, and is meant to send her body skidding back in recoil. Of course, had she actually managed to land the kick, Maloth grunts in irritation, yet his weight dictate that he doesn't even budge.* - Fri Oct  2 19:36:19 2015

He's unable to fully cover a wide enough distance, thus allowing the Syrup Trap to strike his leg. "Hrm. . ?"

As Maloth tried to mvoe from this point on, the dimwit is unfortunately entrapped. His legs wouldn't move far, as sticky, syrup clung to the bottom of his feet. "Hnnng! What do?" the boy protests.* - Fri Oct  2 20:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Maloth's chakra continued to boil over. Eventually? The restraint is broken, and in conjunction with his battle style, there's a massive increase in physical strength. With the hammer in hand, the brute slams forward, releasing a collision that could certainly crack and rupture the ground. The goal? To hopefully loosen up the flooring enough to the point where he could walk. Assuming that had been a success, the brute charges ahead, a single fist cocked back.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs. He'd like that, probably. Without a word, he moves off, but not before wrapping a massive hand around Kohaku's waist. She's hoisted up, and sent over his shoulder. Like King Kong, Maloth stomped off, ready to reach the local diner.* - Sat Oct  3 00:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: <*Hmu on skype when ur back, Paine.*> - Sat Oct  3 00:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
As he stomps off, the Konohagakure citizens gawk at him. The scene is very much surreal. A massive -- gargantuan even -- beast meandered about, with an injured, skinny, and underaged girl within his mits. Maloth was muddied, sweat, and carried a nasty stench with him as well, yet the brute thought nothing of it. He seemed content, happy even.

After twenty minutes, they'd close in on the shop. Once the door is kicked open, he enters and approaches a seat.* - Sat Oct  3 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

He fidgets around to get into a more comfortable position. A hand rises to the hammer, and moves it off his back. Heavily, it's slammed onto the ground, breaking right through the floor and prompting wood to splinter out from below. There's a small, fist-sized crater left, forcing the depression to be deep enough that Maloth's weapon is actually lodged in.

"Wha' want eat?" A simple inquiry.* - Sat Oct  3 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: ...Ramen. - Sat Oct  3 01:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . . - Sat Oct  3 01:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yes..../ - Sat Oct  3 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs. He takes out a large sum of money, and demands the waiter over.

"Give lo' for ramen. Mmm. . . Ge' Maloth cake too--"

"Yes, yes. I know you by now. I suppose the usual buffet?" the employee says, cutting off Maloth's spirited order. The brute would have grown angry, had the interruption not been describing precisely what he wanted. As a regular, he was beginning to grow more acquainted with the staff. At once, the order is given away, and thus the waiter moves on, to prepare the feast.

In no less than twenty minutes, massive hordes of carts are being slid over, and the dishes set onto the table. It's what you'd expect. All the goods. From foods such as ramen, or chicken, to sweets like dumplings. Of course, an assortment of drinks had been delivered too.* - Sat Oct  3 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wasted no time to dig in. Stereotypically, the brute matches his manner of eating, and gobbles down everything in sight. It's a messy process, forcing crumbs and other nasty residue to be slung around, some even getting onto Kohaku. After five minutes straight of eating, Maloth turned to face the young teen, cream and sauce all over his face and chest.

"Is good, ye'? Why. . . they take an' force. . .Is slave?"* - Sat Oct  3 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: <*hmu when ur back*> - Sat Oct  3 02:44:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) || As Lyala walked in, she'd find Maloth more or less handling an entire feast on his own. His eating habit is absolutely raveneous, it's a wonder how he doesn't choke.

A chicken wing is lodged into the brute's mouth once Layla had been noticed. "'Lo," the man-child greets in a muffled tone.* - Sat Oct  3 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turned around, chowing greedily at his chicken wing.

It's covered in slobber, enough that the cooked piece of meat practically glimmered in the light. After hearing Lyala actually spending her own money, Maloth opts to be charitable, and holds that same, nasty piece of meat towards the woman's mouth. "Wwant bite?" How kind. . . Yet stupid. A glance is given back to Kohaku, before his visage shifts on over to Lyala once more.

"We jus' eat. Lady not talk lotta, so Maloth jus' eat."* - Sat Oct  3 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Oh....yeah..sorry. - Sat Oct  3 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugged. At her decline, Maloth brings the cooked meat back to his mouth, chomping away at the piece of food as it were the last edible object in the world. For a few minutes, the fiend continued to practically -inhale- all of the food in sight. On one occasion, he's choking up, only to deal with the issue by downing an entire bottle of sake in one gulp.

Considering his frame, the alcohol is handled quite easily, considering the substance takes a long way to spread around. ". . ." He 'hrms' at last, as an idea finally crept into mind.

"If say go eat. . . Why come fo' eat here. . .?" It wasn't often that he could see through deception, so this was neat.* - Sat Oct  3 03:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Should we go? - Sat Oct  3 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. She hadn't answered his question, but the change in subject was a great distraction. By now, the large bulk of the food had been dealt with, approximately eighty percent. The rest of the bowls/plates are half eaten, and a surplus of half-eaten residue is spreaded onto the table. "Is guess. . ." He says shrugging. Quickly, his club of a hand goes to grab the gal again, and tossing her over a shoulder.

"Where go?"* - Sat Oct  3 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Arnitanu(Brosis55) says: Spar me. - Sat Oct  3 04:19:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turns. He didn't seem intent on letting Lyala down -- up until the issue had been challenged. Quickly, the girl is gently placed back onto the table. 

"Is 'kay. If want fight, gues' just fight!"* - Sat Oct  3 04:21:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looked on oddly as the male seems to summon bugs. ". . .!" Quickly, considering the sudden fear that had spawned at the sight of INSECTS coming out of the guy's SKIN, a hand moves to grab his hammer. It's crimson red, fitted with spikes along the hilt, and wrecks of pure, unrefined EVIL. Without question, dark energies had tampered with the weaponry at some point of time. . . Nevermind the eye that was apparent along one side, although it blinked now and then, making the eyeball not visible on occasions.

Still lacking in proficiency, rather than performing a skillful strike, Maloth swings -- like the damn thing was a bat. It seeks to ram against Arnitanu's ribs and hopefully keep those bugs from fucking him up too bad.

'Course, since Maloth was just a giant, muscle head, he's not swift enough nor nimble enough to invade the insects. The latch onto his skin, easily eating away at his potent reservoir of energy. It annoyed the viking-spawn, but now was no time to complain. The spike along the weapons don't seem to harm him too much, save for superificial cuts along the flesh.* - Sat Oct  3 04:33:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Slowly but sure, his chakra is being absolutely nomnom'd. Maloth wasn't one to work on his levels of chakra, but thankfully, selective breeding had made it so that his body held higher levels of energy than usual. THe bugs, even with more swarming, find that they're not quite able to deplete Maloth as fast as they'd think. ". . .Hng! Not li' this! Need figh' fo'real! Wit' hans!" he says in outrage, raging like a child who had been denied the latest pairs of Jordan.

Considering the quantity had been multiplied by four, the drain is naturally four times as fast. By now, this equates to him being left at about eighty percent of his natural level of energy. Inspite of this, the determined warrior fought on -- but this time in a more frantic, and panicked state. It wasn't often that you dealt with an opponent that covered you in a swarm of bugs, after all. With haste, he continued to sluggishly swing the hammer, akin to a star baseball batter going for a homerun.

In his hastiness, he misses his mark several times, completely. The motions only stop once coming in contact with solid objects, and thus granting shockwaves. The wall, the floor, the table -- all are victimized in the behemoth's random path of destuction. And each of the amentioned areas? Are chipped off, often times with holes or small 'craters' being left as a reminder of the brute's immense strength.

However, the last? Goes right towards Arnitanu, this time aiming to slam in the center of the male's chest. * - Sat Oct  3 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) frowned. The hammer lands with effectiveness, releasing a loud thump and wsending Arnitanu flying backwards. ". . Is. . Finish. . ?" the hulk-like creature said with a frown. His demonic hammer slams down onto the ground, forming another hole in the flooring.

Obviously, the employees and store owner is anything but happy. He's a twenty-five year old, apparently a boss when it comes to cooking. Rushing out, the male is swift to confront the two --- but then steers away from Maloth upon seeing that the dude was like the baby of Yao Ming, with Muscles like Brock Lesnar.

But no, he really does feel a streak of fear implanted in his soul. Briefly, Maloth and the Owner's eye meet, and a bull-like grunt is released from the brute, nostrils flaring. That alone prompts no immediate action. Instead, the chef/owner saunteers onto Arnitanu. "You have to pay for the damage! How dare you come pick a fight in my shop?" Meanwhile, the actual culprit for the damage is dragging the hammer along, falling next to Lyala. 

"Hng. Wha' we go do 'gain. . ?" He had forgotten what they had been on the way to do clearly.* - Sat Oct  3 05:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs. He liked to display his dominance. Lifting her made it clear how strong he was.

"Like do. If wan' be down be put. . . Nee' tell Maloth. What want do?" he demands with a light snarl.* - Sat Oct  3 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. By now, his arm had thoroughly moved about Lyala's waist, holding her perfectly in place. Considering his immense strength, she wasn't getting out anytime soon, lest she pull out some neat tricks.

"No! Nee' tell Maloth now! O' ne'er git down!"* - Sat Oct  3 05:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Gah.... I was going to train some of my jutsu. - Sat Oct  3 06:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He begins to head off, still with the girl in tow. "Where be want train then. . .?" Maloth asks, upon leaving the battered restaurant. He was already turning west, and moving onward to more open areas.* - Sat Oct  3 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Gah, the lake. - Sat Oct  3 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Can you let me down now? - Sat Oct  3 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) allows down!

"Fine. . "* - Sat Oct  3 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's grunted as Lyala initially taunts him. A step forward is taken, but thankfully, Lyala had seemingly saw it fit to begin with her training at last. Arms folded, Maloth has nothing to do -- save for observing the kunoichi as she diligently practices her ninjutsu, granting her spirit additional experience. Each usage of the special spell no doubt imparts her soul with additional spiritual energy, and empowers her overall ability, even if subtle.

While Lyala had managed to best him in combat with the same move before, Maloth still was dazzled, his mouth opening agape in a suprised stupor. Thick, syrup-y substances flew from mouth, gushing like a geyser and flying into the water. Despite being of the 'Suiton' nature, it was entirely unlike water.

That fact is made clear, moreso due to the syrup sticking ontop of the pond's surface for the first few seconds. Inevitably, it sinks, plunging down into the depths of the body of liquid, along said the other dead bodies. As she made her approach, Maloth wears a smile, clearly taking pleasure in seeing the elementalist go to work. He nods along. "Maybe day-one. . can come be Ho-cage. . . Mmm, do good!" The tone is noticeably more cheerful than usual, complete stripped of it's usual gruffness. 

His right hand had thrusted ahead, playfully slamming into Lyala's shoulder. Of course, by 'playful', he likely overestimates his strength. Indeed, if struck, the blonde would find the force pushing her ahead, perhaps into the water. Hopefully she knew how to Suimen.* - Sat Oct  3 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Whoops. He had once more overestimated his strength, thus forcing Lyala into the pool of water. As she raged and squealed, Maloth simply got a hearty chuckle out of it. No apologies are given. "Hahaha! Wow! Maybe no can be Kage-person! Look easy how be fo' push intah water! Is need ge' more strong, li' Malo--"

His eyes had been closed in the sequence, because he was seriously laughing that damn hard. Tears almost spawned from his optics.

Then came the seals. In no time whatsoever, thick waves wash over the area, and crashes right into his chest. The strength, while not enough to seriously threaten his wellbeing, certainly proves to be enough to send him staggering back. Just barely, his foot finds itself no longer supported by the wooden walk-way. As such, his body sails right into the pond, forcing him to plunge deep within the depths. He sunk like a rock, but honestly knew how to swim. 

Quickly, Maloth waddles to the surface, a hand holding onto the bridge as a result. "Hng! Why do this!?" Eyes were narrowed onto his younger, blonde sibling. They spoke of vengence.* - Sat Oct  3 07:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) thinks: What the fuck... - Sat Oct  3 07:32:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) pulls himself up at last.

Leaving behind a trace, there's some thick, brown residue  left in the water. He doesn't bath much. It's likely mud. 

"Hng. . Is no funny. . . " Maloth replies, still staring at the presumably embarrassed Lyala. Of course, her flustered state seems to go right over his head.* - Sat Oct  3 07:39:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And suddenly. . . 

Tragedy struck.  BOOM! Loud crashes could be heard resonating from the south. Instinctively, the hunter/barbarian gripped on his  Demonic weapon, chakra pulsating from his form. . . 

But not even Maloth was -that- dumb.

The Gargantuan creature to the south was in full display. Its skin brittle, coarse, and body completedly enveloped in steel-tinted armor. It was for the first time in forever, the brute had experienced a rare emotion -- fear. Trepidation at it's finest. His body shook, unwilling to move, up until the first wave of terror had been unleashed.
