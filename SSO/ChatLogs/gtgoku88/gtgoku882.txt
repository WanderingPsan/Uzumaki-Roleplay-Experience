Sadly, adrenaline was already flowing, and making it so the pain felt had been numbed. Quickly, the brute continues with his spinning, insistent on making it so that the mask had fallen off. After a single revolution, his hands let go, allowing the Taijutsu Spceialist's body to be sent sailing along the sandy floors of the battle region.

". . . . Come!" He beckons the girl forward, and sure enough, Paine is rushing ahead, ready to deal more punishment. By now, it's obvious just how she's going to attack as well -- via kicks. 

Nevertheless, despite accurately anticipating, Maloth's ability to react, and his overall body movements leave much to be desired. Instead, a quick right boot hammers into his stomach. Deceptively, she packs quite a punch. This blow forces the giant specimen to recoil, and literally sends him skidding backwards.

Quickly,  the battle resumed, with the slender figure now leaping through the air. In response, Maloth's arms shoot up again, forming an 'X'. The arms serve as a shield against the incoming Dynamic Entry. While defended against, Maloth's body again is forced to slide back in recoil due to the sheer strength that Paine had suddenly been able to develop.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: What is it I should be doing here - Thu Sep 24 23:42:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued walk along the road.

Each step taken is enough to casually force some vibrations to be felt along the ground. As he passes through the square, various onlookers gawked at his form. Some were amazed, others enarmored, and of course there was those that envied or simply saw his physique as ridiculous. Maloth paid no mind to the onlookers, of course. 

After all, by now, he was far too used to it.

Eventually, however, the duo would reach the local dinery. Eagerly, the brute takes a seat onto a nearby table, forcing the object to rattle about, and scrunch -- barely able to support his gargantuan weight. 

"First thing need know! Is punchy fighter? If punch fighter, need for get like Maloth!" The barbarian roars, clearly in reference to the art of battle known as 'Taijutsu.' "Need get big for take punch mucha better." And by now, it was clear why he had been brought here. To eat. Even with the impressive muscle Maloth sported, there was also a silly amount of fat that was wrapped around said muscles. * - Thu Sep 24 23:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He had a -lot- of money. Mainly, it was due to his exploits as a savage that stalked the forest. Often times, this would lead the wanton robbery of those that lingered outside of society.

Eventually, he calls on over the waitress and begins to fill out an order.

"Hrm. . .Give Maloth e'erythin' can get! Want lotta food! 'Nough fill up table!" The behemoth roars, pulling out a bag absolutelly filled with yen.* - Fri Sep 25 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He barks, prompting the waitress to move ahead with urgency. Quickly, she -- alongside the rest of the employees -- are scrambling to get dishes ready.

After a ten minute wait, carts upon carts are being sent over. 

By the dozens, dishes are slide onto the table. Eventually, the amount of food that's piled up is high enough to block out vision. All that would be seen is a mountain of treats, forcing Flexus entire frame to be overshadowed.

"Woo! Yes. Then now have eat! When eat. Get more fat, fat be 'ble make take hits."* - Fri Sep 25 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) held an appetite that could rival an Akimichi. . .If not outright exceeding.

His massive, meaty hands quickly grab at the assortment of dishes. For the noodles/ramens? He literally takes the bowls and downs the contents, drinking as if this was a common glass of cold-water.

There were also other dishes, such as roasted Boars, and so forth-- each of which is ravenously chewed away. In a minute, about one third of the food had been scarfed down by Maloth himself.

"Is good!"* - Fri Sep 25 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
After the hour long feast at the local restaurant, Maloth was back on the prowl. Considering his recent defeats at the hands of nearby shinobi, the brute was even more motivated to begin with his training.

Eventually, he finds way to a nearby opening south of the mansion.

And what luck. . . Paine was sitting right there, doing god knows what. "Yo! Say be help Maloth with kick thing, yes? Maloth ready for get stronger. Need be most stronk Tai-person in world," he  shouts.* - Fri Sep 25 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He didn't know -any- darn taijutsu skills to begin.

So. . Maloth would have no damn complains whatsoever. "Jump. . . Kick. Not know what mean." Contrary to his giant appearance, Maloth had hops. Although, his body lack in flexibility, with each movement being rigid. With a small pivot, the man jumps, and lifts a leg up-- but it sadly doesn't extend properly. Like a clumsy bafoon, he comes crashing down, shaking the earth below him. ". . ."

Cue awkward pause. 

"Is good? Maloth not kknow. . . Ne'er learn move fo' taijutsu. Jus' try' punch tings all hard." Casually, the fiend begins to shadow spar, launching rugged or sluggish punches along the air. His adrenaline was picking back up, prompting him to eagerly face Paine. "Take off hat. Hate not able see face."* - Fri Sep 25 05:28:32 2015

Maloth was like a lost child.

He hadn't the experience that Paine had. Unlike the girl, who possessed no natural ability or special genetics, the brute got around solely by being well. . . A phyiscal monster. A beast, even. Battles went easy for him, not due to finesse or skill. But simply because there weren't a lot a of Taijutsu opponents that could even gegt through his thick skin. The male's durability made it appear as if he wore the 'Domu' at all times, meaning his skin -- while not rough like rock -- was every bit as durable. Still, as the taijutsu maestro gave her instruction, he just nodded along, pretending that there was an actual understandment in the lesson being provided.

"--Is good take off hat. Like see face," the brute compliments, patting the girl on the head. "But need show Maloth. How do kick? Not jus 'ble tell. .  Need for show." He even takes a step back, giving Paine an opened room to actually go about instructing him in the Dynamic Entry.* - Fri Sep 25 06:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
For the better part of a night, Maloth kept working hard to properly utilized the 'Dynamic Entry' technique. 

Paine's explanation and demonstration continued to replay through his mind like an old movie. Sadly, there were clear differences between he and Paine's body type. She was as light as a feather, and could easily flutter through the skies to ram her feet against an opponent's body. 

Maloth, on the otherhand, was built like a bruiser. . a brick even. The second he'd leap up, gravity was already conspiring to bring his ass back down to earth. Despite the difficulties in weight, the brute was still significantly strong, however. Thus, actually leaping was never going to be an issue. After lining up along the bottom of the field, the giant takes off in a massive sprint. Each of his muscles tensed, preparing for the eventually flight. 

Upon getting a head full of steam, the barbarian kicks off the ground, allowing his body's natural force to go directly against mother nature. Like a Bumble Bee, Maloth defies all apparent aerodynamic physics, and soars through the skies. As his body raced along the area, the brute shifts, allowing a singular leg to be erected, while the correspondant appendage was pulled backwards. It was this design that made sailing through the atmosphere for a dynamic entry all the more easy.

Of course, as a simpleton, he fails to account for keeping the rest of his body erect or straight. Rather than successfully utilizing the simple taijutsu, he crashes right into the ground. His body rolls along the sandy surface. After a few rotations, his bulky arms pushes agajinst the ground, allowing him to arise.

Covered in bruises and dirt, Maloth resumes the practicing. On the twentieth try, rather than slamming into the floor, his body accelerates through the skies. One foot crushes right against the tree, breaking through without a moment's notice. Upon successfullly completing the technique, the savage hunches over, breathing heavily. 

Sweat covers his form, making the usual scent grow more apparent.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akirama(Killer-wolf-kun) says: Excuse me - Fri Sep 25 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had been dragging his body ahead. He breaths in and out in a heavy and haggard fashion. 

". .Hrm? What need. . ?"* - Fri Sep 25 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looked on incredulously. Was this actually happening right now?

". . Not get what mean. . .Why talk this like. . .?" the cave-man like warrior said with confusion. He stands up erect, preparing for any hostilities, should Akirama be willing to try anything.* - Fri Sep 25 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
"Mm. . . An' how try train on Maloth? Not think can e'en hurt. . " the brute quickly replies, while sizing the child up. Of course, looks could be deceiving, as he distinctively recalls another child that had been able to completely by pass his bulky body.

Slowly, the barbarian lowers into a crouch.

"By battle. .?"* - Fri Sep 25 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) sighs.

"If say so. Try beat Maloth. . " The brute welcomes the challenge, even if he was speaking lazily. His arms rise up, and hands ball into firsts. "Come! Fight Maloth!"* - Fri Sep 25 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
"We fight then! If ready for fight, come hit Maloth! See if can hurt!" the behemoth demands, stomping his feet in anticipation. The stomps are severe or vicious enough to leave imprints layered around the sandy flooring. His bulging muscles tense, in clear anticipation of physical punishment.* - Fri Sep 25 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The battle began with as much intensity as he'd expect. 

The punch wedges right against Maloth's shoulder, but even as the bl9ow sinks in. . . the giant doesn't budges one bit. If Akirama wanted to win, he'd have to come with something harder than that. The force resonating through the initial blow is unable to even really seep through is fat, let alone the muscle. After tanking the blow, the brute gives a mighty, right-handed swipe of the hand. 

His muscles still are tensed, and the hand is on path towards the ribs to strike the youth down.

"Fight harder!"* - Fri Sep 25 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) chortled. He loved when people aimed to engage him in hand to hand combat. Each of scenario often ended with frustration on the part of his opponents, considering most foes lacked the necessary strength to bypass his thick hide. 

The initial strike launched by Maloth seems to do a great job, holding enough force to forceAkirama into being sent backwards. The blow was particularly strong as it had mustered up every ounce of strength the barbarian could release -- and even sought to go beyond his normal limitations. Maloth knew damn well that against most opponents his current level of strength would prove inadequate. . . So why not go to achieve the 'legend'? (Hint: A state of mind where your body's strength isn't held in check by mental restraints.)

Before he can even approach, Akirama is seemingly back on the offensive. Three seals later, the brute is helpless as a torrent of water comes speeding out of his mouth. In response, Maloth's forearm rises, forming an 'X' to shield against the incoming ninjutsu. Sadly, no matter how badly the boy tried, he'd find that all was futile against the might of this particular behemoth.

"Not good 'nough!"* - Fri Sep 25 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The plan was clever.

Sadly, it wasn't exactly going to win him the battle. Lightning worked well with water, yes. . . And Maloth was certainly covered in it. Thus, as the electromagnetic murder technique went over his form, he's jolting and convulsing about. 

It goes on for as few second, but as the electricity clears up. . . Maloth seems unimpressed, unshaken by even that combination. Smoke lingered from his flesh, but save for a few burns, his body remained in relatively nice condition. Casually, he smiles, his expression smug overall. "Tell Maloth. This be all boy able do. . ? Need come harder. . . Guess be turn o' me!" With one mighty step, he presses forward, and unleashes a haymaker towards the centre of the genin's chest.

This was looking to be a knockout blow, despite the slowness.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stomps into the mansion. His body is sweaty as usual, and carries a musk due to recently completing his training exercise. Lazily, he leans over, his hands pressing against knees.

"'Lo. Maloth bore. Give thing for do.. "* - Sat Sep 26 00:05:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

". . .Much strong. Need learn better taijutsu," he say, referencing his immensely powerful body, although he greatly lacks in technical skill. It wasn't hard to believe it either. Maloth was just a physical specimen. All brawn, no brain.* - Sat Sep 26 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. - Sat Sep 26 00:09:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) perks a brow.

He wasn't sure what this implied, but takes the headband away. It's worn over his shoulder. ". . Mm. 'Kay! Now give thing for do, Maloth bore!" He barks out, clearly a bit eager to begin with some actual productivity.* - Sat Sep 26 00:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) moves up to grab the scroll.

"What is. . . mes-sage?" He eyes the scroll curiously, and honestly debates on opening it.* - Sat Sep 26 00:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Hmm. The scroll is just mission details in case you forget. It tells you where to go, and.... - Sat Sep 26 00:37:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . Hrm. <*Turns to Paine*> Be ready? - Sat Sep 26 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turns around and motions for Paine to lead the way out the mansion.* - Sat Sep 26 00:48:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Before the trip began, Maloth of course stops by the local diner. With his massive storage of yen, the brute makes sure to order a feast, which is intelligently sealed within a scroll. Due to this, he effectively has a scroll latched onto his back that can casually be utilized in the travels. It isn't long before the brute meets up with Paine at the village exit. With a nod, the hulk-like creature motions forward, and thus he begins to lead her down the road.

"Hng. . . Not think this what Maloth have do. Maloth jus' want. .  like wrassle. O'. . . punch things. Guess nothin' for do 'bout it. . yes?" That's about as eloquent as the dimwit would get. Of course, to his rear, there's a massive wagon that had been delivered, all filled with supplies.

A meaty club goes to wrap around the handle, allowing the cart to be closely behind him during the mission. He personally shoulders the load of carting the cargo. ". . .Mm. So how do this thing. . . 'lway do missions?"* - Sat Sep 26 01:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
"Mhm. . .! Have go long way for village. . ." 

Without another word, Maloth begins to pull the cart ahead, the squeaky wheels creaking as it rolled along the road. The brute has a vast storage of stamina, thus his muscles very seldomly suffer fatigue. And when it did? He takes a short moment to rest. These are often ten minutes at a time before the hulking figure is back on the road. Observant eyes stare ahead, ensuring that the environment that he remained in was always well within his mind. No way a rogue was ever going to creep up on them.

Eventually, he's unable to keep silence. Small talk -had- to be had.

By now, it's night time, and the sun is setting. Maloth motions for Paine to follow, leading her into a thick, forested area, so that no one could find as they rested for the evening. Upon finding a decent area, the brute takes a seat, allowing the cart to finally come to rest. "Mmm. . We have rest for now." His giant body snuggles up against a tree, while a fire is being produced, along with shelter to shield from potential rain.

"Tell Maloth. Why like be 'punch' person? Not look like person good for punch. Look like person that clean o' cook. Be nice lady for man." What a sexist point of view. But it wasn't ill-intent. This was simply the way his tribe had functioned. The women who weren't built like amazons were seen as second class citizens, and were forced to do busy work.* - Sat Sep 26 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
He nods.

"Yes. Look like little lady. Wonder if can cook. . ." Maloth comments. As Paine trained, he instead opts to rest, hoping that the period of sleep would be enough to replenish th fatigue his muscles currently felt. They weren't sore by any means, but certainly felt the sting of tiredness. With a few hours of rest, Maloth eventually awakens, unsealing a massive buffet. Vehemously, the brute is chewing away, and in record time, the bulk of the treat is completed, save for a half-eatened chicken wing. By then, the giant stands upward and latches a hand back onto the cart handle.

"We need go. Mission take long 'nough time. . "

They weren't far from the Tea Village of course.  As the warrior begins to move ahead, Maloth holds out the saliva-covered chicken wing in Paine's general direction. "Needfood for eat? We not can stop. Chief-person wait for Maloth an' Paine. . ." Assuming Paine followed, they'd be off, and in a few hours, the group was closing in on the designated area. Finally the mission was reaching an end.* - Sat Sep 26 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Finally they had arrived. 

As they close in, Maloth eagerly hands over the stalk. In response to the items being delivered, the clients seem to hand over a small tip. "We finally finish. . . Take such long time for come. . " With that said. . Maloth is about ready to return back to Konohagakure. After pocketing the spare yen, he gives a nod to Paine and proceeds off.

Rather than walk, the giant is literally sprinting, each step forcing the ground to quake or quiver under his inhumane weight. It was going to be another day's travel, but eventually, they would reach home, now in perfect condition to actually note a mission completion and gain their payment. ". . Mmm. Wonder what get when done. . ."* - Sat Sep 26 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) returns after about three days of being outside the village.

"We finish . . "* - Sat Sep 26 04:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook head.

He leans against the twall and slides down.

"Fight Paine. . ." Fatigue was evident.* - Sat Sep 26 04:59:05 2015
