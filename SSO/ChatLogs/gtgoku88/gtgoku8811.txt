<br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: Well!~ You did something that I couldn't stand up straight or walk for a few days. - Fri Oct 16 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods at the whisper.

"Yes. Is like do," he replies, smiling on slightly. 

He stood up, brow risen. "Why is go home? Fo' practice? Maloth able help if be," the giant adds.* - Fri Oct 16 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Uhh, no. It's fine. You don't have to come with me, besidies I'm just going to go change my clothes and I will come back and we can practice. - Fri Oct 16 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Mkay? - Fri Oct 16 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs. He had nothing better to do.

"I come."

His eyes remain on Khalil's lower body throughout the travel.* - Fri Oct 16 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) would have followed behind Khalil.

Briefly, Maloth entertains changing himself. After all, his clothes were smudged in dirt, and left in tatters as a result of the previous, fast-paced spar he had done previously. 

However, those thoughts quickly leaves his eyes, as he scans Khalil's form. It was lithe, but voluptous all the same, prompting the primal feelings of arousal. The brute, despite being a human, was still much like a 'beast' in terms of mindset. A simple slave to his natural thoughts. Thus, taking an  approach, a giant hand rests onto Khalil's bum,giving a tight squeeze and kneading.

There's a subtle look of lust, but all the same, he seems to just be handling business, while staring with an also blank expression.* - Fri Oct 16 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head, breaking off the trance. He gestures for Khalil to lead the way.

"How we be train? Jus' more spar?" the brute questions, although aving no problem with additional sparring.* - Fri Oct 16 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I mean... how else do you want to train? - Fri Oct 16 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Not know! - Fri Oct 16 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Ugh. See? I bore you or something. I don't know how to train but let's figure it out, yeah? - Fri Oct 16 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: You no' bore. - Fri Oct 16 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Is lot way train. - Fri Oct 16 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Mos' time. Maloth is jus' do lotta push up. - Fri Oct 16 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Mmm. - Fri Oct 16 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Do you want to train or stay here? - Fri Oct 16 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) rubs his chin.

He knows what he'll end up doing if he remains in the house, and doesn't seem keen on putting Khalil out of action for too long. "Mmm. we go train."* - Fri Oct 16 22:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Let's go! - Fri Oct 16 22:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) arrive at the designated training area.

He lands with a loud thud, forcing the ground to shake. "'Kay. We figh' this time? Need be able fror hurt."* - Fri Oct 16 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Real fight! - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You can hurt me if you want. - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Mm. . - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Not wan' hurt too much.. - Fri Oct 16 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: You have too! If I want to be strong like you! - Fri Oct 16 22:50:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He didn't want to harm his toy, yet Khalil insisted.* - Fri Oct 16 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Fine. . - Fri Oct 16 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts./ He was going a lot of sparring today, that was for sure.

There were no complaints, though. Each battle he endured only made him stronger. Unlike the battle iwth Paine, Maloth opts to use his base strength, as anymore ran the risk of potentially killing the younger Yamanshi.

Like a bull, his feet clatters along the ground as he makes a mad dash forward. His hip is pulled back, building up torque, and as it unwinds, the massive fist goes rushing ahead, hopefully slamming against the center of the boy's chest. If success, it holds a good amount of concussive damage,. enough to send the average person flying and rolling along the flooring.* - Fri Oct 16 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The attack crushes along Khalil's form, sending the young, male trap skidding along the pavement. It was certainly a thunderous impact, enough to knock the air out of youth's body! 

". . .! Is keep fightin'?" Maloth asks, amidst a sprint, his eyes locking onto the trainee's form. Assuming Khalil hadn't asked for a premature break, the giant lifts off onto the air, his body capable of retaining perfect symmetry. Dynamic entry, in perfect form. It was a skill he eventually wanted to show Khalil, if the boy would even deem this taijutsu, considering it was just a simple kick.

However, had the Yamanshi asked, or showed signs of literally being unable to continue, a leisure jog is taken to be by the male's side. "Is 'kay?"* - Fri Oct 16 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stay in place, frowning.

"Is. . . No 'kay?"* - Fri Oct 16 23:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) sighs, relieved once it was clear that Khalil was okay.

He gently smiles, as the hug around his waist goes full circle. Once the instructions had been given, Maloth backs up, falling into his patent 'Iron Fist' stance again. 

"'Kay! Time this. . . is 'come 'tack Maloth! Nee' get more smart. No hit Maloth ting-ting," he says, in reference to Khalil's repeat tactic of striking his manhood. Even if that was a 'weak point' for all men, Maloth just had too much damn tolerance for pain. As the space is given, a hand gestures for the young shinobi to continue with the spar.* - Fri Oct 16 23:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Maloth remain sitting around in a stationary position, waiting for the beast known as Khalil to at last wage assault on his body.

Over the weeks, Maloth had been working hard to refine his body, and make his frame absolute. . . Unpenetrable by all physical attacks. And honestly? It was beginning to feel that way. The attack literally does nothing by this point, as the beast shrugs it off.

"Nee' hit different!" He notes, making it clear that actually trying to damage him by now was a lost cause. If Khalil wanted victory, she'd need to figure out how to defeat him without inflicting damage. Victory comes in many ways -- such as ensuring that your opponent wasn't in position to attack.* - Sat Oct 17 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) eats the punch. It takes no effort at all, and doesnt' even seem to phase the giant.

As Khalil is biting, Maloth simply chuckles. It was cute. . . How hard the youngin' tried, but in the end, physically attacking him by now was proving to be futile. Khalil's teeth would dig in, but would never be capable of breaking flesh. He had simply became too rigid.

"Hahaha! No try good 'nough. Mmm. . .'nough fight! Need learn movesest."* - Sat Oct 17 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) allows such. 

"Only if Khalil 'cide what for do."* - Sat Oct 17 01:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks.

The entire thing made no sense what so ever to Maloth.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) smirks.

It had been a week or two since the teacher and student had last seen each other. He takes a hand, pounding it against his own form in triumph. "Is no see?! Body mucha strongah! Give full stron' punch! Not thin' 'ble hurt!"* - Sun Oct 18 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looks around.

He was getting tired of Kumo.

"Where is chief?"* - Sun Oct 18 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: i-im not sure...i havent seen t-them...all d-day.. - Sun Oct 18 01:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: So har' find. - Sun Oct 18 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looks ahead. He's clearly contemplating something.

"Think. . . Maloth is be chief!"* - Sun Oct 18 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: w-wahh...y-you..want to be c-cheif? - Sun Oct 18 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . Yes! - Sun Oct 18 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs.

He takes a sprint ahead, grabbing ahold of Paine all the while. The giant continued up the mountain, each step shaking the earth, and alerting the world at large of his arrival. Maloth wasn't going to stop either, not until the mansion had been breached --- Or well, whatever else existed of it.

"Is time fo' chief!"* - Sun Oct 18 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stops once infront of Amaya.

A massive finger is pointed ahead. "Chief sleep for much too! Is nee' give up spot! Maloth be new chief!" the brute declared, his voice stern, gruff, and demanding. He wasn't playing any damn games. His body was filled with tension, prompting his muscles to remain stricken, and prepared for action.

A vein popped from his head.* - Sun Oct 18 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head.

He pounds on his chest in response, while roaring a rebuttal. "No! Is lie! Tire o' lazy! Give Maloth chief!" The brute demanded, the pounding of his own body only serving to raise his primal instincts and desire to take over. 

The guards didn't really mean shit to Maloth. He doubted any of them could get pass his sturdy defenses.* - Sun Oct 18 01:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's body tensed. He takes a step forward, but stops as Amaya aims to reason. . . To pacify the beast.

"Hrm. . ? Is sense mae. . . Then Maloth 'ble lead thing then!" He said, referencing his apparent political power in Kumogakure. Why not be given the ability to handle missions?* - Sun Oct 18 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head again.

He wasn't going to buy that shoddy logic. A glance is given to the various warriors that served as protection. . And once again, Maloth takes a step forward, this time bringing him arms out to clutch at the nearest guard. If not avoided, the giant's hands would have been around that poor specimen's neck.

"No thin' good! . . 'lway har' find! <aloth nee' mo' power!" the brute articulated, as he was now muscling through, aiming to get to Amaya -- and perhaps shake her down. Things could have perhaps been different. . . If she was more of an active leader, rather than someone who seemingly was intent on holding onto power just to have it. * - Sun Oct 18 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) thinks: I'd have handed this title to him in the first place if he could fuckin'read. Or write for that matter. - Sun Oct 18 02:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was tired of being a pawn.

Amaya had two options -- to grant him more power, and thus allow Maloth to be a psuedo-kage, or simply face the wrath of the Behemoth. The taijutsu specialist before him is abruptly lifted, and laid upon the brute's shoulder. Considering the difference in strength and ability, doing so was but a trivial task, thanks to the brute's natural, genetically gifted cells.

In time, his right arm would clutch at the Taijutsu Spec's leg, and using it as leverage to propel the poor soul forward.

Simultaneous, Maloth's extra arm is pulling, as his shoulder dips, making the propulsion go on all too smoothly. If not stopped, one of Amaya's guards would find himself being be F-U'd right into the ground, with enough force to make the fondation of the crater shake -- at least within a small radius. THere's a subtle depression that's spawned as a direct result of the brutish collision, and no doubt, said guard was going to be out of comission.

Still tensed, and steaming with angst, Maloth looks ahead again, and takes cautious steps forward. "Nee' mo' power! Is time last Maloth for tell! Is warn!" roared the disgruntled beast. His patience was running thin. . . And while a rare occurence, it was clear that an angry Maloth wasn't going to be a pleasant Maloth. * - Sun Oct 18 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) leaped up after performing the impressive ass Attitude Adjustment.

"Wooo!" Adrenaline was flowing, surely enough.

He didn't care at all. Whether he worked or ran, all that mattered to Maloth by this point was getting into actual confrontations, and engaging in hot blooded battles.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||He'd follow behind Paine. 

Considering they were tough, hardened warriors, Maloth had no intent on taking a caravan. Their bodies would simply have to become versed with enduring the weather, taking whatever mother nature had to offer. Thus, in no time, the duo are taking their trip, with Maloth characteristically forcing himself to endure un-needed strain. He carries a luggage, filled with nothing more than a series of bulky, heavy rocks. The likes of which weigh his down, and make even the simplest of movements difficult -- if not impossible.

Ignoring the strain on his muscles, the brute would have tranversed the lands, eventually coming to the outskirts of Konoha, with the forest just a short smile ahead. Considering the day of near non-stop traveling, he settles down, at last being at a moment's rest. His eyes shut, allowing focus to be on the internal systems that he called the chakra network. It was this system that allowed him to access additional power or strength -- and it was this would inevitably prompt him to achieve greatness, and perhaps hold power that was unparalleled.

Eyes closed, his mind drifts, allowing chakra to again pool around the brain. Boom, boom . . .In no time, two of the chakra nodes -- the ones specific to keeping his chakra gates in tact -- were easily knocked out of the way. Not only does this give a vivid increase to strength, but it also serves as a means to an end. With a higher flow of strength or power in terms of chakra flow, Maloth is more capable of targetting the next gate.

In time, energy is pooled, and his willpower is seeking to breakthrough, to unlock that next state of power. "Hng. . Hng. . " the warrior grunted. Sadly, it was all for naught. . . as the brute certainly lacked the capacity to achieve the third Hachimon state -- the Gate of Pain. His eyes were in the process of opening. . .And a layer of sweat hugged his form yet again.

 -- Then Paine went about, gathering her strength with the Hachimon formation, and dishing a vicious kick to Maloth's stomach. Yet unfortunately. . 

With the male's consistent training, the strike does very little, other than serving as an agent of annoyance. The brute had grown far too thick or sturdy. Instead of being annoyed, there's a grin. "No hit hard 'nough. We keep go now. . " Assuming Paine's compliance, they were heading right into Konoha.* - Sun Oct 18 17:55:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) didn't buy the claim . . At least not yet.

Regardless, the simple notion of his dear sister being murdered unsettled Maloth, and that much was clear, as evident by the subtle shakes his body performed. The seeds of rage had been planted. . . Teeth clenched, the brute shook his head.

"No believe. . .! Where is body if say die? An' what be man name? If true. . . Maloth is ready fo' kill!" He was a man of vengence, not peace. Angst and guilt was being riled up, communing at his soul -- as this wasn't the first person Maloth had failed to protect in his life span.* - Sun Oct 18 18:54:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||From start to finish. . . That name resonated through his mind.

'Mizumi'. .  The syllabels echo'd, repeating in his brain again and again. That name was never going to be forgotten. Blankly, Maloth looked ahead into the skies, reminisciencing over his presumably deceased sibling. She was so full of joy. . . Always aspiring for the greater good, and seeking to be Hokage to hopefully spread her good moralities onto the rest of the globe.

Despite those pleasant memories, guilt hung heavy over the brute. 

Again, he had failed to protect another close family member -- And this time, he wasn't going to let it go without punishment. After thinking on the matter, and holding hold that Lyala still remained living, the brute's gaze falls back to Heiwa. "Give picture. . . Fo' mask an' cloth. . .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) frowned. He pretty ticked, sure enough. Paine had promised that they'd come to train together with another village, yet all they've done thus far was linger, doing nothing.

"Wha' is fo' do here?"* - Sun Oct 18 20:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turns.

He looks to her sword. "Is figh'. . ?"* - Sun Oct 18 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Me? - Sun Oct 18 20:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sun Oct 18 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs. He didn't care where he fought.

"We go?" The brute's body is crouching, descending into his patented, Iron Fist style.* - Sun Oct 18 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'll begin then.. - Sun Oct 18 20:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) thinks: Baby won't you come my wayyyy~! - Sun Oct 18 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. The battle had began at last. 

He doesn't bother to move, figuring that the woman was as weak as she looked. As the sword slashed through the air, a forearm rises, in hopes of blocking the attack before it can even reach his chest.

Assuming success, the sharpened blade would crash against Maloth's flesh. Oddly enough, his skin itself had been refined, toughened up beyond the normal defenses you would see in a human . In fact. . . It was beyond human capacity, and thus the katana has no effect, despite it's hardness. "Hrm. . .? Nee' hit mo' hard." 

His mitts literally aim to wrap around the bladed portion, in hopes that his superior strength would disable the curved woman from freely utilizing her sword again. In the event that he's capable, Maloth moves forward, sending a simple, yet powerful palm thrust to the center of Baylae's chest. The overwhelming momentum is not meant to break her defenses, or attack the bone.

Instead, it pushes, hopefully knocking the wind out of her body, and forcing the swordwoman's frame to be gliding through the skies before inevitably crashing down.* - Sun Oct 18 21:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Boom! Right in the kisser.

As she's sent skidding backwards, the sword is dislodged from her hands, and now was in possession of Maloth. Curiously, his eyes scan the weapon, unsure honestly what was to become of the swordswoman next. If her sword was the main form of combat, how could she even dream of winning now?

Nonchalantly, the Katana is tossed in a straight forward fashion.

The momentum carries forward, stabbing into a nearby tree, and suddenly becoming lodged within the interior. Slowly, the brute made his approach, seeing this as more of a game rather than an actual fight. "Is all fo' can do. . ? Nee' ge'  mo' smart. . . If wan' figh' o' hur' Maloth," the behemoth explains, again speaking in third person. The slow movements were intentional, to give the endowed kenjutsu user some time to breath and think.* - Sun Oct 18 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||He was a true Raikage-ass ninja. Standing stationary, the knee would go on without an issue. It rams against his abdomen. . . But at the end of the day, Maloth doesn't even flinch, nor shows any sign of feeling the blow.

Instead, the brute is day dreaming, looking up to the skies and wondering just where his sister could be-- Poor Lyala. . .  After the sequence, his attention diverts back towards the ground, and the brute shakes his head, clearly disapproving of the apparent battle methods. 

Shortly after, each muscle in Maloth's body again flares, contracting to increase durability. In a state of constant tension, adrenaline flowed, making his fast-twitch movements far more fluid. Thus, now the brute possessed an even higher capacity to endure damage, and could attack at much swifter pace as well. In response to this all, a hand rushes, aiming to attach an unrelenting grip along her shin.

Most people had no methods of inducing harm onto the brute, at least physically. But this? This was just pitiful. "Is think 'nough. No can hurt Maloth. . ."* - Sun Oct 18 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Gojiro(Hellgatez) says: Eh? - Sun Oct 18 21:29:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He frowned, unsure how to feel.

The victory was well deserved, but it felt empty. Keeping Baylae within his grasp, the brute's bulky right arm excercises it's strength, lifting the swords woman up and hanging her upside down.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Wasting little time, he's swift to draw his hammer. 

Maloth hadn't a clue nor thought of how powerful Shinjin was -- Yet the male's nature of as a 'chief'; suggested him to be fairly powerful. Thus, immediately, the barbarian falls into his own basic stance, modified to account for the manipulation of his demonic, Huevo-spawned hammer. Chakra funnels about his body, eventually communing in the brain, where willpower and such enforces the first restraint of his body to be torn into pieces.

WIth a quick first step, the giant is speeding ahead, hopefully closing the distance within a timely fashion.

Assuming no inteference, a mighty swing is delivered, all with the purpose of slamming the Devolving Hammer right into 'Zeus' shoulder. A bit much? Perhaps. But Maloth really felt that as a chief, Shinjin would be able to deal with him quite easily.* - Sun Oct 18 23:37:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had narrowly missed in his initial swing, his body staggering a bit as the momentum carried forward.

Thus leaves him more than susceptible for the next blow, which is a sudden uppercut to the chin. But strangely enough, as the attack goes through, save for a subtle jerk of the head, Maloth seems genuinely uneffected. Muscling through, the brute forces his chin back down, and wears a giant smile.

"Chief nee' stop play with Maloth!"

The behemoth roared, sending his hammer flying in a diagonal fashion again, this time with the intent on striking the chest. Clearly, the behemoth was under the belief that Shinjin was holding back -- this was the Hokage after all. Hit or miss, Maloth breaks off into yet another attack, his body breaking off into a spinning, and unleashing two swift kicks in sucession. Leaf Great Whirlwind!* - Sun Oct 18 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The sweeping kick had missed it's mark, as Shinjin dexterously leaps into the air, his body devolving into a whisk of yellow and white.

That was at least on attribute he held over Maloth -- sheer speed. Nevertheless, the Hokage is quickly coming back into view. But by then, it was far too late, with a thunderous, forearm whacking the side of the behemoth's face  -- right on the temple, an notorious weak spot.

For shame, however. . . The Kumogakure-borned behemoth was a simple freak of nature. There was nothing more to say on the matter. Even with the swiftness of the blow, and the sudden momentum, the hulking beast barely budges, it's as if he hadn't been struck at all. "Nee'. . . Stop play! Know mo' stron'!" Maloth roared, honestly feeling insulted that Shinjin was only fighting to this level.

As the childish shouts were released, he again swings, sending the hammer in a diagonal fashion. The brute clearly lacks skill with the weapon, however. And while it was swift, he wielded it as if the demonic item were a baseball bat, rather than a finely crafted war hammer.

Sweat lingered along his flesh, although it was easy to miss.* - Sun Oct 18 23:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) lightly breathed.

He was getting a bit tired, but still clearly had enough in the tank to keep the battle going on for prolonged periods.

Shinjin had served to impressed, yet the inability to really be given harm suggest to Maloth that the Hokage is -still- holding back on him. Body tensed, the brute again kicks off the ground, closing in on the distance between the two in no time, presuming Zeus hadn't sped off to a different location.

The hammer is lifted overheard amidst the hot-blooded sprint. He's staring ahead to the shinobi, like a bull to a matador. The second he's within arm's reach, Maloth slams down, hoping that the weight of gravity, and the momentum from his sprint could only add to the force, and whittle through Shinjin's defense. That was the best that could be hoped for -- considering the one dubbed as 'Zeus' showed an aptitude for taking damage himself.

"Ergh. . Is soon nee' use mo' power. . ." the warrior thought to himself in distressed. * - Mon Oct 19 00:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Boom!

The shaft of the hammer slams right into the Shinjin's shoulder, the positioning lessening the overall damage increase.

And in that next moment, lightning comes surging, running along Maloth's frame, and dealing additional damage. Shinjin had worked intelligently, attacking one of the brute's 'weaknesses'. . .That being his inability to take on ninjutsu strikes as well as physical.

Burns riddle along his frame, sending his body jolting -- But strangely, his face remained someone reserved. Make no mistake, Maloth grunted and shouted through it all, and as the lightning came to an end, smoke lingers from his body. And it's that moment. . the behemoth breaks off into the next state. Chakra speedily rushes through is system, converging at one spot. 

In time, the next restraint is broken, revitalizing his frame, and allowing the warrior to resist the pain his body was currently in. With a free hand, Maloth clutches at Shinjin's forearm. Meanwhile, he's leaning in to perform a headbutt.* - Mon Oct 19 00:15:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
'Infinity Punch -- Dempsey Roll.'

That's all he heard before Shinjin had began sending rapid punchesm, the first of which strikes against his chin.

Yet regardless, it does little to harm Maloth's thick hide. He was a man that was specifically bred to be a simple meatshield. Save for a slight flinch due to the momentum carrying his head forward, the brute isn't phased at all.

Considering the nature of the dempsey roll, a few hits manage to land before Maloth finally takes action. The hammer is swug side-ways, hopefully crashing against the abdominal area, which was a place where he had continously targeted throughout the battle -- in hopes of weakening Shinjin significantly enough.

Albeit. . . He was getting tired of using that hammer. Hit or miss, the weapon is dropped, prompting the beast to lunge forward, one hand aiming to wrap about Shinjin's arms, while the other went to latch onto the armpit area. * - Mon Oct 19 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Eh.. - Mon Oct 19 00:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Once more, waves of electricity run along his form, wearing out cells and leaving his body riddled in more burns.

While most people would have been turned off by the violence, each second his nervous system was set in a frenzy was seconds filled with pleasure or delight. He was a brute at it's finest, a warrior bred and made to fight and endure pain.

For a moment, his body is convulsing, loosening his grip for a small window -- But had Shinjin not been able to capitalize on such, the brute resumes with the grappling! This time in the form of a bear hug, to literally squeeze the life out of Shinjin. The act could be seen as either a brutish tactic, or a move of desperation. After all, for all of his physical gifts, Maloth failed in one aspect. . .

Condition. Overall physical energy.

His body required so much energy to function, he tended to find himself being exhausted too swiftly. Presuming the bear hug hadn't been evaded, the second it's in place, Maloth's body goes rotating, and doing a slight leap. Acrobatically, Shinjin body would be swinging while in the behemoth's grip, before he's slammed right onto the ground, with Maloth's weight on top.

-- A variation to the belly to belly suplex.* - Mon Oct 19 00:46:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||'That's enough!' Nigen had spoken true words.

It was enough. 

The battle was grueling, enough to wither down Maloth's own defenses, and leave him covered in burn wounds. Rapidly, due to the exploitation of his chakra gates, and specialized taijutsu techniquess, the beast had exhausted the bulk of his stamina.

As Shinjin laid there, Maloth rolls, laying on his back, his body covered in a light glazing of sweat.  Could this truly be seen as a victory for the behemoth? 

"Is. . . Is. . Win?"* - Mon Oct 19 00:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The hammer would slam at his back. . . But even that isn't enough to truly effect Maloth.

He's running out of gas, however, considering just how much energy the Hachimon Formation took out of him. Promptly, they're deactivated.

"Hng. . ! Is done. . for too tire," the fiend says nonchalantly, his body still riddled in light burns from the excessive lightning release.* - Mon Oct 19 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Like a Slaking, he rolls off, allowing his body to lay onto the floor.

A nod is given, as the battle was in Shinjins favor. "Is figh' good. . . Maloth nee' get stronger. . "Maloth notes, referencing his weakness when it came to ethereal-based attacks.

Weakly, he gives a thumbs up to Hana, as she had given him the perfect opponent to go again.* - Mon Oct 19 01:02:17 2015
