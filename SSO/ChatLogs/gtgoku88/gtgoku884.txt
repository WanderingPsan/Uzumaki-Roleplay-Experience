<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) yawns, looking down to his weakling relative. 

A hand goes to gently push Lyric on the chest. "Tell Maloth. How strong get?"* - Sun Sep 27 23:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: <*Nods*> - Sun Sep 27 23:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had made his approach back to the general area. The scent manly, yet musky scent that usually was worn by Maloth lingers into the area.

"Finally here. Maloth 'ble finish train move. Much easy. . ." This clearly references the Dynamic Entry technique.* - Mon Sep 28 03:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-umm..show me...a d-demonstration - Mon Sep 28 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: i-i mean...e-example - Mon Sep 28 03:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) took a step back. His body tenses, and once by the exit of the mansion, he turned to face Paine herself. Muscles tensing, the brute begins with a swift sprint ahead, his body leaping into the air shortly after. As the giant sailed on through, his body straightens, and a single leg is pushed out while the other is tucked inward. Clearly, there was no issues in terms of aerodynamics considering the great deal of technique or concentration added into the process. 

Had Paine moved, she'd be forced to deal with the Maloth's first original taijutsu ability, Dynamic Entry! "Hng! Kick for die!" That was his nickname for the skill* - Mon Sep 28 04:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The two strikes come to blows.

Despite the size advantage, Paine held an unworldly amount of strength for someone of her size or statue. The two opposing forces strike against one another, and eventually forces all momentum to be neutralized. Rather than fall onto the floor, MAloth lands on his feet, while backing up. "Tch. . . Much strong! -- Can sleep if need for sleep," he blurts out with some aggitation as Paine effortlessly shows him up.

With that, giant backs up, and falls back next to Lyric's side.

"Lyric. .. What type fighter you be?"

* - Mon Sep 28 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: I'm uhh... I don't know.. what type of fighter,  I am.. - Mon Sep 28 04:45:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Then what they teach...?! Fight Maloth. - Mon Sep 28 04:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Not in the mood for it. - Mon Sep 28 04:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) facepalms. It was clear now, why Lyric had been shipped off, rather than trained as a barbarian. Not only was physically ungifted, but the boy lacked drive.

"Hng. . .But need get stronger. . . If not fight, what do?"* - Mon Sep 28 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: I just need to train more before I fight you. - Mon Sep 28 04:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Nope.. - Mon Sep 28 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) seems annoyed. Why wouldn't Lyric just tell him what his battle style was? "Hng. Why not can tell o' show Maloth? Not take long," the dimwits complains, a vein practically popping out of his forehead as the aggitation built up.* - Mon Sep 28 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: But what do you want me to show you? - Mon Sep 28 05:17:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: What shall Maloth do? - Mon Sep 28 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs.

"Maloth not like do 'lot things. Like fight. . . like train. Like wrestle, like eat food. Hrm. . . Oh, like watch fight. . What Lyric do?" He questions in hopes of uncovering more information about his half-brother.* - Mon Sep 28 05:40:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) cringes.

He lacked the ability to read. The simple notion of reading gave the brute a headache. A hand would have arisen, rubbing the top of his cranium overheat.

"Not like read. . . What shop for?" * - Mon Sep 28 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Shop for clo-- Oh hello. - Mon Sep 28 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: <*Gives a nod, acknowledging Kenkai's presence*> - Mon Sep 28 05:53:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: My brother would want to spar you! - Mon Sep 28 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Oh. - Mon Sep 28 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Need batlte. . ? - Mon Sep 28 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kenkai(Gokuflash) says: Yeah. - Mon Sep 28 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Then we battle. - Mon Sep 28 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued in stride down the road.

It was true, Maloth was quite simply, genetically gifted. He was a a behemoth at it's finest. The brute would move along the land in an animated fashion, lugging about his weapon which laid gently on his shoulder. Although. . . the object was anything -but- gentle. It was a massive Hammer, one befit for a gent as large as your's truly. For those with senses? They'd be able to tell, there was something -terribly- wrong with that weapon. . . nevermind the eye-like portion of it.

It had dark undertones-- sadly, Maloth was too ignorant in order to detect it.

Like a wrestler, he continued to walk of, oblivious of any individuals that were also walking along the street, up until Velencia spoke.

"---! Huh. .. ? He-lo. . . What need?" his speaking pattern was much like a caveman. Slow. . . deliberate, and awkward with the pronunciations. The lad's eyes cast down, look on over to the dainty little lady.

* - Mon Sep 28 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) hated that.

Abruptly cutting off your statement was a pet peeve to the simpleminded brute. Brow fidgeting, Maloth exhales, hoping to alleviate some of the irritation that was currently boiling over. The hammer on his shoulder is shifted, and subsequently placed in a more comfortable location --- on a strap just on level with his waist.

'Course, despite Valencia being fitted with weapons, and a headband, the egotistical warrior assumes her to be an average citizen.

"What lookin' for. . .?" the giant says with a gruff, low grunt. His tone suggested a demand, rather than asking, despite the questioning fashion. 

* - Mon Sep 28 20:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Hmh? - Mon Sep 28 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stared on incredulously.

Even if it had been shown that size didn't matter, the arrogance that existed in the behemoth's mind automatically made him think one thing. 

There was no way in hell that Valencia would be a match.

For a moment, Maloth just breaks into an overwhelming chortle. His face momentarily looks into the heavens, and his laughs are loud and hard enough to force up unnatural air currents. The sound reverberated throughout the area, forcing nearby avians to leap up and flee from the vicinity. As slight tears built up, a glance is given back to the much smaller shinobi.

"If want fight. . . Guess 'ble do. Come. . . we figh'." He turns about face, prepared to lead the shinobi towards the proper location.* - Mon Sep 28 20:18:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Let's go. - Mon Sep 28 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) would have arrived at the local training grounds. In his arrogance, the Huevo Diablo-spawned weapon is tossed a few feet towards the north, plunging right into the ground.

"Here be fight. Let lady make move firs'. ." 

Cue falling into a basic stance.* - Mon Sep 28 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Very well. - Mon Sep 28 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
What a vicious technique attack!

Towards the neck, really?

While a giant, Maloth wasn't really just going to sit there and take the strike. Instead, his arms swipes, straying the take off course. Rather than the neck, Valencia would find that the Kunai strikes the trapezius --- Yet something odd occurs. Indeed, despite his organic flesh, it seemed to be rigid, thick even. To the point that even the Kunai wouldn't be able to pierce.

In the end, there's a small prick left along the flesh, sadly Maloth doesn't seem all too phased.

Possessively, his hands lunge forward, hoping to use his advantage in reach to grab the girl by the shoulders.* - Mon Sep 28 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's body was supreme. It -really- was on par with using actual elemental-based defenses.

Thus, the attack beforehand is effective, allowing him to easily latch onto  Valencia for a grapple. Using his above average strength, Maloth subsequently moves to lift the girl over his head, while still keeping an iron-cladded grip. A foot stomps, loosening up a patch of dirt, making it softer and more us-able for wrestling-based moves.

Assuming she hadn't been able to twist her way free? The behemoth subsequently goes to slam her down, his body too descended.

"MALOOOOTTHHH! BOOOOMMMMB!" On collision, debris would fall over the area, making it nearly impossible to get a clear view of what was occuring. The ground quake occasionally --  but thankfully, the floor had been conditioned. Itd hurt for sure, but wasn't going to be enough to land the woman in the hospital, of course.* - Mon Sep 28 20:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
It's over. 

He gets back up, and the dust settles. ". . Oh. . Hope not. .  Hit hard too muc. . ." the dimwit muttered, slightly distressed considering he had a knack of going overboard. 

"Is still can fight?" Maloth inquires, holding out a hand to grant the girl some assistance and arising back to her feet. His entire body seemed to lose all tension, making it apparent that he was asking just to gauge how healthy Valencia remained -- there was no intent on continuing with the battle.* - Mon Sep 28 21:02:30 2015

"She just say. . is 'right," he replies, finding the inquiry on Taiga's behalf to be unnecessary. 

"Give good fight. Not lot get up back from this."* - Mon Sep 28 21:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Pride is a fragile thing. - Mon Sep 28 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) gives a wave.

"Have good fight. Need fight Maloth 'gain later," the brute calls out towards Valencia. Soon after, he shifts his gaze on over to the two male before him, his eyes narrowed. 

"Come for fight. . ?"* - Mon Sep 28 21:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Taiga want's to spar. Thats why he came here. Go ahead and have at it, I'll just watch. - Mon Sep 28 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . .  Did you even listen to a single word I just said? - Mon Sep 28 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He agreed to the terms, considering that was pretty much all he could do.

"We fight now!" seconds after, the giant is charging ahead, each step enough to leave a deep footprint along the ground. It was clear that the brute was packing a lot of weight. 

Sadly, for all of the physical gift, it cannot be re-iterated enough that Maloth lacked formal training in terms of taijutsu. Once within range, a sluggish right-handed haymaker is delivered, intent on ramming right into Taiga's chest, the center. ". . Hng! We see how strong be. . ! Bet no e'en close for Maloth strong muscle!" the barbarian trash-talks admist the blow, it's clear he's putting quite a bit of effort, since. .  -- Unlike Valencia -- Taiga looks like he can take a decent hit.* - Mon Sep 28 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
It was a good idea, at least. His slow rate of speed, and even more raw taijutsu ability made it hard to actually land a hit. This was an attribute that was almost constantly exploited in battle -- yet it mattered little.

As Taiga avoided and sent a second hit, Maloth doesn't even bother to worry about evasion, he remained confident in his own ability to endure. The blow crashes right into his chin, yet his body doesn't even budge. Taking advantage of Taiga presumably being surprised by his durability, the behemoth's right hand lunges forward, hoping to grapple about the Harada's arm and hold him in place. "That all can do!? Need hit mucha hardah! Maloth not e'en feel!"

Shortly after, another haymaker was being dished forward, again targetting the chest in order to knock the wind out of Taiga's body. He's still trashing talk. "Punch like liddle girl!" blurted out the brute, in hopes to make the battle more engaging, and to give his opponent some drive.* - Mon Sep 28 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Being unable to truly harm Maloth wasn't anything to be ashamed of. He hailed from a family of 'vikings'. . . Which just another way of calling themselves savages. In this clan, strength was valued above all else. Thus, the weak were trreated as second class citizens while the strong ruled over the land, and procreated -- selective. Thus, the physical specimen known as Maloth came into being.

". . . !" He grunts as Taiga had managed to give him the slip after taking the blow, thus exploiting another weakness Maloth possessed. Speed. Angrily, the brute is charging ahead, seemingly making no mind of the handseals being woven through.

Before he knew it, a giant Fireball was being released from Taiga's maw. For a moment, the fiend's body pauses, as he debates leaping to the side, yet with the small amount of space, and his poor rate of speed -- moving was futile. As a result, his arms shoot up, intent on shielding the more valuable body parts; things such as his face,  and neck while still charging through. 

The attack comes and goes, exploding in one might of inferno. Yet as it cleared? Maloth was -still- charging through. His chest had been burned off, along with a good portion of his pants. Selective portion of the behemoth's skin had also been left charred or sing -- but it was as if he felt no pain at all. "Not! Good! 'nough!"* - Mon Sep 28 22:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued to charge, his fist cocked back in preparation to again send another blow crashing into Taiga's body. Yet, showing off some dexterity, the young kenjutsu-minded shinobi seems to effortlessly be able to slip right through Maloth's legs. Startled, the brute wrecklessly charges ahead -- unable to stop the momentum that had already been built up.

Crash!

The fondation of the gates themselves quake, and rattle. But not even that had been enough to really shake him off. Angrily, the male turns, eying Taiga in the same fashion a bull would a matador.* - Mon Sep 28 22:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The adrenaline in his body is dying down.

Taiga was fortunate for one thing -- that dude was damn fast. Too fast for Maloth to keep up with at least. "Hrm. . Guess is 'kay. . . Not can catch if want, 'nyway," the brute replies. The bull-like stare suddenly begins to recede and he exhales, letting the nerves in his body calm. * - Mon Sep 28 22:38:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Oh thank god. . . If he exists. - Mon Sep 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Ah, I'm going somewhere else now. .  And think about, what I could do better. - Mon Sep 28 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
The battle had been long and hard, but in the end, it went to the rightful victor. Instead of lingering in the victory, the brute moves towards the gate and descends into a sitting position. One leg crosses over the other, mimicking a stereotypical, indian stance. 

"Hrm. . ."

And now, Maloth simply had to resume with the previous training exercise. Today, his muscles had already been thoroughly worked out -- perhaps the brink of completely shutting down. They were forced to go towards the limit and beyond. . . yet that summit of power he desired just couldn't quite be achieved. And it was for one simple reason; he lacked the will or mental fortitude.

From this moment, the entire world around him faded into non-existent. His eyes or mind's eye eventually homed in, as if physically viewing his own chakra circulatory system. In this viewing, Maloth's mind traced along, eventually targetting the brain, where the first of many 'locks' had been located. "Hng. . . Need. . . lock powah. . . Know what 'fore able do. . not 'nough. .. " he whispered to himself, oblivious to whoever else was in the region.

In no time, chakra is being pulled and forced into one designated area. It aimed to overwhelm, and eventually shatter the first chakra restraint. However, the sequence goes further than just mindless pushing energy. No, this was a process based on will. You had to -want- it! And at this point, there was no one that wanted to push further ahead in his training more than Maloth. 

Chakra continued to swish around before. . 

Boom! At last, he had broken free. There was a wealth of strength being unleashed about his body. Soon after, his eyes shut open, and a simper is worn. 

"Think do it. . "* - Mon Sep 28 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued to focus in on his energy. The flow of chakra among his brain continous swirled around, completely and utterly shattering the first of the mental restrained. For most people, the feel would likely be awkward. Yet, Maloth's brain and his body had been conditioned to enduring excess stress. 

At once, he stands up, wearing a giant smile still upon his face. His body was still brimming with excessive energy. Even if there was no viel of chakra or other energies to signify the strength. Excited, he fidgets around, astounded by the wealth of power that had been suddenly granted to him. "This. . Is begin of power?" the brute muttered to himself. 

Certainly, there was a pep to his step. But only a fool would just go off of feeling alone. Nay, Maloth had to test the granted power first-hand. Starting off, a test of speed is given. As everyone would know, the rate of speed he moved at was a glaring weakness in the giant's arsenal. Anyone could come in, attack, then subsequently speed ahead before he could even react. And that? Honestly ticks him the fuck off.

Leg muscles tensed, Maloth kicks off the ground, allowing his body to propel forward. The fast-twitch fibers in his muscles seem to be energized beyond belief, subsequently allowing his over-sized frame to speed along the ground. By no means was this 'super human' speed. Hell, anyone with a pair of eyes would have been able to track the behemoth's movement. Yet. . . This was a clear improvement, as he effectively doubles the normal rate of velocity.

Sadly, the downside of the technique makes itself known. With each step, his body worked overtime, and thus expended too much energy. After the brief sprint, Maloth doubles over partially, sweat having been formed faster than normal. "Hah. . Just that 'nough make Maloth tire. . ?" complains the simpleton. He wasn't out of energy, of course, not even close.

It was just that the lack of physical stamina was finally biting him in the ass. Regardless, upon being satisfied with the speed boost, he turns ahead and eyes the fence. Just what was the extent of his power boost? That was going to be tested today.

After pushing off the ground,Maloth's body goesspeeding ahead, with his right arm cocked back. Upon being in range, the arm comes thrusting ahead, slamming against the metal fencing. The very fondation of the structure is shaken to the core, much like it did when Taiga had managed to fool the brute into running into it. However, as it rocked, the edges that had kept the fencing tethered to the ground and the poles are bent, showcasing a clear increase in strength.

Before long, the eastern portion of the area's fencing is completely torn asunder, and goes crashing into the grass itself. Destruction of public property at it's finest. With the blow, comes a steep decline in overall physical stamina. His breathing rate is increased, yet he's hardly gasping for airs, as his muscles still possessed more than enough fuel to continue working at the maximum efficiency. 

"Is strong. . But not strong 'nough. . Maloth see. . ." His eyes continued to trace, looking for a suitable object to strike in order to test his might. Eventually, the gaze finds the base of a boulder, it's exterior colored brown, and cracks left along the right side. It would be this object that honestly would be a proper bench mark for the increaed state of power. 

As Maloth would recall, these were the same objects he used in previous training exercises. Sadly, despite his massive size, the boulders never once gave in to his strength. Each strike tended to heed no real result, with only minor cracks being left as a reminder of the failure. Much like the attack on the fence, Maloth rushes ahead, arm cocked back. Once more, his hand slings ahead, striking the rocky terrain.

BOOM! It lands with an explosive effect. Rock immediately comes splintering off from the boulder, and the heavy construction is sent skidding back a few feet. There's a brief period of dust clouding the area, but as it settled, the visage is enough to plant another giant grin on Maloth's face. The boulder had been greatly damaged, with a fist-sized hole now being left along the exterior -- but there was still room for improvement. In time, Maloth would find himself completely shattering the object. . or so he hoped.

He doesn't have time to  sit in the victory. Immediately, his body falls over, exhausted. His stamina is reaching dangerously low levels, forcing Maloth to deactivate the first Hachimon state. Hot sweat covers his body, and by now, he's almost desperately gathering oxygen into his lungs.* - Tue Sep 29 00:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stayed put. He allows Paine to swiftly swing, slamming a knee into his rib cage. There was slight discomfort, but Maloth seemed to take the pain rather well. Clearly, he'd be more than capable of taking the woman's strikes on a repeated basis should she choose. "Hrm . . . Look like good move," he retorts, seemingly impressed with the showmanship.

Once done, Maloth takes a step back, further distancing the two. His body lows into a crouch, leaving him in perfect condition to mimick the taijutsu technique. Quickly, his body begins to spin, and a leg is thrutted out. Sadly, he lacks the flexibility that Paine is fortunate enough to sport. The motion is rigid, and trying to do the technique while on one leg forces him to topple over. 

Maloth's body lands onto the ground with a thud, forcing the sand to burst onto the area. Once it's cleared, you'll find his body still laying on the ground, his eyes suggesting embarressment. "Hng. . . Not do good job. Is mistake. . " he says in a meek tone -- a demeanor that was rare for someone of his ilk.* - Tue Sep 29 01:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. The jutsu, despite appearing simple in nature, was pretty damn difficult to perform. Especially if you consider the fact that Maloth had no actual formal training what-so-ever. "Hng. . Maloth just have try, he guess. . ." the tarzan-like behemoth muttered to himself.

Upon standing in the proper positioning, his muscles again tensed, preparing themselves for the action. His eyes shut briefly, as he is mentally preparing for the next process that will inevitably grant the brute yet another useful Taijutsu technique to afflict on his opponent. Once ready, his body begins with the rotation, and one leg is placed back into the forefront. As this occurs, his sense of balance is ompletely disrupted, prompting a descent back onto the ground.

As he lands, Maloth frowns, embarressed yet again by the lack of skill in terms of conventional taijutsu technique. To really excel in the art that Paine sought to teach, he'd need to complete re-invent his manner of combat. As a born and raise barbarian, Maloth's style of fighting was rigid and blunt. Yet with Paine. .  she demanded that the behemoth be as nimble and swift as a freaking ballerina. And clearly, that was something Maloth struggled with mightily.

Yet he would never, ever run from a damned challenge. Once more, upon getting into position, he whips his hop on towards the east, prompting a rigid, uneasy rotation. It's awkward, and his right leg -- which was the one chosen to be thrusted out -- wobbles uneasily about, making it clear that in actual combat, this was inefficient.  Likewise, the left leg shock, due to the poor balance still sported by the uncoordinated beast.

For the next hour, Paine would bare witness to Maloth's unbreakable will. He continued spinning while aiming to properly kick for the entire duration, even at times feeling sick. On the last occasion, a proper spinning kick is delivered,  prompting a light gust of wind to be spawned. As usual, he's worked out to work up quite a bit of a sweat and prances on over to the instructor, musky and all.

"Do good. .?"* - Tue Sep 29 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. His eyes observantly look over Paine as she explains the simply details. Overall, this jutsu wasn't going to be hard to uncover or unlocked -- it simply took patience. The hard part in itself was simply being able to do the kick properly -- thus this secondary portion wasn't going to be an issue in the least. As usual. Maloth backs up, getting into the proper stance needed to utilize his technique.

Slowly, he crouches, and begins to rotate his body in a partially circular fashion. His leg, at the same time, sticks out, while ther other is merely utilized to support his immense weight. By now, due to the continued fashion of training, there wasn't a single issue in using this stance -- although, it took conscious effort to actually enter. Along with this, it'd certainly take a greater deal of work to exit seamless -- making the usage unpractical for combat scenarios.

Nevertheless, his leg moved without a hitch, and aimed to strike Paine along the ankles to trip her up. Yes, the student was aiming to pull a fast one on the master -- even if she could likely avoided the blow with ease. There's a mischevious grin on the cave-man's face, as he anticipates embarrassing and knocking her onto the floor. Would it have even worked? "Take this!" * - Tue Sep 29 03:48:41 2015

Filler.* - Tue Sep 29 04:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) bursts out into laughter upon seeing Paine's clumsy act. For someone as skilled and swift as she was -- the girl tended to flop and trip often. 

As the dust settled, Maloth moved on in, extending a hand forward to assist in her getting back up. "Need be careful more. . .! Hahaha!" would she accept? Assuming she does, herculean strength is applied to lift her up.* - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hahah. Think need practice move. - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: What do now? - Tue Sep 29 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Looked ahead, as it seemed his tutelage had yet been adjourned. Quickly, Maloth re-enters his battle stance, while observing Paine's expert application of the taijutsu skill. Overall, by the last step was simple -- and wouldn't requiring much effort, if any. By leaping into the air, the basic taijutsu manuever would almost certainly be completed.

Before long, Maloth's body breaks into a rotation. He's standing on one leg, while the other is taken out. All of this occurs as he's standing on the ball of hsi feet, much like how the Taijutsu extraordinaire also demonstrated. It sweeps underneath, likely being able to knock Paine over -- had she been in range. Soon, during the spinning, the giant, hulking beast leaps into the air,  while continuing with the motion. The brute overcomes all odds.

His spinning is fluid, losing all the rigidness of the previous exercise. Before long, he lands right on his feet, wearing a smile. "Do good?" Hopefully he had done well, it seemed the simpleminded warrior eagerly awaited approval. Despite Paine's small and umimpressive stature, he held great respect for her ability. And this was huge, considering his culture greatly valued a person's appearance. Men were to be muscular and buff. While  woomen either required an Amazon build, or to be endowed, the less they were of either, the less valued they were by society. Hence Maloth's admiration being remarkable.* - Tue Sep 29 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

Overjoyed, he does something rare. 

Quickly leaning in, Maloth seeks to give Paine a tight hug, likely squeezing some life out of her. If she's in his grip, the brute continues to shake her around, but eventually allows her to descend.

"He thank. Maloth get mucha strong now. E'en learn how make body go faster."* - Tue Sep 29 06:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) tilted his head in mild confusion.

"Mean want train? Maloth need practice move get taught," he says, referencing PAine's recent tutelage. He had to master that whirlwind technique, after all.* - Tue Sep 29 06:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 29 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) rushes on over to the local training grounds. He comes to a stop once at the center of the sandy region, his eyes dead set on Valencia. The last battle the two had engaged in is freshly within Maloth's mind, thus he knows now to hold back a tad bit more, less he run the risk of defeating her in two moves again.  

"Let make firs' move. What type train want do. . . Spah 'gain?"* - Tue Sep 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had settled into the training area, his feet fidgeting along the grass. The weight that came with Maloth's sturdy body forces deep depressions to be tattoed along the ground. It marred the training area with general clues that the 'Behemoth' --- as some tended to call him -- had once ran wild in the area. Hell, towards the right, the fencing itself had been dislodged due to Maloth's previously training exploits, ones involving the developing and mastery of his first chakra gates. Wasting no time, he takes off the vest, throwing it towards the right, thus giving his body free mobility, at least in terms of upper body strength.

The brute still wore scars and burns from before, yet they seemed to matter little. 

". . Gues' want spah 'gain! Haha, Maloth try not hurt so much. . . Not like time last," taunted the beast-- although it's in a playful tone. He had greatly enjoyed their last 'bout, no matter how brief it had been. And the small crater formed from the previous engagement still lingered just south.

"Is ready? 'Cause Maloth come for smash!" the fiend roars, racing ahead at a moderate space, speed not being his strong point as per usual. The ground again shook, and there's a light sprinkling of dirt coming about with each step as he builds momentum to bum rush the dainty, and athletically built little kunoichi.

 "...!" Yet he stops short in his tracks as the girl seems to bite herself on the thumb, while subsequently pressing a hand against the ground. It honestly strikes a moment of fear into Maloth's heart. No, this wasn't a show of cowardice, but uncertainty. The jutsu performed was foreign, and thus prompted insecurity. Plumes of smoke come speeding out afterwards. . . and for now, the hulking animal can just look ahead.

But as it clears. . .as the dust settles.

There's only a fuckin' Ant Eater. "HAHAHAH! THINK BE BAD THING! LIKE DRAGON! NOT KNOW WANT GIVE MALOTH FOOD!" He roars, clearing seeing the Anteater as no real threat. For a moment, the simpleton believes Valencia to simply be buttering him up. After all, why else would she be sating his desire to fit, along with summoning livestock?

Regardless, the giant continues racing ahead shortly after, and is but a few feet away from Valencia in a second or two.* - Tue Sep 29 06:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued with his sprinting forward with a giant grin. This was going to be all too good --- Had Valencia not known any better? She could have bought a few extra supplies, like explosive tags or something. 

Nevertheless, considering the girl didn't move an inch, she's within range of Maloth -- and thus subjected to being at the brute's mercy interms of close-ranged attacking. Trying something new, the second he has an opportunity, his body ducks into a half-crouch, with his leg muscles being tensed. Using this state of tension, the right leg springs forward, forcing the left to serve as an ancor. 

Before long, a high kick is delivered, aiming to rock Valencia right in the ribs and send her body skidding about the pavement. Had she evaded? Then Maloth continued in stride, now knocking right at her ankles to trip her up. This was just how Paine had taught him. 

'Course, the movements isn't as fluid as could be, considering the barbarian had -just- learened the taijutsu manuever. Would Miss White be able to cope with the hand to hand technique? "HNG! FIRST BEAT VALENCIA! THEN TAKE MONSTER FOR FOOD!"* - Tue Sep 29 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Boom! Boom!

Each hit lands with succession, sadly as the final hit went through to trip her up, a plume of smoke had spawned. "H-Huh?" Maloth gasped, as a giant turtle seemed to have been teleported out of thin air. It casted a shadow over his person and was falling hard -- yet it mattered little to the inhumanly, physically and genetically gifted monstrosity that was -MALOTH-. Instead, as the Anteater had moved to fall on his head, it was in for a surprise.

Rather than toppling over him, the intelligent animal finds itself landing cleanly on the caveman's shoulder. Both of his arms are swift to wrap around the opposite ends of Mr. Puffin, aiming to constrict and limit mobility. "GUES' WANT BE FOOD 'FORE FIGHT END!" The brute roared, his loudness prompting a gust to build up infront of him. 

--Then. . . 

Kink! Clink!

The Kunai attacked his achilles heel, all with futility mind you. Even the areas you may have deemed 'fragile' possessed an unnatural amount of durability. There would be a few knicks, yet the usage all pales in comparison to how rigid and tough the cells in Maloth's body proved to be. "Huh. . ?" Quickly, he turns, while using the grip on Puffin to hoist him up, and slam him down --- perhaps even on Valencia.

Had that missed? The Anteater is forced to be bodyslammed onto the pavement, perhaps serving to fracture his bone structure.* - Tue Sep 29 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wore a face suggesting confusion at first. The summoning was there, then it wasn't -- much to Maloth's chargin. His stomach was simultaneously growling, thus explaining his appetite and desire to have the Anteater for food. 

That expression only wears off once Valencia speaks. 

Instead, it's soon replaced with a frown. "But. . Why?" He complains, just now having his adrenaline flowing due to the excitement from the 'bout. 

"Is do good. .  Jus' cause not able hurt Maloth, not neat quit." Of course, she -had- hurt him a tad. It was simply that his durability,. and penchant for pain made it difficult to bring him down.* - Tue Sep 29 07:11:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) yawns. It had been an entire day, and thus now they had a mission to complete. He nonchalantly approaches Lyric, grabbing the tiny specimen and tossing Lyric over onto his shoulder.* - Wed Sep 30 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Wha-- Not again...  - Wed Sep 30 20:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
At last, it was time to do the simple-leveled, D-ranked mission. Considering his inability to read, Maloth is forced to have Lyric give out the instructions. Upon getting proper information, the shinobi' heads down the road, following the intricate paths that subsequently lead him to the local diner. It's there that they're client awaits. Two tourists, a blue-haired businessman -- seemingly middle age, along with a barely-out-of-her teens brunette. Clearly, the two were in a relationship for very specific reasons.

They had sought to start the tour at the diner for whatever reason.

With Lyric in tow, Maloth stops on the scene, giving a nod of the head to acknowledge both of his temporary employers. "'Lo. Name Maloth. . . What need for us do 'gain? Beat things o' somethin'?" the savage stated in a blunt fashion. He wasn't a damn tour guide, after all. . . Just a simple, to-the-point, brawler.* - Wed Sep 30 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says nothing as Lyric managed to wiggle his way down.

An eye cants downward as the small-ish fist collides against his chest. With a shrug, Maloth moves to speak at last. "Not know. . . Is think Lyric tell all 'deas. . " the dimwit notes. Seriously, did he really expect Maloth to be the brains of the operations?

Meanwhile, the clients are growing a tadbit restless as they whisper towards one another. Eventually, the middle-aged gent speaks up, his voice making it clear that he was an obviously an impatient, pompous individual. ". . I don't believe I paid this amount of money to deal with ineptness. We don't have all day, you guys know," he says, turning attention towards lyric -- the one seemingly incharged of this entire operation.

At that point, the brute looked between lyric and the clients, wondering what they'd do to continue with the mission, hopefully getting paid.* - Wed Sep 30 21:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Maloth had indeed been following Lyric around. After all, it was his mission too, no? Eventually, he moves  ahead, raising a brow as Lyric had requested him to take over the mission's end.

"Hrm. . . Maloth try. . "

'Course, a hand gestures for the duo to follow him. Upon turning, the behemoth is backtracking back to the mansion, while explaining all of the different areas or sites that the village possessed. "This be house. . .Mmm. People stay live there, yes. . ." he replies in a simply fashion. The statement is repeated, over and over -- since they were going around a housing district. The repetition, sadly enough, manages to invoke irritation.

"Okay! Okay! We get it, these are houses!" the two clients roar out, seemingly displeased with Maloth's method of being a tour guide. The brute, as you would expect, takes exception to the rowdiness. A vein visibly is viewed growing under his skin, and his fist are clenched. "Jus' . .. Tell. . .What see. . " each word is delivered slowly, making it clear that the behemoth was at edge.* - Wed Sep 30 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts as Lyric took control over the situation.

She grabs at the vest, 'pulling' him over, which was essentially just Maloth following along. Ofcourse, the smack on the arm doesn't really annoy nor phase the brute. "Not know. Need get money guess? Is finish for job thing," he says simply. After all, they went through all of this trouble, why not receive payment?* - Thu Oct  1 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Okay, then let's go back to get the money. - Thu Oct  1 00:17:55 2015

He turns, grabbing Lyric around the waist, and lifting the boy up again. "We go now. -- Oh. . ." Briefly, he turns towards the most likely day dreaming Paine.

"We fight 'gain later. Think close for beat," he replies casually. Soon after, the giant heads on off.* - Thu Oct  1 00:27:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Well, we need to cut some wood. - Thu Oct  1 01:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) follows Lyric into the forest.

"Have tool?"* - Thu Oct  1 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: I thought.. - Thu Oct  1 01:31:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: You know. - Thu Oct  1 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: Hands. - Thu Oct  1 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs.

He could break trees apart with ease, for sure. But they would certainly not be in block sizes, nor anything that was in usable fashions. "Ooh. Can. . . Show true Maloth strenk. . " He says casually, blending in two words on reflex. Without another word, the brute's eyes fall shut, allowing vchakra to surge around his brain -- internally. It continues to build up, targetting a specific area, before at least one of the chakra nodes combusts. . . This allows the chakra system to grow much more free.

But more importantly? This completely removed the shackles his body naturally placed to keep his stamina from being exhausted, along with keeping his body from expiring too swift. With the sudden release of power, Maloth's strength skyrockets. With the added strength, he punches away, breaking the woode apart into smitherines. Splinters fly around, but conveniently avoid striking any of the people.

The sequence would continue agian and again, as Maloth literally just goes hulk mode. On occasions, with the smaller trees, he's enabled to literally pull the vegetation up from the root, allowing it to limply fall onto the ground.

"Is good?"* - Thu Oct  1 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Before long, the first of his gates recede. He's visibly a bit winded, due to the exertion of strength that first gate demanded. Once done, he hunches briefly -- before seeing Lyric take it upon himself to carry the wood. 

Swiftly, Maloth makes his move, dragging along moderately-sized trees, and moving towards the exit. They had worked hard enough - -  not it was time to collect. "Is need do?" the brute inquired, finding the entire mission trivial -- even by D-ranked standards. Nevertheless, he was happy to help, that was for sure. * - Thu Oct  1 02:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Not get money? - Thu Oct  1 03:18:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turns his head.

"Yes. Is like money."* - Thu Oct  1 03:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
':O'
"Wow! Why give money?" the brute says, while standing at the bundle. It's quickly pocketed so that he could eventually transport it to his secret stash.* - Thu Oct  1 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Dunno. - Thu Oct  1 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Is weird,. .  - Thu Oct  1 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: <*Blinks*> - Thu Oct  1 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) glances towards Lyric.

"Is think sleepin' . . We go?"* - Thu Oct  1 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turns to go train.* - Thu Oct  1 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued with his training. Prior to Paine's arrival, Maloth was hard at work, working on the physical aspect of his body's training -- rather than technical. Meaning, he was simply working to get his muscles acclimated with the first state of the gate formation, while also aiming to push into the second. "Must. . . Work. . . Harder. . "

By now, Maloth had been stuck in a push-up position, his body covered in the usual layer of sweat. It was as if he had jumped into a swimming pool -- but the water clug much harder than usual. There was a thick, unsettling stench that roamed over the area, before alas. ..  he turns to face Paine. "Huh? Oh. . .Finally come? Yes. Want train an' fight. . ." the brute said tiredly. The chakra flowing in his system comes to an abrupt rest, leaving his body covered in sores due to being overworked.* - Thu Oct  1 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. Being tired wasn't something that he'd ever allow to hold him back. As one that intended to excel in the art of Hachimon, Maloth had to get used to battling with his body in less than desired conditions. Moreso. . . He had to be ready to deal with dangerously low levels of stamina. After all, the usage of any Eight Gates came at a price of exhausting your body -- as well as damaging your muscle cells. 

"NO!" Maloth protested. His breathing was rapid, and haggard, showcasing extreme exhaustion. Still covered in sweat, the beast leaps onto his feet, and makes a swift approach on over to the meditating Paine. "Need learn new thing. Be practice hard fo' kick. Think is good for use in battle. . . Plus want learn how do 'nother kick o' punch," the simpleton spoke excitedly. His training -- prior to meeting Paine -- had been slow, borderline nonexistant. 

Now with Dissida watching over him? Maloth was gaining strength an impeccable rate. With eager eyes, he looks forward, while falling into his battle stance -- the Iron Fist. A stance he truthfully intended to teach Paine one day, but only once it had reached a respectable enough point to actually be taught. "We go. . .?"* - Thu Oct  1 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) whispers: [ I will end your life. ] - Thu Oct  1 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
As the two walked in, they would find Maloth hard at work.There were damanged rocks -- boulders even -- spreaded all around. Each hole or depression within the rocky boulders tend to be roughly equal to the size of the behemoth's fists. They seemed to have been forced to endure quite a beating.

Of course, by now, he was slugging at the rocks, but once more resuming his push-ups. Each motion is done with the first of the gates activated. Thus, it prepares his body for the strain of using them in prolonged combat, a strain that was physical --- in the form of cellular damage, as well as taxing on his overall energy reservoirs. "Hng. 'Lo," the dimwit said towards the two arriving party. His eyes cant over to Lyric. "See wake up, fine'ly. Get money?"* - Thu Oct  1 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: I have been awake. - Thu Oct  1 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: And nope. - Thu Oct  1 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyric(BoyVaporeon) says: No money. - Thu Oct  1 06:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) frowned. He never once leaves the push-up positions, though. Slow and steady, his body descended, elbow arching to -really- get those muscles to break down. The motion continued, up until Maloth's chest was a centimeter from colliding with the sandy floor. He stays there, forcing every cell to work over time to continue or keep this positioning consistent, and honestly, it's a struggle. The brute had been working on this same motion time and time again, and with the first gate already activated, it drained a higher amount of physical energy than usual.

After a few seconds, his arms were wobbling, forcing his body to briefly brush against the sand. Rocky particles clung to his flesh, before Maloth opts to push upward. "Hng. . .! See. . . Gues' chief be sleep for time long. . " He says inbetween grunts before finally re-establishing the starting position. His eyes gaze back onto Lyric. "Need help for train? Ne'er see train. . . Still prob. . . stay weak like when tribe send 'way." The tone, despite being archaic in nature, was reminiscient of a scolding.

Briefly, Marissa's presence is acknowledge. "What need?" he says, presuming the fan-wielding kunoichi had arrived due to her requiring one of their presence. Be it for official terms, or just socializing.* - Thu Oct  1 06:11:12 2015
