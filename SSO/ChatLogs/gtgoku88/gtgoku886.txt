This was pretty rare for maloth, as the bulk of the brute's training remained on the development of his physical body. Instead, however, the warrior sought to reach the next level in his Hachimon state -- level two. Thus, meditation was needed to not only allow his body to be pushed further beyond the normal limits, but to subsequently learn how to impose his will and break the next shackle. Then Lyala came about.

Despite being meditating, there was still some sweat being worked up. One eye shoots open. "Hrm? 'Lo," the brute greets, though still remaining in that formation.* - Sun Oct  4 06:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Maloth, on the otherhand, actually had a legitimate stance. Although, he seldomly used it due to poor bodily conditioning. Following into a basic battle formation, his fists rise, and knees crouch. Both eyes fall onto his opponent, Kida -- a male who he remained vaguely familiar with. Assuming they had met in the past? Kida likely would note some actual changes. His body? Had grown more bulky and rigid due to his ludicrous training regime. One predicated on consuming countless calories a day to build up fat.

In addition to this, his body was more muscular as well. Without a second thought, the brute takes a step forward, releasing a slow, yet powerful swing to his opponent's maw. It aims to be a real hitter, sending waves of momentum along the Rokujou's jaw. "See if more stron' than Maloth!" the beast roars, still very much confident in his genetics -- which was really the only reason he was this powerful.* - Mon Oct  5 00:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was far too slow. His initial punch missed its mark, casually hitting nothing but air. Being the much faster opponent, it seemed Kida was more than able of speeding around, and taking advantage of Maloth's wild swing. A swift kick comes inward right after, having enough potency and velocity to be a blur to the naked eye. In no time, that appendage slams harshly against the brute's ribs -- and certainly, for most cases this would be bone shattering. Yet. . . 

Maloth wasn't a normal individual. His genetics had been purposely selected by his ancestors, making his bones thicker than normal, and his hide rigid. Instead of being sent wobbling, the brute stays put, not even moving a single inch. Taking advantage of the ineffective blow, the taijutsu specialist's club of a hand moves around Kido's ankles, hoping to establish a grip that would limit mobility. 

Success or not, Maloth's body is lunging forward, right hand balled into a fist. A massively powerful haymaker is dished forward, intent on knocking the wind out of the fellow hand-to-hand combatant's body. Kida would find that Maloth's size wasn't just for show. He was every bit as powerful as you'd expect considering he was nothing but a wall of talking muscle. "Is nee' hit harder! Not strong 'nough fo' punch Maloth an' may hurt!" taunted the dimwit, arrogance was evident.* - Mon Oct  5 01:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||His giant hands still remained firmly around Kida's ankles. The first blow landed with great effectively, no doubt rocking the shinobi's bones to the core. As the boy inevitably recoils, Maloth makes his next move. His right hand pulls Kida forward, swinging the opponent's body closer to his own gargantuan frame. "Hah. . . Is thought be tough. . . Is good fo' taijutsu. . But no strong 'nough! Nee' try harder!" the hulking fiend again re-iterates, impressed with Kida's overal l skill -- as it reminded him of Paine, but irked at the lack of physical conditioning. That was half of being a taijutsu specialist after all.

Upon being in reach, the brute's arms latch ahead, getting Kida within a bear bug. No doubt, Maloth was literally seeking to choke the air out the physically inferior warrior's body. It was unfortunate, for all of Kida's skill, none of that meant anything due to the simple, overwhelming physique that Maloth sported. Assuming success, the bear hug continued on for several seconds, before the wrestler-like behemoth made his next move.

Leaping into the air, he contorts his body, before positioning Kida downward. If all went according to plan, the boy was gonig to be grand slammed right into the flooring. His body would have to be pretty sturdy to endure the overwhelming force generated by the flashy wrestling manuever.

On impact, the ground shakes, and the floor forms depression due to the magnitude of the force. Dust picks up, clouding the area, building up anticipation for those looking on -- had the boy managed to survive the perhaps. . . overzealous technique? Had he even managed to escape before being slammed back-first into the dirty terrain of Kumogakure? * - Mon Oct  5 02:42:59 2015

'Course, while it did hurt, the attack doesn't loosen his grip, and rather just further infuriates the beast. Absorbing the contact, the giant would have continued leaping into the air, only to come crashing down with fierceness. As the dust cleared? Kida would be left in the center of a crater, his body likely resonating with sours.

Nevertheless, as that attack goes through, Maloth leaps up, taking several steps back subsequently after. His fists remained risen, waiting to see just how well the boy would react to the previous crushing blow. "Still 'ble for figh'. . .?" the hulk-like creature questions, unsure if he had dealt too much damage.* - Mon Oct  5 03:10:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was apparently in this game of pushing up a boulder. It wasn't something he was particularly adversed too, considering his nature as an actual freak of nature. Before long, Maloth approaches a boulder roughly about half his size. Upon getting into a crouching, his hands shoot forward, pressing his hands forward. 

Once a grip is establish, every muscle is put into play. His biceps, triceps, and even the muscle that existed in his legs as they pushed from the ground. In a steady fashion., the condensed boulder eventually gains some momentum. Due to the rigid, yet circular shape, it manages to roll over, and slowly makes way up the hell. "Hng. . ! Hng!" bull-like grunts are heard due to the strain such a tedious task placed on his body. Adrenaline was flowing as per usual, and the burn could really be felt, since the task regularly destroyed his cells -- on a microscopic fashion, micro fractures even.

Nevertheless, this was all being put towards one goal in mind. The goal to achieve a higher realm of power. Just from this, the beast's muscle cells were being conditioned, and gaining immense endurance -- something that would be needed if he was to truly specialize in the hachimon formation. This was pretty much like training wheels, preparing him for the added strain of progressing down the path of that dastardly kinjutsu.

On occasion, the chakra around his brain flickered, begging to break out into the first level, to exercise or obtained familiarity. Maloth didn't regularly abuse that state of power after all. With the continued rolling, he's moving ahead, with no end in sight as a result of the enthusiasm.* - Mon Oct  5 09:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||His muscles bulged through this all, each cell being strickened and in a condition primed to perform work. Moving ahead with a full head of steam, it's Maloth's adrenaline that carries him forward. With a rumble, the giant boulder -- roughly four feet in diameter, and comprised of especially thick and condensed sediments --  moved along the hill. On occasions, the friction forces portions of the rocky construction to chip off. Pebbles roll along the ground, yet none of this ever seems to deter the behemoth.

Indeed, at times, the brute grew a bit too overzealous. The entire sequence reminded him of the brutish training sessions that were held back in his old tribes. At least when they were in abundance, roaming the wilds and doing as they pleased. In fact, in comparison to the elite training he's observed in his youth, this was child's play -- even if Maloth was admittedly struggling with just this.

Due to the excitement, the male pushes ahead, the chakra in his brain carrying bits of his will. It's this will that breaks the first of the restraints and pushes each muscle cell into overtime. With ease, the boulder is rolled ahead, resisting every bit of opposition granted byn ature -- in the form of gravity, and of course allowing the hulking figure to advance further. His leg muscles remained tensed, as it had to support the rest of his body weight, in addition to the opposing forces that came down on him during the trek.

Breathing a bit hard, some fatigue is evident, but not even exhaustion would ever stop him from reaching the top of the hill. A brief glance is given downward, examining his two opponents, who seemed to be having some issues. With a sly grin, the brute pressed forward, hoping that the adrenaline rush never failed. The competition would be his.* - Mon Oct  5 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued in stride. Considering the flow of chakra, and his heightened state of strength, moving the boulder along the path was seemingly trivial -- at least from the outside. Indeed, at a steady pace, his hands remained lodged onto the rocky substance, and thus it pushes, still using even the leg muscles to aid in the process. Creak. . . Creak. . . The boulder rumbled, grumpy at the fact that the behemoth made a mockery of its might. 

It was essentially being pushed around like a baby in a stroller. In no time, he was nearing the end point, his muscles still tensed and burning with adrenaline. The cells cried out in agony, begging for a moment break as they continued to be crushed by the opposing forces. Yet? Maloth continued on. This was more than just a competition for him.

As usual, his view cants back downward, looking to his opponents who were still at the starting line. Victory was far from assured, but at least it was amusing to see just how superior he was in this training exercise. Hopefully Maloth's poor level of stamina didn't come back to haunt him, since losing at this point would be utterly irritating. * - Mon Oct  5 09:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) remained undettered. The grunts were ever-present, persistant as he continued to venture on the steep incline hill. Dirt crumbled upon his feet, as each step holds a sense of purpose, forcing the weight to dig thoroughly into the ground below. These steps leave profound foot prints, ensuring that there was evidence of the brute's previous path was recorded within history. 

By now, fatigue was running evident. The usage of the first gate leaves his body far more tired than it's usually is. Build up of sweat is apparent along each centimeter of flesh. ANd of course, due to the current state of his circulatory system, his muscle cells remained under further stress. By now, it was like someone had thrown a furnance inside his body -- this was a perfect analogy for how hot his insides were.

Nevertheless, Maloth doesn't slow down one bit. He continues to move ahead, his rate of breathing akin to a thirsty dog. Tongue out, he panted again and again, hoping that the gathered oxygen would be enough to replenished the lost nutrition in his muscles. Before long. . . the beast is but a step away from achieving the end of the goal. Things would be irritating had his body eventually began to give out.* - Mon Oct  5 09:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And finally, he hits a bump on the road-- literallly. The hill wasn't exactly the smoothest construction on earth. Due to the bump, Maloth trips up, prompting his balance to be ruined. The mislap is enough to force the weight and gravity to momentarily gain the upperhand. Despite his attempts, the giant is slidding down, leaving a path along the hill as a direct result. 

Foot print aside, after skidding a meter or two, all movements comes to a hault. His arms are wobbling, still exhausted and struggling to support the boulder's weight. Breathing is sporadic, yet he refuses to stop, not until the top had been breached. Only then could the rigorous training session come to an end.* - Mon Oct  5 09:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The lost of momentum keeps going on. He can't stave back his amusing mistake. Before you know it, coupling the trippage with his exhausted muscles, Maloth is well on his way downward. To think, this man had nearly completed the obstacle course in a single motion a few moment's prior. More sweat builds up, along with a stench, but even then, he refuses to give in. Each time his body traveled on a downward path, the grunts grow more profound and a bit louder than normal. 

Nature would not be the victor today, as Maloth was a man. And everyone knew, men ruled over nature. Pushing ahead, the brute employs every ounce of strength -- from the biceps, shoulders, hips, and of course his legs to stave off the gravity's opposition. Nevertheless, it seemed that he was on a continously path downward. Teeth clenched, muscles still erect, the brute grunts harder than a yoshi -- but to no avail.

By this point, the chakra in his head again begins to circulate, once more being dictated solely by his will or mind's consciousness. It targets the next needle-sized chakra node, and pries away, hoping to break open that restraint as well to revitalize the body. Sadly, all this does is give a mild headache, rather than granting more energy, and pushing his strength even higher.* - Mon Oct  5 10:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Like a weak fire, the chakra along the second gate flickered. For a moment, it manages to open up the gateway -- but ONLY for a moment. And that's all he needed. His body, suddenly energized, manages to ignore the stress that had previously built up. With that aside, the brute pushes ahead, his muscles now feeling relieved and fresh. 

Indeed, they take the same positioning as before. Legs tensed, Maloth again resumes his upward path. Like a Sumo-Wrestler, his arms pushed ahead, forcing the giant boulder to once more resume it's upward path. Each rotation flattens the ground out straight, hopefully disabling any chance of him being tripped up. Mean mugging the skies, the simpleton was in a hurry. Even if this was just good training, there was no way he wanted to lose to Amon, who was perhaps inferior to him in terms of sheer power.* - Mon Oct  5 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Waayyy up, I feel blessed. Straight up. 

That's right, the revitalization from before gives him a boost of adrenaline. Even as the soreness was still somewhat lingering in his muscular structure, Maloth's mind nulled those sensations out. Instead, they push like a man possessed, and function almost as if the brute hadn't been worknig out at all up until this point. Needless to say, the boulder is being pushed quite speedily, and catching ground once more. In no time at all, the end was nearing, and his anticipation was arising.

Sure, failure here would just mean his muscles would have the fortune of developing further as a direct result of the repeated act. However, on the flipside, accomplishing the task would place his soul at ease,and actually motivate him to train harder in the following days. Well, once he went to investigate Konohagakure to locate his master, Paine. NEvertheless, those thoughts aside, he's literally a single step away from achieving the goal. Was it finally over?* - Mon Oct  5 10:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And at last, it's over. He pushes on, his body never once slowing down a bit. With the momentum blaring, he moves ahead at last, rushing right over the hill! "Is done! Mos' bes' in worl'!" the brute roars. The push is a bit overzealous, forcing the boulder to run over the opposite end, and crash into the ground -- just barely missing citizens that passed on by without a clue of what was occuring. 

Like tarzan, he looked to the skies, beating his chest and unleashing a battle cry. After minutes of cheering, the brute settles down, and looks downward onto Amon, who still was trying to catch up. The sweat began to dry up, considering his body was on cool down mode, and the first gate immediately shuts on off.* - Mon Oct  5 10:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. The high from having earned the victory begins to fade. "Is good. . Ye' . . . Not strong 'nough, though. . . Need learn hit mo' hard, an fas'," the fiend retorts. He was egotistical at times, but also a perfectionist. Even with all of his genetic gifts, the brute still lacked in one clear area -- technique and speed.  His hand rose, sending medium punch to Amon's shoulder. The damage was further held back, considering that his muscles felt more or less dead. 

He grunts, due to the pain that came with moving his biceps, and lets the appendage fall limp. "Is strong too. . . Jus' need try more hard, li' Maloth." His tone, while deep, demanding and gruff -- held an odd calmness to it. This was his casual voice, one he gained due to Amon's clear praise.* - Mon Oct  5 10:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. A glance is given towards the friendly gesture -- but there's no smile, as it ran the risk of ruining his image. Hulking beasts didn't smile often!

He was particularly tired, but acknowledges that this entire thing was exhaustion. "Is sense make. . ." the brute notes. He descends backwards, allowing his massive frame to rest along the hill. * - Mon Oct  5 11:04:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. Clearly, the brute drank his milk, and ate his vitamins. It also helped that his body cells were conditioned specifically be a giant meatshield. Before long, as the headbutt settled, Hideki would find that Maloth's frame was rigid-- his skin akin to stone at times. Instead of harming him, the poor soul would find the bulk of hte force bouncing back, likely making his own head hurt. . "Not ge' . . .Why do this?" the brute questions.* - Tue Oct  6 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He moves towards the mountain and gets into a crouch. "Is all do . ."* - Tue Oct  6 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: I see... - Tue Oct  6 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Maloth, headbutt Hideki.  - Tue Oct  6 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yeah, he's a taijutsu specialist. - Tue Oct  6 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: You should fight him, Hideki. - Tue Oct  6 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideki(Assassin241) says: ----- - Tue Oct  6 01:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh. - Tue Oct  6 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) remained with his legs folded over one another. His eyes had shut prior to the Uchiha's arrival, and once more, Maloth's utmost attention is placed towards the cognitive effort on pushing his body to new heights. With an exhale, the chakra in the brute's body swelled, moving from hist ummy and guiding itself towards the brain. Rather than stopping there, however, the behemoth intelligently allows the compact release of might to be pinpointed towards the singular, needle-sized chakra node.

The sequence wasn't one based on control or spiritual prowess -- since lord knows Maloth failed epically in those regards. He was inept as could be, even if his chakra reservoirs were a cut above the rest. Indeed, what the brute sought to do was ensure that his will power was no longer denied. 

Logically, as chakra carried your mind's consciousness, a part of it's strength was based on iron-cladded will. As it fluxuated, eventually, the first of many restraints would be completely and utterly shattered. It allows for his usual circulatory flow to grow more potent, and thus grant a greater quantity of strength and power. 'Course, the power wasn't without consequences. Just having the state of power activated was one that greatly exhausted every cell in his body.

A steady stream of stamina was being extended, and seemingly just from meditation, sweat was beginning to develop, pushing the brute closer to dehydration. Sadly, this wasn't going to be the end of his rigorous training session. For minutes on in, his spiritual energy surged onward, attacking that one specific chakra node, and hoping to break it open. And while it cracked. . . the second gate refused to truly be unleashed fully. Indeed, to even get to this point, the first of his hachimon formation had been opened, already placing his body under further strain.

Of course, it hadn't yet reached a point where his muscles were going to be ripped or damaged. Instead, the only downside was immense fatigue -- something Maloth despised. Although, it was to be expected. Despite being a muscle-bound freak, he had poor conditioning and still neglected on working on that aspect of his strength. "Hng. . Is har' . . Why not can easy do. . ." complained the behemoth under his voice.

Eventually, enough was enough. He couldn't do it, at least not yet. It remained to be seen, was this a failure of the mind. . . ? Or was this simply Maloth's body being completely unable to handle that next level of stress. Most likely, the answer was likely in the former issue. Nevertheless, Maloth continued in stride. Even as he sat around the ground motionlessly, sweat pilfered up, making it clear that he engaged in an intense exercise.

After doing this for close to half an hour, the brute eventually rises, and gets back into a push-up positioning. The mind was only one half, and now, he had to work on the body. A repetitive process? For sure. But necessary if he wanted to achieve the dream. After all, reaching an additional level in the Hachimon state was all about hardwork and patience -- two things the warrior excelled in. 

His large, bulky body descended once more, each seconds gradually allowing him to progress lower. Purposely, he had moved in a slow, deliberate fashion to ensure that his muscles were really torn apart, thus allowing themselves to recover and grow stronger. This what made him such a difficult opponent. . . For the next half hour, the beast continued with pointless repetition, working up a sweat.

Suddenly, without question, he arises and turns towards the east. "Yes. . . Is what do. Maloth be back, have thin' for do. . " In a mechanical fashion, he heads off towards the right, and away from Kumogakure. There was someone that had to be tracked down.* - Tue Oct  6 01:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And his trip began. Real men didn't mooch off of Caravans, and thus, he proceeds to walk along the land itself. Maloth cared little for the dangers of the forest, nor the weather conditions. No clothes, nor provisions were needed to shield his frame from any potential dangers. Instead, the brute depended on the perfect shield of all -- his own body. Flesh that was rigid like stone, and bones as stiff as actual steel. Hours pass on, and before long, he's been on the road for days.

Taking the night off, the brute descends onto the ground. Before even taking a moment's rest, he falls into a sit-up positioning. This grants him the ability to work on his abdomen, and build up much needed muscle. And while this group of muscle wasn't exactly necessary for offense, it granted more rigid cells to better protect his body. Once the night had set, Maloth awakens, hisbody rejuvenated. One person remained on his mind -- Paine. The taijutsu extraordinaire.* - Tue Oct  6 01:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Indeed. . .Maloth had grown quite possessive in his search for the Concealed Figure. Konoha was left in borderline ruins -- And from these ruins, Maloth meandered about. Sadly, despite his best attempts, the Taijutsu Maestro -- Paine, simply could not be located. 

Then it donned upon the beast. . .

Indeed, in their time together, Paine had confided within him, and subsequently made it clear where she'd go. An area devoid of human interaction, one where nature was never interfered with. Along the way, as Maloth moved towards the east, the brutish warrior hunted, eating and cooking the wildlife to sate his desires. Eventually, he closes in on the desired area.

For some odd reason,  the brute opted to go undercover, leaving his body submerged within the body of water underneath. As he creeps, the warrior eventually manages to get towards the Concealed Figure's rear. Without warning, Maloth leaps, rushing out of the water, and hopefully tackling the girl -- in a playful fashion. "Arghh! Fin'ly, find! Where be? Not e'en try tell Maloth where be!" complained the close-ranged apprentice.* - Tue Oct  6 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The grip is used to lift Paine upward, allowing her to settle on his shoulder. ". . Is 'member like go quiet place. . .So chec' here. Why not come wit' Maloth?" The brute inquires. Indeed, it had been a few weeks since the two had last truthfully conversed. As Paine developed? So did he-- ANd it showed. His body was far more sturdy, and rigid, making him better able to endure damage. ". . .Mmm. We go for Kumo. . yeah?"

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) raises a brow. ". . .Wha'. . ?" He pauses admist his path. He goes, settling Paine back onto the ground, and turning to face his mentor. Would he actually have to travel back and forth on a daily basis -- or rather weekly basis -- in order to receive his training? "Why no come back for with Maloth? No' need stay 'ere. . .  Can be with Maloth," the brute declares, his voice gruff as can be.

By then, he descends into a kneel, allowing his feet to dangle into the water. 

There's an exasperated grunt released after, showing the behemoth's clear irritation. First she had disappeared for weeks on end, and now she was refusing to return to society? What in the world was up with this chick?* - Tue Oct  6 04:15:34 2015

His body was covered in dried blood, and he smelled much like a wild animal -- a bear to be specific. In hand is a Chicken Wing -like appendage.  By the time Lyala had arisen, Maloth is a bit startled, and smacks her in the ribs with the item, which is characteristically covered in his slobber.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Considering Paine's unwillingness to join him in his training session, Maloth took off. After briefly meeting with Lyala, the brute traveled along the land, curious to see what the world had to offer -- at least for now. One place in particular that drew some interest was the village hidden in the Sand. It was a place that the brute hadnt' been to in ages, and thus his curiosity leads him away. 

Minutes become hours, and hours become days. Over the course of a few days, the warrior moved along the world, his body being forced to endure all the obstacles mother nature had to offer. Be it rain, snow, thunder, and even natural sickness -- nothing dared hold  Maloth back. For far too long, he's been limited by someone or something, thus his defiance is at an all time high.

In no time at all, the brute would have moved through the heated desert. The sunrays smashed against his body, just at the crack of dawn. Oddly or surprisingly enough, birds were available, the bulk flying over the terrain in search of food. None, obviously, dared come his way. After all, who the hell would want to eat a man that was built like a rock? He probably didn't taste any good either. For a few minutes longer, the brute continued moving, following along the dirt path he saw on the flooring.

As a familiar face, he's easily allowed through the gates. Before even bothering to go look around to mingle with the locals, the giant rushes on over to the mountains -- to begin training of course. Several heavy, and sand stones are spreaded about. Thinking on his toes, he takes these constructs, attaching each to his limbs in other to further weigh down and add a constant train to his body.

For too long, he;'s been forced to be an onlooker as those that he cared for were murderized, or abused. . .  Those memories, despite being long ago are still lingering fresh in his mind. He was a conflicted giant, one that is forever struck with grief and a feeling of ineptness. And this feeling wasn't due to his low intellect, but rather . . . The constant failures in his life. The lost of his people, and of course the lost of many good friends.

Once more, Maloth resumed with his arduous training sessions. There weren't many in the village that could even come close to being able to take him on in terms of hand to hand, thus he worked alone. With the weights attached to his body, the brute first begins to climb along the mountain tops. It was similiar to the boulder exercise that had been conducted the day prior. 

The right hand first wedges into an opening along the mountain, and once a grip is established, it's use as leverage to pull upward. The process encourages the use of each major muscle, but places emphasis on the biceps and shoulder muscles, along with the muscles in his legs -- the thighs primarily. All of these areas are contracted, and enables his cells to be broken on a microscopic level. 

Teeth clenched, and grunting heavily, Maloth continues to move along the area. The hot temperatures of the Sunagakure desert wears down on his body, forcing his frame  to be more sweaty, and musky than usual. Nevertheless, the hazardous conditions just serve as encouragement for the often extreme dimwit. Seconds turn into minute,s and each passing tick is one that pushes the hulking beast further along the goal.

Given SUnagakure's terrain, almost each end of the village was covered by a mountain. Evidently, during his random training, he would found himself positioned near the hospital. Again and again, the brute moved further up, elevating just beyond the hospital's borders. . .Admist some of the climbing, his gates were active, forcing more strain on the body, and prompting him to get a bit used to the sensation. After all, he wanted to use that transformations as a primary form of combat.

"Hng. . . Hng! Not. . e'en close. . . Need. . go more!" Maloth roared our with a grunt. His voice, deep and authoriative, echo through the empty desert. It forces the wildlife in the nearby proximity to grow alert, and even compel certain eagles to pick up and fly off. But that mattered little. . 

Screaming, crying, it didn't particularly change the true realities of things. And that reality? Maloth was getting extraordinary tired. Along with this, the heat that pressed against his frame pumped out an extraordinary amount of sweat, and thus loosened his grip. Ten paces later, and it was all over. The liquid from his hand dissolves one of the openings just enough, forcing his strength to be a bit overzealous and break the rocking structure.

Couple that with Maloth's immense weight, and the brute is plummeting down. Freefall, he crashes into the exterior of the hospital's roof. Conveniently, it seems that the infrastructure is incomplete, and thus weak. Due to the sheer weight from the rocks attached to the beast's limbs, and the added weight from his normal body, the hospital's structure gives out.

Boom! Boom! Bom! Boom! Again and again, he's crashing through layers, his body utterly smashing through the roofs/floors. This downward path is continously, up until he reaches the ground level -- the morgue. A room where both Zenaki and the Priest Bryson had been seated. Extraordinarily. . the male was unharmed, saved for a few bruises.

Maloth stands promptly, blankly looking towards the strange medics. "Ergh. . .What happens? Is 'stake. . Yes. .. " As a reference, he very much speaks like a caveman. His mind seems unevolved, yet his body appears to have been systematically evolved, or at least purposely spawned by genetics. Casually, the brute waltz around, curious..* - Tue Oct  6 09:18:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||He shakes his bulky frame, prompting dust and bits of rocks to fall off his body. Strangely, the rocks that were previously attached to his body are still primarily in decent shape, they suffer only minor damages. "'Lo. . .  Thin' no good 'spitable be. . ." the brute comments, as he eyes the dead body. A hand rises -- struggling to battle the opposition of gravity, and forcing each muscle in his arm to bulge.

Nevertheless, one of the many carcasses are pointed out. "See 'ready dead," Maloth continued with a confused gaze. If this was a hospital, why was there a dead body? Hospitals were supposed to save people, not have them killed! That said, the giant makes an approach forward, perhaps being close enough to invade Zenaki's personal bubble. His stench was as clear as can be, probably discomforting as a matter of fact.

"Ergh. . Head hurt."* - Tue Oct  6 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) isn't so dumb as to take a pill from a stranger. The object given is snatched up, and tossed away. Beyond this, Maloth just looked on incredulously -- what was with this woman? "Is speak like no soul be have. . . Is weird. Be Botro. . ?" He asks, assuming that Zenaki wasn't exactly human at all, but a doll. His curiosity reigns supreme. Swiftly, the brute's right hand speeds down, aiming to grab the girl by the thigh and lift her up, Assuming success, she'd be held upside down as the strange brute goes about examining her form.

"Not get. . Why act thi' like. . ?"* - Tue Oct  6 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||A giant finger moves, prodding the girl all over her body. Was this really a person? "Is act like no have feelin'.. . Need act like person! Jus' cause liddle, just 'cause weak, no mean can be botro,"Maloth complains, his tone losing the gruff gentleness, and gaining some animosity.

"Show Maloth feeling," the brute demands of the young medical lass.* - Tue Oct  6 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was defiant. He hailed from a clan that called for survival of the fittest. . .and clearly, she was far from the fittest. Thus, his grip of Zenaki remains consistent. Using his immense strength, the brute lifts the girl up, until she was at eye level, thus staring at the beast eye to eye. "Why nee' listen? Why not for can show feelin'? What if Maloth want see?" He spoke in a bully-ish tone. Why do all of this? Simply because he was bigger and stronger, who could check him?* - Tue Oct  6 10:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's grip is tightening -- he wasn't trying to crush her bones or anything.

"Some 'motion. . Yes. . Make weak. Like cry, o' sad. But some good. . Mm, like git mad an' stuff!" Maloth declared with some spirit. He chortled, finding Zenaki entire commentary silly, and laughable. THe hand that's free stretches out, and flexes, showing off a beefy and hardened bicep muscle. Certainly, this man was no slouch when it came to physical activity.

". . .An' talk like not 'ready weak. O'. . can figh'? Just look weak?" the beast comments, finding nothing extraordinary out of Zenaki's physiques. She was neither endowed -- like his own sister- - nor physically opposing, like the amazonian-like women that once populated the brute's tribe.* - Tue Oct  6 10:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) scratches his nose. Did the girl not know the way o' the world?

"Need ask mo' nice," Maloth says bluntly. He wasn't going to be commanded by some medic, after all.* - Tue Oct  6 10:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Put me down. Now. - Tue Oct  6 10:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's brow furrows. He didn't like how poorly Zenaki was treated him. Physically, Maloth was a grown man. . . Yet his psychological wasn't nearly as sophisticated. With a more stern voice, he repeats himself, the grip at last tightening.

"Say. . . Need ask n ice. . . Maloth not slave for tell what do. . ." the brute states with some frustration.* - Tue Oct  6 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||That comment brings back memories. He had encountered the girl before -- once while in Konoha. Casually, he lets his grip go, allowing Zenaki to descend onto the floor at gravity's leisure. "Now 'member. . . Is slave, yes? Think like be slave?" the brute questions, his voice apparently losing some of the animosity, of course Zenaki was still on thin ice with him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) pondered on this.

He still deemed Zenaki a slave- -but that thought triggers memories. The way of the barbarians. A society that had the perfect caste system. Zenaki in particularly, considering her feebleness would perhaps have been a prime candidate. Sadly, she was a member of this village, and thus Maloth had no intent on being a wanted man. 

"Tch. . .Talk lot. . .Think Maloth go now," he says, growing bored of the exchange. Without another word, the brute turns south and begins to head off, likely prepared to return home -- in Kumogakure.* - Tue Oct  6 11:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) makes his approach after days away from the village. Why away? Simply because of training. The brute still roams as if he's in his natural element. A layer of mud smudges his clothes, and dried dirt hugs his flesh. The hammer that was Maloth's trademark lugged behind, being dragging along the floor and releasing a loud screech along the way. As usual, he was training even in the walk. 
Weights were attached to his waists and major appendages, making each step a struggle. Although, the strain wasn't visible as the brute wore a usual stoic facial expression. In time, this allows Maloth to make an approach back to the public square. Casually, he moves right on pass Genesis, his rugged body inadvertantly bumping and pushing her frame a bit towards the side. It's at this point that his musk is probably evident, making it clear that the barbaric warrior hardly takes time for a shower.

At once, he takes a seat, resting the hammer into the ground and using it as a crutch. Despite his nonchalance, the weapon wreaked of evil or malice, one that could potentially warp his persona later on. ". . .'Lo," greeted the hulk-like specimen, clearly projecting his voice in the direction of Genesis.* - Tue Oct  6 11:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's body at last comes to rest. His insides are burning, but relieved that they're no longer being overworked. ". . . " He says nothing at first, much rather preferring to gather his breath and thoughts. A hand moves, unlatching at the various weights and finally releasing his frame from that bondage. On reflex, his muscular structure tensed and fidgeted, his arms subtly shaking as it was hard to keep it still.

". . .How do? See up fast. . mo' fas' than 'ther peoples. . Maloth see lot. Can fight?" He wasn't much of a conversationalist, inspite of his best attempts. This is clear, considering the topic randomly shifts to fighting.* - Tue Oct  6 11:29:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. His attention is captured certainly, as the girl seems capable of spawning angelic wings made from paper. 

"Wha' . . .? How do? Have figh' Maloth now!" the brute demands. Why show off such a neat technique if you weren't willing to battle?The bulky creature makes his approach, fist clenched and ready to go.* - Tue Oct  6 20:05:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued with his casual pace. He had asked for a damn fight, flying into the air wasn't going to deny him that. His legs tensed, prepared to leap upward -- up until some punk towards the south started to scream. Casually, the brute turns face, eying Kojiro in his approach.

"Hrm. . .?" the dimwit murmured to himself casually. 

Was this a battle?* - Tue Oct  6 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) thinks: Gah, Kojiro did a bad thing to fight my brother. Oh, well.  - Tue Oct  6 20:17:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Thwap! A swift fist slams against Maloth's meaty frame. Rather than dealing actual damage, Kojiro finds that the attack leaves the brute unphased, almost as if the blow hadn't been dished out at all. "Hrm. . .? Oh, do wan' figh'!" he declares abruptly, finally understanding what the hell was even going on. Without warning, the fiend charges forward, lowering a shoulder in the process. Assuming capability of taking advantage of the close distance, his shoulder bones would be rammed into the Yamanashi's chest.

Maloth would continue in stride, hoping to use his weight and force to topple over the mutual physical specimen, and essentially tackle him down like a professional linebacker. Hit or miss, the momentum carries over, forcing the brute to place conscious effort in stopping his path. Once movements had been ceased, he turns, eying his target again, like a bear that had been deprived of a meal for months. "He see. ..  If mo' stron' than friend!" A reference to Amon, clearly enough.* - Tue Oct  6 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reisen(BigBootyJudy) says: Of course. . .I'll try to get you some mochi too. . . - Tue Oct  6 20:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Okay, then. Where too. - Tue Oct  6 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) thinks: Gonna go train my techniques. - Tue Oct  6 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Oh. - Tue Oct  6 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Boom! It lands partially, doing the damage that Maloth had anticipated, and of course giving the male the satisfaction of observing as the imposing Kojiro is sent packing. "Hah! Hah! Hah! Is easy. . ." The brute bellows, no doubt charmed and mesmorized by his own physical capabilities. It was fun to be on the winning side.

Then Kojiro goes beast mode.

Incredulously, Maloth looked ahead, unsure of the Yamanashi was serious. Nevertheless, once he had drawn his wakizashi, the barbarian follows suit, a hand moving to grasp along the hilt of his hammer. Spikes riddle the exterior, but none of this appears to be much of a detriment to the brutish, and pain tolerant warrior. At the most, there would be minor pricks along the flesh, but generally he ignored any discomfort.

Much like Kojiro's weapon, Maloth's tool glowed-- but it wasn't of chakra. Purple-ish energy flowed on occasion out of the metal's form. It was dark power, and something that would strike fear into the hearts of many of his opponents. The weapon was seldomly used, but it was effective all the same. Just as Kojiro is slashing at his shoulder, the brute is sending a mighty swing, this time towards his ribs.

Notably, Maloth lacks self restraint, as being within such a close proximity with the demonic weapon warps his psyche just a tad-- and makes him more prone to violence and murderous intent. "GRAH! SEE WHAT BE MO' STRONG!" He roars, believing this to be a battle between weapons. The Wakizashi would have slashed into his shoulder, but finds itself unable to truly penetrate. Flesh would be mildly damage, but overall, Maloth isn't slowing down one bit.* - Tue Oct  6 20:32:38 2015
