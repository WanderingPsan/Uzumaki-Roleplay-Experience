<br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The lightning courses through the blade, increasing it's cutting prowess. 'Course, the added chakra flow means little. The attack still does not so much as even bother him, save for a few mild shocks. "Argh! Is trick Maloth!" Although it was no trick, he wouldn't have been able to avoid regardless of whether the lightning had been seen before or not.

Nevertheless, the hammer does it's trick, slamming against Kojiro's shoulder and damaging the bone. The force sends the boy flying ahead, likely making the battle come to an abrupt end. Swiftly, his hammer is being lowered, and the demonic power that flowed through it begins to lessen. "Hng. . Is. . done?" There's a faint frown worn, this was good practice certainly.* - Tue Oct  6 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . ? Who be you? - Tue Oct  6 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yukimura, Seisuke(Jjking218) says: Not important. - Tue Oct  6 20:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs. "if say so," the male replies. He turns, giving a glance to the defeated Kojiro. "Is good figh' . . .Need get mo' tough," Maloth notes, feeling that their brief exchange was a decent warm up. The hammer is dragged along the ground seconds after, and with that the brute heads on off to meet his sibling. He's been neglecting her as of late, after all. Assuming no one stops him, he's off to the west.* - Tue Oct  6 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) stumbled upon the area with his weapon in tow. Just as Lyala had predicted, Maloth had came out of the battle victorious. The ground seems to be marred with holes, as if some giant badger had been building a home in the area. ". . . Hrm? Wha' doin'?" the brute murmured to himself, although he'd wait for Lyala to finish her exercises before actually questioning her on this.* - Tue Oct  6 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. She failed horribly in the flying kick, much to Maloth's amusement. The Dynamic Entry, it was a skill that Maloth was particularly proficient in. As the chuckles settle, Lyala seems to dig into the ground, her form again being hidden from his eyes. "Hrm. . ?" Frantically, the brute peers around the area, curious to see where she had gone. . .And what she had planned. Hopefully nothing mischevious.* - Tue Oct  6 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) is completely unaware of Lyala approach. As she leaps, he's left a tad startled, and as her arms wrap about his neck, the brute is ready to take action -- Then her feminine voice is heard. All tension is washed away, and a light smile spawns on his face for the briefest moments.

"Hng! Is good trick. . .! Think if try mo', maybe able choke Maloth' real," the brute says, although he speaks with sarcasm. As it stood now, there was no way in hell Lyala was going to be choking him out. Although sarcastistic, there is no malice intent, he's playing clearly.* - Tue Oct  6 21:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) makes his approach. What the fuck was going on? Two massive hands go to grab both of the entities, liftin' them in the air -- if they couldn't resist.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head.

"Is big man. . . Not nee' try figh' liddle girl. An' if e'en figh'. . . Spose win 'ready," Maloth says with pity. He tosses the two onto the ground -- away from one another with some annoyance. 

A glance is given to Komaru. "Why try figh'. .?"* - Wed Oct  7 03:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: And he wanted me to get naked! - Wed Oct  7 03:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wore a bewildered facial expression initially.

:O

"Git. . . Naked. . .? Not sense mae. . . Is jus' liddle girl. .  Not have muscle, oh big chest things," the brute replies, clearly he wasn't buying it. Nevertheless, the fighting had been settled. Casually, he moves to take a seat, his back pressing against the wall. 

"Both nee' stop figh' .  . Les' be stron' an' make fight fun. . "* - Wed Oct  7 03:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Hmph. - Wed Oct  7 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He takes sometime to actually register what Cypher had motioned for. Eventually, Maloth's hand moves, swallowing up Cyphers, and providing an unnecesarily strong grip. Sternly, he shakes, before releasing after a few seconds. 

". . . Name Maloth."* - Wed Oct  7 03:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. "Know is pleasure be Maloth. . . Like be me," he replies, nodding again in comfirmation of his own claim. 

Before he could take a moment's rest, Komaru was rushing up to him. Indeed, Maloth was a grand specimen to behold. Even as he sat, his height likely rivalled the nine-year old's, who remained standing, if not outright eclipsing.

"Yes! An'. . . Is liddle.?"* - Wed Oct  7 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm? 'Lo. Name be Maloth. . . Liddle girl is. . . Shinono? - Wed Oct  7 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. "See later," the brute says, giving a pat -- perhaps a bit heavy handed -- onto Lyala's shoulder.

His view falls onto Heiwa now.

"What e'en try for do . .?"* - Wed Oct  7 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: Maloth. - Wed Oct  7 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'm gonna go back to my box-home. - Wed Oct  7 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Komaru(JustCallMeGnar) says: Bye. - Wed Oct  7 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head.

"Nee' try more hard. An' drink lot water," Maloth replies, giving his very meager amount of knowledge of Suiton jutsu in hopes of assisting Heiwa's progression.* - Wed Oct  7 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. "If have lot water in body. . . Mo' easy do water magic," he replies casually-- although, it's safe to assume that Maloth doesn't have a clue what the fuck he was talking about. After all, this was a man that specialized solely on taijutsu prowess.

"An' need focus. Is how Maloth learn 'lock power. Jus' need for-tend no one there."* - Wed Oct  7 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. The boy was on the right track. For now, Maloth fell silent, figuring his wise words were no longer needed to guide Heiwa towards the right path. In no time, water comes from his maw, prompting the brute to deem it a success.

-- Suddenly, a youthful voice is heard from the rear.

Kumogakure was seemingly growing more populated with children. Upon turning, the giant's gaze falls south. "Huh? Try help him. . . So am able do water magic," articulated the barbarian.* - Wed Oct  7 05:06:20 2015

Alcohol was the best drink! He was from a tribe of vikings/barbarians, as Lyala would know. She'd likely be able to infer that they were heavy drinkers when not battling.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wastes no time. He quickly calls for the waiter to come over.

"Maloth want lot o' Drinks! Give all can do!" -- And by now, the waiter had recognized the brute on a personal basis. Indeed, Maloth came to this place often, and grew familiarized with the staff. Before long, he's heading over an obscene amount of cash, which was likely stolen from bandits in the outskirts. 

In no time, the waiter is gone, brewing up a massive, king-sized order of liquor. 

"Lyala. . . is ready?"* - Thu Oct  8 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Ready! - Thu Oct  8 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) says: Excuseee me. - Thu Oct  8 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Thu Oct  8 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. By then, the large bulk of the beverages reach the table. It covers every inch of the table's range, the smell leaks into the area. "Is good. . Maloth drink firs'!" No time is taken before a massive club of a hand reaches down, grabbing onto one of the massive mugs of beer -- which was just one of the many different drinks. It's brought to his mouth, and in a vehemous fashion, the brute devours it. There's a warm sensation that goes over his insides, and it makes him feel all bubbly. . . Nevertheless, the brute is fine.

"is good. . "* - Thu Oct  8 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) says: Uh. . I'm not really so sure on good teachers to be honest. .  - Thu Oct  8 04:04:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) says: Darn. - Thu Oct  8 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) raised a brow. He was proud.. . Lyala definitely knew how to handle her alcohol. 

"Oh! Is good. . . See if able beat Maloth!" The proposal to drink had just been for fun. But now, he had been challenged. THis was now a personal endeavor! Quickly, Maloth grabs a second giant glass, and swallows it's contents like it was a bottle of water, rather than cold liquor. Upon ingesting the drink, he releases a loud, nasty burp. You could swear you saw some spit protruding from his maw during the process.

". . .Easy!"* - Thu Oct  8 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Thu Oct  8 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) rose a brow.

He was legitimately surprised. . .Was this the same Lyala he had known for years? The weak, feeble creature that was sent away? ". . Woah. . Is can drin'. . . Not think last more long than Maloth!" the brute declares. He picks up the pace, foolishly downing tow mugs at once, to show Lyala one thing. . .

He was a real one. A manly man.

"Ish. . .eashy. . "* - Thu Oct  8 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was growing impressed.

"Not know. . . Abl' drink this like. .  Sure ne'er drink for?" The simpleminded brute asked with a legitimate slur. This was surprising to say the least. Nevertheless, even as there was a slight wobble, Maloth refused to be the loser in this competition -- even if they hadn't even made their wager yet. That entire part had slipped his mind.

Without a second comment, some rum is taken from a flask, and devoured in seconds. It flows into his tummy, and spreads out into his systems, pushing him further down the line of tipsiness. Who would be victorious?* - Thu Oct  8 04:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Thu Oct  8 04:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinked oddly. 

This girl was really getting out of hand, but it amused Maloth, so he doesnt' really do anything. In no time, the brute goes to grab too more glasses of foamy beer. Simultaneously, both are being poured down his mouth, and sliding through is throat. It takes very little effort to down them both, which was sensibly considering just how ravenously Maloth tended to eat.

"Is. . . Still kay?" the behemoth questions with a slur, unsure if Lyala had reached her limits. She was much smaller than him, so it was a safe assumption.* - Thu Oct  8 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) followed suit. Just as she goes to drink two, so does he. Thankfully, his larger frame and familiarity with the beverage is enough to allow him to remain conscious. After releasing another giant burp, Maloth moves forward, grabbing Lyala in a bridal fashion and setting her onto the table.

Giant fingers goes, poking her on face.

". . . Is 'kay?" He asks in a groggy fashion, just barely able to remain some consciousness.* - Thu Oct  8 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continues to poke. This was becoming irritating.

". . Wake . ." the brute says in a low tone. He was enjoying their time out together, it made sense that he had no intention of letting it end prematurely.

Nonchalantly, a drink is held in hand, primed for take off should the girl not awaken.* - Thu Oct  8 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had just about been ready to splash her face with the a cup of liquor. Drats.

"Hrm. . ? Ish lose. . . 'lmost beat Maloth. . . Almos' . . .  What prize Maloth win?" He says, getting right to the point. They had played with the intent on wagering, no?* - Thu Oct  8 04:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Uhh.. - Thu Oct  8 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Maloth. - Thu Oct  8 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I can't think if a prize. - Thu Oct  8 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Give me a bit. - Thu Oct  8 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Hell. - Thu Oct  8 05:03:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yes... - Thu Oct  8 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I am never drinkin again. - Thu Oct  8 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Ever. - Thu Oct  8 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) frowns.

"But is fun!"* - Thu Oct  8 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: It is not. - Thu Oct  8 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Is fun for Maloth. . . What Lyala think be fun? - Thu Oct  8 05:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: ... Wanna know what I think is fun? - Thu Oct  8 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Shopping. - Thu Oct  8 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: --! - Thu Oct  8 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: We should dress you up. - Thu Oct  8 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looks down.

He wore nothing but a pair of worn out  jeans and some gauntlets.

"Is no good. . ?"* - Thu Oct  8 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Nope. - Thu Oct  8 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Gues' ..  If think so. - Thu Oct  8 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: We. . go? - Thu Oct  8 05:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm! - Thu Oct  8 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks around.

This is where she had intended to take him?* - Thu Oct  8 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: -- - Thu Oct  8 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Kay! - Thu Oct  8 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: This would be, very very hard... - Thu Oct  8 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: But I can do it. - Thu Oct  8 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I'm pretty sure I can. - Thu Oct  8 05:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He's still having some trouble understanding what Lyala had intended to do.

"Hrm. . ? If say can do," the brute replies. It was amusing how different two siblings could be. Maloth was a jungle boy, while Lyala clearly was a girl accustomed to the city. He waits to see her decision.* - Thu Oct  8 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I will need help...  - Thu Oct  8 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: I... - Thu Oct  8 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: You really.. - Thu Oct  8 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Need. - Thu Oct  8 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: To change - Thu Oct  8 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Those pants. - Thu Oct  8 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks.

He looks down. Those pants had been through a lot, and they really WREAKED. It was a wonder why Lyala hadn't ever dealt with them before. The cloth remains covered in dried blood and mud. ". . Not have 'nother pant."* - Thu Oct  8 05:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) followed along side Lyala. He didn't particularly want to be here, but also didn't mind that his sister cared enough to try and help his appearance. Sadly, she'd find that looking for clothes and shoes for the monstrosity was going to be easier said than done. His physique was certainly unique, making it difficult to find clothes that would fit properly -- meaning he'd probably require custom clothing for the most part.

Eventually, a jet-black pants is tossed his way.

Lacking of common sense, he obliges and begins to change -- in public. Assuming not stopped, he's stripping down into his undies, revealing a muscular, buff lower body to match his upper. Of course, he -did- have underwears, but they were stained, and riddled with holes, making him not as modest as could be.

If not stopped by this point, he continues on, trying to slip the pair of jeans up. It scrunches, releasing sounds that suggested the fabric was being stretched out. . ! But it manages to slip on, albeit while getting dirty, since Maloth was a filthy specimen.

"is. . Good?"
* - Thu Oct  8 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Yes!!! You look, very very handsome. Mhm. - Thu Oct  8 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) smiled. He took the compliment well..

"Am handsome? Really think be handsome?" the brute questions, almost in disbelief. "Lyala is handsome too," the brute states, botching his returning compliment completely. A gaze shifts on over to the imposing female, Bremusa. It was nice to see that there were still muscular women running out nowadays, although she wasn't recognized as a true member of his former tribe. After gazing onto the dark skinned woman briefly, he speaks again.

"Is done give Maloth cloth. . ?" he says, looking back to Lyala briefly.* - Thu Oct  8 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Mhm, I am done. - Thu Oct  8 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: No' get clothes for self? - Thu Oct  8 06:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Mmm, nope. - Thu Oct  8 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Oh. . .  - Thu Oct  8 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hello - Thu Oct  8 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm? 'Lo. Think know.. - Thu Oct  8 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) recognized the voice.* - Thu Oct  8 06:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I gave you the gauntlets you now wear? - Thu Oct  8 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Oh! Yes, now 'member. - Thu Oct  8 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: What do here? - Thu Oct  8 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I migrated here with several others after the demon attacked the leaf. . and. . Erebus died. .  - Thu Oct  8 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyala(BoyFlareon) says: Well.. I sh--- - Thu Oct  8 06:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He could feel Marissa's pain, but said nothing on it. Erebus was an enemy, believe it or not. So his death brought Maloth great pleasure. "is bad man. . kill Maloth frien'. . "

Before Lyala could run, he grasps at her shoulder.

"What mean is girl friend. .? Maloth have lot girlfriend. Lyala one, not get why nee' run," he comments, clearly not understanding the definition of 'girlfriend.' Soon after, his eyes fall back onto Bremusa, whose physique greatly intrigued him. It wasn't often that he saw a female that had a form that could rival his own -- if they hypothetically had the same gender.

"Hrm. . . Who you be? Is right whe' say have warrior 'o great strong. . "* - Thu Oct  8 06:29:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. "Is good meet. Name Mal--"He's forced to juggle more than one conversation. His gaze turns over, meeting Marissa's. "Hrm. . ? Suitengu. . Hea' get kill. So no' need worry, 'know is dead, yes?" He states bluntly, figuring that the girl was only distressed due to not knowing where the hell that little runt had gone.* - Thu Oct  8 06:39:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) gives a blank stare. He definitely didn't expect that reaction. . 

"Oh. . Ergh. Is happens, cry no' fix problem! If hurt 'nough for make mad. . . Jus' go get venge!" The brute roars, feeling no need to give pity. Ambition was better. . . 

He turns, nodding towards Bremusa. Judging by her frame and overall attitude, it was suffice to say that she too was from a warrior society, of fighting-based clan. ". . .Mm? Sometime. . Ye'. .  Is no tough like 'ther warrior people," the brute admits, although he didn't seem to be looking down upon the fan user.* - Thu Oct  8 06:58:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugged. He hadn't a clue as to WHO had been responsible for the death of Suitengu. . . Simply that he had died.

"Is not know. . . Nee' ask 'round. Know other people know," Maloth says with a grin. He could see the beast that laid within Marissa's soul. Before, she had been seen as a weak, feeble woman. One  that, while interesting to speak and observe, could truthfully do no harm to anyone.

Now, however, Maloth saw different.

"Sho. .  is strong 'nough for do revenge? Try fight Maloth. . . See if strong," he offers, hoping that Marrisa would accept and perform well enough to impress. He wouldn't like to see her run off for revenge and die in the process.* - Thu Oct  8 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||His arms were folded, and he gives a challenging grin to Marissa. So she had taken the offer? Splendid. It's clear that Maloth greatly anticipated engaging Marissa in a 'bout. After all, he hadn't had a good fight -all week.- It was about time someone had the balls to battle him.

Still wishing to ascend into that next realm of power, he falls into a basic stance, glancing fiercely onto Marissa's form. She was skinny and lithely built, making it clear that the girl lacked in terms of physicality. "Is ready then . . .We go!" A foot stomps onto theground in excitement, and considering his bulky frame and high level of durability, it shakes the ground to the core.

Dust kicks up, but not blatantly enough to cloud the area. Marrissa still very much had a clear view and shot at him. The ground continued to shake, and cracks ran along the infrastructure -- making it apparent that the girl likely wouldn't want to get caught by a punch anytime soon. Without a second word, Maloth breaks off into a sprint. Savagely, he's rushing, his stance much like a football player's, one that was ready to run Marissa right over.

The fan, as he lacked knowledge on it, wasn't paid too much mind. In fact, it garners a chuckle. A heavy one that pierces through the skies, and occasionally forces the weaker mountainous structures to rumbles -- giving the appearance of potential avalanches. But his arrogance would have a giant price to pay sure enough. . . Just as the fan is whipped..

The wind is beckoned to the girl's will. Without question, a gale of wind is conjured. It roared, screeching like a banshee and carrying out the girl's current state of mind -- one of pure rage and sorrow. These emotions serve to better her strength, and force Maloth to pause briefly. Cuts riddle his frame, none being deep, but the pain certainly being felt.

In time, it forces a light trickle of blood to go through his forearm as the razor sharp winds can easily make it through his flesh, but seem to be stopped by the thick muscle. He isn't quite thrown back as when the fcurrents come, both feet plant, enduring the damage. ALong with this, his weight makes it take a bit more effort to actually toss him off course. . .

"Is stron'! But no strong 'nough!" Despite suffering some damage, Maloth continued to race forward like a bull. Sadly, the Sickle Weasal had proven to be enough to keep him away just long enough -- couple with Marissa being sent back in recoil, she was still a good amount of distance away from his wrath.* - Thu Oct  8 08:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Fortunately enough for Marissa, Maloth had no intention on actually utilizing his hammer. When that weapon was in his employment, it was clear the he'd have trouble controlling his urges. Just a single swing would be liable to send her to the hospital, if not outright leaving her on the verge of death. Thus, the brute graciously opts not to even employ that evil weapon.

Notably, it gave off a feeling a malice, one that Marissa was undoubtably used to by now. Despite the cuts that were riddling Maloth's form, the brute never slows down. . . He's rushing ahead, eager to engage in close-ranged combat, but never quite being able to close the distance enough. Nevertheless, he can't quite be put down. The endless blows of Fuuton techniques several little purpose other than deterring him and whittling away at his defenses.

Before being able to close the distance again, the girl's fan flicks once more. It unleashes a torrent of wind spheres, most being concussive in nature. Due to the sheer amount, evasion is impossible due to Maloth's slow level of speed, and shit-tier reflexes. Thus, his hands shoot uwpard, forming an 'X' to save the more vital  areas. Along with this, his legs contort, shielding his crotch or jewels from potential stiking.

All in all, each of the spheres hit their mark, pushing the brute's bones to a high degree of stress. But. . . Even that still wasn't enough. Resisting it all, Maloth's body -- while covered with bruises -- leaps upward. He wasn't about to just ler Marissa continue with evasion. Like the incredible hulk, he's flying through the frame. A giant arm lashes ahead, aiming to grab either the fan, or Marissa's body. Either one would be ideal. . .  perhaps it'd make the battle go more smoothly.

"Is strong. . Maloth like what see! But nee' mo' bettahs moves!" Advice is given through the battle. Marissa had some skill for sure, but what she lacked was a greater moveset. Some skills that could be used to supplement her ability, and deal damage against those with thicker skin. Although, it wasn' t often that she'd run into as good of a tank as Maloth-- being prepared was always helpful, though. Regardless, if the attempted hulk leap had ended in failure, he'd sail onto the ground with a thud.

The collision is enough to leave a crater, or smash rocks. Maloth wasn't a small man by any means, clearly enough. His gargantuan weight only further added to any fall. . . Making it clear why he specialized in wrestling based moves. After all, if you had a five-hundred plus pound man falling ontop of you, chances are. . . you aren't getting back up.* - Thu Oct  8 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||That unbottled rage, that's precisely what he wanted so desperately to battle Marrisa. To see just what the girl had to offer in terms of offensive ability. Before then, he simply saw her as some thrall that would remain in the mansion for day's on end waiting for Erebus to find use for her. Sadly, Marissa is more than capable of evading his capture. Thus, Maloth begins on a downward path towards the ground, grunting with frustration due to his inability of even being capable of throwing a punch.

Whenever he had gotten close, Marissa pulled some stunt. She;'d either flee or pelt him with ranged attacks, making it near to impossible of actually performing any real taijutsu. This greatly irritated the childlike brute. Just as he's about to land, the combination attack is sent forward. Thankfully, the young fan specialist lacked true skill in regards to the Katon affinity. This is what saves him frm being scorched. . . Well, too badly at least.

An 'X'-formation of flames comes spiralling his way. At once, Maloth's body tucks, and his left arm comes to block the bulk of the flames that descend upon him. It was like a Goddess from heaven was smiting him for his wrong doings. . .! But. . . That isn't enough to put down the beast. He looks ahead with angry eyes, while also wearing a giant grin. This girl was tougher than she looked, even if she continously ran from close-ranged combat.

The combination leaves a decent burn on his back and arms, but with the pain came pleasure. Naturally, due to her swinging the fan, the woman was no doubt on a downward spiral considering it wasn't used to glide. He'd continued rushing ahead, aiming to predict just where the young lass would land. She had to come down eventually. .  right? And had she began gliding again? THen the hulking fiend simply leapt. He had no qualms with taking to the skies. Once more, he;s aiming to tackle the dainty teen from the air and onto the ground.* - Thu Oct  8 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) still sailing through the skies -- assuming she hadn't landed, Maloth yells obscenity. "Nee' figh' Maloth for real! Not like keep chasin'!" This was a commonly issue he held in most battles. His opponents simply evaded him and pelted away with ranged assaults. . . It was irritating. Regardless, while in the air, the brute swipes a hand, hoping to aid in the event that the tackle failed. ". . . Need get more faster. . "* - Thu Oct  8 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Clever. Clever. . .  She had great tact. But in the end, what ever advantage she had over him in terms of overall intelligent and strategy was made up simply by Maloth being a fuckin' sturdy idiot. It was the natural order of things. . . When one species was smarter, nature inevitably made the opposition have some sort of redeeming factor. In the case of this brute, this just happened to be his impeccable durability and penchant to take pain what was fate had decided would be the equalizer.

The swings once more, producing a massive gale or breeze. It''s enough to send his frame flying, but not before a grip had been established. Assuming he actually had made some contact, once the Great Breakthough was being unleashed, as he's being sent forward, so too would the fan. Hopefully the force that came from Maloth's eventually loss of his grip would dictate that Marrissa too lost control of her fan. 

Assuming it had gone acording to plan, the folding item flutters, before landing onto the ground with a clatter. MAloth, on the other hand, had also been sent sailing pretty hard. Unexpectantly, the wind smashes against his figure, forcing his cells to take the impact  of the dense wind currents. Naturally, his body does well. Despite this, the constant bombardment of attacks are beginning to make themselves known. His body is more than just a little bruised, and still has a few cuts here and there. 

In addition to this, the release eventually prompts him to slam into the ground. The sudden force, coupled with weight leaves another crater. The crater formed is about four feet in depth, while the diameter is roughtly the size of Maloth's height. Dust clouds momentarily cloud view, but as the dust dissipates or settles. . . The hulking beast is getting up, albeit in a dizzy fashion. The collision with the ground hurted, yet it also benefited him as it placed his body against something it was used too..

Blunt force or trauma. Standing erect, the beast looks to see how Marissa had landed or dealt with the blow. Was she still with her fan? In the event that she wasn't, the brute's fist punches against his palm, allowing him to crack his knuckles. There's a hopeful grin.* - Thu Oct  8 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||His clothes, which had just recently been purchased for him by Lyala, had been ruined. It was once more tattered and filled with dust and cuts. . . But that didn't matter. Even as Maloth's form was marred up or tattoed with wounds and bruises, the adrenline flowing and his appetite for battle beckoned him to go further. Promptly, chakra flowed through his interior, all of it again pulling towards the brain.

Why. . .? To focus on that single, needle-sized chakra point that placed shackles upon his true strength. It was a process governed by iron-cladded will. He wanted the new level of power badly. . . and thus, the restraint is completely shattered, giving a greater rise to power and speed. Noticeably for Marissa, she'd find that Maloth moved nearly twice as fast as before. "Not nee' worry 'nymore! Know nothin' can do!" He barks, confident now that Marissa no longer had her fan.

Of course, Maloth was an ignorant entity. He knew not that the fan was simply a means to improve one's elemental ability with Fuuton. From his point-of-view, the fan was magical and without it, Marissa was powerless. Needless to say, the simpleminded behemoth believes the battle to be won and thus wrecklessly charges in to end the battle. . .!

His bulky body was closing in one her, hoping to take advantage before she could complete the seal. The season he was in range? His right arm shoots forward, aiming to clothesline right around her neck. Despite his state of excitement, the strength ish eld back a tad, as too much force would prove to shatter her collarbone. In this state, there would be a minor would at the most. . . Thankfully, he had only used the gate for his speed boost, rather than boneshattering strikes. * - Thu Oct  8 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Kawarimi. The bane of his existence. -- Or not. The clothesline would have go through, activating the Body Replacement technique. . . Sadly, she had simply opted to switch with her clothes. For the most part, they serve little purpose other than stripping Marrissa down. Nevertheless, as the attack goes on, the brute adds a bit of 'Omph' to the blow. It deals enough damage to send her frame skidding along the dirt.

Her momentum would just barely stop ahead of the mountain, saving her from further damage. Even then, the giant is still well on his way over, aided in part by his usage of the first gate -- one that rapidly was draining his stamina. Indeed, the fan specialist would easily be able to pick up on such as sweat was even boiling over his figure.

Nevertheless, assuming she stayed down long enough, Maloth would have been upon her. A foot rises, pressing onto her chest. Not enough to potentially deal damage, but enough to hopefully pin her in place. Had the battle finally come to a close? For his own sake, he hoped so. His body couldn't keep up with the consistent drain of physical energy for much longer.* - Thu Oct  8 10:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The battle had at last come to an end. His body depowers, releasing the strain placed onto it by the first gate. Considering Marissa's state of unconsciousness, the brute grabs her defeated body and proceeds up the mountain to settle her down some place safe. Each cell in his muscles, while not sore or anything, felt utterly exhasuted, his body releasing a thick odor -- which had been customary or expected of the brute by now. 

The fatigue was clear, his movements along the incline mountain were sluggish. Before moving onward, Kaori's presence is noted. "Hrm. . . Is be watch figh'?" the hulking animal questions. To think, he had just now noticed the spectator. How shameful for a man that partially worked as a hunter in the old days. * - Thu Oct  8 11:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) raises a brow at the change in facial expression. 

By now, his own foul stench was normal. It conditioned his nose, making him numb to all of the unpleasant sensation. Steps closer are taken as Marissa's unconscious frame still remains on his shoulder.

"Huh. . .? Sense make. . . O' Maloth be able for tell is there," he says, holding confidence in his own sensory ability. "Why make face this like. . ?"* - Thu Oct  8 11:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued to move, clearly on the path to enter the building. Something bugged him, however. 

The words spoken by Kaori. Brow rose, the brute stops a step before entering the building. In a slow, half-hearted fashion, he turns, his height enough to cast a shadow over the much smaller Kumogakure inhabitant. The expression worn by Maloth depicts intrigue or confusion, rather than just rage -- at least for now.

"What mean smell . . Is smell good," he replies, seeming finding his own scent pleasant or at least decent. An arm rises, allowing the scent from his armpit to be unrestrained. It flows into the area, giving Maloth -- and Kaori herself-- an even more pronounced whiff of his aroma. 

The brute nodded, sure that he smelled great. . . Like a manly man should smell.* - Thu Oct  8 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) still is lugging the unconscious Fan Specialist around on one shoulder.* - Thu Oct  8 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. "Is smell manly. . Is what people 'pose like," the brute insists. His body is leaning forward as he seeks to place his armpits literally centimeres away from Kaori's face. Hell, had she not been still, she ran the risk of brushing her flesh against his musky, sweaty and stick underarm. Considering the position, she likely didn't have anywhere to, lest she can move around his bulky frame some how.* - Thu Oct  8 11:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nodded. He had been victorious in convincing Kaori of his manliness. With a smirk, the brute goes to stand back erect -- but then a thought invades his mind. Yes, he had proved his manliness and glory to the world. . . But had Kaori? Observant eyes look the small Yamanshi up and down. Lacking any common sense, with the one arm that remained free, his hand shoots downward. If the reach was swift enough to grab her by the leg, he'd employ his superhuman strength, effortlessly lifting her up.

She'd be dangle upside down as MAloth casually goes to examine her form. Was it 'womanly' to his perception? His definition of 'womanly' varied, mind you considering the environment that the brute had grown up in.* - Thu Oct  8 12:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued to hold his recent captive upside down. There was something about this woman that seemed familiar. . . Perhaps it was the garbs? Thoughtfully, he continued to examine her form before turning her about to get a look at her rear and the other features. 

Having done this, with no blatant perversion mind you, Maloth turns her about face, giving a partial nod. She wasn't half bad -- certainly fitting the criteria of his people. A tribe where people -- or women really  -- were judged by their appearance, moreso than even their male counterparts. To say the least, you either had to fit the bill as a warrior, or a mate. 

"Hrm. . . What think for self? Am be womanly?" The fiend finally asks, curious on Kaori's own thoughts. He remained amused, and impressed at the same time. "is good no scream. . . All-time Maloth do this. . . They like. . 'No! Not hurt! Put please now down!'" the dimwit mocks in his trademark manner of speech.* - Thu Oct  8 13:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. It was understandable.

He was enjoying the conversation, yet something in the back of his mind was bugging him. He had someone to visit -- but things here had to be wrapped up first.

"Is good. Maloth no like cowar. . . But is fun for watch people scream, ahaha! What be name? Think know. . ." He replies, casually allowing Kaori's body to descend. Indeed, the girl greatly looked like someone he had faced before -- Kojiro. 

". .! Is wear cloth o' man Maloth beat to mud! Break arm! Is know he?"* - Thu Oct  8 13:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grinned. He recalled the battle vividly. . . It escalated for no reason.

"Yes! Look jus' like he. . ! Kojito. . . He need get more strong. . . Lose easy to Maloth. . . . Kaori. . . Can fight?" He inquires, curious to see if the young shinobi actually had some skill to match her frame. Even as the brute had just recovered from defeating Marissa in a long-winded battle, the notion of yet another confrontation was appealing. 

His visage is casted upon Kaori -- who had made a good impression on the simpleminded behemoth thus far..* - Thu Oct  8 13:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He moves inside briefly to drop off the unconscious Marissa. Upon returning, a massive club of a hand moves, patting the young Yamanshi on the head.

"Is good for talk. Glad no' make Maloth mad like 'ther people. . Hng. . ." It was hard being a barbarian living in society sometimes. He turns about face. "But have go now. Need go train with master. Kaori train too, so can give fight good fo' Maloth," the gargantuan male states. After giving another nod, he begins down the path, each step enough to make the most miniscule of tremors move through the mountainous area.* - Thu Oct  8 13:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) would have trekked through the forests again. This time, he knew exactly where Paine had been huddled up. Right ontop of a bridge, over a raging waterfall. How in the world did this girl even eat? It was as if she never even left the area. Still, he greatly anticipated reaching the area. Unbeknowst to Paine, the brute legitimately enjoyed her presence -- he didn't come just for training. It was also a legit visit.

Through the trip, the brute remains as persistant and diligent in his training as always. After all, Paine wouldn't have it any other way. Very night, Maloth would first train his body, by doing a series of physical exercises. Things such as push-ups, sit-ups, and anything else that required no equipment other than your natural physique.

And after, there came the spiritual training. Just like Dissida Paine and her mindscape, the volatile brute too also regularly engaged in meditation. But it wasn't him having visions of a tutor. No, this was pure training. His chakra consistently flared and communed around specific points as he aimed to conjure up enough will power to break another restraint. Admittedly? Maloth was getting dangerously close. . . But just could not quite reach that next bracket of strength.

The second Gate, the Gate of Healing. It's power was just legend, at least according to his tribe's story. Before long, the brute at last reached the destination. As usual, he keeps with his antics, and submerges himself underwater, creping along the bridge and proving strong enough to resist the water's current. Once in position, he does a leap, forcing galloons of water to  jump up, splashing Paine. As he lands on the bridge, a scary face is made, and his arms are lifted up to make himself appear bigger.

"GRWARGH! Is wake now. . ? How?"* - Thu Oct  8 14:11:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grinned. He looked ahead, happy that his instructor was finally awake. "What be doin' out here? Not can be fun. . . Is nothin' for do. . . " The brute articulates, still in a crouching formation an d still covered in a layer of water. His muscles were tense, and still growing more defined -- showing that he never stopped training. Even now, the brute considered getting into position to do more physical exercises. After all, it was the body that truly would undergo the 'transformation' known as Hachimon.

The mind simply had to be able to allow the body the opportunity. "For come here. . . Maloth be train. . Work on technique," he'd state assuming Paine had given a response. Falling onto one foot, the other leg kicks upward, before sending a sweeping kick towards the bottom. His skilll in the Leaf Whirlwind manuever had increased by leaps and bounds. "Is good. . .  Paine know Maloth come for train. . But firs. . "

Fatigued, the brute takes a seat, allowing his legs to dangle into the water. A hand pats onto the ground, gesturing for the girl to sit herself by his side. "Tal' to Maloth. Is want know if really is like be 'lone out here." Needless to say, he'd be a bit offended if she really did prefer to sit out in the wilderness alone rather than chill with the M-Meister. AKA, Maloth.* - Thu Oct  8 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He disliked being questioned. 

"Is not -need- in Kumo," the taijutsu trainee admits. He looks ahead, frowning a bit, before turnnig to gaze into Paine's optics. "But wan' in Kumo. Is Maloth friend, no? Not e'en need be in crowd. . . Jus' want 'round," the brute admits. 

This lithe taijutsu specialist had grown on him. It was funny how things were in the world. . . Paine was the embodiment of -everything- a barbarian or warrior shouldn't be, as described by his clan. She was small, lacking in curves, and as quiet as a mouse. But even with these qualities, in ways, Maloth felt drawn to her.

She had defied all odds, and become a literal beast in terms of taijutsu prowess, far exceeding even someone as bulky and sturdy as Maloth himself. "Is come with Kumo when Maloth leave. . yeah?  Not nee' make he grab an' carry," the brute jokingly threatens, even if he's kinda serious in his threats.* - Thu Oct  8 15:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. He wasn't going to have it. 

Paine was one of the few people he deemed to be a psuedo-clanmate. "No! Is come an' stay wit' Maloth. Not nee' be scare. . . Maloth ne'er let no one hurt," he says casually, hoping to ensure that Paine would cease with this senseless life of solitude. This way, they could hang out whenever, and battle one another at a more regular pace.

". . .Tch. . .Not for sure. . . Maloth get mucha strongah! Try punch on chest!" He challenges the sensei with a toothy grin. Feeling that his body was up to par, massive clubs beat down on his own muscular frame, showcasing the sturdiness.* - Thu Oct  8 15:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||His chest muscles strickened in preparation for the incoming blow. It was this motion or preparation that was instrumental in utilizing his personal stance, the 'Iron Fist'. The name 'iron' came from the defensive undertones. His body would have hardened due to the muscle's contraction, thus making him better able to defend against the incoming blows. Be it physical or ethereal. . .

Nevertheless, Paine's full force is nothing to be trifled with. The blow rocks his body to the core, forcing his sturdy frame to recoil. It leaves a very light bruise, but generally, the discoloration of his flesh is subsiding at a fast rate. "Is stronger! But not strong 'nough hurt Maloth much!" The brute declared with a slick grin, he was very proud of his body clearly enough. Although, performing this stance was notably drainiing, thus he didn't employ it very much.

Arms folded, a glance is given back to Paine. He's motioning to stand, and pushing off the wooden bridge to assist in such. "We go? Back to Kumo. . . Can train an' eat there later. Tire of Paine stay here all day," Maloth complains. His hands move to grasp around the woman's lithe figure, and picks her right on up. It was time to blow this popsicle stand! "'kay?" he questions, hoping that the quiet woman would comply.* - Thu Oct  8 16:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) picks up the white robe. She wasn't coming back.* - Thu Oct  8 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Oh! - Thu Oct  8 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Before actually leaving, he felt compelled to show off his new weapon. Yep, it was totally a guy tthing. Briefly, Paine is set onto the ground, and his hammer grasped. It literally smelled of evil intent, and occasionally emanated from it's metallic form. Eventually, it's brought over his head, and gains needed momentum. "Is see this?!"

Spikes were protruding along it's handle, making it clear that wielding the weapon was hazardous to most. Nonetheless, he swings downward, forcing the demonic hammer to clash against the ground. As a note, there was an eyeball along it's side, and as the weapon is swung about, it closes. Eventually, the hammer 'Devolving Hammer' hits the ground, releasing all of the built up momentum and crushing the floor entirely.

It's this weapon that greatly auguments his own striking power. In time, the dirt quivered, and a crater is left along the grassy terrain of Konohagakure's forest. Arrogant, the weapon is sheathed before it's chaotic nature can come to pollute Maloth's mind. After all, prolonged wielding of his Hammer tended to warp his senses and make the already fight-loving brute bloodthirsty. . Hence the little incident with Kojiro. "Is cool. . . Yes?"* - Thu Oct  8 16:31:08 2015

"Happen lon' time 'go. No' can take all thing too. . . Maloth teach is mucha stronger. . . Beat Maloth with punchin'!" He says in reference to his taijutsu instructor, one that could honestly beat him with just physical might. That was a rare occurence. Before he could speak further, Misa had made her presence known.

Turning, the brute faces the eccentric Uchiha.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. He thinks on the moment. . . pondering all of the shinobi that he had encounter during his adventures in continent.

". . .Mm. Not can 'member. ..  Ergh. Gues'. . . -- No," he mutters. The question had literally stumped here. Sure, there were shinobi that were a lot faster than Maloth, but that's only because he was a walking wall of muscle. His velocity took a hit as a direct result.

Eventually, a hand rises to massage his cranium as the deep thoughts start to make his brain overheat. Why did she ask such a difficult question? "Ergh. . . Ow. . "* - Thu Oct  8 16:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||A new challenger had approached! Quickly, Maloth's knees buckle, allowing his frame to fall into a battle stance. Every muscle in his body twitches as they're routinely flexed to have them in a state of contraction. In this manner, his body gained a higher degree of durability, making him well equipped to taking a beating, but also impeding his attacking prowess, mobility and ability to react. Daggers are stared ahead, eying Kirie as she'd inevitably prepare for battle.

"Mmm . . Change mind. . . can use nature-thing," Maloth says, giving permission for elemental releases. He could only hope that the girl didn't think to use his weakness, that being illusions. It annoyed him so much, making him hesistant to attack shinobi at times. Regardless, now in a perfect stance, he presses off against the ground, rushing head first into Kirie's direction.

Right fist cocked, it's building up momentum. Once in the distance? The brute releases a singular strike. A right handed haymaker right towards the center of the woman's chest. Despite it's power, which was creditted solely due to his immense body or muscle density, the punch lacked finnese or speed. This was something that he and his teacher worked rigorously to overcome, and honestly. . . they were succeeding. He'd just have to apply a bit more effort.

Regardless, as it goes through, his shoulder leans in stride, hoping to add more power to keep the girl on her toes. Hit or miss, Maloth's body breaks into a twirl, with a single foot serving as a crutch or anchor. The other leg arises, hoping to kick her right in the face -- though this was honestly a faint. Assuming it missed, he'd follow through, releasing a kick at her ankle in a sweeping motion to knock her off her feet.

While the brute hadn't yet called upon that special source of power, his inner workings were churning and begging for it to be utilized. In all this time, he was growing more accustomed to operating beyond his body's normal limits, thus increasing his skill in using the jutsu. The only downside? A lack of stamina, forcing premature exhaustion in battle. Thus he only used it for special circumstances.* - Thu Oct  8 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: I can. . . hear them.. - Thu Oct  8 17:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Al-Saachez, Kirie(AxelFraire) says: When you log in ther eis literally a window in giant red letters telling you no to enter the buildings - Thu Oct  8 17:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Genesis(Pokemon Bradley) whispers: [notice me] - Thu Oct  8 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||As he charged in, the initial attack misses it's mark, understandably. For all his advantages in terms of physical ability, the warrior known as Maloth still lacked technical skill. So even as his punches hurted, they'd never be able to actually land against a sufficiency fast opponent!

Kirie seemed to fit that description as she effortlessly side-step his blow. Still recoiling, his body turns, and a fierce gaze is casted onto Kirie's frame. Sadly. . . She knew precisely how to battle him. Just as Maloth begins to sprint over in an angered fashion, she goes to use that nifty ass Suiton technique. It was the same as the jutsu Lyala had used to defeat him in battle weeks ago.

Unable to truthfully avoid or evacuate the area, the brute steps into the sticky syrup puddle. Things wouldn't have been so bad had someone saw it fit to teach Maloth the art of Suimen. For shame, he hadn't known the technique, thus as his foot sinks in, the syrup tethers his appendage to the ground. "Hng! Not stupid thin' 'gain!" the fiend roared with annoyance. Perhaps he should have kept things restricted solely to Taijutsu.

Hastily, he's pulling away in hopes of dislodging his foot from the syrup trap itself. Yet it would not budge. In time, the brute opts to use his Demonic hammer, even as it propeled him to do more sinister things. It's risen above his hand and slams harshly into the ground. A smart plan, no? Even if the syrup remained stuck to his feet, would it even matter if the ground was dislodged enough to allow movement?

His attention briefly leaves Kirie. Relentless, the ground of Kumogakure is forced to endure the might of the behemoth. Each blow is thunderous, sending shockwaves of sound around the region. And of course, it's systematically breaking apart the rocky terrain, forming rocks here or there. Veins are popping out of his frame, making it clear that a lot of effort was being employed for the sequence.* - Thu Oct  8 17:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: .! - Thu Oct  8 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And that's all she wrote. Kirie had exploited his weaknesses.  Just as the ground was being broken up, he catches wind of Kirie making her approach on over the syrup trap. Somehow, someway, she had negated the negative effect of the sticky substance. As such, Maloth is unable to get out of the way once the water continues to pour, encasing him in a dome of water. It constricts movement.

Even with Maloth's great deal of strength, nothing can allow him to break through. Before long, it was apparent that the trap served another purpose, which was to strip him of any oxygen. After all, even with someone being as durable as himself, in the end if you lacked oxygen, your body began to shut down. Not panicking, he builds up a mass of chakra and pumps it towards his brain.

As per usual, this allows Maloth to enter is first state of power. Sadly, the flow of chakra wasnt' relevant enough to disrupt the water prison -- at least not yet. Someday, however, it would reach that thresh hold. Regardless of the chakra flowage, the brute's strength is unable to outdo the power of the water dome, and soon after he's fading fast. Eventually, it's time to call it quits.

"Hng! Hate fight thin' like this. . . Maloth nee' work hard," the brute states, gesturing for Kirie to let down the prison. . . Well, gesture is a strong word. He simply beckons for it. Assuming she complies, he alllows the chakra state gate to subside. 

Even then, however, it drains a considerable amount of stamina, and leaves his body a bit sore. There was still a lot of work needed to be done in order to achieve the true power. . . By now, Kirie had simply made one thing apparent. Being a giant, brutish warrior wasn't enough. He still needed to work harder than ever from the looks of it.* - Thu Oct  8 18:31:28 2015

They're at himself, for not having the skill set required to defend against these unorthodox techniques. "Hng. . Is good figh'. . . Maloth jus' need learn be mo' fast an' stuff," he replies before moving on over to the mountain and leaning against the wall. He stares forward, wondering what to do next.* - Thu Oct  8 18:40:51 2015
