<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Carrying wood? A simple mission and something perfectly fit for the barbarian/viking to accomplish. It was a mission that wouldn't require much thought, and was more or less based on his physical strength. Luckily enough, the caravan of wood is settled right below the mountain. Quickly, using his refined muscles, Maloth takes ahold of the handle.

With hastiness, he's speeding along the rocky terrain of Kumogakure. 

Ba-bump! Save for a few shakes here or there, there's really no actual obstacles. In time, following the map that was in the scroll -- 'cause yes, Maloth could at least read a map, the 'Genin' eventually makes way around the netire village. Every few minutes, there's a brief stop to let off the cargo of wood. Each crater is heavy, but of course, considering his massive levels of strength, releasing them isn't something difficult to do.

The recipients are typically overjoyed and offer praise for both his physique and work ethic. Time and time again, the brute navigates around the village, repeating the same process. On the fifteen different order, it seems that all of the wood eventually had been delivered, prompting the brute to move back -- retracing his steps. Given another half hour of brisk walking, Maloth is coming back to the base of the mountain.

And what would you know. Khalil was right there, as if waiting on the behemoth for one reason or another. Casually, the hulking fiend places two hands on Khali's hips, lifting him upward and prancing off to the top of the mountain. "'Lo. Jus' finish mission."* - Sun Oct 11 21:06:20 2015

THeir last battle had ended in a crushing defeat on the Yamanshi's part. . .And no doubt, things were going to end the same if Maloth had anything to say about. After wasting a few seconds to enter a stance, the brute rushes forward, his feet stomping harshly onto the ground and leaving depressions along the ground. "We go!" declared the fiend, clearly having on intent on making this battle go on longer than necessary.

Like a bull, he's charging and once close? The giant's shoulder dips forward, aiming to ram against Khalil's chest-- with moderate force. Considering the size difference, Maloth can quite clearly crush the male, so he's mindful of holding back on his power. If struck, there was enough force to send Khalil skidding back, perhaps even enough to force him onto the pavement or floor.* - Sun Oct 11 21:51:34 2015

Body too stron'!" the gargantuan warrior yelled in triumph, his head canted towards the heavens admist the senseless yelling. He's feeling good, sure enough. . . Then Khalil is getting back up and sprinting forward, even as the brute's gaze is off.

The laughter was to continue, up until a bump could be felt against his chest.  How cute. . . The Yamanashi' strike hardly phases the thick-skinned beast, and more or less felt like a baby punch. Looking downward, the brute stares ahead, wearing a slick grin. "Is all can do.  .?" Having no secondary comment, on instict, Maloth's palm thrusts ahead, hoping to strike the center of the femboy's chest to knock air out of his body and send him flying.* - Sun Oct 11 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The battle continued to be as onesided as conceiveably possible. Khalil simply did not have the tools to defeat Maloth -- atl east not yet. Just as the boy is rising, the brute falls back into his normal stance, waiting for his opponent to again make an approach. Just as the last time, it's Khalil using those powerful, yet ultimate ineffective, kicks. Multiple strikes clash against the giant's form, and time and time again. . . they prove to do nothing more than force a chortle from teh beast's form. He found the entire thing endearing.

The Yamanshi was like the little engine that could. With the last kick coming -- the Heel Drop -- Maloth's massive right hand shoots up, grabbng the teen by the ankle. Had that been successful, the giant breaks into a spin, using his strength to carry Khalil along with the momentum.  For several revolutions, the femboy's frame would be rotated.* - Sun Oct 11 22:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) |||After a few revolutions, he allows his grip to be released, thus sending Khalil flying. 

"Hahaha!--" It was by then that Khalil had surrendered, making it clear that the battle was over. There was a slight and brief frown, as Maloth was actually getting some enjoyment out of the battle. .  Even if it was one-sided as hell. These victories felt good, especially if you considered the fact of how often Maloth would lose in the past while in this village.

Finally. . his body was developing. "Okay. We go. . " He moves, grabbing Khalil by the hips once more, and hoisting the boy up like a trophy. Into the distance the two went in order to gain credit for a mission completion.* - Sun Oct 11 23:14:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) followed closely behind Khalil, still believing that the man was a female in ways.

That was the only explanation. In time, Maloth reaches the local bar, and plants his rear onto the chair. The wooden structure crunches about, and wobbles, barely able to maintain or support the massive weight that came with the brute taking a seat.* - Sun Oct 11 23:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) downs another bottle.

Clearly, he's more than capable of handling his alcohol due to his upbringing. After drinking another shot, Maloth looks ahead, wondering how well Khalil was holding up.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: An' yes. Li' hair. - Mon Oct 12 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

"Is hear right."* - Mon Oct 12 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bremusa(Ej247) says: Hmm. - Mon Oct 12 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: . . . - Mon Oct 12 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Come! - Mon Oct 12 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looks ahead dryly as Bremusa makes her approach. The brute remains standing stroicly, unafraid and honestly unconcerned with the treat that Bremusa may have been able to dish out. Before long, it was apparent that the woman also excelled in Taijutsu, just as Maloth had. Hell, she even used familiar tehcnique -- the Dynamic Entry. But, it does very little to aid in her cause. As the kick crashes against his chest, she'd find that she'd be unable to really harm.

In fact, it was like running into a brick wall.

Consequently, the amazon is being bounced off with ease. "Hah! Is all got!? Come mo' hard! Get partner, Maloth no care!" He says, gesturing to Khalil. The brute had to display his cominance over the two women -- even if one was acutally a male. It was the way of things, as both parties would eventually evolve or develop into being valued members of his pack. . . albeit, treated as second class citizens and thralls.* - Mon Oct 12 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: No... thanks. - Mon Oct 12 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I don't want to join. - Mon Oct 12 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) thinks: He hits too hard. - Mon Oct 12 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) talked casually as he schooled Bremusa in the art of battle.

Just as she entered a boxer stance, so does Maloth. Even with Breumusa's beefy frame, he knows better than to use his full power. Instead, each punch is going to be held back to about half strength. Speedily, his hands break off into a blurring combo, the likes of which goes to slam against the center of her chest -- three hits in general. Hit or miss, the brute eventually breaks into a rotation, sending a kick towards the woman's ankles.

If struck, she'd find sudden momentum attacking at her lower body, intent on knocking her over. "Is nee' get more tough, Khalil! An' say do what Maloth say. . . 'Cause win! Is slave o' Maloth, no?" He says expectantly. Rules were rules, were they not?* - Mon Oct 12 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: -- - Mon Oct 12 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) thinks: Damn it... he used the slave card. - Mon Oct 12 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) doesn't make any further moves. Both arms are folded, and the brute takes a step back. "Is done. . ?"

A glance is given towards Khalil -- and it's stern in nature. He wasn't kidding when he figured the young femboy had to do what he was told. "Is no stron'! Not e'en mo' strong than Khalil!" Maloth states in a snide, yet playful tone. Was this the true strength of amazon?

"No see how people can keep man for slave. .. Is weak too much. . "* - Mon Oct 12 03:53:23 2015
