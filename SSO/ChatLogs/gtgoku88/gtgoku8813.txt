<br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) sat there with his legs spreaded out. He say Khalil running, albeit didn't really mind it. In no time, the much smaller taijutsu warrior hops onto his frame, giving a mighty hug. The simple collision forces the soreness on his body to react negatively, but Maloth doesn't body to show it. A single arm moves, wrapping an arm already Khalil's waist. 

"'Lo. How be?" He says, mildly surprised that his companion had been this overjoyed, enough to hug him even while smelly and sweaty.* - Fri Oct 23 20:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: That's the thing. - Fri Oct 23 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||He wears a giant grin.

Had Khalil not truly known the extent of his Hachimon formation? Eager to show off, Maloth sprints away, a hand gesturing for the Yamanshi to wait. At a faster rate than normal, he moves off into the horizon, his body going towards some of the rubble that still existed along the village's border.

Using his muscular frame, two nicely sized boulders are carried ontop of Maloth's shoulder. In no time at all, he's returning with body-sized, rocky constructions. They're smacked right in the middle of the square, their form cracking and being riddled with fissures.


He smiles again, turning to face Khalil -- who presumably had waited patiently. "First show how stron' Maloth be. .  normal. . " A right arm is cocked back, each muscle tensed and contracting. Clearly, he was buildig up a high amount of momentum, and preparing to knock this thing out the park. In no time, the arm is sent forward, the fist colliding harshly against the boulder. Given his herculean strength, the blow is more than enough to force the construction to be sent back in recoil, easily sliding a good five feet.

On impact, shards of rock come cascading off, leaving a fist-sized hole along the exterior. The depth being a simply three inches. Remarkably, the attack didn't harm MAloth's own structure, as his bones were far too dense, and the muscle cells far too rigid and used to pain to actually be phased. Several more punches are delivered in succession, each one borderline being a blur to the naked eye, given Maloth's rapid improvement in terms of attack speed.

Time and time again, the results were the same, each one destroying a greater portion of the boulder. Having done such, the behemoth moves on, displaying his less than stellar speed. One leg follows the other, each time pushing off the ground to propel his body forward. It goes in a circular route, and only reaches a max of fourty-five miles per hour. Pitiful rates of speed.

He does two laps, before falling back at the start position, his devious grin only manifesting further. "Now. . ." Internally, the chakras in his body were about growing more potent or vibrant. Effortlessly, Maloth breaks off, achieving the first gate, and easily knocking off the second one soon after. In this state, his power skyrockets, and his body has access to a larger pool of stamina reserves. Wastign no time, the brute steps forward, and demonstrates his punching ability once more.

On this occasion, as the punch lands, the boulder is absolutely shattered. The entire body shakes, as if the inanimate object had gain some sentience. Seconsds later, it's speeding through the atmosphere, crashing against the ground. That punch, coupled with the collision on the floor had effectively taken out about half of the boulder's mass. Having put on display his might, Maloth finally depowers down, exhaling as he does so. "See? Ne'er see how Maloth get tire fast? Is 'cause use mo' power."* - Fri Oct 23 22:48:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: See, you should teach me how to do that Maloth! - Sat Oct 24 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Is try Maloth gues. - Sat Oct 24 01:47:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Now, is it possible for me to learn? - Sat Oct 24 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods along. He was certainly willing to teach Khalil the basis for the Hachimon Formation. It seemed the young lass would have to start from the bottom. "'Kay. . For do this. . .Take have strong min' an' BODY! We start on mind. . . The brute declared."

From there, Maloth takes a seat, motioning for Khalil to take a seat just next to him. Legs were crossed, and his eyes close shut, allowing his mind to drift and gain a higher level of focus. -- Also, before beginning, he brings out a convenient chart, that details the chakra nodes. The one specific for the first gate is noted, and highlighted with a marker.

"For start. . .Build chakras. . . Push for place Maloth show. . . Point for do is no give to mucha chakra. No! Point for be. . . Make will. . . Mind powah mo' stron'. Force break. . ." The behemoth instructed gently. His words weren't as articulate as you would likely want -- but it served the purpose. Hopefully, Khalil -- with all the time spent with the lovable lug -- would be capable of detailing just what the brute had meant to convey.

And basically? It was pretty simple.

He simply instructed her to pool together the chakras towards that specific point. Once in place, it was Khalil's will that was meant to break the first shackles, and unleash his vast quantity of chakra and stored bodily ability. Assuming the Yamanshi understood, Maloth nodded, giving more needed information.

"Not onl' thing. . For be good. Nee' train body lot. . Push for limit. 'Cause this? Is go more far than limit! So bod' nee' be read' fo' workin' more hardah and stron'!" Simple. To be ready for the first gate, your body needed to be in tiptop shape. After all, if not, how else could you expect to be ready to go b eyond your normal limitations and not harm yourself?* - Sat Oct 24 02:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's brow remained furrowed with aggitation. He didn't like this woman's game at all. For all intents and purposes, the brute fully believed that Baylea had set him up in a trap to be eaten. Now? She was backing away like a coward.

Such was the consequence of being a slow warrior. Perhaps Maloth ought of invest within ninja weapons. He certainly had the strength for it.

"Then why 'fraid? And why come for Maloth village??"* - Sat Oct 24 21:57:07 2015

"Lo. . . Person Maloth see in Konohoho! Is figh' friend! Friend try eat Maloth! Ne'er wan' see man in here. If do. . . Will kill," the brute warns. He certainly wasn't playing either.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

"Give bes' try! No' think can e'en hur' Maloth!" His skin was beyond normal human capacity. He still fully believed her to be the weakling he had defeated a month ago.* - Sat Oct 24 22:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: This is going to be hard.. - Sat Oct 24 22:13:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) whispers: Why so 'fraid? If no can win, nee' get beat! - Sat Oct 24 22:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) folded his arms. He didn't care.

There had been no one that boasted the strength needed to fully get past his defense -- nor anyone that could legitimately go toe to toe with him in close combat. Maloth had gotten arrogant, and it showed. Arms folded, he scoffs, motioning the dark skinned warrior forward.* - Sat Oct 24 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: He'll feel my new found power this time.. - Sat Oct 24 22:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) remained stationary.  There was legitimately nothing to fear, at least from his perspective. A giant, predatory grin is worn, even as the curved woman leapt into the sky. Of course, Maloth was no battle strategist. Thus, he doesn't notice, nor really care about the used  gravity to amplify her strike. Instead, once Baylea had proced on a downward free fall, he moves to act.

The giant's right hand latches ahead, in hopes of wrapping around the woman's armpits. Likewise, success or not, his left hand is sending a crosschop right towards the woman's waist, intent on dealing a high degree of concussive damage.

Of course, the attack from Baylea probably would land. It strikes against Maloth's upper shoulder, yet rather than cutting through, the damage is akin to a papercut as the male's skin proves to be far too rugged. * - Sat Oct 24 22:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Indeed. Baylea had the clear advantage in terms of reflexive ability, yet Maloth wasn't exactly a slouch. The second she's moving, every muscle in the beast's body tense, bolstering his body's defense.. .  But also making it in a more primed condition to attack.

Indeed, the second Baylea's first strike had gonet hrough, the brute was moving to make a counter. GIving that he couldn't endure the strike, and hardly moves, the right hand juts forward, aiming to grab the girl along the forearm.

In addition to such, his left fist is sent ahead, aiming to punch her square in the chest.* - Sat Oct 24 22:31:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: This isn't..good.. - Sat Oct 24 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Gosh..diggity..darnit.. - Sat Oct 24 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And that was all she wrote,.

Baylea would find that Maloth's grip was absolute, unwilling to budge or compromise. In this world, there wasn't many individuals that could ever hope of breaking free from his iron-cladded grasp. ". . .Thought is say. . . get stronger. . ." the warrior replies. 

He was grinning sinisterly.

"Is over!" From there, assuming he can take her katana given the low range of motion, Maloth tosses it away. The free arm moves, wrapping about her waist and pulling her into a tight bear hug.She'd be able to feel the bones in her body beginning to give out -- albeit they would barely manage to keep their stability. 

After a few moment's of holding her in this position, the brute's body leaps a bit, before acrobatically rotating in the air. In the end, Baylea would find herself being faced towards the ground -- and the work of gravity does the rest. She'd effectively be piledrived into the earth, rock flying upward and a dust cloud surrounding the region.  As it cleared, Maloth stood victorious, with Baylea remarkably clinging to life.

Albeit, she was probably too damage or injured to move.

"Su. . .Plex. . . Ci-ty."* - Sat Oct 24 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) goes to dust the residual dirt off his shoulder.

"Is all. . " Casually, a massive hand moves to grasp Baylea by her locks. With a grip, she's lifted and tossed over the beast's shoulder. 

"Is prisono now. . . We wait. For bea' up 'ther thing."* - Sat Oct 24 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. His ego was rising.

"Yes. . .Is easy for win. Know be. . ." With that, he nods, motioning for Khalil to follow. No issue here, he'd simply go to place the necromancer within a cell so that they could decide what to do with her later.* - Sat Oct 24 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) tossed her limp body onto a mattress within the cells.

"Is done. . " Casually, the brute makes way towards the exit -- but stops before going. Even someone as dimwitted as Maloth could recall the proper procedure. A hand naps towards Khalil. 

"Tie up. An' check for weapons o' 'ther thingums.."* - Sat Oct 24 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: You want me to tie her up? - Sat Oct 24 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) whispers: An' search. - Sat Oct 24 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: ..I..I don't wanna. - Sat Oct 24 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) whispers: Why - Sat Oct 24 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: Because, what if she hurts me? - Sat Oct 24 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He shook his finger, disappointed in Khalil's cowardice.

Of course, there wasn't a lot of time to waste. Producing a short Kunai knife, Maloth does a single swipe. It cuts through each bit of fabric, exposing Baylea's body -- and ensuring that there were no secret weapons or scrolls hidden.

To further sate curiosity, the giant goes to grasp around the swordwoman's ankles. She's lifted upside down, and shaken. Alas, presuming nothing is discovered, Baylea is tossed back onto the mattress in the nude, then wrapped up thoroughly -- in chains.

"We come back later. When wake. . . So can fin' person that try eat Maloth."* - Sat Oct 24 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) whispers: Not nee' be scare. Is here with Maloth. - Sat Oct 24 23:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: Hhmph, bet you like seeing her naked. - Sat Oct 24 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks. Was this actually happening?

He places a hand onto Khalil's shoulder, and beckons the feminine figure back. If resisted, Maloth would simply toss the much smaller Yamanshi over his shoulder and head back towards the entrance of the cell.

"Is prisoner now. Where be 'Shoji'?"* - Sat Oct 24 23:17:20 2015

He was a warrior at heart -- and every good warrior knew you were suppose to nip the problem in the bud. After all. . . This was the same woman that Maloth had suspected to be trying to kill him just a month prior. 

-- Baylea's comment does bring a lot of thought, however.

The Necromancer wasn't just a danger to him. . . After all, Maloth could protect himself. But what of the people that he held dear? The people, that -- as she mentioned -- he'd 'give his life to protect.' A hand grasps onto the hammer. 

"'Fore Maloth come do thing. . . Tell he. What purpose be 'fore travel? Purpose for. . .  test streng' an' 'tack people."* - Sun Oct 25 00:00:51 2015

He wasn't going to give Baylea the chance nor satisfaction to even lay a finger on anyone that Maloth held dear. Swiftly, the brute's grasp of the hammer tightens and chakra funnels along every point of his body -- empowering it. Taking a step forward, with a single mighty swing, he aims to slam the hilt against her chest, hopefully caving it in.

The strike held a greater amount of force, enough that the momentum was carried beyond her body. It forces signifiacnt depressions to develop along the ground.* - Sun Oct 25 00:20:28 2015

"Not chance Maloth 'ble take. . .Have people care mo' 'bout! Need keep tribe safe!" the beast of a warrior declared. 

Considering the activation of his gates, every muscle in the brute's body flared, strengthing and greatly empowering his body beyond the norm. There's a massive grimace being worn all the same, and he mean mugs the devious Necromancer through it all. There isn't a hint of remorse, as the brute very much believes that he's in the right.

The strike held a greater amount of force, enough that the momentum was carried beyond her body. It forces signifiacnt depressions to develop along the ground. The room itself shook from the aftershock, a testiment to the brute's immense level of strength.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||At last. . the brute had returned from his swift and effortless execution of the Necromancer -- Baylea. 

--And there was quite a bit of commotion occuring around the scene. Hordes of troops hadgathered, preparing to deal with a threat. Fighting through the crowd, it isn't long before the beast's gaze falls onto a familiar face -- Shoji. "Is try eat Maloth!" He roars at the top of his voice, still enraged and eager to get vengence.

With a sword in hand, the behemoth rushes ahead, seeing nothing but red.

The troops nearby seek to alert Maloth of the arriving threat -- meaning Edge and company. . .  Sadly, all warnings fall on deaf ears. "TIME FOR  BEAT TO MUD!"* - Sun Oct 25 01:49:13 2015

Why was this man so fast? Quickly, he kicks off into the first and second state of Hachimon, greatly improving his speed as he sprinted -- still ignorant and uncaring of the arriving forces.

"S-Sir! Ch-Chief! There are--"

"NO CARE! MALOTH KILL!" The brute roared, his voice sending echos throughout the valley. Although, it was hard to hear it over the screams of the crowd. Quickly, the brute was heading on towards the west, his eyes never leaving Shoji, despite how speedy the Ghoul may have been.* - Sun Oct 25 01:57:45 2015

He re-merges outside, eying Shoji -- presuming the Ghoul could be seen. The brute looked ahead, still not caring for the storm of troops that were within -- and now suddenly attacking.

The second Shoji leapt forward, the brute's body pivoted, dipping a bit towards the right to avoid being grappled. On that moment, his sword -- that belonged to Baylea -- whips forward, holding surprising quickness. It's intent on striking through the Ghoul's neck.

Even if the brute lacked actual proficiency with swords, the strike itself was fairly swift, enough to complete behead a normal man.

Hit or miss, the brute is back tracking, keeping his body away from the tendrils, and swiping to severe them as well. He recalled the battle too vividly in the past, and thus remained wary of any acidics that would leap ahead.* - Sun Oct 25 02:18:14 2015

He pokes it a few times. "Know no' dead! Stop lie for Maloth!" He takes a fist, and begins to absolutely pulverize the demonic presence, his hand being coveredi n blood due to the brutish attacks. Having done the deed, the brute turns, giving a nod to Emiko. 

"---Oh. . .Think be 'tacks! Liddle gir' not use for figh'! So nee' leave. . ." the behemoth instructs, still giving out his sexist commands.

Powering down, Maloth jogs over, occasionally giving a stiff forearm to the opposing troops that came to attack, although with futility as it came to him. ". . . .What happens. . .?!"* - Sun Oct 25 02:25:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Amidst his focus being on defeating and killing the Ghoul -- Shoji -- he's unable to really grasp the situation at hand towards the back.

Surprised, his eyes open widely as the shadow is casted over his frame. Mystified, the stand-in Raikage looked ahead. Sadly, however, it was too little too late. He wasn't swift, nor fast to react and thus the statue catches him off guard.

Doing it's thing, it apparently gains rock-like quanities, and entraps all of those within range. Held in captivity, the brute is swift to to panic. Hammer in hand, he's rushing ahead, slamming it against any exterior that could be conjured. Certainly, there would -faint- cracks, but alas. . . Maloth lacked the overall strength to break free.

However, knowing how hard-headed this guy could be, the lack of progress isn't one to deter him. Continously, his arms swung, allowing the demonic, huevo-spawned weapon to repeatily smash along the the prison.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The area lit up, like one giant ass fire cracker.

Even someone as stupid as Maloth could determine one thing. 

This. Wasn't. Good. At. All. 

In a frenzy, his head swiveled around, scanning the area for any living person. His eyes eventually set on Emiko, the young gal that had aided in the defeat of the Ghoul, and one that was instructed to flee. Speedily, his body closes the distance between himself and her small frame.

Possessively, once in range, both massive arms move to wrap about the blond's body. Considering the ridiculous size different, Maloth's body is able to serve as a proper meat shield, enduring the vicious explosions and onslaught of sharpened weapons that came from the statue's interior. He'd grunt for several minutes, as even with his sturdy frame, there came a mass of pain from the repeated strikes. 

Thankfully, it seemed that his body was actually rigid enough to endure all of the blows. The light from before fades, giving way to smoke that lingered. It proceeded to dissipate, and as that clear the casualities are noted. Several poor souls had succumb to the impressive strike. But all the same. ..  Maloth  persevered. His body suffered first degree burns, and papercut-esque incisions. Standing tall, an almost fatherly gaze befalls Emiko.

"Is tell get 'way! Nee' listen. . . " Hopefully the statue falls down. From there, he exits, giving a glance as the village again suffers its losses.* - Sun Oct 25 03:01:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||As the battle waged on, Kumogakure continued to suffer loss after loss.

It was just within a matter of hours that the bloodshed had reach it's climax. Save for the entities that huddled below the mansion, every other soldier in the military had been slain.

The roars of war had subsided, giving way to gentle whispers. The wind flowed elegently, painting a peaceful picture, despite the vicious violence that these lands had just played host too. It isn't long before the Canine-Statue proceeds to subside, allowing for view of Edge andh is lackie, Rymei.

Of course, to this end, Maloth's gaze remained on the sole survivor, Emiko. The red-headed girl he had placed his life on the line to protect. ". . .'Member voice. . . No get. Why is--" His voice was steadily rising in rage. Even if his life was presumably being spared, the brute was overcome with anger and sorrow. The troops, fodder or not, were under -his- jurisdiction. He was a chief, leader of the army, and thus it was understandable that a War Chief would feel some type of war.

Alass, Rymei had worked intelligently, attacking the weakness that hung over Maloth's head from start to finish. Genjutsu.

Feathers spawn, and as they spread along, it pushes him into a state of slumber. He would gradually close his eyes, each cell in his body losing mobility before. . .

Still asleep, he's left defenseless as the mysterious entity, Lulu, makes her approach. The water promptly rushes ahead from her maw, enveloping his bulky body without a problem. 

Held in suspension, the beast is deprived on oxygen.

Sadly, the root seal is in full effect, binding each of his movements, and making it impossible for any resistance to be had. Add that with the fact that he was in a genjutsu-induced slumber, the sturdy warrior isn't able to do a thing. Seconds go on, evolving into minutes. Each tick along the sand of time serving one purpose -- to limit just how much longer the brute had to live.

Given six minutes or so of being submerged underneath the water, every bit of vitality Maloth possessed had been expended. He had no glamarous death, nor even the time to lament on his shortcomings. Hell, the beast hadn't even a moment to spare to grieve over the lost of his loved ones. 

In his peaceful decline, the giant's soul eventually transcends the mortal plane and fades off into the next world. Briefly, the brute looked on, both admiring and regretting the bloodshed. Today had been a day of great victories, and terrible losses. It's just unfortunate that the final loss was on Maloth.
