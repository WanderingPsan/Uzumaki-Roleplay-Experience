<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) seems to be aggitated for one reason or another. Eventually, Maloth turns towards the south and stomps off. What better way to relieve stress/aggression than to train? None, that's what. 

Once out of range, he turns towards the west.* - Sun Sep 27 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Again and again. .  He had lost something held dear. The first blow in Maloth's life came as a result of his clansmen practically killing themselves. The next? Amai's murder. And finally, I bright you to the wanton killing of the Akimichi -- Flexus. The former two had been by the hand of the same man, Baen. 

No longer would Maloth continue to sit about, allowing his own strength to plateau. Now? The brute had to bring his level of strength to new heights, to surpass the limits or shackles that mother nature had bestowed upon his genetically gifted frame. A vein popped from his the brute's head, and by now -- if it wasn't clear before -- his motivation is soaring. 

Finally, as the giant slide his feet across the road, he eventually reaches the emptied training ground. "MALOTH ANGRY! NOT LET KEEP BE WEAK! BAD THING NOT HAPPEN MALOTH  'NYMORE WHEN WEAK NOT BE!" His neck is bulging, and the veins along his body grow more prevalant or noticeable. 

He begins the sequence by first gathering a series of boulders around the area. Luckily, in Konoha's not-to-distant destruction, much of the debris still lingered about the landscape. Some of which was in the form of enlarged chunks of rock. Using this as a 'training' exercise, as well as preparation for additional exercises. "Hng!" Two mighty hands press against the opposite end of the first boulder, allowing his arms to eventually wrap around the earthly object. Using every ounce of muscle in his body, the former-barbarian is eventually enabled to lift-- although it's a struggle from start to finish. In the beginnings, Maloth's body trembled from head to toe, his arms wobbling to just lift the heavy thing a few feet.

Having gotten it about two feet into the air, the warrior scrambles, shuffling his feet to swiftly place his 'tool' in the center of the field. Just that alone leaves the monster covered in sweat, and his internal organs overheating. Fatigue toxin gushed out in galloons, forcing an uncomfortable, yet pleasing burning sensation to overtake his arms and leg muscles. The cells in those appendages throbbed considering the microscopic breakdown that had occured, and soon these same organic machines were repairing themselves to force Maloth's body to be rebuilt -- in a stronger capacity.

For the next fifteen minutes, he repeats himself. Very briefly does the 'shinobi' takes a break. And shinobi is a strong word, considering Katsune had simply taken advantage of his immense stupidity to make Maloth a grunt. Nevertheless, after the alloted time, all three boulders are side to side, ready for the pickings. "Need. . . Keep get strongah. . . 'ready see. . Maloth for so tired. Bu'. . .Not 'nough train. Need go harder."

Already, the simpleton was beating it into his own brain -- whatever his body could do now. . . it simply was -not- good enough. No matter what his current limitations were, they would have to be completely shattered. And should his body reach the absolute, natural capacity? Then even that would be completely evaporated, up until the point that his frame had reached super-human levels.

". . .Know one move. . But make move bes' in word."

Amazing, he's quite speedy -- at least for someone of his size. Like a rhino, Maloth begins to charge. His body is initially erect, but eventually it descends into a half-crouch as a full-head of steam is obtained. He's moving at speeds that could rival a common track star, and without another thought, the brute leaps and extends a leg forward. His body is held in a perfect, flawless formed, ninety degree angle. The other appendage is tucked, allowing for a strangely efficient aerodynamic nature. 

"ARRGHHHH!!" this is the battle cry that will pierce the heavens. It roars about, leaving an incredibly loud echo that rings through the area. Birds in the distance pick up on the disturbance, prompting their wings to kick into action, and thus granting them the ability to flee. 

In three seconds flat, however, Maloth eventually kicks the leftmost boulder. It does budge a single inch, yet there is a definite crack left on the surface. Sadly, as the force was unable to break through, the bulk is bounced back into the behemoth's frame. Had he not been a sturdy motherfucker, there was a high risk that his bones may have been completely and utterly-- nah, just fractured.  As Brandy would say, if at first you don't succeed, brush it all off and try again.

For the next half hour that ensued, the beserker is rushing back and forth, practicing his 'Dynamic Entry' in hopes of mastering it to perfection. In these half an hour, each of the three boulders are forced to endure abuse, each time cracking a bit, but never having enough damage done to comprise their existence. Maloth's muscles are left sore -- but they cry for more abuse and punishment, willing the ambition beast to continue in his endeavors.

One may call him a crazy man, but the entire notion of 'going beyond your limit' wasn't something foreign to Maloth. His tribemen were often known for doing so-- although many just chalked it off as legend. "Must. . .go fastah. Must. . . go strongah. . ." he says in between pants. Sadly, it would seem that today, the taijutsu minded warrior would be unable to go beyond his limits. There was always next time, right?* - Sun Sep 27 11:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had been gone for well over an hour. 

After the initial training involving the refinement of his dynamic entry ability, Maloth spent the bulk of his time refining the body's muscles. It was rare that someone as physically dominant as him would feel overwhelmed -- yet here he was, feeling as his arms, legs, and pectorals were ready to leap off his body. Perhaps to find a new host, one that was less insane and hardworking as Maloth. Of course, considering the effort applied, the brute is covered in a nice viel of dry sweat, though some parts of his body held some moisture.

Stench is clear, but he doesn't give a shit. By then, the brute slinks on over to the mansion, and gives a glance towards each of the individuals in the areas, starting with Yumiko, and ending on Sabo. -- An opinion had been formed on each, even if they didn't say or do anything. .

Silently, the hulking beast meanders towards a nearby tree, presses his back against it, and slides down. Eyes occasionally close, and the energies within Maloth's body swirled. To achieve the desired result, it took more than just pushing your body to the brink of collapsing. Nay, you had to hold a certain level of mental competency --- yes, I know that's a stretch for someone that's as simpleminded as Maloth. 

Thankfully, this 'competency' wasn't a mental attribute based on intellect, or worldly knowledge. It was one that embodied your consciousness, or quite frankly . . . Your will. If there was a will, there was a way -- an avenue to push beyond the simple limits the natural world would have you endure for the rest of your life.  "Not be 'tent. . . Go strongah. . " he thinks to himself.

The dark-skinned fiend eventually builds up enough chakra that swirls in his brain. It targets a specific point, a single, needle-sized node along his body. And the point? To overload it. While the barbarian's brain heated up, that first restraint was cracking. . . Cracking -hard-, yet it would not shatter completely. After some minutes, he ceases, and continues to observe the area.

For the next few minutes, Maloth occasionally retries the sequence, to mix results. Exhaling, the angsty bruiser just looks ahead, wondering why this Erebus fellow wanted to interview Yumiko.* - Sun Sep 27 11:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
After a few minutes of resting, it was time to begin with his next task. Maloth's body still was reeling from the previous training exercise. Sadly, not all of his work had yet been completed. After all, there still existed the mission given a day prior -- to spar and defeat a shinobi of lower rank.

By now, due to all of this time spent in Konoha, Maloth had grown familiar with the hotspots. Thus, finding a shinobi to battle was a trivial task. The question remained, which one was weak enough to be dubbed 'lower rank.' For all of his physical talents, the brute still remained relatively unskilled or raw in nature. Despite this, he still heads off, moving along the road and eventually coming towards the academy. Today was graduation day, and the ceremony had just ended. The titan, casting a shadow on all the new genins, looked down, picking apart the children in the pack.

Ba-bump! Ba-bump! He rolled up on them, his feet clattering and leaving 'big-foot' imprints on the ground. "'Lo. . ." The giant uttered as a form of greeting. His eyes continued to scan through the crowd. "Maloth need peopel fight-- which shinono come fight Maloth?!" His voice booms, and rockets along the atmosphere. It's a bone-chilling tone, and commands the attention of all of those that  lined up in the academy's training grounds. Initially, there is some skepticism, as the brute is an imposing entity and often lacks control in his blows. But eventually, some of the more bold individuals move to the forefront.

As usual, he takes the mission to the extremes. Rather than fighting one lower ranked opponent? Maloth was going to battle several -- and not all of them were push overs either. There's about eight in total, all primed and ready to go toe to toe with the great-- the behemoth, Maloth! All the while, the simpleton provides much needed explanations. The instruction was simple, they had permission to attack all out, but had to avoid attacking with lethal areas towards the brute's vital.

This training was going to be put forth towards pushing him pass the normal limits in effort to achieve the illustrious, Hachimon Formation. Instantly after the instructions had been given, three of the recent graduates charge forward -- two of which were around the age of sixteen. The other was simply a thirteen year old youth, one with a penchent for speed and reaction timing. From all angles, Maloth is being bombarded with physical blows, and even projectile weapons -- but none can seem to do any good. 

Each strike that manages to land earns a chortle. "Not good 'nough! Need hit Maloth more hard! Not ever win this way!" Meanwhile, as the advice is given, the giant is release haymaker after haymaker. Each one is as powerful as the last, but seeks to not much match. . . But to exceed the might or force conjured beforehand. It was a constant sequence that the former barbarian was aiming to apply towards his daily life. To go pass your body's limit, you'd have to be able to consistent reach and maintain that limtation, after all. To prepare your muscle cells for the strain that was to come, once you actually reached the desired goal.

"His body is like a rock! We can't pierce through his defense!" the warriors shouted. The weapons that flung would occasionally knick flesh, but they could never really dig deep enough into his skin to cause much discomfort. As the haymakers are unleashed, the recently graduated genins are caught consistently, the force enough to send their bodies richocheting backwards. It's effortless, and there seems to be NO resistance whatsoever.

Despite the power in the punches, however. Maloth's blows held a severe lack oin speed. Nevertheless, considering that no amount of attacks from the ensemble would do much to his health, he's free to continue to sluggishly strike until one manages to hit its mark. The battle goes on and on for about ten minutes, up until one single opponent remained.

Its clear that the last remaining entity is, for lack of a better word, a freaking nerd. His knees buckled, and legs trembled at the sight of this monstrosity. ". . .Run. . " the dimwit commands. Sadly, the boy is too fear-struck to even move his legs. Instead, he collapses onto his knees and begins to sob. Looking around, it seemed the mission was completed. Casually, Maloth subsequently turns and begins with a stroll.

There was a minimal build up in sweat. Generally, however, his stamina reservoirs were in great condition considering the ease of the win. Why was this a mission again? Upon reaching the mansion, he stares at the Hokage. "Finish thing. . beat lotta people. Need moneys."* - Sun Sep 27 19:35:53 2015
