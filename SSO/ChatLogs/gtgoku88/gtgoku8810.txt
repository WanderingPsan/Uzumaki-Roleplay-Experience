Simultaneously, the brute manages to battle off both of the woman at once. As Khalil comes in for the kick, Maloth again catches his leg before the strike can truthfully make contact. Using that grasp, the shhinobi is capable of lifting Khalil's dainty frame, while taking a step back to distance himself from Bremusa.

As Bremusa's muscled arms wrap about his frame, she'd find that she was unable to really lift him up. Why? A combination of both weight and resistance by Maloth's leg muscles. On cue, Khalil's body is tossed afterwards, right onto Bremusa, all with the intent on making the two women fall onto the floor, saddled ontop of one another.  "Hahaha! Nee' train with chother! No Maloth!" Weaklings train with weaklings.* - Mon Oct 12 04:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. The woman just did not know when to give up. Maloth's body stands still for a bit, taking the punches with ease.

As the last is coming, the brute speeds up ahead, aided in part by his access to the Hachimon FOrmation. In this state, hopefully he's speedy enough to get to the woman's rear. Assuming he can, both arms rush out, wrapping underneath the woman's arm pits, and intersecting behind the neck. 

A full Nelson!

"The Maloth Lock! Ne'er able break this!" He roars, confident that this hold was no going to be defeated. If the grapple is locked on, he's shaking the amazon wildly in hopes to demoralize her, and rid the woman of her sexist thoughts. . . This way, Maloth's own sexist and partially elitist view of the world would reign supreme!* - Mon Oct 12 04:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. Where was that woman going?

"Stay. Nee' get mo' tough. From now on, is battle Bremusa. Bremusa is battle Khalil," he says, making it clear that these two were no match for him just yet. From there, Maloth continues to choke the amazon out with the Full Nelson. Surely, she'd succumb to the stress and give up, no?* - Mon Oct 12 04:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) releases her.

"Hahaha! Is too weak for Maloth," he says, watching Bremusa inevitably fell onto the floor out of exhaustion. His ego was soaring by this point, as he had yet to take an L in well. . . Months. Finally, Maloth was winning the majority of his battles, simply because most people lacked the firepower to actually hurt him.* - Mon Oct 12 04:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Okay, good. - Mon Oct 12 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) turns, following at Khalil.

He's staring at the femboy like he's a piece of meat. . .Because honestly, the Yamanshi is. At least now that Maloth felt that he held authority over the much smaller, fragile and feminine figure. In no time, the brute is caught up, and using a massive reach, a hand creeps down, resting on the abnormally ample bum of the 'woman.' 

"Why is frown?" 

He does the act nonchalantly as it's typical in his culture. The dominant men were entitled to do what they pleased with the women. . .Or those built like Khalil in some cases.* - Mon Oct 12 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinks.

"'Cause can do," he says, still skeptical of the frown Khalil wore. Maloth's hand never moves, and he gestures for the Yamanshi to lead the way, still casually squishy his mitts every so often. 

"Is still see frown. Why is?" the brute would inquire while following behind the much smaller taijutsu specialist.* - Mon Oct 12 05:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
"Jus' wan' kno' why is do frown 'fore," he says, curious as to why Khalil had made that displeased facial expression.

One last, strong grip is given -- and given Maloth's strength, it's pretty rigid. "--Hrm? Do 'cause can. Is 'fore long to MAloth. Is girly, so Maloth wan' do. This be how happens in tribe. Is more stron' an' more big, so can. Bu' is 'lso protector," he notes, as his caste of barbarians were known for being defensive of their 'property.'* - Mon Oct 12 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) was visibly surprised as the young shinobi rushed over and gave the wall of muscle a hug. 

"Huh? What sorry 'bout?" Maloth asks, confused as Khalil had failed to explain what exactly he had done wrong. The imbecile still didnt' even realize why the teen had been frowning just a few moments prior.* - Mon Oct 12 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts.

He hated that and continued to move behind Khalil, his eyes falling over the male's form. "Nee' tell Malot. . . No like keep secret."* - Mon Oct 12 05:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: Fine, I like you Maloth.. - Mon Oct 12 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: As in a girl liking a boy, so they would be together. BUT. You don't even know what I am talking about. - Mon Oct 12 05:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. He knew exactly what Khalil was talking about. "Is sense make," Maloth notes, looking over his own form. A hand rises, showcasing his impressive and unnatural physique. This was the body of a man bred for one thing; to fight and to destroy. 

"Is stron'. Is how be all time, liddle ladies 'lways like stron' man. Is jus' like lady," he says, referencing Khalil's apparent gender, even if he was actually a made. "Is good do like. Since be undah' Maloth," he notes with a chortly.* - Mon Oct 12 05:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: -- Wait, I don't like you because of your body... I mean, that's sexy but.. - Mon Oct 12 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: You always make me laugh... and your personality.... and the way you treat me. - Mon Oct 12 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: That's why I like you - Mon Oct 12 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looks down.

That was a first, but it was good to have someone like him for who he was. 'Course, based on Khalil's comments, he liked being bossed around? Regardless, Maloth doesn't return any affection in response, even if he isn't legitimately found of the Yamanshi.

"Mmm. . He thank."* - Mon Oct 12 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head.

"Not nee' try. Is too tire for train. Is bored, jus' stay with Khalil," he admits, once more establishing a hand onto Khalil's bum admist the walk. Where would they go?* - Mon Oct 12 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shrugs and takes a seat on his own mattress.'

"Why is feel weird?" the simpleton asks, not really seeing the issue. People like Yamanshi weren't too uncommon where Maloth grew up. Although they were often mis-treated.

"Why is ask?"* - Mon Oct 12 06:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) has no issues with the change in position. He allows Khalil to take a spot on his laps.

"Is no weir'.  . .Not get what mean be friend. Is person undah' Maloth," he says, adamant in keeping Khalil as a 'slave' if you will. . . Clearly with less than honest intentions at times.* - Mon Oct 12 06:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

He felt good considering how handsy Khalil had got. The compliments and praise of his physique only further bolstered the giant's ego. "Is no. You is have. . . mucha little hands," the brute remarks with a nod. His hand fidgets, resting at the Yamanshi's waist and adjusting his positioning.* - Mon Oct 12 06:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||"Hrm? What is wan' do?" He asks, since it seemed as if the trap had some other things planned. His brow is risen at that question, genuinely curious in regards to the inquiry.

Of course, had Khalil no actual plans, he'd likely take notice of a shift in Maloth's bodily temperature. Almost on insticct, Khalil is being pulled closer, further along the brute's lap.* - Mon Oct 12 06:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||He ponders on it. 

The Yamanshi was being. . . subtly suggestive, at least from Maloth's perspective. By now, the heat that manifested on his body wasn't just on his torso. Subtly, an outline or lump could be seen spawning along his pants, the loin areas. It's clear what's happening in particular, as the appendage brushes against Khalil's form.

"Is want," the brute stated simply, making his demands clear as there was faint arousal on the rise.* - Mon Oct 12 07:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||No time at all was wasted.

He didn't like spending time with foreplay, and preferred to get straight into business. It's true, just as Khalil had predicted, remaining consistent with his own gargantuan body mass, the brute's member was equally as swollen and thick. Both of his thumbs slip along the edge of his pant's upper portion. It pulls, allowing some space and proceeds to navigate the cloth downward.

Slowly but surely, more of the brute's flesh is being revealed, until the base of his veiny, mammoth-sized cock is being revealed. By now, it's only semi-erect, yet even in this state, the mass is true and there's quite a bit of fidgeting or movement. 

He's slow in the process as his pants grow tightly fitted. . .But sure enough, the dimwitted fiend is enabled to snake out his anaconda. A dark-skinned monster lays out, still semi-hard, and occasionally rising. . . before descends, it was like an excited dog wagging it's tail. "Is be. . . Hope 'ble handle." Of course, he didn't care if she could. The length sits over his laps, awaiting it's own attention.* - Mon Oct 12 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
On contact with Khalil's soft, miniture hands, his cock stiffens further. It jolts ahead, but the movements remain contained under the femboy's gentle, yet stern grip. He says nothing for the time, and just grunts -- clearly in a state of lust, yet instinctually drawn to the 'woman' due to her indulging in these lewd acts.

Khalil would certainly be able to detect this heighten state of lust.

More heat and blood funneled it's away along his sexual organ, forcing more of it's length to be revealed. By the time the Yamanshi was licking and giving loving kisses, it hand extended to full range -- a monstrous thirteen inches, and thick enough to take two hands to full encircle. Possessively, Maloth's giant hands moved to rest ontop of the trap's head, as if to guide the male in his journey should he ever stray off course.

By now, more of the brute's pants had been pulled downward, revealing a sizeable, cum-filled scrotom. For all of Khalil's efforts, he'd simply hear the occasion coo, showing that Maloth was at least content, not exactly overjoyed. An observant eye looks on to see how well the young shinobi would go on.* - Mon Oct 12 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) continued to release soft, tamed grunts.

Khalil was decent, yet the trap clearly lacked experience. What Maloth desired and demanded. . . required more spunk. . . More nastiness. His hand would have pressed against Khalil's head, whenver the femboy figured he had reached whatever limit his poor mouth and throat could take.

Ruthlessly, Maloth sought to force even more cock meat down the Yamanshi's cute little mouth, and force or induce gagging. To make things more sloppy even. This is brief, however, as even in his state or primal lust, the brute had to recognize one thing -- this was likely the boy's first time. "No' bad. . ." the male commented, his face placid and devoid of much emotion, save for satisfaction.

Before long, it seemed the youthful and willing shinobi/kunoichi had shifted gears, turning about to reveal too plump and toned ass cheeks. It was surreal, how could someone that claimed not to be a woman have such feminine features, and plumpness? Regardless, it was all the same to Maloth. Two massive hands reach ahead, grabbing and manhandling the slender figure and settling them onto the mattress. 

His cock is slammed right inbetween their rear, resting and eventually seeping into their plump behind. There are very clear throbs now becoming apparent, ones that moved in unison with the very beat of Maloth's heart. The wetness or lubcrication that came from the all-to-brief oral sex would serve well here. The brute's hips swayed too and fro, massaging his dick inbetween the luscious crevice that was Khali's bum, really just building up anticipation.

In time, however. .. He was ready for the main course.

With a single hand on the base, Maloth's oversized member is position, allowing the head to rest right on the Yamanashi's anus. The other hand comes out, slamming harshly against one of the cheeks. "If wan' Maloth. .  Have wor'. Have beg, and have push for self!" He demanded, making it clear what his intents were. He wanted Khalil to push back on his length.* - Mon Oct 12 07:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||That's what he liked.

A shadow casted onto Khalil's frame, alongside Maloth's predatory, and lust-filled gaze. The young femboy was learning nicely, and taking orders as if it had been his birthright --- and it -had- been it. . . as far as Maloth was concerned.

He looked on with dilating eyes, marveling at how admirably the youngster worked. With an arc'd back, Khalil is able to push backwards, allowing his derriere to sink further along the behemoth's ginormous member. It swallows it up hole, and latches along every inch like a parasite.  

This was a part that Maloth seemed to enjoy greatly. His breathing grows heavy, and excited as the throbs continue to run rampant on his cock. It twitches, yet finds no room to move admist Khalil's constrictions. Another swat of the hand is given, prompting yet another hand-shaped, red marked to be tattoo'd upon his flesh. "Is goooood," the brute would admit, and by now his hips were moving on their own. 

Gently, even with te lubrication that came from Khalil's deepthroating, the oversized, sex-loving barbarian pressed onward. It was a difficult task, as the Yamanshi's hole was untouched, and thus seemed unwilling to compromise. Nevertheless, giving enough 'persuasion', he eventually manages to sink deeper into the teen's pucker, each inch traveled proving to send additional waves of pleasure along his frame. In a few minute's time, about five inches manages to be stuffed in.

By the second, Khalil's hole was expanded to accomodate for the size and thickness that came from the evasion. Yet all the same, his anus clung onto Maloth's form, unwilling to move away.--- By the end of it, the brute's body is forced to show a small amount of appreciation. A thick layer of pre-cum is pumped out, filling the boy's insides with condensed, gooey substances.* - Mon Oct 12 08:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Indeed, the duo had produced quite a bit of lubrication for the endeavor.

Serving as the lubrication agent was a mixture of slimey saliva, and a load of precum. Each repetition, or pump of the hips is met with a squishy sound effect, almost as if someone with thick boots was stomping  right through mud. 

Sqish! Sqish!

It was murky, yet brought Maloth even more delight as it made the scenario even more dirty and lustful. The brute is very much in his zone, and pushing himself further into a climax as his girthy length continues to break through Khalil's ass, digging deeper in as if searching for god or the holy grail -- and honestly, based on the feeling that came from this, his bum might as have been dubbed the holy grail.

Pants riddle the room, along with the occasional -- yet loud -- moan. To encourage the endeavor, Maloth isn't ashamed of giving the occasional spank. Yet what did oyu know. . . the Yamnashi wasn't a complete push over. In time, with a splunk, Maloth's cock is grasped and pulled out, somewhat to his dismay. By this, he had managed to stuff about six and a half inches total, and certainly left Khalil's anus partially gaping. Allowing the femboy to do as he pleased, the giant warrior is eventually guided onto his back, the added weight forcing the mattress to tremble.

He watches with a grunt, as Khalil -- now in the 'dominant position -- saddled ontop of his frame, and again stuffed his massive cock back into his supple ass. Two hands rest on the hips of the trap, yet Maloth deems it fit to let him handle it personally. By then, the throbs and twitching is more prevalent, along with the heat. Judging by all of these signs, and look on the giant's face, it's clear that he wasn't going to last much longer if Khalil kept this up. 

Up and down, the boy rocked, each time going deeper on Maloth's thick pole. "Ergh. .! Is. . 'most done!" He warns.* - Mon Oct 12 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Continued pampering pushes Maloth closer to his absolute limit.

By now, you  could feel the heat of Malothl’s veiny, thick member reach it's pinnacle or high-point. In conjunction with the repeated, uncontrolled throbs, the warrior was practically shivering in anticipation. His breathing was fatigued and seemingly out of breath as the rookie -- and talented cock rider in his own right -- really put a number on the brute. Funnily enough, in the hayday, Maloth was known as a playboy considering his talents and physical gifts. . . Not many could out last him.

The shivering continued, up until one final contraction.

His cock stiffens up once more, and on several occasions, the contraction leads to heavy pumps, all to familiar to a fire hose. His syrupy cum comes pouring out, filling up Khalil's anal passage to the brink, and forcing an overflow. Of course, some seeps out, falling onto Maloth's pelvis region. 

As it occurs, the giant can't help but to give a single satisfied sign. "Is. . .Is. . . do good. . . Maloth like. . . wan' do night every. . ." the beast said in a fatigued tone, barely able to even speak by now.* - Mon Oct 12 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) allows such. His length begins to grow flaccid, yet still retains a large portion of it's mass.

A hand falls onto Khalil's head, before motioning downward. There was a mess that had to be cleaned up -- namely the semen that Maloth had spilled on himself and the mattress.* - Mon Oct 12 09:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) exhales. He's still a bit winded and nods weakly.

"Nigh'. . "* - Mon Oct 12 09:46:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) had awoken some time ago. As usual, the giant does his daily training regiment to refine his physique and increase overall power. By the time Khalil had spoken, Maloth was wide awake.

The giant takes leisure steps over and leans against the wall.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) makes his approach down the mansion.

As usual, he's slinging behind a giant hammer. In the freehand, there's a cart being dragged. The wheels repeatily churn, releasing the sound of friction or collision admist the road, making his approach all too noticeable. Inside the cart are crude metals or ores, all piled up on one another in preparation to be delivered. Evebn with the wheels, pulling the objects around were a tiring task, and of course force quite a bit of effort from the brute's behalf.

As he travels, a familiar femboy is taken note of. Maloth stops dead in his track, giving a nod of acknowledgement to Khalil. A giant hand comes, resting on the blonde's head of hair.

"Mmm, He-lo. What be doin'?"* - Wed Oct 14 14:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) tanks the hit. 

He looks downward, unsure how to respond initially.

"Hrm? Is do 'lot thin'. Go train in fores'. . . Mmm, an' do mission. So have leave," He replies bluntly, still looking ahead with the blank expression. From Maloth's perspective, he hadn't really done anything out of the ordinary. The brute tended to just up and leave for day's at a time -- assuming the sitaution called for it. Often times, he felt compelled to go test his limits in order to push himself further along the path of Hachimon.

". . . Wha' be do when Maloth no here?" the giant continues, curious as to how the Yamanshi had spent his time alone.* - Wed Oct 14 14:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Well, first I did some training and then I ate.... and then I went to sleep... - Wed Oct 14 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) seemed mystified. His mouth briefly opens agape in surprise, before his body settles, regaining much needed composure. ". . .No do mission? No try tal' for people?" the brute questions, as he didn't find Khalil's apparent life of solitude to be well. . . normal, at least not in this setting. Kumogakure was still a developing nation, certainly she had found something to do in order to remain pre-occupied, no? 

"Hrm. . . An' how train. . ? Nee' be show new move?" Maloth offers, as he recalls Khalil's desire to be proficient in taijutsu, even if the femboy was a dainty looking thing. It never hurt to help, right?* - Wed Oct 14 14:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looked at the cargo. He was in admist a mission. . . but honestly didn't even feel like completing it. After some internal debate, the beast nods, finding that a good fight would be a swell way to raise his motivation for training. "Is thin' idea o' good!" He replies with some excitement. A giant, meat club of a hand moves from Khalil's head, swatting at the curved boy's rear, prompting him to lead the way. As the blonde moved, so did Maloth.

His left hand never leaves the handle, allowing him to easily carry about his mission cargo towards the training area. The mission in question likely could be handled at a different time.

"An'. . . What is be move?" Curious, there was only one taijutsu technique that he had noticed Khalil used-- and it was that damn Leaf Great Whirlwind.* - Wed Oct 14 14:57:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||And cue a brisk walk on over to the eastern training field. As a note, she would likely be able to take notice of some fist-sized craters that littered the fine glass tiles. Clearly, someone had been training a bit fiercely in the area.

Having arrived, Maloth takes a quick step back, falling into a stance of his own. 

"Is ready. . ? Wan' see!"* - Wed Oct 14 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) kept his arms folded for a moement. Khalil -was- getting good. . . But the girl was hardly a threat, at least not by now. ". . .Mmm. . .--" Then he takes notice of the frontal flip. The dexterous, and honestly speedy action raises alarm, forcing theb rute to at least go to enter his own stance. Each muscle on the brute's body tensed up, strickening and thus fortifying his body's endurance. Albeit, with the added durability or endurance came a decrease in body fludity, be it in speed or ability to react.

--Before long, the blond, yet slender taijutsu specialist would have been towards Maloth's rear.  Several strikes manage to strike against Maloth's frame, although it holds little effectiveness. Each attack is stopped dead in it's track, no longer even being capable of piercing through his thick, muscular hide. His skin was partially rigid too, as tough as actual stone, yet oddly not as rough.

Even the blows against his manhood does little, as pain was simply pleasure to the brute. And on that blow? Considering the area, it was just extra. Turning about, his body is immediately breaking into a spin, with one leg thrusted out, allowing for a spinning kick to strike at the ankle.* - Wed Oct 14 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's body moved in a single rotation. The momentum comes to an end once the first kick had gone off without a hitch. Defensively, Maloth skips backward, his body still tensed and his stance still in full force. Fighting at this level of skill and focus tended to drain Maloth pretty swiftly, be it on a physical or mental level. Neverthelesss, upon seeing Khalil's lack of vigilance, the brute calms himself for just a moment, his observant eye looking the femboy up and down.

It's a scrutinizing, primal gaze. One that was akin to a predatory in the natural forest, looking towards the Yamanshi as if a piece of meat. Of course, unlike an actual predatory, the look didn't suggest greed or desire to eat, if not just a bit of lust. 

Still, this was still time of business. "Is done? Nee' keep try. E'en if lose," the brute notes, having no intent on allowing Khalil's strength to suffer due to complacency.* - Wed Oct 14 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) 's eyes click Khalil's form up and down. He remained stoic, however, despite the examination. "Is jus' rip. . . No nee' for 'fraid. Nothin' Maloth not see," he replies. "Look at Maloth. Ne'er wear shir', pan' 'lways be rip!" He says, gesturing to his consistently battered and tattered clothes. The giant was not one for modesty, and he didn't expect Khalil to linger on such petty, worldly squabbles for much longer either.

With a grunt, he falls back into the normal stance, looking ahead as the blonde eventually moved onward to continue with the assault. 

Muscles tensed again, Maloth stays put, enduring the flurry of strikes, each of which again fails to make it pass his thick muscular structure, and thus afforded no actual gain. Hell, considering Khalil's small frame, the boy even failed to make the gargantuan and heavy figure even stumble back in recoil. It was literally like punching an organic, boulder.

"Is no hi' har' 'nough! Body no stron' 'nough, so is have mae' body more stronk! Mo' bettah for limit!" He says, referencing the Hachimon formation -- the gate of Opening even. Maloth's body remained in stationary positioning, his muscles remaining strickened and occasionally having veins popping out of his form. Eventually, however. . . It's time to take actual. He releases a half-hearted blow, one towards the trapezus to spawn discomfort.* - Wed Oct 14 15:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts.

"No nee' change! If in figh', person figh' no le' change!" He says, clearly -not- understanding where Khalil was coming from. With another beastly grunt, he stomps onto the floor, forcing a small-ranged radius to shake under the might of his weight and strength. 

"Kee' go. 'Fore have rip off," he threatenns, still maintaining that same stance.* - Wed Oct 14 15:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts.

He submits -- just this once. "Only time is 'llowed. . . Nex' time, nee' learn how figh' e'en if body is show," Maloth instructs, still clearly irritated by Khalil's consciousness to the civilization's norms.

"Be fas'."* - Wed Oct 14 15:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: imma show u on skype - Wed Oct 14 16:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) waited patiently for Khalil's eventually approach. As per usual, the brute -- clearly fond of the 'woman's frame -- gives an unwavering glare, as if undressing with his eyes. Of course, this was time of action, not time of perversion and thus his focus remains on the task at hands. Once more, the brute falls into a stance of his own, --- 

And it isn't long before the blonde is bringing the fight to him. It was a pity, had this been the Maloth of month's past, then maybe Khalil would have stood a chance. Sadly, given the quarter of a ton (or more) in weight, studiness, and penchant for balance, the brute doesn't budge an inch. There's a slight pinge of pain that lingers along his ankles, but other than that, the brute seemed unphased. 

"Is goo'. . . Nee' try mo' hard. Know Maloth tal' 'bout? In brain, 'ble force body get more strong!" The giant alerts the woman, in hopes of compelling her to pursue the art of Hachimon as well. Admist the talk, he's taking a step forward, and aiming to latch onto one the Yamanshi's arm. Assuming a grip is established, rather than punching, or producing an ironcladded grapple, his arm swings, aiming to force Khalil's frame to be rocketed to the west, sliding on the floor.* - Wed Oct 14 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) grunts. He knew the importance of training hard, but it seemed that Khalil didn't quite have the drive as he did.

In her approach, the brute relents, only briefly smiling before looking down onto the feminien figure. "If wan'. Wha' we do now?"* - Wed Oct 14 16:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Ok. - Wed Oct 14 18:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||In no time at all, they had returned to the previous area.

Thankfully, there were no thieves mingling about in the area. Indeed, comsidering the cart remained around, Maloth's giant hands wrap around the handle, and again he's pulling it down. THere's a loud, creaking noise that persists, but it doesnt' seem to be bothering the brute one bit.

"We go!"

Without another word, the giant moves towards the south, heading towards one of the slums that were recently made popular in Kumogakure. Popular because. . .Y'know, the village's decline in terms of economical status, and it's rapidly declining military strength. There was plenty of civil unrest, thus making the mission;'s objective pretty obvious. If people had nicer houses? They'd subsequently be less angsty, and thus could perhaps grow to be upstanding citizens of Kumogakure.

After traveling three miles, Maloth -- alongside Khalil -- would have arrived in the impovished lands. Just from appearance alone, you could tell that these people had very little money. Housings were ran down, and many shady crooks stood around at the street corners. There are a few cat calls -- moreso towards the feminine looking male, Khalil. Others gawk at Maloth's sheer size.

In time, they arrive at the designated area, a run down house. The framework is still in place, what was left now was just to reinforce and decorate. Luckily, this wasn't going to be a difficult task, and the house was moderately-sized at best.* - Wed Oct 14 18:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||
Leading the endeavors, Maloth moves ahead, dragging the cart right behind his back.

It takes a few paces before at last, the brute is upon that banged up house. In additional to simple material and tools, there were decorative devices -- such as paint, wallpaper, and so forth. He gives a glance to Khalil, still regarding the femboy as a woman in all honesty. 

"Maloth go. . . Fix thing. He leave Khalil for make house look pretty, yes?" Believe it or not, despite being an idiot, the brute knew a thing or two about constructions. It was the only other real activity he knew how to -- save for fighting, having sex, or drinking. Thus was the way of a true savage. Grabbing several tools and metals, the brute begins to make his way towards the house -- quite literally kicking at the door.

It's broken down, likely to be fixed later. With clinking tools, the brute moves ahead, entering the cozy housing and looking for a series of items to fix or other  furniture that could be laying about. And of course, the hulking fiend would have to approach the walls and roof in order to reinforce their structure. As it stood now, there was about two weeks at the most because the roof and walls collapsed under it's own weight.

Would  Khalil comply? Regardless, Maloth is hammering away and doing an assortment of handy-man things.* - Wed Oct 14 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) looked down to Khalil who had graciously followed him inside. The help was certainly appreciative.

Pausing a bit from his handy-man endeavors, the giant looked downward, eying the Yamanshi as he patted his chest. "Mmm?-- Oh yes! Like do," the brute replies quickly in a gruff tone of voice, very clearly enjoying their time together.  Having said that, he turns back to the task at hand, eager to finally complete the mission, as he knew that Amaya was close to finally returning to her post at the mansion.

Given enough time, the giant continued hammering away, while providing strange mixtures along the walls and roof. From this alone, he's capable of single handily re-inforcing all of the building's structures to ensure that it is no longer at risk being broken down due to weathering. It's a tiring effort, but one's that worth it. All in all, he takes about an hour at the most to complete the task, considering the house was pretty small.

A glance is given on over to Khalil, and presuming she had finished, he quickly grabs the feminine figure by the waist, and hoists them up. A bit fatigued, Maloth makes way out of the house and back towards the mansion. The family that had lived there was already outside, and boy they're pretty generous with the greetings and compliments. GIving his thanks for their gratitude, it isn't long before the barbarian is back at the base, ready to get that reward.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I wanna see too! - Wed Oct 14 20:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods towards both of the women.

He had been practicing hard, at Paine's behest, to refine his own rate of attacking. Using a familiar skill, the warrior gets into a stance and sends a vicious kick towards the base of the mountain. The strength behind the blow is more than enough to leave a crater along the pathway. Rubble slides down the ground.

After completing the task, he turns, eying Paine's reaction to this.* - Wed Oct 14 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Woot woot! - Wed Oct 14 21:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||The attack had apparently been good enough to impress the taijtusu specialist, and his master, Paine! Indeed, with the heel kick came not only decently sized crater on the ground, but also a nice gust of wind. It was strong enough to send loose clothes fluttering, and to force long strands of hair to sway as well. Having accomplished the task, Maloth wears a grin -- although it's short lived. "Is wor' har'. . . Glad now can learn mo' thing! Is good for whe' go strongah mode," the dimwit explains. He looks on eagerly from there, wondering when the training was actually going to begin.

Of course, he had no qualms if Paine wanted to settle down and simply chat. She could feasibly be tired due to the long trip. Sunagakure wasn't exactly close to Kumogakure, after all.* - Wed Oct 14 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: hmm.... - Wed Oct 14 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-um...how about a s-spar? - Wed Oct 14 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm? 'Kay! - Wed Oct 14 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nodded along, as he was more than capable of understanding the stipulations.

It was clever, and sensible all the same. Maloth stayed put, allowing Paine to do her thing, setting up the arena, even as the Raikage sat about limply just to the right-- hopefully she didn't get in the way. "Is sense mae'. . .An' if Maloth am win you. Wha' be get. . . teach new move?" He says, wondering if there was an actual prize to this entire thing. Nevertheless, prize or not, the giant was on board, now via utilization of his customly made battle stance.

As Paine would be able to note, every muscle on his body remained in a constant state of contraction, to be better able to absorb contact. This gave the disadvantage of slowing his body down beyond it's already pitiful level. "Is ready! Come 'tack when can!"* - Wed Oct 14 21:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Why are you guys sparing right next to the Raikage? - Wed Oct 14 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) doesn't answer Kyushiki's question. . . ! At least at first. "Is train! Mae harder, so is get more strongerer!"

It was all apart of the game to him, at least from what Maloth could gather!

By then, Paine had taken her move, easily closing the distance between himself and her own miniture frame, and thus giving the perfect opportunity to engage in taijutsu combat. While not as skilled as the Concealed Figure, the brute had made up for his shortcomings by being an excellent, physical specimen. As reiterated countless times beforehand, Maloth had been selective bred, crafted from the strongest warriorsh is people could summon.

Staying put, the blow crashed against his frame, and this time. . . It seemed unable to truthfully make it pass the brute's sturdy, muscular body. Instead, the punch is stuffed, and while it forces the giant to shake a tad, it's clear that the blow isn't nearly as effective as Paine would have desired.

Instead, his right arm swat, hopefully making the forearm crash against Paine's neck, and packing enough strength to force the timid creature back. "Hnng! We see if Maloth win! No weak 'nymore! Is mucha strongah! 'Cause Paine is teach!" the brute declared confidently, actually having belief that he could win in this little expedition.* - Wed Oct 14 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Do it somewhere else? - Wed Oct 14 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Like the training area? - Wed Oct 14 22:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) blinked as Paine magically produced a log. It fell onto the ground, or rather. . -was- falling, before the woman had kicked it up with an impressive kick. 

What more, her body briefly accelerates, speeding behind the very log that she had sent on an upward. Impressive, and it dazzled Maloth to the point of cheering. As the log falls onto the floor, he grabs it himself, wearing a giant smile. 

Unless Paine hadn't recalled, he had been training to utilize the initial skill for sometime. It was simply their training had been interrupted repeatily. First by randoms coming to chat, and again by the Attack on Kenshin, where the speedstar eventually ran wild and wrecked Kumogakure with relative ease.  Following suit, once the log is in position, Maloth's frame shifts, allowing his body to stand up on one leg. The other kicks upward, sending the wood spiralling up without resistance.

The entire sequence shows some rawness, as he still wasn't quite used to utilizing the move. Although, in the end, rigid or not, the brute had succesfully emulated the kick. At last, his body leaps up. . .and at this point, he's failing.

Unlike Paine, Maloth didn't pay attention to detail, and thus could not take advantage of the aerial position to easily get into proper positioning. Upon landing, he looks ahead, gauging a response.

* - Wed Oct 14 23:35:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) remained raw in his abilities still.

It was a good thing he had the taijutsu Mastro, Paine, to add in his development. The brute owed a lot to the woman, for taking him under her wings, and thus enabling his amazing genetics to have actual substance -- or taijutsu ability -- behind it.

Once more, Maloth's gaze remained on the toned figure as she leapt through the air, again demonstrating the attack. It was two techniques in one, and of course was far more difficult than it looked. The first strike would be a fluid, upward kick, meant to launch an opponent high into the skies. This skill was far more technically refined than anticipated, as it accurately released momentum in accordance to how heavy the object is.

Following suit, his chakra surged, releasing the first gate just as Paine had done. In this state, there are noticeable veins protruding about his frame, as a testiment to the heightened state of power. What more, with the added physical might, Maloth also gained a stark incline in speed, making him far more apt to reproduce the skills that his sensei had just demonstrated. Once more, as a log is set into place, the brute blurs forward.

His right leg comes up, while the left remains tethered to the ground, and serving as an agent to aid in his balance. The former appendage eventually strikes the log, this time with an immense level of strength, and sends the heavy object flying upward without a hitch. "Is hit!" The collision was significant, forcing splinters of wood to cascade along the floor as the actual log soared through the skies.

Taking advantage of this, with the heightened strength, the brute eventually leaps into the skies, his body again blurring. It moved in a strange angle, thus giving him the perfect opportunity to position himself aerially along the wooden structure.

And subsequently after, down came a kick, powerful enough to send the log rushing onto the floor. It slams harshly, and just barely avoids being on path to Paine.* - Thu Oct 15 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Paine's observation and commentary made sense. Her opinion and tutelage was something only a true pracititoner of taijutsu could pick up on, and even then, it required a keen eye. For those that would have paid close attention to Maloth's last attempt, the kick was far from perfect. There was hesistation, but that hesistation wasn't due to mental miscues. Instead, this 'hesistation' was simply a byproduct of his body not being used to this particular motion.]

After all, would you ever expect a man of this size and stature to be flexible in the least? That said, upon hearing the Dissida's commentary, Maloth is more than willing to give the two techniques a try once more. He's tirelessly or relentless in his endeavors. Before long, the log is placed back into a standing positioning, held in place as if it were a football ready to be punted by a star Kicker.

After taking several steps back, the brute rushes forward. Each step or stride is filled with enthusiasm and force, leaving cracks along the ground. The second he's within range on this occasion, the dark-skinned barbarian kicks his right leg forward. It extends about the knee, allowing the leg to move through it's full range of mobility, albeit not as fast as Paine could do -- and certainly lacking in fluidity.

As per usual, the adjacent leg remains bound to the floor, and the muscles are stricken. In this state, given Maloth's consistent training to fortify his balance, the brute's center of gravity remains uncompromised. There's a glare being given to the inanimate object throughout the scene, as he would never rest until the techniques had been completed in a timely and efficient manner.

All the while, the first Hachimon State is still fully in effect. On collision, more pieces of wood break off, as the log goes soaring into the skies. The object in question moved in a linear path, and instantly held a large source of momentum, although there were subtle signs of resistance. Hopefully Madam Paine hadn't taken notice. Nevertheless, once the object is in the skies, the brute takes full advantage of his improved speed, and blurs ahead again.

Once in the atmosphere, Maloth sends a downward hill kick. Again, it proceeds to fall onto the ground, this time in direct path with Paine. In the event she dodged, it would crash onto the floor, leaving another crater, and forcing the wood to crack about in sporadic fashions. The giant lands soon after, giving a glance to gauge Paine's opinion. "Is good. .?"* - Thu Oct 15 12:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) wore a giant smile once the praise from Paine had finally been delivered. He nodded eagerly, considering doing a handstand was a trivial task. "Is thank," the brute comments briefly. Wasting no time at all, his body leaps into the air, performing an aerial flip. As the forces of gravity pull him down, the behemoth hands on his hands, which were now supporting his body weight. Strategetically, his legs leaned ahead, allowing the momentum or force to be balanced.

". . .This. . handstand? Wha' nee' for do?"* - Thu Oct 15 13:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) would have followed behind Paine obviously. When it came to being tutored, Maloth was strangely servient to the woman's wishes. The travel is done while he remained obediently on both hands, performing neat hand stands would inevitably provide the moment needed to travel. He's lagging behind, but is just barely able to keep up with the athletic woman.

It isn't long before they arrive at the designated area -- which sports a massive trench. Indeed, in days preceding , a massive hole had been conjured. There were scorch marks that marred the floor, tattooing it with sickly black charring. "Hrm. . ? Lot happens," Maloth notes, but generally remains quiet. Once the hat-wearing woman had moved ahead, the brute seeks to mimic her actions.

Wobbling, his arms continued to support his weight as he meandered around the trench. Sadly, the wobbling only grows more abundant as the wear and tear/muscle fatigue began to take it's toll. He's slowly losing his balance, before alas, the brute's arm give out, prompting his sturdy frame to fall over. It's sinking directly into the trench, which is likely about thirty feet or so deep.

Boom! With a loud thud, he lands, his body partially bruised due to the nature. Wasting no time, the giant leaps up, his face slightly red due to being flustered at the failed attempt. Kneeling, Maloth looks head, gauging Paine's own reaction to the failed attempt. Although, this begged the question-- Wait no, she answered already. The entire process was just to build up experience for being balanced in the air.* - Thu Oct 15 14:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) followed behind Khalil. It isn't long before the duo arrive at the meeting area. 

He descends, planting his rear onto a chair. It cracks and crumbles, barely able to support Maloth's inhumane weight. As usual, he's shirtless, and seems to care very little about such. Sitting, Maloth can't help but to notice the few awkward stares. They were justified considering his strange demeanor.

"Is try. . " the brute muttered softly.* - Fri Oct 16 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) allows his hands to be grasped of course. THere's a brief glance given over the action, but generally, Maloth is calmed. For a second, his mouth opens, as if ready to question -- but then he realizes or recalls the promise. To remain silent. Hopefully no one in the meeting. . . triggered him, or said anything that could induce rage.

From that point on, the brute just gives glances on over to Khalil and whatever writings the young shinobi had been jotting down.'

Seconds become minutes, and just like that the promise is broken.

"What is doing?"* - Fri Oct 16 03:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) shook his head. His grip only tightening around Khalil's own had. "No. Wan' be here," he replies casually, willing to put up with teh boredom if it meant having the Yamanshi aroudn to keep him company. Although yes, this mission was sutpendously boring. If only the brute knew how to read and write himself.* - Fri Oct 16 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods. The mission lacked excitement, mainly because the people in the meeting were as silent as could be. It was a wonder how this could be dubbed a meeting when very little public interaction was actually being completed. Nevertheless, it wasn't as if Khalil was holding him captive. Thus, the brute ignores his own impatient nature, and endures the sheer boredom that was the mission.

"Is 'kay. . . No is bore," the giant says, lying right through his damn teeth.

"What is write 'bout? Not listen,' Maloth asks, considering he had pretty blo9cked out any talking that was deemed boring or unexciting. His observant eyes view the sheet, but sadly, the giant is unable to read or write, and thus can't decipher what was being talked about.* - Fri Oct 16 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) nods.

He wears a smile, happy that the boring mission is at last concluded. Presuming that his  hand is still being held, the shinobi allows Khalil to lead the way, making a pathway back to the mansion where they could turn in the mission. Was this going to be routine?

Hopefully not. Kumogakure needed something exciting in order to regain the power it once held. So far. . . Amaya wasn't doing a whole lot to change the village's poor and declining state.* - Fri Oct 16 04:27:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||In no time, he falls into a basic stance -- his Iron Fist formation. It was something that needed to be improved upon, yet for now, Maloth relies on such. Each muscle in his body finds themselves being contracted, and thus more capable of taking shots.

Today, Maloth had -no- intention of holding back. He's still a tad bit sour over Paine's words.

How could she reject Maloth's demand to have his children!? A warrior of his calibar . . no less. The decline irked the brute, mainly because he sought to have a strong successor, and clearly Paine was a prime candidate for such. "Is show Paine. . . Why shoul' no say no 'for Maloth! Is show, he be stron', then mae wan' have baby o' Maloth!" the brute declared with a snicker-- although he's clearly serious. Wasting no time, the brute kicks off the ground, his body blazing forward towards the opponent, his speed nothing to sneeze at this point.

Mid-stride, the chakra gates that rested within his body was finally being activated. Energy funneled to the brain, and targeted the first of many restraints. The likes of which improve the usual flow of chakra, and of course. . . Remove the shackles that the body naturally had placed to keep itself from expiring prematurely. Nearly breaking into a blur, the giant is enabled to close the distance between himself and the expert taijutsu practitioner known as Paine!

Now in distance, his right arm slings forward, now holding a respectable level of speed. It aims to crash against the woman's chest, and certainly would hold enough momentum to send her body skidding if able to connect. 'Course, in the event that it misses, the momentum carries over, crashing into the ground with a loud thud. The impact is enough to force the flooring to rupture, and leave a decently sized crater onto landmark -- about three feet in terms of diameter.* - Fri Oct 16 17:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Boom!

The attack alone is enough to shake the fondation of the area to the very core. It was as if someone had released a miniture fissure along the land, forcing the ground to rupture. Dust kicks up into the skies, and rocks flee from their area all the same, clouding and shrouding Maloth's location. For a moment, both of their appendages remained lodged against one another, as the brute sought to overpower the dainty woman -- who still earned his admiration, simply because she overcomes all odd. There was really no reason for her to be this powerful. . .

Thus, her hardwork was admirable. A woman with no genetic gifts, nor natural talent. Yet here she was, being Maloth's bitter superior, outclassing him in most ways when it came to close quarter combat. He loved it. . ! Yet it also enraged him, as the brute's simplemindedness, and lack of social skill/common sense leads him to believe that this is the reason she denies his mating call.

 "Hng. . .! Keep block!. . . No let keep. . .!" He muttered to himself with rage. Yes, it was obvious that Paine was the superior combatant in terms of taijutsu skill. . . But Maloth was the physical specimen here!

It isn't long before Paine is seekign to overpower the brute, lifting him into the air. But just as that's happening,  countermeasures are taken. Using one of the very skills taught to him prior, the brute's right leg lifts and comes crashing down, intent on delivering a devestating heel kick to the back of the woman's head -- hopefully making it impossible for her to complete the attempted combo! His legs blurred, as adrenaline and natural skill made it so that his attacks were now a  lot faster than normal, in addition to being far more powerful.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||Boom! The ground again crumbled, moreso as Maloth landed along the ground. His form goes skidding, nevertheless, before finally come to a pause just meters away from Paine.

"Hng! Nee' get good hit. . " The brute muttered under his breath. He gives a brief glance to the blonde, that apparently was eager to take notes- - for good reason. Both of the current combatants surely exceeded Khalil's level of strength. Wasting no time, his body again speeds right on up, moving at a deceptively fast rate of velocity.

Mid-stride, his right arm is cocked back.

Once in distance, it swings forward, aiming to catch Paine right on the upper chest -- the action coming as  the brute literally ran ahead. The momentum from the movement speed would hopefully make the attack that much more devestating and difficult to avoid. "Clootheessliiineeeeeeee!" roared the beast amidst the blow. Should it prove successful, Paine would be forced to endure a large quantity of concussive damage, and of course be sent skidding along the pavement.

By now, there were minor signs of fatigue, considering the brute had opted to enter the first hachimon state right from the jump. Surely, it made him more formiddable, yet it also forced his body to grow more exhausted in a quicker pace. "Hng. .  Migh' nee' go more strong. . " a clear reference to gate two.* - Fri Oct 16 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) || He nods with enthusiasm as the attack lands with great effectiveness. The ground shook, and mild gusts of winds are produced from the aftershock alone. There are loud howls that spawn as a result, the likes of which echo about the isolated region. 

The ground is tattooed with deprressions, the holes being crafted as Paine inevitably it tossed along the pavement. "Yes. . . Is strong move fo' finish fight. . Is 'prise Paine able still for stand. . " and at last, he kicks into the next state of power, Hachimon level two! The gate of healing. His body now re-energized, Maloth kicks off the ground, moving at a renewed level of velocity.

Nearly breaking into a blur, the brute kicks off a nearby mountainous wall, and uses it as leverage to dive right towards the ground. The target? No one other than Paine. In the event that she was unable to react accordingly, she'd find herself being forced to endure the gargantuan weight that came with the brute's impressive figure. Hit or miss, an even greater crater was to be spawned, the floor shakes, and of course dust clouds the area. . .conveniently bringing up the level of tension for the battle.

Regardless, hit or miss, this was it for Maloth. He'd power down, figuring that enough of a battle had been performed.* - Fri Oct 16 19:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||What a powerful kick.

It sends his form skidding backwards, and crashing against the ground. But generally, he remains unharmed. There's a slight covering of sweat along his form, prompting his skin to shine just briefly. "Is good figh' .. . Maloth for too tired to keep go," the brute admits. He falls onto his ass, and begins to rest along a mountain.* - Fri Oct 16 20:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) ||In no time at all, a log is produced, likely obtained from the rubble that lingered from the village's previous destruction.

As it settle, Maloth takes his approach, entering a stance.  Once in position, he takes a step forward, sending his right leg forward in an upward fashion. It forces the log to be sent spiralling into the skies, going as far as to nearly be out of viewing distance!

"Is call Maloth kick! Much strong, good fo' get in air," the brute states with a grin. There were other uses, such as deflecting attacks to leave your opponents open for counter, but Khalil could easily infer the possibilities on his own. "What be thin'?"* - Fri Oct 16 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) frowns. He seemed mildly agitated, considering Khalil's lack of desire to learn. Taking a seat, his massive cranium shifts on over to eye the notes that she had been reading.

". . .Wha' is? Let Maloth see?" the brute inquires, his eyes blatantly curious.* - Fri Oct 16 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Ooh, it's nothing, Maloth. Don't worry about it. But uhhh, you can go if you want. I don't want you to stay here all bored, knowing how you are. - Fri Oct 16 21:00:48 2015

"No' is bea' for mud. If do, Khalil ne'er walk 'gain," the brute replies, chortling. A hand moves, wacking the femboy on the back in a gentle fashion, finding the entire comment ridiculous -- yet amusing all the same. "How long is be rea'?"* - Fri Oct 16 21:20:25 2015
