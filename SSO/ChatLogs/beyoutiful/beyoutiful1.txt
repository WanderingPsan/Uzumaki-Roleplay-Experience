<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) wasn't even paying attention to Jiki she was far to involved with singing at the moment. She would allow him to manipulate his sand as he pleased. She was harmless afterall.* - Tue Sep 01 22:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) 's curvaceous frame would've been completely enveloped in Jiki's iron sand. She peered towards him as he motioned his hand as he manipulated his iron sand encasing her body. She didn't try to struggle she would allow him to do as he pleased.* - Tue Sep 01 22:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) was leaned up against the manor before she diverted her gaze towards Zetsumo who had materialized within her immediate vicinity. Peering towards the monstrosity that was Zetsumo a devilish smirk appeared upon her face before she pushed herself off the mansion and strolled towards him. Her waist dipped and her hips voluptuously shifted in her confident stride as she closed the distance between the two of them.  

"It seems that things haven't changed around here. This is my home and despite the little falling out we had I figured it would be best to return. Besides, people always tend to find their way back home." Maya muttered peering towards Zetsumo taking a mental note of his physical features. He had retained his looks and didn't seem to age considerably.* - Thu Sep 03 21:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) would nod her head as she peered towards Zetsumo and begin to follow him to his desired location. She couldn't help but notice the slow pace in which he walked, but after fifteen minutes or so the two of them had arrived at the local restaurant. Entering the diner she would glance around watching as the civilians scattered clearing out the restaurant upon setting eyes upon Zetsumo. Eventually, after everyone had exited the diner Zetsumo had moved towards the right and motioned for her to take a seat at the table. Peering towards him she would approach the table before she joined him taking a seat on the opposite of the table. 

Listening intently she would allow him to explain his plans on helping her develop as medical Shinobi. Once he had finished speaking, she part her lips speaking in a delicate tone which was unusual for her since Zetsumo had known her to be outspoken and demanding. "Take as long as you require to acquire the scrolls for me. I can wait, I understand you have a busy schedule and things that you must carry out not only as the Hokage but as the leader of the Kenryoku." 

Maya said delicately before she peered towards the waiter who had rushed over towards the table to assist the duo. She would allow Zetsumo to place his order before she parted her lips to place hers. "I'll just have a bowl of miso ramen please." Maya said politely before her gaze diverted back towards Zetsumo as she gazed into his eyes. The woman's physical features weren't the only thing that had changed it would've seemed that Maya's entire demeanor had changed. It was amazing what five years could do.* - Thu Sep 03 23:49:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) didn't feel compelled to become angry at the fact that she would have to wait to advance as a medical Shinobi. She actually didn't mind waiting for him to acquire the scrolls even if it took him several months to do so. She assumed that Zetsumo still perceived her to be the haughty abrasive girl that she was five years ago when the two of them had first met each other. However, if that was the case he was wrong and she had completely changed her attitude and view on life. She peered towards the waiter as he scurried off to convey to the chef what the two of them had ordered. 

Diverting her attention back towards Zetsumo Maya would run her hands through her gorgeous locks, allowing her fingers to glide through her jet black hair that cascaded down her back. Her massive breast would've been exposed a bit as she showing a bit of cleavage. She would bat her eyelashes a bit, but not in a flirtatious manner of course. Parting her lips, she would respond to Zetsumo's comment one that she hasn't answered for him back then. 

"A lot happened since the two of has been apart. I've changed as a person so the way that I deal with individuals have changed as well. We all are subject to change some of us change for the better and some of us change for the worse. I'm interested in medical Ninjutsu and I hope to one day become the best medical Shinobi ever. It's the only thing I seem to be good at and I wish to improve my insight on medical Ninjutsu and fill the void I have. I also don't mind assisting you I suppose." Maya said politely peering towards Zetsumo staring him directly into his eyes as if she peering into his soul.* - Fri Sep 04 00:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) peered towards Zetsumo as he began bragging about Zenaki's development as a medical Shinobi. It seemed as though he didn't change a bit and still gloated about things he was proud of. Parting her lips Maya would speak in response to his statement. "Sounds like a great idea. I'm interested in taking up lessons with her, although I'm not interested in dabbling with poisons and pills more so of medical Ninjutsu and techniques that most people don't know. However, I'm willing to learn a thing or two from just so I can be more versatile in the field rather proficient in just one." 

Maya stated clearly not that interested in poisons and things of nature. Then suddenly the meal would've been supplied as the waiter returned to the table and placed each dish upon the table. Steam would've emitted from both dishes signaling that the ramen was hot and freshly cook for the duo. Peering towards the food she would reach for some chopsticks as she prepared to utilize them. "Enough about me. What exactly do you want from me in return for your services? I assume you want me to do your biddings and serve as your personal medic along as the personal medic for the Kenryoku correct?" Maya questioned wondering what  his intentions were.* - Fri Sep 04 00:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) removes his hand off of her rear and peers towards him. She doesn't say anything but one could probably tell that she was completely disgusted.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) peered towards Zetsumo as he casually strolled towards her before he planted his hand on firm derrière. Her cheeks flushed instantly the moment he began to stroke her bum. Her facial expression contorted and a smile formed upon her face, it was evident she liked it and it eased her nerves. Not only was she enjoying it, but she had received news that Zetsumo had acquired some scrolls for her. Parting her lips the medic would speak in a low tone. "Thank you lord Zetsumo I'll get to studying immediately after we spend some time together." Maya said politely her demeanor completely different from how it was yesterday when she appeared to be an emotional wreck.* - Sat Sep 05 16:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) was rather eager to begin her training. She had been slacking on her training for years and now she was granted the opportunity to pursue her goal of becoming the worlds most renown medical Shinobi. Retrieving the scroll that was gifted to her by Zetsumo the woman would open it, peering towards it eager to see the contents of the scroll. It had been quite some time since she performed a jutsu so she assumed that learning this jutsu would be a bit troublesome for her. Gazing directly at the scroll the woman would begin reading the scroll carefully making sure to retain the information that she read. 

Amid reading the scroll the medical Shinobi would've found a few things interesting and found the jutsu that she would be attempting to master rather useful. "I'll be able to make incisions without the need of a scalpel, which will be necessary for on the spot surgery. " Maya pondered internally before she proceeded to read the scroll thinking of a numerous amount of ways she would be able to make use of the jutsu. The medical shinobi would constantly be shifting in Zetsumo's lap. Her ample derrière grinding against his pelvis as she proceeded to expand her insight on medical Ninjutsu and the jutsu known as chakra scalpel that would aid her in completing surgeries. 

Closing the scroll the woman would place it on the desk before she place her hands together and wove through a various measure of hand seals. It had been quite a while since she performed a jutsu so the speed in which she executed, he hand seals would've been sluggish for her standards. Kneading her chakra the woman would channel her chakra to her left hand, sending a considerable amount of chakra to her hand. Despite not having performed a jutsu the woman still possessed a decent amount of control on her chakra. 

The woman would ponder on a scalpel as she would attempt to shape her chakra into a blade that resembled a scalpel a tool in which medical Shinobi utilized to make incisions. Fortunately the woman had managed to effectively shape and channel her chakra to the desired area which permitted her to successfully perform the jutsu. Her attention would soon divert to Kitora whom had entered the mansion. She would've listened the woman's words but as usual she didn't seem to pay her any mind.* - Sun Sep 06 15:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) gaze would've been fixated upon Amai. Maya would look the girl up and down finding her unattractive her attention would soon return back towards the monstrosity that was Zetsumo. Parting her lips she would speak in a fragile. "My isn't she attractive." Maya said sarcastic pausing for a bit before she proceeded to speak to Zetsumo. "Amegakure is quite boring. I've also mastered the technique and I will require more scrolls." Maya said delicately peering around a bit.* - Tue Sep 08 19:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) Peered towards Zetsumo a grin forming upon her face as he approached her. A smile crept upon her face the moment his palm landed upon her ample rear. It would've been evident to everyone present that the medical Shinobi was enjoying this. In a matter of seconds the medical Shinobi clasped her together and began to weave through a progression of various hand seals. Molding her chakra the woman would effectively shape her chakra in the form a blade. 

The chakra that she had molded would've manifested completely enveloping her right hand. Parting her lips, she would speak to Zetsumo once more. "I have yet to utilize the Jutsu. Judging by the amount of casualties we have suffered recently I'm certain I'll be using it soon enough. " Maya said as she peered down towards the girl as she walked around as if she were an animal. The medical Shinobi would remove the leash from Zetsumo's grasp. A devious grin forming on her face before she spoke to him. "Release her. Allow her to be treated as an individual." Maya said. Although she meant what she said there was a hidden meaning behind what she did.* - Tue Sep 08 19:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) would place in her hand in Zetsumo's before she strolled off with him. she would wave at amai* - Tue Sep 08 20:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) figured it was best to practice utilizing the jutsu before the two of them spent some leisure time with Zetsumo. Remembering the information that she read upon learning the jutsu known as chakra scalpel she would attempt to sever a few tendons in his body. Placing her hands together, she would weave through a various measure of different hand seals. Amid weaving through the obliged hand seals she would muster up a significant amount of chakra channeling it to her arm. 

The kunoichi would go through the process of shaping her chakra shaping her chakra in the form a scalpel. Parting her lips, she speaks to Zetsumo before she prepared to make internal incisions. "I'm going to attempt to sever a few tendons in your body." The medical Shinobi stated before she extended her arm out towards Zetsumo. Being an exceptional medical Shinobi she was familiar the human anatomy and where the tendons were located. The woman would kneel down quickly utilizing the chakra scalpel to sever the Achilles' tendon in an attempt to render him immobile. She would glance up towards the monstrosity to see if she was utilizing the jutsu correctly.* - Tue Sep 08 20:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) would've remained in her position as she attempted to sever several tendons in Zetsumo's leg. She wasn't quite sure if he attempt was successful because he remained motionless and didn't seem to show any signs of pain. Fortunately, he was vocal and conveyed to her that she had in fact succeeded in her attempt to sever several of his tendons. A smile formed on the woman's face before she rose to her feet and peered towards the hot springs. 

She would simply nod her head before she began to remove her clothing, removing every article of clothing that she wore. Her curvaceous frame would've been exposed to Zetsumo for a few moments before she stepped into the hot springs submerging her body in the water. Her massive buxom would've still been exposed a bit, however the lower portion of her body was completely submerged in the water. 

Releasing a groan, she would've tilted her head back as she soaked in the water, allowing it to relieve her of any tension she felt. Once she had been settled in the water she would peer towards Zetsumo wondering when he was going to join her. The medical Shinobi didn't mind spending quality time with Zetsumo. She hadn't actually got to speak with him since she had returned to the village and now was the perfect opportunity for them to engage in conversation without being disturbed.* - Tue Sep 08 20:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) peered towards Zetsumo as he followed suit and removed his clothing exposing his muscular frame along with masks that littered his frame. Being a medical Shinobi she was accustomed to seeing odd things battle scars that lingered on his frame. Her gaze never left him as he sank into the water and close the distance between the two of them. 

Parting her lips the woman would speak. "It is unfortunate what happened to Kitora. I know we didn't see eye to eye for a reason that still befuddles me to this day, however, I understand the role she played in your faction. I'm interested in taking on her role in the near future once I acquire the ability to fight in combat. Would you be interested in teaching me some elemental Jutsu? I recall you being well versed if most of the elements" Maya inquired as she peered towards Zetsumo.* - Tue Sep 08 21:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) peered towards Zetsumo as he chuckled and her facial expression would've contorted to one that displayed distaste. Parting her lips, she would've spoke as she complied and stepped out of the hot springs for a moment so that she could observe Zetsumo as he exhibited the Jutsu that he was going to be teaching her. "I don't find anything funny. We will have to see sooner or later." 

Maya retorted as she stood there her curvaceous figure completely exposed for Zetsumo to see. The medical Shinobi didn't mind being nude she was comfortable with her body and comfortable around Zetsumo. She would approach him taking a step closer listening intently as he began to explain the concept of the Jutsu to her. 

She had never utilized her element so she made sure to listen carefully as he explained in detail the purpose of the Jutsu and how to go about successfully performing it. The medical Shinobi found what he was saying rather interesting despite how troublesome it was going to be actually master this technique. She would repeatedly nod her head notifying Zetsumo that she was actually paying attention as he spoke. 

Once Zetsumo had finished explaining the woman she watched him closely as he executed the Jutsu and effectively manipulated the shape of the pillar of rock he had created utilizing his chakra. Maya would've watched in awe never having seen a technique so destructive since she avoided combat. For a moment Rei would ponder about it for a second before she would attempt to perform the Jutsu that he had just demonstrated a few moments ago.

Being a medical shinobi muster up chakra was something that she did occasionally and didn't prove to be troublesome for her however she never utilized her Doton chakra. Despite being inexperienced with chakra nature, she would endeavor the perform the Jutsu and would close her eyes as she sought to muster up chakra kneading it into her stomach before it eventually manifested around her palms so that it was visible. 

Once she had built up a various measure of chakra the woman would peered at palms before she transferred her chakra into her stomach, allowing her Doton chakra to be infused with the rock in order to form the earth into a thick pillar. The medical shinobi had been paying attention and she made sure to manipulate the shape of the pillar that she had created sharpening the edges of it so that it could possibly impale someone or cause a grievous injury. 

Although the woman had been thinking this she would've failed at manipulating the shape of the pillar and thus failed to perform the Jutsu. Sighing in frustration the medical kunoichi would've peered towards the pillar of earth that had been erected from the ground before she would attempt to perform the Jutsu once more. 

Mustering up an abundant amount of chakra in her stomach the woman would've transferred chakra into the ground by pressing her palm against the surface of the earth. Fortunately the woman had managed to effectively shape the edges of the pillar she had created. Sharpening it enough so that it could impale an enemy or foe. She would approach the pillar of earth that she had shaped and formed observing it to see if it was sharp enough to actually cause harm to someone.* - Tue Sep 08 22:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
After weeks of lazily practicing from a scroll, it would seem that Maya had finally gotten a decent understanding of the Chakra Scalpel technique. As a medical shinobi -- and one of the only two with the profession among the Kenryoku. . . Maya felt the innate desire to strive for higher excellency. To be the best that she could be, especially in such trying times like this.

Without a second thought, the curvaceous medical shinobi finds herself moving to a more isolated region. A dummy is seto ut already, sporting transparent skin so that she could actually see what was going on underneath.

Two to three handsigns later, and her chakra is being activated. On inception, there's a warm, fuzzy feeling resonating around her tummy. As a descendent of the illustrious Senju Clan, Maya's reservoir of spiritual and physical energy were vast. Not only that, but it possessed a positive aura by default -- even if she was working a would-be, world-wise tyrant. The energy seeped together, forming large clumps which eventually held greater potency.

As chakra control-minded shinobi, she put the utmost effort in ensuring that this sequence of the procedure had gone on flawlessly. "Okay. . Okay. Take it easy. The first step of chakra control is simple -- and that's building up just the right amount of energy. That way, the second portion can be done without any difficulties," the young girl coached to herself. Indeed, she had known precisely how Chakra Control was govened. It was broken into three simple parts.

The first being the manipulation or kneading of one's chakra. For all chakra-based techniques, the user had to know precisely just how much energy needed to be built up for the required skill. Of course, the amount varied based on which ninjutsu was being applied, and how chakra costly it was. Clearly, the desired goal was to use as little as humanly possible to still get a competent result. Regardless of her vast skill in this regards, doing so for a B ranked technique was still a tall-task to behold. 

She visibly struggles, her arms trrembling on the last seal. A good chunk of her overall energy reservoirs are used. Sadly, no matter how much effort had been applied, far too much energy had been spilled out-- though it was too late to turn around now. She had already pooled together the quantity, and thus it ws either use it, or have all that energy go to waste. Maya wears a frowns, as she reads the clear discrepancy. "D-damnit. . . C'mon. Alright, let's try this again. I can still get the second and third portions correct. . " Urged the young Senju, as if giving herself a pep-talk would eventually grant some sudden resurgence, and bolster her level of skills.

In time, Maya had eventually began pushed the energy away from her sternum, and into her palms. A vibrant, translucent and blue glow takes over her hands. It was as if she was suddenly wearing some futuristic gloves that glowed at any point of the day. A very small amount of sweat bubbles over, and builds onto her forehead. It isnt' enough to form droplets by any means, but it does prompt a slight sheen to be made apparent as a simple testament to the hardwork suddenly being applied.

The second step to the 'Chakra Control' process was where Maya's skill admittedly took a dip. Once you had first built up the desired amount of energy, you simply had to put each molecule to use. Although this was easier said then done. Often times, a rookie shinobi will find that applying a large bulk of energy into one, uniform usage of ninjutsu was a difficult task to accomplish. More often than not, the majority of the power would find it self wasting away, and dissipating uselessly into the skies. Meanwhile, whatever was left was to be placed into the technique itself -- of course, the jutsu was to suffer, considering it no longer had the necessary fuel.

This was a sequence that the Senju struggled with every day. The 'Glove' of chakra around her hand flickered like a weak fire, and seemed ready to collapse or shut off on a moment's notice. All in all, only about one-third of the chakra built up is actually placed sufficiently into the Chakra Scalpel technique. It's a fact that's clearly acknowledged, as even with most of her focus on the release, Maya is well aware of her own downfalls and limitations. She'd grunt, and curse inaudibly.

Nevertheless, this would be a segway into the third and final portion of chakra control. Something that is often overlooked. . .

Shape Manipulation! A more refined version of chakra manipulation, and often not all to significant, unless you go into higher leveled ninjutsu. . .Such as 'Chakra No Mesu.' What was initially a shapeless flow of energy, that had foamy and irregularly outlines on the edge, was now taking form. It quivers and fidgets around, until at last, there's a somewhat sharpened edge at the tip. It's the mid-point of the fingers, particularly the 'middle finger.' 

Going further, the edges of the Chakra Scalpel blade were gaining stability. In no time now, Maya had finally completed the jutsu. at least in the formation. By now, more sweat had been built up, and proceeded to form into beads. A second later, she's pressing a hand against the dummy, and secreting more energy ahead. It takes an unreal amount of control -- one that only a medical could ever dream to utilize. 

It seeps, moving beyond the flesh of the inanimate object, and eventually targetting the inside body. Of course, that's just about as far as it'll go. After all, this was just a superpowered scalpel. It likely did not hold the capability of attacking one's bone. Rather, Maya's observant eyes look on over to the transparent skin, and finds  tendon. The flowing chakra takes shape, while moving, and forms a thin blade. It cuts and snipes, easily reducing that tendon to a torn string.

That sequence, while seemingly short, takes a great deal of effort and concentration. Thus it's reasonable to see why this jutsu lacks usage in combat. After all, your opponent won't just sit around and wait for you to use it. You have to move with quickness and of course be to  keep a steady head while in hostile situations. Going further, she continues with her endeavors.

A second hand falls onto the dummy, while chakra pulsates. There's still that same, warmy feeling that had existed at the beginning of all of this. Simultaneous with the right, her left hand releases additional power, and they work overtime, shredding at precise locations of the body. Time and tiem again, and incision is being made, and of course serves as practice for not only rendering the body immobile. . . But to be able to use it for actua surgery should the need arise.

After half an hour, the energy flow finally comes to a rest. She's so damn exhausted, and falls onto her back.
* - Thu Sep 10 11:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) had come to observe the beautiful scenery of nature.

"Ah. . . It's nice to see something that looks almost as good as me,"the girl thought to herself with a leisurely smile. Of course, the talk of the two teens below catches her attention. With somewhat surprised eyes, she looks ahead, mystified even.

There's a constant flow of chakra about her hands, as it now sits on the tree, and proceeds to rupture the wood. Even in relaxation, there was always an opportunity to exercise. "Err. . . What are you guys talking about?"* - Thu Sep 10 11:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) shrugs.

"'Sumo seems to be meditating. I guess that'll be okay," Maya replies calmly. She begins to move after the duo, her hips swaying in a somewhat provocative fashion. This was in no way intent on attracting attention -- rather, it was just the woman's swagger. Clearly, she did not lack in confidence.* - Thu Sep 10 11:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) would have followed closely behind the duo. Why not get to know other members of the Kenryoku better? In a matter of minutes, they'd arrive at Katsune's new home. She's crack the door open and go to take a seat -- on the same table mind you.

Similiar to the younger kunoichi, Maya's leg crosses over the other. A scroll is in hand, and is being read, almost as if it were a magazine. She hums leisurely admist the reading.

"Hrm? Eh. . .Yeah, this place is pretty. . . small. Compared to Konohagakure's home. I hope we don't have to stay in this village for long."* - Thu Sep 10 11:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) nods. She gives a brief glance to the surrounding area, before frowning a bit. Maya was a fan of nice things. . . and nice places. And definitely, this cozy home didn't meet her standards. "Yeah. Even my house was bigger than this. Although. . . I usually just stayed in the mansion with Zetsumo," the Senju replies. Once the brief survey of the house had been given, her eyes fall back onto the jutsu scroll, as more studying was required.

Still, why not make idle conversation?

"So who is that guy in the shower. Your boyfriend or something?" Maya asks, she gives a glance over to the young gal seconds after. Her eyes convey amusement. "Mmm, cute couple I'd say." Clearly, she's teasing the young kunoichi.* - Thu Sep 10 12:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) nods. Briefly, her lips are pressed together, in the form of a smile, though that's quick to fade. After the response, her eyes fall back onto the sheets of paper. The kanji for the scroll makes it's clear that she's still in the works of developing her medical ninjutsu.

"I see. Mmm, I had expected a more animated response. But, judging by your comments, I can tell you're telling the truth. Although, I can also tell he probably has a thing for you," Maya notes, while still skimming through the scroll that seemed to be brimming with knowledge.

"Right then. Hrm. . . So what do you do for fun? Y;know. . . When the Zombie guy isn't breathing down your throat, harrassing you to train and stuff. Since training really -isn't- fun." she continues, still speaking leisurely, and making idle conversation to sate her boredom. Occasionally, Maya's brow fidgets, not out of irritation for the conversation, but simply due to overworking her brain in a bid to master the technical aspect of the Chakra Scalpel technique.* - Thu Sep 10 12:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) 's right brow jumps. That was. . . Uhm, a doozy.

"Ouch. That's really unfortunate. Sorry for your loss? I realize this group isn't all fun and games all the time," Maya replies. For just that moment, her eyes were no longer glued. She observed Katsune's seemingly unresponsive nature -- and it made it hard to tell if the woman even cared.

"You're strong, by the way. Emotionally." On that note, her eyes go back to studying the sheets.* - Thu Sep 10 12:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
The sheet in her hand fumbles. She readjusts it, straightening out the paper and moving it a bit from her face. It comes to a resting stop on the table. 

"Huh? Don't want to make you uncomfortable. Although, I would be a liar to say that I don't -really- want to know," Maya replies. She's speaking respectfully from start to finish, no longer holding that same rambunctious nature that had once driven her away from the Kenryoku.

"I mean. It's not like i'm going to go blurt it out."* - Thu Sep 10 12:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) huffs. "I take your word for it. You haven't flinched at all. You're pretty strong, I'll say again," Maya says. Her hands again come to lift the sheets up, and she's once more studying to her heart's content. Chakra Scalpel. . . It had to be mastered. The Senju's brow again furrows, as the contents of the scrolls are tirelessly examined.

"Although, it's a dull life to lead. I hope you can learn to have actual fun in time," Maya speaks politely again.

"And this dude is taking a long time in the shower. I wonder if he fell a sleep." The comment clearly references Kilm.* - Thu Sep 10 12:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) seemed visibly surprised. "--What? Wow. . .I really expected for that offer to be declined. See, you guys aren't that boring," Maya says withj a grin. She means zero offense, clearly, and is obviously joking. After reading over that damn scroll for the umpteenth time, the sheets are finally rolled on up and set to her side. Casually, the voluptous woman takes a step ahead and proceeds to the exit.

"Cool. So hrm. . .Would you guys be against mud baths?"* - Thu Sep 10 13:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
And cue a short stride over to Amegakure's local spa area.

The inside has an entirely different climate for sure. While the outside was cool, the insides, at least of the lobby, is warm to the touch. With that same, almost provocative stride, Maya moves over to the clerk, and rings the bell. A short, asian-looking employee rushes over, with a smile and seems eager to serve.

"Err. How much does it cost for three--" Immediately, she's cut off. As a member of the Kenryoku, a group that was greatly benefiting Amegakure, it seems the clerk is giving them access to every one of the facility, free of charge. Clothes and such are even prepared for the occasion.

"Huh. And that's that. . . So what's going to be first, people?" Maya's hand had absentmindedly moved towards that scroll. It seems that even as she's doing leisure acts, the kunoichi is prone to slipping back to work as she obsessively seeks mastery of the admittedly difficult art. Once the question had been delivered, with swaying hips, Maya moves over towards the lockers, designated for females. Yet she doesn't enter, after all, there were still some clear questions that needed to be answered.* - Thu Sep 10 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) speaks up calmly.

"A mud bath? Or just the hotsprings? " She seems to be speaking to both, assuming Kilm hadn't gone off already. Like the other interactions, Maya occasionally glances back, and reads the scroll. Her lips moved subtly, making that fact all too clear.* - Thu Sep 10 13:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) gives a glance to Katsune. Her e---

Wow. Basketball? "Oh. . Uh. There should be one, yeah."* - Thu Sep 10 13:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) 's brow twitches. Her face depicts surprise -- as someone being a lover of basketball wasn't exactly too common. "He's. . . He's. . .Serious?" Maya spoke with mystification. 

In Kilm's search, he'd find the Gym towards the back. Of course, there were a bunch of other jocks littered about. A few even had already began their own pick-up games. Idle chit-chat is in abundance, although it usually seems to be based around not actually wanting to be in the spa, or perhaps some macho stories involving their wives/girlfriends.

Meanwhile, Maya still wears that same incredulous gaze as the shinobi had done sprinted. "Huh. . . Strange b--friend, you got there. Let's go, I guess. . ." She turns and moves towards the exit. Their lockers are already assigned, and changing outfits are in placed. Bikini's more or less. The Senju cracks open the locker, and looks ahead, eying just what to wear. Meanwhile, her clothes are casually being undone.* - Thu Sep 10 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
Naturally, the jocks oblige. "Shit. This is a new face 'round here. . . Shono. You get the new guy," one of the masculine voices declare. He had no intent on taking on some fresh meat, who probably didn't even have game. 

Meanwhile, Maya is still in the locker room. There's an internal debate. Eventually, she decides on the a simple, black set. In no time at all, she's stripped down, wearing modest underwears, and occasionally gives a glance to Katsune. Of course, this isn't out of perversion, nor any particularly interest in the young girl. After all, this Senju had her eyes on one particular, Zombie man.

"Hrm? Oh, I figured you had stuffed your bra. You're pretty big," Maya notes, in reference to katsune's bosom. Her visage never shows modesty, and she's literally sizing the girl up. Eventually, after stripping down, she places on the black bikini. It hugs her figures, and isn't overly. . . showy, yet still leaves much to the imagination.

As usual, hips swaying, the adult kunoichi is leading the way, en route to the mud bath. Her features, while full and endowed, have minimal movement, due to how snug the outfit proves to be. It wouldn't be more than five minutes before they had trekked along the hallway and reach the designated area.* - Thu Sep 10 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
Still had that scroll in hand, of course. She's giving a glance along the way, mouthing some of the words on reflex.* - Thu Sep 10 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
"A henge. . .? Doubt it. I've seen you around a lot, no one can really keep a henge up forever," the curved kunoichi says with a slight chuckle. Clearly, she had not seen anyone on Tsunade's level just yet. Once at the proper region, a feet dips in, allowing her toe to press through the thick muds. It's warm, and somewhat heavy, but feels good nevertheless.

"Hrm. Nice stuff," Maya comments.

Shortly after, she's sticking the rest of her leg in, followed by the second leg as well. Before even going to sit, the woman turns around, waving the girl inward. "Come. It's more fun to do this with company." 

Of course, many of the spa's employees are around, ready to be of service should any of the customers desire it. After giving a last, fleeting glance to one of the diagrams on the scroll, it's finally put to the side, and left alone. No more scholastic tasks. It was time for relaxation at long last. Meanwhile. . .Kilm is apparently going Lebron James on fools.

After a made shot, many of the gym's regulars scoff, placing that as nothing more than beginner's luck. Although, some are wary. 'He might got game, be on your guard, boys."* - Thu Sep 10 14:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
There was no doubt in her mind that Katsune was not using a henge. "I guess you just have good genes?" She says, implying that being curvaceous or endowed was something to be proud of. Her tush eventually settles with a wiggle, as it digs through the thick mud before her. Descending further down, eventually, only Maya's neck and head are visibly.

She hums again, content with the nice sensation that spawned from the mud bath.

"Hrm. . .So topics. . Topics. Hrn, what should I say-- Sorry about this. I'm usually more. . Uh, socially competent. Just I don't want to say anything that can irritate you. You seemed pretty uncomfortable with our last conversation," Maya says again in a polite tone. Meanwhile. . .

Kilm is still destroying the competition. Being a criminally fast and dexterous shinobi has its perks.* - Thu Sep 10 14:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) rolled her eyes in an exaggerated manner. "'Course, I won't talk about any classified business. Not that I know of any. I'm only here to heal and serve as support."

And it was true. Maya wasn't a combative person by any means. She simply remained about to serve the Head Honcho, Zetsumo. 

"Anywho. . . Yeah, i'll be careful. You seem pretty uptight. I half-expected you to ask for a massage, cause you seem kinda. . . Subtly stressed. --" Her hands flick through the mud. The sudden elevation forces droplets of mud to come about. It splatters around the immediate area. Once freed, she snaps her fingers, calling forth one of the employees.

They quickly follow instructions, covering Maya's face in some strange mixture, meant to soften the skin and clean out any impurities. "Got to stay looking my best, mhm," the medic notes. She seemed to take great pride in her physical appearance, that was for sure.* - Thu Sep 10 15:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) nods with a smile.

"Yeah. He would probably give you some uncomfortable stares as you got it," Maya comments. The smile fades quickly once Katsune continued to speak, depicting her gruesome experiences as a member. FUnny enough, there wasn't a doubt in her mind that any of this was true.

"Huh. . . Sounds like him. Well. . I guess it kind of work? I did comment on how strong you are emotionally."* - Thu Sep 10 15:40:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) hums. She has a constant, yet hardly noticeably, smirk on her face through this all. Not due to the conversation, but simply because her body was feeling great.

"Hrm? Sounds fun, I guess. Everyone has a particularly way to relieve stress. Do you know the names or faces of anyone in particularly that you -really- wanna beat up?"* - Thu Sep 10 15:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
"Hrm? Someone placed seals on you? Probably to restrict you from doing or saying something. That's weird. . . and scary. Imagine if that was like an explosive seal too, and triggered to explode. I can see why you'd want to beat that person up," Maya says with understanding.

"You've been enjoying your time here at least? Maybe we'll hang out more often, if so."* - Thu Sep 10 16:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) shook his head. Her muddied hand goes to flick Katsune on the forehead -- playfully, of course.

"No. I meant the spa."* - Thu Sep 10 16:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
Upon entry, Misa would be in the lobby. Compared to the outside, it was warmer -- due to the constant usage of heat in the area.

Unlike the others, Misa likely isn't recognized as a Kenryoku member. Thus, upon coming to the desk, the clerk asks for a modest, one-thousand yen. "Good evening, Miss. Welcome to Amegakure's [Insert Spa Name here]. Isuppose you will pay the premium cost? It is only one-thousand yen. And withthat, I can grant you access to the hotsprings or mud bathes. You'll even be given a complementary bikini for each. Of course, the rest of the spa's feature require an additional payment."

Meanwhile, Maya continues to lounge about with a small smirk on her face. "Uh . . .I was with him for about a year -- five years ago. Then I quit. Now I'm coming to work for him again." It was like an ex-girlfriend returning to her abusive significant other.

"You?"* - Thu Sep 10 16:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
"Maybe he's sweet on me? Tch. . Yeah, that's probably it. Surprise or not, I'm back, I guess. Don't plan on going anywhere by this point," Maya replies with a smirk. She fidgets around,. getting into  more comfortable positioning. And for references, she wore a facemask to purify her skin.

Meanwhile, the clerk dealing with Misa immediately changes her tune.

The outfit worn, likely suggests some type of affiliation with the Kenryoku. "O-Oh. . . I apologize, Miss. . ?-- I believe some of your allies are using the. . Err. Mud Baths, I believe. A-apologies again. In the locker room there will be a changing suit free of charge." She hands over a sheet, depicting which locker would be Misa's for use, and a key is even handed over.

Nonchalantly, at last, Maya is sitting back up. The mud now only reaches waist level. Her hands move, and the scroll from before is absentmindedly read. "Sooo. . .What type of fighter are you? I'm guessing stealth and close-ranged, based from what you've said before."* - Thu Sep 10 16:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) snickers.

"Wow. Someone is very confident in their ability."* - Thu Sep 10 16:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) rose her brow at the response.

"Huh? I'd like to see that sometime. If you're comfortable with showing off a little," she replies. The clerk is mystified and exhales once Misa had essentially disappeared into nothing. Certainly, an untrained shinobi had no chance of escaping.* - Thu Sep 10 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) wears a smile.

"I'd like to see you in action. You sound very strong. . . But I wouldn't underestimate Paine and her taijutsu. She works hard. . . And someday, she might be stronger than us all. Even you," Maya replies. That reference to Young Gai, though.* - Thu Sep 10 16:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) yawns while shifting in the mud.

"We've been in here for a while. We oughta leave soon." -- A thought occurred. 

"And you oughta get a facemask too. Should make your skin look better." ALways about appearance with this one.* - Thu Sep 10 16:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
"Hrm? Your skin looks okay," Maya said with a sly grin. Her eyes briefly close shut as she's shifting and getting into another comfortable position. After all, sitting in one spot all day could get irritating.

"It could look better, though. Don't you care about looking really good? I mean, you're a pretty girl. But you could become beautiful with a bit of grooming," the Senju says with a smirk. By no means was the comment condescending. It was simple, she was just that superficial.

* - Thu Sep 10 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
"Suit yourself. I mean, you don't -need- to look better. But hey, I guess there's some logic in it. You're probably gonna end up getting scarred and stuff, so the beauty treatment would be for no reason."

She shrugs, and continues to allow the mask to set in.

Then. . . enough time had passed. More employees speed out, cleaning off the material, and revealing  Maya's renewed face. Her skin is practically glowing. "Finallllyyy. Feel my skin"* - Thu Sep 10 17:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
"You're a soldier? That's why. People tend to suffer from battle scars if they fight a lot. No one is untouchable, you know. Someone will be able to hit you sooner or later," Maya notes. She pokes her own flesh, and smiles at the pleasant feeling.

"C'mon. Feel it."* - Thu Sep 10 17:48:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) frowns.

"Tch. Find, suit yourself. Don't have to feel how good your skin can potentially feel," Maya notes. She does nod in agreement, though. The mud bath had run it's course. She's pushing off the ground, and rising up.* - Thu Sep 10 17:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) has some struggle with exitting. The mud had weighed down on her. 

Once standing, Maya moves ahead with a strut as per usual, and finds the shower head -- which was near their lockers. The water is running, and washing away. It leads a brown puddle to form on the ground before it's washed down the drain.

'"So. This is fun, right? Or was." Her hand runs along her body, helping in the cleaning endeavors. "My skin feels better all over."* - Thu Sep 10 18:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) continued to rinse her frame.

Both hands are in her hair, and shampoo is being implied to ensure that it's as clean as can be. Soap drape over her frame, and casually, she takes note of Katsune. . . showing off her features? Even with a blank expression, Maya's senses are tingling. This was a challenge.

Thus, the action is mimicked. Her bra is momentarily pulled ahead, revealing her full, and endowed bosom. No doubt, it's larger than what you would expect, as the clothes from before seemed to be holding everything together. She'd grunt, allowing the water to wash away whatever mud was within the bikini, while purposely forcing her goods to jiggle. 

Meanwhile, after allowing the top to go back to it's previous position, she's doing subtle poses, showing off her figure -- things such as hips, thin waist and supple bum. While Katsune could be described as a child on the cusp of completely maturity, Maya on the other hand, was built like a fully grown woman. There's a slight yawn -- a taunt perhaps?

"Yeah. We should do this more often."* - Thu Sep 10 18:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) grinned in a subdued fashion. She had won the battle from the looks of it.

"Yeah. . .Hrm. Maybe the hotsprings?" Maya says in a sing-song tone, still feeling good over the victory. Even if it was something as petty as a competition of looks.

By now, the water is turned off as she's cleaned. And a towel is ran over her frame. "I'm sure it beats lounging around the village, right?"* - Thu Sep 10 18:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) doesnt' take notice of the synchronizing time.

She's moving in stride, going to the locker. Her clothes are quickly taken out. "Maybe next time, you can decide what we do. It'll be boring if I dictate everything all the time."* - Thu Sep 10 18:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) follows suit. The wet bikini is placed on the bench, and soon she's standing in the nude. SHortly after, a fresh pair of underwear is worn and her usual attire is slipped on.

"Huh. . " Maya comments calmly, still reeling from their brief battle. Her eye traces over Katsune's frame, and more of her pride is swelling -- cause she deemed herself to look so much better.

"What were you going to suggest before this?"* - Thu Sep 10 18:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) chortles.

"So you really didn't have anything? Why lie?" She says after the chuckle subsides. Boots are applied, and her hair is combed out.

"Let's head out."* - Thu Sep 10 18:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) notes the eyebrow twitch. She speaks as politely as ever, regardless.

"Is. . .Something wrong?"* - Thu Sep 10 19:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) shock her head. She seems damn curious now.

"No one really needs healing at the moment. What's wrong though. . .Did I say something wrong?" What an angel Maya was. Her tone never shifts into a rude one, in fact, it's a tone that suggests concerns.* - Thu Sep 10 19:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
"C'mon. I can tell it's something."

Despite being so polite, Maya can kind of infer. Katsune was feeling a bit sour about her body being less developed -- much to the Senju's delight. She'd never make that satisfaction publically known, of course.* - Thu Sep 10 19:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) still wore a concerned look, but was actually grinning ear to ear on the inside. She had defeated this chick -- hard.

"Yep. I enjoyed it. Let's head back to the others, though."* - Thu Sep 10 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) proceeds to the south while sporting the 'Peace Sign.' Deviously, the kunoichi is still grinning on the inside, estatic of her victory.* - Thu Sep 10 19:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) ||
Back to old grind. Once more, she had to continue her efforts in the Chakra No Mesu technique. After all, even with the continued growth, the jutsu was far from perfect, and still completely impractical not only for combat, but perhaps even for surgical uses. In the day previous, Maya had come a long way, and sought to run off that momentum.

Carefully, her mind remained geared towards the three portions of chakra control - each of which was an important part of the jutsu's production mind you. With a huff, after doing three differing hand signs, chakra is built and pumped from her belly. The belly, which is where the bulk of one's ethereal energy was pooled after being produced by the heart, is soon rupturing. There's a warm feeling - as if she were suffering from indigestion.

Of course, this was far from the case. It simply remained a product of Maya's unwavering will and naturally positive chakra. Eventually, after a minute flat, a good chunk of strength had been built up, and thus allowed for the next portions of the technique to go underway. Using impeccable chakra precision, she's guiding all that accumulated energy upward, as if it were a stream of water running along to a larger body of liquid - an ocean even. All of this goes on seamlessly. . . Up until the hand area had been reached!

Chakra is resonating clearly and easily. It eventually manifests beyond the usual tenketsu, and forces the hands to gain a vibrant glow. Initially, the flow of energy is unrestrained and seemed to be unruly at that. It holds no forms and seems to flee from Maya;'s flesh.

However, while seemingly raw or unprecise in nature, this jutus at least had refined the process of the first Chakra control step. She was not only releasing an accurate amount of chakra juice, but also using it to perfection - or near it. This fact isn't unnoticed, and prompts a wide, silly grin to manifest onto the Senju's features. Sadly, even with the clear  improvements, Maya remained as unsatified as ever. Her work had yet been completed.

At once, the chakra flowing is reeled in, and bent to the woman's will. As domineering as can be, she does her best to form the chakra to her likely, and eventually. . . It actually heeds her command. No longer was it flowing like a river during a powerful storm. Rather, each particle of energy moved with a degree of tranquility, which suggested that the Senju was in complete and utter control. Without a moment's rest, her hands are pressed against the doll's frame.
As a reference, the doll was simply a training device with transparent flesh to reveal its internal workings. Thus, she could practice the surgical aspects of the ninjutsu, while subsequently gaining a higher degree of control, and logically be enabled to use this in battle potentially. Well. . . Once her chakra chakra had reached a certain thresh hold. 

Chi pulsated from her hand, and before long, it takes shape, forming blade-like formations. They're sharpened, and seem to be menacing. Before long, as the blades are formed, Maya is at last inducing the jutsu onto the dummy itself. She begins first, doing external incisions. The sharpened edge or borders of the chakra work wonders, easily ripping through flesh and forcing an opening to be formed. "So. . . I can also do external attacks if I want. This could be useful. Although. . . Internal seems to be the best option, after all. You can't train your insides to be more durable."

Upon reading the scroll over the last few days, she had also picked up another nice or interesting tidbit of information. This more or less regarding that fact that was limited durability added to the chakra-cladded hand. Perhaps this granted some clear defensive options potentially when in the heat of battle.

After some experimentation, chakra is again being pulsed outward, and running on the inside of the dummy. Thin, hardly noticeable blades seep through the flesh, and with great precision begins to saw away at the dummy's tendons and other weakened muscles. All through this, the medic's eyes are scanning eagerly, aiming to figure which particularly part of the body would be best attacked. To render an opponent immobile. Of course, these locations were pretty easy to discover.

Eventually, she's done. Chakra flowing comes to a stop, and the Chakra No Mesu is finally at an adequate level, after weeks of restless work. Instead, Maya is seeking to perform another technique - the Genjutsu Dispersions. 

Due to the amount of genjutsu specialist in the Kenryoku, finding one to place her in an illusion was an easy task. Thankfully, there was no risk as she'd now know when an illusion was in place. All that had to be done by this point was simply practice the process in which she'd practice releasing or forcing the fake visions away.

The wind sweeps over the area, momentarily clouding the world. As it comes to a stop, Maya's mind is warped. It's there that she envisions her worse fears - being alone. That's all that there was to it. The world was pitch black, and there was a soul inside. . . Save for the world's residential zombie. Yet his frame was transparent, and quickly fading away. "This. . . This is just an illusion." Maya falls to a single knee, and her heart rate is picking up . . Fast! Even when being instructed, the trauma of the very real fear was taking over. Then. . . She breaths, and proceeds to think of this in a more logical fashion.

"Okay. . . Okay. . . My arms still work at least. . ." But they trembled. In a fumbling fashion, she brings those hands together, and forms a 'Ram' hand sign. At once, the chakra flowing through her body is quickly stopped, with the focus being on the brains. Shortly after, an additional incision of strength is pumped, overpowering the previous genjutsu. Quickly, the darkness fades, and she's being made aware of the actual world.

Sadly, her body is shaking and is overwhelmed in sweat. * - Fri Sep 11 09:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I do . . . Sometimes. - Fri Sep 11 09:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) whispers: Why are you sitting back here? - Fri Sep 11 09:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Maya(Beyoutiful___) continued with her efforts in the genjutsu Kai technique. It was a skill she seemed to struggle mightily against -- yet was still adamant in achieving mastery over. As a medic, with great chakra control, why -not- master the release technique? It could end up; saving her life.

Maya muttered, whispering under her breath as she spoke to the insanely nervous, Concealed Figure. Who could likely be inferred to be. . . Dissida, Paine. Not that this identity was actually a secret.

"Uhm. . .I guess that answers that. But like. . . Why do you always wear that mask? Are you afraid someone will actually see your face?" The Senju spoke politely as per usual, and was seemingly speaking with genuine curiosity. Yet you could never be too sure when it was the oft devious Maya speaking.

Regardless of that, her hand remained percched on the ram handsign. Had there been any sensor in the general area, they'd note the constant fluctuation in one's chakra reservoirs. Constantly, it would be frozen, before eventually being rebooted. And te freeze wasn't in just some isolated point of the body. Rather. . .  It was throughout her curved frame.

Although, the reboot of chakra was actually focused only in the brain.Each time the chakra circulatory system had been evaporated, a flow of strength coming in the opposite direction of the usual flow come running through. Despite the simplicity of the jutsu, Maya was visibly being drained from having to apply so much damn effort. It was a wonder why this D ranked jutsu was proving to be so difficult.

Meanwhile, her eyes are still being placed to the battle at hand.
