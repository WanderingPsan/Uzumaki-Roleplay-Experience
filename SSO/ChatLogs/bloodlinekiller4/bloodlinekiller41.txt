<br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) sat within his room, well the corner of his room. His bed was untouched, he was currently on the ground, his kneens tucked in, his eyes placed over his kneens while slouched over. One seemed about eight years of age, low sniffling was heard from the boy. 

"Sis...*sob* Sis.." the child cried in low sobs, tears flowing from his eyes. His personality in question was the complete opposite of his sister Two.* - Thu Dec  3 23:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) sniffled a little while hearing the door open up, followed by faint foot steps. His heart rate sped, the child grew nervous.. He didn't feel safe, no... Not at all without his sister, especially since he wasn't as skilled phsycially while outside of their shared unisence. He'd look up slowly, he'd sniffled a little while wiping away his tears. His eyes focused on Yuriko as she approached, mostly her pink hair it really brightened up his dull room.

"W-Where is my sister?.." the boy asked, his voice a little shaky, scared even. Though, from the passing seconds he made eye contact with Yuriko he'd look elsewhere even trying to find a way out! But he would try to hide this, he didn't want to be disaplained like the others.* - Thu Dec  3 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) shook his head, he remained quiet while wiping away tears that eventually dried up. His vision was a little bit more cleared now, "..Two..My..Sister is Two.", the listing in numbers, it was probably since he was about a minute older than his sister whom fell short, though despite this she had..quite the personality.

"Will.. You find her?..Can I see her?" so many questions he bombarded Yuriko with. Hopefully, she hadn't known about the two, if he could've manipulated this... He'd find a way to escape. Despite being a bit timid, the child was the brains between himself and his sister.* - Fri Dec  4 00:11:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) "H-Huh?" the boy looked up, sniffling a bit. He was scared but he had to milk this the best he could have. Being good? The scientist were gone? Honestly, he wanted revenge for all of those experiments, the suffering he and his sister went through.  Though.. the thought about being friends, and how Yuriko came off first, it made the boy feel warm inside.. A bit trusting, but he wasn't one hundred percent with it.

His voice was soft, gentle even."R-Really? I can't wait to see sis!!!! I-I'll be g-." the boy stopped, looking blankly at Yuriko as she called him "Thing One" it mad his left eye twitch slightly but he didn't think much of it.. He was the shy easy going one, to his sis... something like that was a major insult.

"Soo.. The mean people are really gone, ma'am?" he'd ask one final time before slowly motioning to his feet, as he did he'd stumble backwards hitting into the wall behind of him. He'd extend a hand outward holding against the wall, using it for support. It was difficult for him while the two weren't joined together, but he was better off than in the past.* - Fri Dec  4 00:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) eyes widened as Yuriko asisted him by holdind on to his hand. "She.. really is nice." the child thought while following side to side with the woman. He'd look at the floor at times, making sure he wouldn't stumble or trip over his own feet! But so far hadn't messed up. He'd look up, looking ar various numbered signs of various other experiments like himself that he hadn't ever come across. Eventually while traversing through the long white hall, he'd look up noticing the number '2" plastered above the door. If no one was paying attention to him or if they were paying attention to him, he'd smile for a second, but the smile was quickly erased from his lips.

Infront of the door he'd call out, "SIS!!! ARE YOU OKAY?!" the boy called out, waiting to se if she'd have answered.

//Two heard a faint voice, she was currently strapped up in a straight jacket, a mussle worn over his mouth. Her legs were chains to the ground, unable to move or free herself. She looked rather depressed, she was eight years of age as well. Though she faintly recognized the voice and tried to call out to her brother, but only slow muffling sounds were heard.* - Fri Dec  4 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) //One eyes opened wide, anger formed in his gut after seeing the state in which his sister was kept. The moment his hand was released, he'd rush forward, almost falling in the process to get ovet to his sister's side."W-What.. Why would they do this?.." the boy's voice was breaking, tears formed in his eyes. 

//Two on the other hand didn't have sympathy for her brother, though seeing him cry ticked her off even more. She'd shake a little within her binds trying to break free, but it was a failure and she hadn't broken out. She'd glared at Yuriko as she approached her, she wasn't sure if to have trusted her or not. What happened to the scientists? She'd lightened up a little while Yuriko undid her muzzle. Though, her face quickly turned soar after hearing Yuriko calling her "Thing Two."

her voice piped up, it was higher than One but she gave off a bossy nature."What is that now?! Another pet name for us?! I'll get you and beat you two a pulp lady!" the girl squirmed a little trying to break free, now Yuriko probably understod why Two was muzzled, that and her tendancy of biting.

//One neared his sister while attempting to calm her down, "Sis.. Calm down. She's here to help, please listen. She took care of those bad people." he'd shot her a glance that meant a lot of things, something that only those two knew the meaning of.

//Two's breathing settled down a little, she'd look away from Yuriko while blowing out steam. She was pissed, but was a little more settled than before. She a waited to be free'd.* - Fri Dec  4 01:07:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) //Two wasn't backing down, to her if someone steped up to the plate, she was going up to bat, she didn't care. As Yuriko pressed her nose against her own, she'd simply rub her nose into hers. A serious look on her face as well, she wasn't timid like her counterpart One. "Oh. Try me." she'd simply say, a smirk worn on the eight year olds face, she was a stuborn brat.

//One tried to reason with Yuriko, "Ma'am please.. She'll be nice.. I promise, she's just..." he couldn't find the right word, he wasn't schooled as much. "She's hot!" then he'd placed his hands on his head thinking.."Headed... Hot headed, yeah!" while saying this he'd attempt to get in between Yuriko and Two but this probably wasn't possible.

//Two on the other hand focused on One, her brother did annoy her but she missed him.. In honestly, despite their differances they completed each other in various ways that Yuriko probably hadn't known. "Fine.. I'll... be.. nice." she said it distasteful, and played with her mouth afterwards as if she'd have a bad after taste in her mouth.* - Fri Dec  4 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) //Two eyes twitched a little while hearing Yuriko's whispered threat. But, she couldn't do much binded plus she needed her brother alive and functioning. She'd simply stare at her but mumbled "Fine." with that, her restraints were undone, her arms were freed, the chains that binded her feet clattered to the ground below.  She'd feel her wrists a bit, while walking around stretching out a bit.

//One on the other hand was excited, a small smile was visible on his face. Though he'd pause to take in the room, the two couldn't do much in this small room, especially since it was closed in. He'd walk next to his sister, "You actually listened to someone? Hahaha." the child laughed, was this a change in personality? Not really, he just was a bit more confident at his sister's side.

//Two spat in One's direction, completely missing him."Shut up and come closer, I'm taking over."

//One's stuttering returned, followed by a sadened face. His boost in confidence twindled. He'd extend a hand outward towards his sister, with Two extending her hand outward two, their hands were joined. As their hands were joined, the two morphed into a single body with Two as the lead! Their outward appearance was Two's body, a female. Her hair was cut short, jagged a bit from the torment she'd suffered through. Though what was different now, was a visible pony tail at the back of her head? Though this was no pony tail, if one looked closer where and pushed away the hair, a sleeping one was seen. One had completely tuckered himself out, he hadn't a nice safe nap in some time and would exploit this, but he was concerned about his sister's actions since she was in control now.* - Fri Dec  4 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*One & Two(Bloodline Killer 4) //Two glared at Yuriko as she called herself and her sibling "Thing one and Thing Two." her body twitched a little, but decided it was better not to react right now.. For now she'd play the part be 'nice' until she'd find those scientist and reak havoc, in doing this she knew she'd have One's asistance as well. Even if she didn't have his help or asistance, she'd make him!* - Fri Dec  4 01:49:13 2015
