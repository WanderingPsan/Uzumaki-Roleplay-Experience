<br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he was tempted to try the technique, he would quickly decide against it, thinking that it would be smarter to read the entire scroll before attempting something that he never had before. So again, looking down to the scroll that he had out, he would begin to read on. Scanning over the text quickly, yet in a way that he would be able to take in all of the information, he would nod at certain parts. Thinking that perhaps he would be able to handle the technique now, he would slowly stand to his feet.

Looking to Taiga he would say, "Well you asked how the training was going, now is the moment of truth." saying such he would quickly stretch a bit. Calming himself down with a bit of breathing, he would slowly do the hand seals that had been indicated inside of the scroll he had gotten from Taiga. He would at the same time get his chakra ready in the same way he would for his other fire jutsu, through instead of sending it to his hands, he would send it on a course to his mouth. Putting his hands up to funnel it, he would let out a small ball of fire, that wavered in shape, and fell away almost instantly. Yet, he had still technically preformed the technique, "Not bad for my first try huh?"* - Wed Sep 30 22:35:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had now learned a new jutsu, his spirits were raised to higher levels than they ever had been in the past months. Looking to Taiga he would smirk a bit, "Thank you for giving me the scroll to let me learn this." saying such he would quickly go back to doing what he had before. Starting with the hand seals that he was doing his best to recall at this point, he would take his time to make sure that he had gotten each one correct. Though, if he made a mistake, he would go back and restart.

While he would be going through the hand seals needed for the jutsu, he would also be readying his chakra, building it up for a good bit of time while he did the seals. Once he was content with both, he would let it rise to his mouth. Quickly moving his hands to his mouth to direct the fire, he would release it. Letting it flow forward a bit, a sad excuse for a ball would form, flying forward and hitting the ground a ways infront of him. This costing him a good bit of energy, he would sigh a bit, "This is always harder starting out than I remember."* - Wed Sep 30 22:52:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he had been told to leave, he would quickly have gotten his things together and started off after Arashiyama. Once they had made it to the gate of Sunagakure, he would listen to what Arash had to say. Nodding to him, he would quickly rumage around in his back and pull out the mask that he had bought before he had lift Kirigakure. Pulling his clothes tight around any skin to block the sun. Speaking to Arash as they walked he would skip his mask on, "Hope you don't mind the mask, the Kazekage gave me permission to wear it outside the village, or on mission, and I value wearing it quite a bit." saying such he wouldn't wait for a reply as he took in the scenery around them as they went.* - Wed Sep 30 23:28:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Having basically had a quiet journey to the first village, he would simply stay behind Arash, not really finding it his place to speak out. Though, as they walked through towards the main building, he would make sure to nod, and give his greetings to the people that they passed, making sure that he didn't come off as a stuck up prick. Though, as they entered the main building, he would be on alert, not that he exactly expected anything to happen, he just assumed that if he were to be quiet for such a long period of time, it would be better off to keep his eyes and mind busy instead of his mouth. Once it was all said and done, he would follow Arash loyaly to the next village, only breaking the routine by drinking from a stash of water he happen to have on him every now and again.* - Wed Sep 30 23:38:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as they went, being relatively used to the climate at this point, and having plently of energy for the time being, though he would on occasion lift his mask to wipe away the bit of sweat that would be forming there. This time around, he decided that he would ignore the villagers. He hadn't seen the other two in his companions talking or acknowledging them, he would take this as a lesson to do the same. Thus, he would ignore them as he went, keeping calm behind his mask. Though, it would be the same as last time, a walk in and out. This time around though as they left, he would reach around inside of his vest, pulling out a bit of jerky for the next distance they needed to travel to the last village he would offer it around, "Anyone?" before nibbling at some himself, making sure he was fufilled by the next town.* - Wed Sep 30 23:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit as he went, he would either hand out the jerky he had offered or just keep the rest for himself, regardless, he would again remove the mask for a moment, wiping away a bit of sweat, "Fine I guess, Well, at least it's not any hotter than it is, right?" saying such he would he would listen to what Arash had said, making sure to rest a bit in the next outpost. Making sure to fill up on supplies before they again set out. Though, as he walked he would find himself looking to Arash, somewhat curious about their leader, "Not to be nosey, but, what's the deal with you? I kinda want to know more about the leader of our squad." asking such he would continue to walk on.* - Thu Oct  1 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Having heard what he wanted from Arash, he would quickly nod, not saying much to him as he listened to what he said. Though from there on out on the way back to the village he would go ahead and remove the mask, whistling a bit as he went. When the gate of the village came into view though, the whistling would then stop, as his excitement to be back would rise to the surface. Quickly following back to the area to where everyone would hang out, he would happily say, "That wasn't but so bad."* - Thu Oct  1 00:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Basically ignoring everything else that was going on in the area, he would take a few steps down away from everyone. Moving to sit to the ground he would start to work on a few hand seals. Taking his time very slowly to make sure he got them all right, he would make sure that zero mistakes were made. At the same time he was doing these hand seals, he would start to build chakra up in his body, being ready to direct it to where he needed it to go.

Once he was ready, he would quickly force it to head towards his mouth, moving his hands to control the flow, as it suddenly burst forward as a shakey ball of fire, as he still wasn't good at using the technique in any way. Letting the ball fall into quick nothingness, he would sigh a bit, wiping his forehead of whatever sweat had built up there. Shaking his head a bit he would then go on to say, "Man this is a bitch to train." saying such he would rub the back of his neck.* - Thu Oct  1 01:19:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he continued to rub the back of his neck, he would decide that it was time to continue to train. Again starting to go over the technique that he was starting to get used to, he would start to go through the hand seals one more time. Once he was sure he was fine with all of them, he would make sure to take proper control of his chakra as well, building it up to the point where he would be able to release it all in one go.

Thinking that it was about time, he would look around to make sure that no one would be in the way. Satisfied that no one would be in the way, he would again let his chakra burst forward, controling it with his hands as he normally would. A large continuous fireball flowing from his mouth, scorching the ground infront of him and leaving a bit of a crater. Letting it die out, he would sigh a bit, still having a hard time.

Looking around one last time to see if anyone was going to make fun of him with all the problems he was having, he would speak out, "Anyone have anything else I could perhaps learn after I'm done with this?" saying such in hopes of distracting them from his slow improvement he would quickly step forward, kicking dirt in the scorched crater he had made. Once he was sure it was filled he would throw his hands in his pockets and wait for an answer.* - Thu Oct  1 01:29:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, being a bit bored with the little activity that was going on around him, he would move a few paces away. Once he was happy with where he was, he would quickly sit. Starting to go through hand seals that he had recently learned, he would continue to focus on them a bit more than a normal person would, making sure that he didn't mess anything up as he went. Though, at the same time he did this, he would be building chakra up inside of his body to go along with the hand seals required with the jutsu.

Getting everything basically where he wanted it, he would nod a bit before sending the chakra towards his mouth. Quickly raising his hands to his mouth, he would release the chakra in the form of a giant fire ball. The ball, would rage forward, going a good ways forward before hitting the ground and causing a small crater, along with a burn mark to match. After a few moments, the fire would burn out, and leave only the scorch marks as a sign that anything had even happened to begin with.

Wiping his brow a bit after he had finished, he would quickly stand to his feet. "Even this is a bit hard for me to advance. . ." shaking his head at the thought, he would quickly look around one last time before thinking over if he should continue to practice or not. Rubbing the back of his neck, he would decide against it for the time being and would speak out, "So, anyone wanna do something?" saying such he would then sit about waiting for a reply.* - Thu Oct  1 20:33:55 2015

Thinking things over on how to make training his jutsu more interesting for himself he would take a few moments. Coming up with nothing really, he would simply decide that he would attempt to make the actual fireball itself bigger. Being that it seemed simple enough, he would shrug before looking around, again checking to see if anything, or anyone would happen to be in range of it.

Having seen that nothing would have been in the range of it, he would start to go through with it all again. This time starting as he usually did, he would go through the hand seals, making perfectly well to see that they were done correctly. Though, at the same time he would start to build up chakra. Though, this time he would make sure to build up a larger ammount of chakra. Storing it away for as long as he thought he would be able to hold it. Nodding as he approached his limit, he would be a bit content with the amount he built up.
 
Thinking that it was pointless to wait and think about it anymore, he would quickly move his hands to his mouth to direct the flow of chakra when it came, he would release it all. The chakra coming out in the form of a larger than usual fire ball, would basically only manage to be around for a matter of seconds before basically dying out. It would seem where he had put all of the focus on the gathering of his chakra, he had forgot about having a good control over it as well.

Shaking his head at this fact, he would quickly go back to the start. Somewhat tiredly, he would go through the handseals again, building up chakra as far as he could go, ready to have a good grasp of the jutsu once he was done. Quickly, again moving his hands to his mouth, he would again release the large fireball, though this time making sure he was ready for it. Though, it would seem as the strain of a second attempt at it would be a bit much as it started to whisp a bit before again, dying out. Shaking his head at this fact he would mutter under his breath, "I should have thought about how to control it when building it bigger from the start." then going about rubbing his neck, he would again check to see what everyone else was doing.* - Thu Oct  1 20:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, he would perk up when he heard that Taiga would be taught something, "Good for you!" saying such he would quickly turn back around. Doing the thing that had become easy for him now. Starting with his hand seals, he would go through them quite easily now, sure that he wouldn't make a mistake. Chuckling at this fact he would say, "Perhaps I do get the hang of things pretty fast?" 

Having said such, he would get on to the next portion of the practice, building up as much chakra as he possibly could. Getting to a point where he was happy, he would quickly raise his hand to his mouth as usual, and quite easily let go a rather large fireball, and one that seemed to hold form, and maintain its exsistance for a good amount of time. By the time he finally let it fade out he would look over to Taiga, "See! Better everytime."* - Thu Oct  1 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Of course. - Thu Oct  1 21:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Well, seeing that you use kenjutsu, this skill will be great for destruction.. - Thu Oct  1 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Mhm...Continue to try. - Thu Oct  1 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, seeing that Taiga was being taught, and yet while it made him happy to see a friend advancing, he would be aggrivated with himself for not being able to catch up to him or anyone else. So in turn, he would get back to the training that he had come to find a bit too normal for him. It seemed he had been lacking in relax time, though he would shake this thought from his head as he sat back to the ground. Chuckling a bit he would then go on to say, "Guess I need to keep going too."

Having said such he would quickly start to go through his hand seals. The idea of messing one up at this point not even entering his mind. While going through them, he would again start to build up fire chakra inside of his body, getting it ready for use. Once he was content with what he had prepared, he would again quickly put his hands towards his mouth, ready to shape the jutsu. Right after his hands had come up, the stream of fire would follow right after. The fire, flowing out in a large continuous ball, would cause a somewhat large crater infront of him, and the ground would be obviously scorched from the use.

Content with what he had done, he would stop and look around from a bit, watching as Taiga was getting closer and closer to learning the technique that the other man was teaching him. Having thought about wanting to stop his own training at first, this sight would suddenly drive him forward, because, as stated before, he didn't want to fall behind anymore than he already had. Thus, he would quickly stand to his feet, ready to see just how big he could make this jutsu.

Having this thought go through his head, he would quickly start to do it all again, basically like a robot at this point, he would quickly start the hand seals, though in his haste to keep up with Taiga and his training, he would accidently mess one up. Cussing himself for this with a few choice words, he would quickly take a few deep breathes before going back to the beggining and starting over, making sure to stay focused this time around. Nodding to himself as he went.

Though, as he did these hand seals, he would be very sure that he could muster all the chakra that he wanted to in order to make this jutsu impressive. Taking more time than he usually would to get the jutsu ready, he would pool in as much chakra as he could. Once he was sure that he had tapped basically all of the chakra he could without having major effects on himself, he would again bring his hands to his mouth, and start to let the chakra flow outwards.

Upon letting his chakra flow out, a fireball bigger than anything he had released thus far would be released, easily being big enough to engulf a person if need be. As he struggled to control this, he would quickly end if before he used more chakra than he wanted, or before he lost control of it in general. Once it was completely over, he would wipe the sweat that would have obviously started to show on his brow, "Well, that was. . .bigger." saying such he would rub the back of his neck a bit before turning to Taiga, already seeing that he had learned something new, "Though I see I keep falling further behind you."* - Thu Oct  1 22:17:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, making his way off to the distance, he would decide again to work on the same jutsu, thinking it over to what he could do this time to make it better. Taking his time with this, he would glance around the area, this time having moved completely away from everyone. Noting that the area was empty, and that the only buildings were behind him. Nodding to himself at this, he would make to to be pointed off to outside of the village before he started to work on anything.

Nodding to himself, he would quickly start to work on the technique, starting first with hand seals that was basically the easiest part of the entire process. Going through them flawlessly, he would go on to start building up his chakra. Getting it ready for the big release that was sure to come once he was fully ready for it. Taking his time with this part of the process to make sure that he didn't over-use chakra where he no longer had to in order to use the jutsu.

Happy with what he had built up, he would quickly go on to again bring his hands to his mouth and look up towards the skyline. Pushing the chakra forward, he would let it fly from his mouth in the form of a huge fireball, heading towards the distance. Only going away when a strong gust of winds blew it back to non-exsistance. Shrugging about this, he would stretch his arms a bit before rubbing the back of his neck. 

Curious if he should continue or not, he would take a few moments to think it over, he could feel himself reaching the end of how far he could take this jutsu, yet, he felt like he hadn't taken it far enough. So, in turn he would quickly decide to see how many he could knock out with a few goes before he decided to call it a day. Thus he would turn back to the skyline, readying himself. Making sure again that no one would be in the attack range.

Again going through the jutsu, he would start off with the hand seals. Having no issues in doing such, before again getting to the chakra building. Taking his time, he would quickly build it up to the required levels. Then, releasing the chakra out in the form of a fireball, of course, the general thing again. Though this time he would continue the process over and over again for as long as he thought he would be able to handle the strain. Once he would finally call it quits, he would rub his face a bit, and fall back onto his butt to sit, tired from the strain.* - Thu Oct  1 22:56:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he would rub the back of his neck a bit, "Well, being that I have use of three different elements, I have a bit of training for Earth Jutsu, but no actual Earth jutsu." saying such he would chuckle a bit, "Sad isn't it?" having said that he would shrug a bit.* - Fri Oct  2 00:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Er. - Fri Oct  2 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 00:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: If I said I didn't have one exactly? - Fri Oct  2 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Then I'd tell you to figure it out. - Fri Oct  2 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . . - Fri Oct  2 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I wasn't a serious shinobi until my brother was killed. I suggest you take your role here more seriously 'less someone dies on your watch. - Fri Oct  2 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I mean, I don't know exactly have one. . .I just want to get stronger, and stop being beaten to easily. - Fri Oct  2 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he wasn't ready in any way, shape , or form for the kick that was aimed at his cheek, he would be hit full on. And being hit, he would stumble back a bit, rubbing where the foot had connected. Somewhat angered by this whole thing, he would simply shake his head, a bit aggrivated, "I'll do my best." basically growling it out, he would quickly go through a few hand seals.

While in the process of the hand seals, he would be building up chakra at the same time. Quickly putting his hands to his mouth, he would quickly release the built up chakra in the form of a large fire ball, heading right for where Yan was standing.* - Fri Oct  2 00:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that Yan would disapear from view, he would already be on alert, ready for him to appear anywhere, thus, he would keep his head in motion. 

Taking him longer than it should have he would everntually turn to realize that Yan was behind him. Once he had though, he was likely to slow to make a move before Yan did.* - Fri Oct  2 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) As he saw what seemed to be a wall of mud coming towards him, he would quickly dash to the side, and leap a bit to get out of the way. Doing an epic roll so that he would be able to come up on his feet once he was in a safe area he would quickly speak out, "You really do know a lot of Earth techniques don't you?" 

Upon saying such, he would wait a bit, hoping to be far enough away that the next time around he would be able to employ his defensive jutsu if need be.* - Fri Oct  2 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Fight now talk later! - Fri Oct  2 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being interupted as Yan rushed forward, he saw that he would be able to dodge out of the way, yet instead, he would stand and take the hit, feeling that dodging seemed a bit pointless at this moment in time if the person was just going to keep coming at him. And in turn, would have his head pushed to the side from the punch. 

And again, being as slow as he was, it was likely Yan would get in another attack before he'd be able to pull one off.* - Fri Oct  2 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Again, simply taking the head, being that he was unlikely to dodge it anyway, he would be knocked back. Coughing just a bit from the blow, he would shake his head a bit. Though, listening as the man spoke, he would basically ignore it. 

Starting to go through some hand seals, being that it seemed the man had stopped his attack for the time being, and during the time he was easily going through the hand seals, he would be building up chakra for it as well. And, once he was done, he would distribute it to the surrounding air around him getting it ready for whatever was to come after he spoke out, "I'm simply biding my time!"* - Fri Oct  2 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that ot was more of a defensive jutsu that he had prepared, he would simply spit back, "Oh please, I insist that you go first, it's only fair." saying such he would be sure to be on the look out for whatever yan was preparing this time around.* - Fri Oct  2 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: I'm so bored. - Fri Oct  2 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) The moment that Yan would have his mouth open, he would let his own jutsu kick into affect. The air around him would spin and ridiculous speeds, hopfully acting as a barrier from the on-coming water technique, and if the water had happened to be faster, it would hopefully block at least a portion of the attack, while he was hit by the first portion, though, regardless, once it was all said and done, he would speak out, "So, how far are we going to take this?"* - Fri Oct  2 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Nodding to him, he would happily accept the scroll, "Thank you so much. . .it was a suprising pleasure to have a little fight with you, though, you could have wiped the floor with me right away, I know." having said such he would pocket the scroll after glancing at it, "Anyway I can pay you back?"* - Fri Oct  2 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: By becoming a good ninja. - Fri Oct  2 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I-I See. - Fri Oct  2 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Thank you. - Fri Oct  2 01:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) While waiting to see what Yan would say, he would quickly pull the scroll back out to look over it. Shrugging a bit he would slowly pull it open and begin to read away at it, curious to see exactly what it contained. Slowly looking over the words written there, he would nod a bit as he went, already seeing that it would work out well for him in the future if he was able to utilize it properly, which meant following the scroll, and then working on the jutsu once he had figured it. Again nodding at this, he would slowly cross the scroll and put it away for the time being.* - Fri Oct  2 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Yo'... - Fri Oct  2 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: When you get the technique down, I want that scroll.   - Fri Oct  2 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Will do. - Fri Oct  2 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: Nothing just reading the good word of god, would you like to hear a scriptture? - Fri Oct  2 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I think I can actually finish it up for you pretty fast. - Fri Oct  2 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Uh, sure. - Fri Oct  2 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: Good man! - Fri Oct  2 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing what Yan had said, he would quickly pull the scroll back out of his vest, thinking that he had to hurry up and finish learning it. Quickly opening it, he would scan the pages, making sure that he would be able to remember the important parts of the jutsu. Though, once he had been over it once, he would quickly turn back to the start of the scroll to read it all again, being that he wanted to make sure that he didn't miss a single thing that had been written down here.

Once he was sure that he had gotten all of the hand movement memorized, he would quickly put the scroll to the side, "All yours, thanks for letting me use it." once he had said this, he would very slowly go through the hand seals that had been stated in the scroll. Taking his time to make sure that he didn't mess anything up, he would at the same time knead chakra inside of him. Mixing it with the earth around him, a sloppily done Mud clone would rise up for a few moments before suddenly dropping  back down and falling to pieces, showing that since he had just learned it, he had no real mastery over it.* - Fri Oct  2 01:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Teach me about him. - Fri Oct  2 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he was done learning the jutsu, he would quickly look around before catching sight of Keiko, immediately interested, he would walk over next to her, "Hey there. I don't think I have met you before, I'm Kang, you are?" simply trying to get a conversation going.* - Fri Oct  2 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: I will! You see God is a great man and this was his sarifice..., another scriptrure, - Fri Oct  2 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He is a man? - Fri Oct  2 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: .... - Fri Oct  2 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: ... - Fri Oct  2 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that she had taken a few steps away, he would follow a bit, though staying a good ways away at the same time so he, himself could be comfortable with the distance, "Ko? Well then, it's a pleasure to meet you Ko." saying such he would stretch a bit.* - Fri Oct  2 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmm. - Fri Oct  2 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: No... God has no shape or form... but he is omnipresent... omnipotent and  omniscient - Fri Oct  2 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Omni--what? - Fri Oct  2 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Koji(Akainu_Hellhound) says: Nice, to meet you as well. - Fri Oct  2 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) At this point he would shrug a bit and throw his hands into his pockets, "Well, anyway. . . " not sure on where to take the conversation hoping that she would somehow keep it going.* - Fri Oct  2 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If he's all that, then why doesn't he destroy the evil in the world? - Fri Oct  2 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: Because then he would be biased; Which he is not... he is a neutral party watching over us... - Fri Oct  2 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: The way I see it...if you can look at evil and do nothing about it, you are even worse than that evil. - Fri Oct  2 02:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mhm, Well, a pleasure to meet you both, sorry for the confusion. - Fri Oct  2 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. Nice to meet you both. - Fri Oct  2 02:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson (Ninjagangster90210) says: Thats the thing about it my brother... If there was no evil in this world that God had rid us from would you be good? How would you measure the goodness of one person? There is no evil therefore good would not exist... thats not the world God created... God created a world were we all could live and experience life. Ofcourse there are  some people who are luckier than others but you cant have the ying without the yang... do you understand? - Fri Oct  2 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Speaking out he would say to Koji, "Well not to be rude, but, if you don't mind. . ." trailing off he would then turn to Keiko, "I was going to see if she wanted to grab a meal with me, being that I find her quite intriguing, and I also need to fill up. . ." having said such, his stomach would actual start to grumble.* - Fri Oct  2 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Perhaps I can get her to train with me later. - Fri Oct  2 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhhamed Hassan(Ziare1) says: We all good? - Fri Oct  2 02:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I guess we can go eat, and then if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you to train with me. - Fri Oct  2 02:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Starts to lead the way to some place to eat that may or may not even exsist since buildings are a damn trap.* - Fri Oct  2 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Having absolutely no luck what so ever in finding a place to eat, he would find his way to an open patch. Rubbing the back of his neck he would basically pull a pic-nic basic and a blanket out of no-where, laying it down on the ground, "You mind this kind of thing?"* - Fri Oct  2 02:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Somewhat happy about her response, he would take a seat on the blanket and open up the basket, which, being lolmagic like the rest of it, held every usually liked pic-nic food and drink from sandwhiches, to assorted snacks speaking up he would say, "Ah, take whatever you want. . ." shrugging a bit he himself would simply munch on a few crackers.* - Fri Oct  2 02:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: So. - Fri Oct  2 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You're from Kirigakure? - Fri Oct  2 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Trying to avoid looking right at her, as he already felt that perhaps she was un-easy around him, though he did find her a bit attractive, though he knew little about her, so he wouldn't exactly know what he would feel about her, other than general interest.

Sitting cross legged as he reached into the basket for a bottle of water, he would take a few sips, making sure to reply to Ko, "Yes, I am, though I didn't exactly fit in, if was as if I was invisible there." saying such he would finally get a good look at her, noticing the tapping, and the blank expression, "Hey. . .is something wrong?" actually worried, being that he was a naturally good person.* - Fri Oct  2 02:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That happens...when you've been away from people for a while. - Fri Oct  2 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he wasn't exactly the best with people he would rub the back of his neck, a sign that he was confused on what to do, so in turn he would say, "Well, you can relax around me. I'm not threatening enough to harm you. . .I just today got beat by an academy student." having a genuine look of shame at this, he would try to hide it by looking to the ground.

Quickly trying to wipe away the look he would then go on to say, "Enough about me though, What do you mean fighting?? If that's the case, take as long as you want, and eat as much as you want. Relax a bit. I can wait a good time to train, being that I just had a spar with that one guy. . ."

Being that he had no reason to harm her, and in actually the reverse, wanted to help her the best he could, the food would be perfectly fine, if not the best made to his ability.

"Well, you can ah, stay around me to get used to people if you'd like. . ."* - Fri Oct  2 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her check over the food time after time he would say, "Do you really think that I'd try to harm you?" sighing at this as a bit of a let down, he would quickly shake it away like he usually did with any feelings that he didn't feel like he needed to show.

"Though being that I obviously wouldn't, does it at least taste good? I know it's hard to mess up a sandwhich, but just want to make sure, haha." having said such he himself would finally put aside the crackers he had been eatting on, to sub out for one of the sandwhiches inside of the basic, unwrapping it to take a few bites himself.

Speaking up one last time, "As a side note,Hopefully my company will be somewhat enjoyable to you."* - Fri Oct  2 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Konoha. - Fri Oct  2 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Taiga. - Fri Oct  2 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, he would start to eat away at his sandwhich a bit faster, a bit hungry. "Well, I guess I'll tell you about my life a bit. . .Born and raised in Kirigakure, basically left out of everything, Then Taiga showed up, with some squad members who were hurt. I helped them get medical attention, and went with them to Konoha, and after a while I guess I found my way here, and somehow joined up with the village."

saying such he would shrug a bit, not wanting to be so rude he would then go on to say, "What about you? You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to, but I'd like to know more about you."* - Fri Oct  2 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 03:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I wonder if she is even enjoying this. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I hope so. . .she is a bit attractive, and keeps on making me wonder everytime she speaks up. She is interesting to me I guess? - Fri Oct  2 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Is still wearing his Kirigakure headband, being that he still felt a bit of a connection to where he was born, though, he was loyal to Sunagakure for the time being.

Hearing what she had said, he would instantly frown, "I- I'm sorry. . ." not wanting to push the subject any further he would rummage around in the basket, pulling out what seemed to be a few more crackers, obviously going back to munching on those.* - Fri Oct  2 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Sometimes. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Should really train my nose some day. Poison would be a really shitty way to die. - Fri Oct  2 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'm not sure what to say . . - Fri Oct  2 03:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) his facial expression being present along with the frown, would be one of general concern, a bit of a sad look in his eyes for her. Not only was he putting himself in her shoes, but, the thought of losing something you cared for generally upset him. Starting down at the blanket they were sitting on blankly for longer than he show have, he would almost robotically chew away at the food while thinking.

"I- " quickly stopping himself he would take the sign of her silence to be that if she was going to say something it was to be important, "If you want to talk about it further, or anything at all, I'll keep it to myself if you'd like. . ." the frown still being portrayed, as general concern was shown in his deep red colored eyes. A few thoughts that he didn't expect entering his head.* - Fri Oct  2 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I think I am starting to care more about this girl. . .is it because the concern I have over what happened to her? Or is it just what happens from being a teen? I need to just keep my head clear. . .I'll zone out again. - Fri Oct  2 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Either this is a very unusual boy. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Or he needs practice. - Fri Oct  2 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: O-Oh. . .I see. - Fri Oct  2 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Alright then. - Fri Oct  2 03:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit after his attempts at trying to comfort her had died out, he would do something out of character for himself, he would lay back, leaving himself completely open to attack if someone were to want to.

Looking up at the sky, and whatever clouds there were brought him a bit of peace, "Well, I'm glad you shared what you did with me. It makes me feel like I am actually helpful to someone for once. . .and I'm even happier it's to someone who has the beauty you do, and is interesting to boot." saying this somewhat monotone, as it wasn't exactly meant to be said, it was himself accidently letting his thoughts speak, as he was too occupied by cloud watching.* - Fri Oct  2 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Definitely needs practice. - Fri Oct  2 03:36:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Fri Oct  2 03:41:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I dunno. . .I don't mind telling you things. - Fri Oct  2 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Telling a stranger such a thing. Either foolish...or poor ability to lie. - Fri Oct  2 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I mean. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I've been in your company for a little while here, not long, and I know your name. If anything you're more than a stranger, and for some odd reason, I really don't mind telling you things. - Fri Oct  2 03:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'd feel obligated to try and stop you. . .likely die doing so. - Fri Oct  2 03:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Sometimes...the best way to help your friend isn't by fighting, you know? - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: True. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: But, I don't have many friends. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Sure, I talk to people. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: But even Taiga isn't but so much of a friend. - Fri Oct  2 03:46:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: But even he isn't someone I would consider a full on friend. - Fri Oct  2 03:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Though, I'd still make up for my screw up if you were a bounty hunter. - Fri Oct  2 03:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Interesting. And someone wants them? - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: The Hokage was overthrown.  - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: And for basically no reason the person who had taken over apparently put it on him. - Fri Oct  2 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct  2 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Then I heard new rumors. - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Murderous man. Killing for no reason. - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Decided to steer clear of that place. - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: That's horrible. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:53:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's nice having you around. . . - Fri Oct  2 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) basically is at the tipping point of realizing or not if he likes Keiko.* - Fri Oct  2 03:54:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Still confused over how he felt in this exact moment he would say, "Oh? Why the sudden urge to spar? I mean if you want to I'm up for it, I doubt I'll be much of a challenge, but I'll try."* - Fri Oct  2 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Raising his eyebrows a bit, he couldn't help but look her over once, an uncontrollable smile coming to his lips as he did so. He finally accepted that he found her a bit attractive. "Well, lead the way then." standing, he would quickly brush himself off and simply leave the food items here to pick up when they returned.* - Fri Oct  2 04:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well? - Fri Oct  2 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ... - Fri Oct  2 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: *squints* - Fri Oct  2 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Berith(BoyUmbreon) says: Iza! - Fri Oct  2 04:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Like, does the same shit, cause ya know.* - Fri Oct  2 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit he would only shrug, "I wouldn't, as I said, I'm not too good." as he said this, he would take a few steps back, taking the time to get ready. Though, as a bit of a cheat, he would start things off, making himself ready if need be.

Going through a quick round of hand seals, which he didn't even need to check being like this particular round seemed like second nature to him, he would build up chakra inside of his body, releasing it to the air around him in preperation for whatever Ko had up her sleeve.* - Fri Oct  2 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I hope she doesn't think differently when she beats me. . . - Fri Oct  2 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Basically at the mercy of the jutsu, all he would manage to be able to do was hold his resolve. He really had no way to counter it at the moment, though he would continue to keep his jutsu at the ready, holding it in place for whenever he would be able to use it.* - Fri Oct  2 04:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Is done.* - Fri Oct  2 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Basically having no clue of where Ko had gone, he would be left looking around somewhat cluelessly as to where she would pop up. Multiple thoughts going though his head at this exact moment, he would feel a sudden tug on his ankles.

At this moment, he would be pulled deep into the ground, sealing all moment except from the neck up. Basically knowing when he had lost, he wouldn't even attempt to move, or cry out. He was used to this sort of thing, and thus simply sighed.

Watching as Ko was seemed to be having a good time, he couldn't help bit let a smirk cross his face, he was glad to see her happy, yet when he realized that he was at the end of getting another defeat added to his record, he would quickly let a sigh replace his smirk. Thus, he would simply close his eyes, actually enjoying the feeling of being unable to move, it was like getting a hug for the first time, and with the darkness that would be to come with the corridor, he was willing to bet it would be pretty easy to nap here. Sometimes it's better to see the bright side of things, right?* - Fri Oct  2 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Snapping back from his ideas of how great it would be to sleep in something like this, he would open his eyes to Ko, and a sudden feeling of wanting to answer any of Ko's questions would enter over him, though it was already really there to start, so it wouldn't take much.

Once it had taken effect, he would keep his normal look, though he would be keeping eye contact with Ko, ready for her to ask him questions, or what not.* - Fri Oct  2 04:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Tell me....everything. - Fri Oct  2 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Never realized. . . this jutsu would be so helpful. - Fri Oct  2 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Not having any control over what was happening to him, he would quietly listen to her question. As soon as the question had left her mouth he would start pooring out everything he thought about her.

 "Well, My first impression of you when everyone else was around, was that perhaps you needed somewhat to talk to, and, being that I didn't exactly know who you were, I wanted to get to know you." only pausing to get his wording completely figured out he would continue on, "And after inviting you to eat, I thought it was a bit cute how you sat, and then I felt terrible for everything you said that had happened to you, and what you have to go through, and to top it all off, the thought of losing something such as your village tore me up on the inside."

Taking another deep breath to continue his speech he would continue to drone on, "Though as we continued to talk, I found myself likeing you, to the point where I couldn't decide if it was simply teen hormones or I actually liked you, and up until we came out here to spar I was trying to figure it out, and when I finally saw you having a good time, I realized, I probably have feelings for you." finally getting it all out, he would finally let his mouth close with silence as an after effect.* - Fri Oct  2 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Looking at her for a moment he would say, "I really want you to stay here." saying such he then say, "That's it." if any form of emotion could still somehow show through, a sad look would be in his eyes.* - Fri Oct  2 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fair price to pay for losing the spar, right? - Fri Oct  2 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Pulling himself out of the ground he would sit on the ground, one knee rested under one of his arms, "That wasn't cool. . .I didn't want you to know that stuff. . .yet, if ever." saying such he would basically fall back to lay down in the darkness.

Sighing he would basically have no real problem, it just bugged him, "You at least could have given me a heads up ahead of time or something." saying such, an obvious bit of depression would shine through when he said this.* - Fri Oct  2 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Looking at her as she tried to hand him what he comsidered a small bit of money, being that he had gambled away that much money recently in fact. Though that didn't really matter. He had no real attachment to money. He didn't have anything he wanted to buy, nor did he plan to want something.

Simply shaking his head at her he would refuse her money, "I don't want, or need that." having said such he would glance at her, wanting to meet her eyes, but not being able to. 

Being that he was forced into this, he felt it was fair for her to have to deal with the lashback from it. So in turn, he would stay laid down, eyes now closed, "How about you have to go on a date with me? You already know how my feelings were progressing, I think it's only fair you have to deal with them."* - Fri Oct  2 05:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: You'd be surprised how hard it is to find willing people. - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Even if I pay them. - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Do you seriously think I would tell you my feelings willingly? - Fri Oct  2 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. I believe you. - Fri Oct  2 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Just wanted to hear you say it. - Fri Oct  2 05:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Anyway, this isn't going to be a normal date. - Fri Oct  2 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm going to make sure you enjoy it, and thus, as a bit of payback, -you- have to take me on one, and actually -enjoy- it. - Fri Oct  2 05:28:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmph. - Fri Oct  2 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fair enough. - Fri Oct  2 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I'll try. - Fri Oct  2 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you say so. - Fri Oct  2 05:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighs a bit, continuing to lay on the ground. "That was still pretty messed up ya know? What if the person you thought you might have feelings for forced you to tell them?" knowing that the odds were that she had no feelings for him, or anyone from the way she treated people.* - Fri Oct  2 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Hmmm. - Fri Oct  2 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: That almost happened to me once. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I was mad even though it never actually happened. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: I was lucky. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Exactly. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: So yeah....I guess that was pretty rude. - Fri Oct  2 05:34:04 2015

Whatever floats your boat." sighing a bit more he would finally stand up, stretching a bit. Reaching into his vest he would quickly grab a mask and slip it onto his face.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, his mood spiking a bit all over the place, he wouldn't reply right away. Thinking his words over, he would manage to contain a few choice words, "I'd much like you as a friend, but I usually don't stick around long enough that I guess?" finally have brought himself back to his usual self, "I usually leave a village around the time I start to make them." 

Leaving it at that for the time being, he would sigh a bit. "Though, if you ever need to talk, I'm sure you can find me if need be." saying such he would simply decide that the issues he was having emotionally before hand were a bit stupid, and he was unsure why he had even had them, and in such he would simply sit back to the ground, and lay back down again, "Sorry for acting that way. I have some issues every now and again." saying such he'd take a couple deep breathes before pulling a kunai out and spinning it around a bit.

Pushing the blade into his hand for a moment, not enough to cut himself, but simply feel the sharpness, he would say, "I'm a bit strange aren't I?" saying such he would slip the kunai back away.* - Fri Oct  2 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that everything he had said had basically been ignored, he would just continue to lie there. "Good talk." saying such he would close his eyes again. Thinking a few things over. * - Fri Oct  2 06:26:08 2015
