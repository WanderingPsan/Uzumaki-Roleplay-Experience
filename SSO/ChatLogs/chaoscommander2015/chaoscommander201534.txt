<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, everyone's panic starting to annoy him, he'd slowly move to sit on the dirt. Slinging his instrument from behind him to his frontside, he'd look it over. Playing a few strings, and then going through the process of tuning them by ear, he'd sigh. They always seemed to be out of line to him when he went to play it. Shaking this off though, he'd close his eyes. Making this half training, half pleasure, he'd start to send chakra into his fingertips, trying to transfer it to the strings as he touched it.

Having his eyes closed now, he'd sigh, ready to start. Starting off slow, he'd strum the instrument, his fingers running lazily over the instrument. Though, as he went, he'd try to pick it up, moving faster and faster before suddenly bringing it back down to a low, quiet type of movement. Going about this for sometime, drawing it out, he'd eventually start to come to a close, sweat already beading on his forehead. Looking around, as he didn't need to focus on the instrument to play it, he'd catch sight of whatever faces would be made, if any.

Sighing now, as he decided it was time to practice, he'd quickly look down to the string required to add his chakra too. Quickly plucking it, his chakra would be sent out with the sounds that it made. Though being that he wasn't focusing on anyone in particular, it would simply fall short, and die out as it didn't have anyone to affect. Once he had done this, he'd look up, not really caring what anyone thought as he moved the instrument to his back, letting it rest where it usually did as he stood to his feet and brushed himself off.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Eri cheated. - Mon Nov 16 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: And I became his student because of it, right Sensei? - Mon Nov 16 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: -------- - Mon Nov 16 07:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Mhm.. - Mon Nov 16 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Course more often than naught he ends up pouting like a student rather than  Sensei. - Mon Nov 16 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling slightly, then, turning into a full blown laugh he'd say, "You two are great. I envy you." saying such, having a smirk on his face as he joked, he'd look to his guitar again, once more strumming it experimentally, thinking of what to play.* - Mon Nov 16 07:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow playfully he'd say, "You go well together. It's kinda adorable."* - Mon Nov 16 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ......................................... - Mon Nov 16 07:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Wait wait wait. - Mon Nov 16 07:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lets just... - Mon Nov 16 07:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Listen... - Mon Nov 16 07:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Looking after her he'd yell, "If you come back and stop being grumpy, You can try and play my guitar~" chuckling a bit more he'd say, "Was just a joke."* - Mon Nov 16 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Eri come back. - Mon Nov 16 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, his smile somewhat dying, as the first good mood he had in some time coming to an end over a simple joke. "You're being a bit dramatic don't you think?" asking such, he'd say again, "This is a one time offer. You come back and cheer up, you can play my guitar." he was unsure if it would work, nor cared. In his mind, he had been trying to Hook his Village's leader up with a hottie, but, guess that was wrong?* - Mon Nov 16 07:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow as she decided to sit next to him, he'd be unsure of how to react. He was trying to help Ortho out, but it had seemed it had backfired. Shaking his head slightly, he'd hesitantly undo the strap of the instrument around his neck, holding it up a bit, "Are you gonna stare holes into it, or try and play it?" 

Now trying to hand it over he'd say, "Perhaps Ortho would like to try as well?" hinting that the mofo needed to get down here and fix this somehow.* - Mon Nov 16 07:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why is he acting like a pussy? - Mon Nov 16 07:27:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her walk off, assuming Ortho was to follow he'd yell, "It'll be here when you get back." refering to the instrument. "Though, I may be napping, the grass seems rather nice." saying such before laughing he'd mumble under his breath, "Good luck." to no one in particular as he laid back into the grass.* - Mon Nov 16 07:33:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Like, how you gonna cause so much RP, and get our hopes up so much, and just bail .-. - Tue Nov 17 00:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: -omit- - Tue Nov 17 00:59:18 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 17 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: How did you figure out you could use your skill in guitars to cast genjutsu? - Tue Nov 17 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? Figure out. . .Hm. - Tue Nov 17 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well, I figured. . . - Tue Nov 17 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Genjutsu is triggered by sight usually? And being that it's one of the senses, it would only make sense if I could do it by attacking one of the others. - Tue Nov 17 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: In this situation. - Tue Nov 17 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hearing. - Tue Nov 17 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: And being that I'm not the most physically fit person, Genjutsu was my only option. - Tue Nov 17 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: So I tried it. - Tue Nov 17 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: After a bit of tweaking and thought, it eventually worked. - Tue Nov 17 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's truly impressive. - Tue Nov 17 01:16:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Tue Nov 17 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you say so. - Tue Nov 17 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just seemed logical to me. - Tue Nov 17 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That logic goes far, Hatsujin. You should give yourself more credit. - Tue Nov 17 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll give myself more credit once I can use it effectively. - Tue Nov 17 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I need to improve. - Tue Nov 17 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Simply stopping movement isn't enough. - Tue Nov 17 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you have anything in mind? - Tue Nov 17 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh. . . - Tue Nov 17 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Being able to end someone's life, or simply end brain function eventually would be nice. - Tue Nov 17 01:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: If I can use my mind over strength to do my work. . . - Tue Nov 17 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: It would make things easy. - Tue Nov 17 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Maybe you look into Fuuinjutsu a bit. - Tue Nov 17 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Tue Nov 17 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why is that? - Tue Nov 17 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're smart. Fuuinjutsu could help you enhance that. - Tue Nov 17 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh. . . - Tue Nov 17 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: But what would I do with it? - Tue Nov 17 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Seal things into scrolls, set traps. - Tue Nov 17 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Have to think smart. - Tue Nov 17 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm. . . - Tue Nov 17 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I guess perhaps I could. - Tue Nov 17 01:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I've simply kept myself to Genjutsu for a long time. I'll have to get someone to help me with the basics. - Tue Nov 17 01:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Anything we can do for now? - Tue Nov 17 01:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't want to have you fab too much in Ninjutsu. - Tue Nov 17 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: So for now, just bear with me. - Tue Nov 17 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh. . .I meant in general. - Tue Nov 17 01:43:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit, looking around and noticing Eri as she had shown back up, and then to Ortho "Hey, you guys get stuff handled?" asking such, he'd move to turn his body to face them, still sitting in the grass, "I was a bit bored."* - Tue Nov 17 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Ortho. - Tue Nov 17 02:45:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitarashi(Maruka) says: I want to learn as much as I can. - Tue Nov 17 02:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I need you to be specific. Learning has to be selective from the start so you know what path you want to progress to. - Tue Nov 17 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, suddenly feeling a bit lazy, he'd lay back, guitar on his lap as he closed his eyes, enjoying the feel of the grass.* - Tue Nov 17 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Sensei, you wanted me to learn that genjutsu diffusion thing right? - Tue Nov 17 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as Eri attempted to walk by him, a thought would quickly come to mind, even if he was hesitant about. Speaking to her as she tried to walk past he'd say, "Take this with you, try it out, since you didn't get the chance the other day." saying such, he'd slip the guitar off of his body, obviously catching that something was wrong with Eri.

"Just ah, try not to break it if you would. I only have the one." Smiling kindly as he said such, he'd eye the guitar, hiding how uncomfortable it made him to offer it over to someone else.* - Tue Nov 17 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) ignored said first name, not hearing it.* - Tue Nov 17 03:58:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Simply takes it back, not making a big deal, not even looking at it, before falling back to lay into the grass again.* - Tue Nov 17 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'ma just creep away on that note. - Tue Nov 17 05:34:56 2015
