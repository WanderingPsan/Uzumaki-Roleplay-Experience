<br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing heavily, he would wrap his arms around Khalil, "To be honest. . .I think you'd look better in more feminine clothes. . ." remembering what he had seen yesterdery, he would quickly bring a hand to his nose, trying to quickly clear his mind.* - Thu Oct  8 15:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing a bit more he would say, "N-Nothing." saying such, he would shake the thoughts away. "Anyway! You should try it. . .I-I'd like to see." saying such he would wrap his arms back around Khalil* - Thu Oct  8 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) whispers: Kay, I'll do it but later on! - Thu Oct  8 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mhm. - Thu Oct  8 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Just now realized how close together they were. Thoughts flooding his head again, he would panic, very anime style, and somehow fall out of the bed into the floor.* - Thu Oct  8 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Staying in the floor he would say, "C-close." it would now be plainly obvious that around Khalil, his personality may as well be the opposite of normal. Though, somewhat shaking it off, he would reach up to take Khalil's hand, and yank him to the floor with him instead.* - Thu Oct  8 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh.   - Thu Oct  8 16:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) watching as Khalil leaned in, he would quickly force his way up, flipping their postions. It would seem Geralt had lost it a bit, as his hands went to wrap around Khalil's butt. Leaning forward, he would kiss the boy quite forcefully. Only once he had broken the kiss would he realize what he was doing. Quickly backing off he would say, "P-Perhaps we should just nap a bit more. . I don't seem to be completely rested. . ."* - Thu Oct  8 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I wouldn't have done that if I was fully awake. . .I would have been able to stop myself. - Thu Oct  8 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Alright, Nap time! - Thu Oct  8 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: 3DS* - Thu Oct  8 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, having made his way out of the house, he would quickly sit. He had been acting too nice lately. Something about Khalil did that to him for some odd reason. Shaking this off, he would quickly revert now that he was away from him, he happy face would go back to its usually dark, and apathetic version, and the general feel around him wouldn't be as light as it was before. Stretching a bit, he would slowly reach inside of his coat. It was time he get back to doing what he normally would.

Opening the book with an evil smirk, he would take a quick look around the area. Being that he didn't see anyone, he would slowly set the old, blood stained book down in front of him. Once he had done this, he would slowly flip a good couple pages in. Taking his time to read through it carefully, he would make notes of certain things within the book. What he had to say, and do and so on. Though, once he was done, he figured that he needed to get better at actually doing it as well.

Pulling his hood up over his face, he would slowly begin to read away at the pages. The words, making the air around him feel a bit dark and suffocating, would be almost inaudible. Though, of they could be heard, they would sound like something straight out of hell itself. They had no coherent meaning, and unless you were part of his group, there was almost no way at all that you would be able to understand what the words meant, or what would come forth once he was done with them.

Once he had finished reading off the words, he would quickly shut the book, speaking allowed, "Enter!" and once he had said such, a dark hole would basically rip open beside him. A dark aura emanating from it, the air around would begin to crackle. Bits of dirt and loose material would begin to get sucked in as the portal began to stabilize. It was clear that whatever was going to enter from the never ending darkness, wouldn't be anything human, or anything that people had probably seen before.

The portal, finally stabilized, would basically sit, hovering over the ground as two small red, clawed hands appeared at the side of it. The beast inside would start to pull itself out, but by bit more would begin to show of it. First, the head would begin to appear, a ragged, red thing with small horns atop its head, Sharp teeth, and piercing eyes. Followed by the rest of his red body, and ending with its devil like pointed tail. It looking around, would let out a small screech as it was glad to once again be free to roam, even if it was at a masters command.

The portal at this point would slowly begin to waver, getting smaller and smaller before suddenly just blinking out of existence at if it had never even been there to start with. Left where it was, would be a general feeling of discomfort, as if something completely evil had been there before. Looking to his imp he would think, <This feeling is what I missed, this dark foreboding feeling that I could cause death at any point. Perhaps I need to distance myself from Khalil. Or just drag him into the darkness with me. . > 

Having gotten this thought out of his head, he would quickly look to the monster that he had called forth, "You. Go grab me something to eat. I don't care what it is, or where you get it. Also, don't be seen. I don't need a mob after me once again." Having said such, being that he had described what he considered food to him once before, he would watch as the small beast began to run off, at  rather fast speeds while keeping to the shadows and buildings to avoid people's sight.

The beast's point of view now, would be one of a larger world, being that he stood at waist height to most people. Scampering through the streets, he would run past vendors, and stalls, stealing food as he went. He was rather fast, and the odds of him being seen or caught were unlikely, unless someone with a good eye was able to catch sight of his form. Once he was sure that he had gathered enough for his master, he would quickly make his way back, handing it all over happily.

 Once he had gotten the food from his imp, he would hide most of it away in his large coat, though the rest, he would start to munch on. Smirking, while eyeing the monster, he would silently hand some over, thinking for a moment before saying, "I guess you deserve this at least for your hard work." Though, he would only shake his head as he watched the little monstrosity begin to eat away at what he had given it. It was a mess, and had no care for dropping bits and pieces, it would simply pick them back up and eat away again.

Once he had eaten, and he was sure that the little monster in front of him had gotten his fill, he would shake his head, "Time for you to leave now, I'll summon you again when I need you." Upon saying such, he would quickly mumble a few words that were universal in his religion for sending back the beast that you had summoned before stating, "Exit." Once he had done this with rather fast speed, and no fumbling, he would watch what would unfold again.

The same type of portal that had brought hr beast here would rip open under its feet. Dark aura again being held around it, he would bask in the feeling. Watching as the portal began to suck the monster back down, he would let out a rather evil sounding chuckle, he was loving the feeling that he was getting from practicing the satanic arts that had been passed down to him as a child from many satanic priest. Once the beast was completely gone, and the portal gone, he would let out a disappointed sigh before standing to his feet and beginning to walk off. He needed to find something else to do.* - Thu Oct  8 17:03:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: You guys seem to be having fun. - Thu Oct  8 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Maloth(Gtgoku88) says: Hrm. . ? - Thu Oct  8 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) A soft look coming to his face, he would say, "Calm down Kahlil. . . Just get some knew ones right?" nodding a bit he would say, "Everything will be fine." though, saying such he would sigh a bit, walking over to attempt and pat him on the head a bit.* - Thu Oct  8 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing what was happeing between Maloth, and Khalil, he would instantly step between the two, taking whatever mud would be flund in the direction of the two, and shielding Khalil from it. 

He didn't like was was going on, and as he wiped the mud from his face he would contain himself as he said, "Leave Khalil alone." saying such in an apathetic way, he would quickly turn away, something very. . .off. . .with him at the moment. "Khalil, I suggest we leave."* - Thu Oct  8 23:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bremusa(Ej247) says: We amazons are raised up on to be warroirs, how to hunt, how to well previde for our selfs. Though we all care very much for one another and when there is trouble we all fight to deffend and protet our home. - Thu Oct  8 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) at this point, finding himself being a bit angered, he would speak to Khalil as Maloth started to talk. "Close your eyes, deal with it for a moment, we'll get you cleaned up here in a bit." 

Having said such, he would calmly reach into his jacket, while keeping his back to Maloth. Flipping open the book, he would turn a few pages. Getting to one that he had almost never used in the past, he would start to read, and if Khalil was listening, he would know what was to come. Reading off words in a weird, satanic sounding language, he would let a sigh release from his mouth as he came to the end of the sentence.

Quickly putting the book away he would state, "Enter." upon saying such, a dark black portal would open up, rigth beside himself, and infront of Maloth, though likely after the mud had been kicked. Two large gray claws would suddenly appear at the edges. Pulling itself forward from the portal would be a monster unlike anything anyone had likely seen before. Having wings, sharp claws, and teeth, it would be a gargoyle straight from hell.

Once this beast was fully out, the portal would close behind it. Geralt turning, keeping a straight, and apathetic voice would say, "Sir, I kindly ask that you stop, and let us be on our way?" it almost killing him to speak in a nice way with the large man.* - Thu Oct  8 23:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) having simply wanted to leave at this point, before Paine even had a chance to attack his gargoyle, he would simply say, "Exit." causing a portal to rip open below the beast, sucking it back to where it came from, which it obviously didn't want to go back to. Once he had done this, he would quickly speak out, "Sorry for troubling you all, -we- shall be going now." 

Having said such, he would quickly reah behind him, grabbing onto Khalil, and moving as fast as he could past everyone with Khalil in tow. 

(Note, they are both still covered in mud as they leave.)* - Fri Oct  9 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Bringing Khalil to a clothes shop, he would slide his own coat off, revealing a slender, athletic build, "Alright, let's get new clothes." <Or in my case, new clothes of the same exact think I have now.>* - Fri Oct  9 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) having been walking around with onlly boxers on at this point, being that he cared not for a changing room, as he didn't care, and he let the shopkeeper know it, he would hear Khalil speak out. Looking to him he would say, "Yea, one sec, let me get dressed." having said such, he would basically pull the same exact thing he normally wore off of the shelfs, before putting it on.

Nodding, he would begin to look around for clothes-- Girl clothes. Pulling out a few cute things from dresses, to skirts, leggings, to Blouses. Basically anything girly you could think of, he would hand through. "Your pick~"* - Fri Oct  9 00:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) blusing a bit at first, he would contain himself the best he could, "I-It's probably good you picked one of the less-girly outfits out of all that stuff. . .I wouldn-" pausing he would simply say, "Nevermind. . .You look. . .cute" upon saying such, he would simply rub the back of his neck, thinking to himself.* - Fri Oct  9 00:42:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) would lead them back to the house they had been staying in, dropping off his dirty clothes, and plopping onto the bed. "Standing up to brutes like that are a pain." closing his eyes he would stretch out a bit, obviously comfortable.* - Fri Oct  9 00:57:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) opened his eyes back up, looking to Khalil's cute apparence and posture. Blushing a bit he would mumble, "So far away. . ." though, it would be at that point in loudness, where Khalil maybe, or maybe not heard it.* - Fri Oct  9 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Hm? - Fri Oct  9 01:06:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) would quickly, forcefully, and hungrly, pull him in, pulling him to the bed and holding him in a tight hug, burying his face into Khalil's Neck, "Much better." it would seem that Geralt was in the mood to be spoiled today.* - Fri Oct  9 01:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) planting a small kiss on Khalil's neck, he would rub his face against Kihalil's neck again, "Oh shut up. . ."  saying such, his hands would go the the small of Khalil's back, holding him tightly.* - Fri Oct  9 01:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) enjoying the feeling of being close to someone, he would let out a few enjoyed sighs of air as Khalil's fingers went down his back. Apparently, Geralt weak point was being spoiled, and he was clearly enjoying every second of it. 

Reaching out, he would wrap both of his hands around Khalil's butt, not purposely, it was just the easiest thing to grab a hold of. Once he had done this, he would keep his face buried in Khalil's neck, face blushing. Mumbling, "Still not close enough." while trying to pull him closer, via the hold he had on hid butt, trying to cut any distance between the two of them.* - Fri Oct  9 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Not letting his grip go, he would simply say, "I'm fine with this for right now. . .I think." saying such he would stare at Khalil, it was obvious that Geralt wanted to do more, and, hoenstly, he probably could get away with it pretty easily. But, it seemed that Khalil was the one person he didn't want to hate him. His hands, moving away from Khalil's butt would go to his back instead, rubbing it a bit as he put his head onto Khalil's chest. It seemed this was for whatever reason comforting to him, "I-I. . um.  .like to be spoiled this way is all. . ."* - Fri Oct  9 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) being that he had been so lost in thought, and what he had been doing, he wouldn't even register the noises coming from the village. "It is honestly me who should be thanking you." having said such, he would pause a second, his fingers scrunching up against Khalil's back. "I'm not the cute one. You are. . .I just like to be spoiled.

Having said such, he would quickly lift his head, moving to Khalil. Bringing his mouth towards Khalil's, he would attempt to kiss him, pretty heavily at that.* - Fri Oct  9 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) having his hair ruffled, he would let out a small sound of bliss. Enjoying the kiss, he wouldn't let Khalil stop intially, trying to make the kiss last longer. Though, having his lip bitten, he would go completely silent, he was on the edge of something at the moment, and the wrong thing could set him off. Though, hearing Khalil's next statement, he would blush full red, "I love you too Khalil!~" saying such he would lean -very- forcefully into Khalil, kissing him again, and trying to insert his tongue into his mouth, he was starting to lose control a bit.* - Fri Oct  9 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Hmm... - Fri Oct  9 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Slowly pulling back from Khalil after their kiss, he would obviously be craving to go back in for another one, as he stared at Khalil's lips. "P-Perhaps we should stop. If we keep going. . .I'll do bad things to you." saying such he would lick his lips just a tad before Leaning, and burying his head back into Khalil's neck, and closing his eyes, fighting off the thoughts he was having.* - Fri Oct  9 02:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling a bit greedy over Khalil he would say, "Not really. . .I like this. . .but if you want to go you can." the temptation still running through his head about having his way with Khalil, the though that came to mind next quickly made him turn away from Khalil and grab his nose a bit, stopping the flow of blood that was likely to go there.

Deciding that he needed to change the subject before he lost complete control, he would quickly turn back, "Hey Khalil~" before suddenly, and basically for no reason, started to tickle him, wanting to tease him a bit.* - Fri Oct  9 02:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Continuing to tickle him for some time, he would finally come to a rest, on top of Khalil, "I don't really want to go out around other people right now. . ." he was obviously enjoying his time with Khalil and wanted to keep it that way, "I know I'm selfish. . ." saying such he would reach forward, catching Khalil's chin, and slowly rubbing a thumb across his check, looking at him with this really happy, dumb look.* - Fri Oct  9 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing Khalil's question, he would get pulled into a kiss before he could answer. Kissing back, heavily, he would say, "I'd make sure you were around." pausing he would then answer the other question with, "I'd probably be at another village now, and a lot more people would be. . .well, not living."  having said such, he would rub his neck, thinking that perhaps that this wasn't the best thing to talk about, though, leaning forward he would whisper something before meeting his lips to Khalil's again, biting at his lower lip, and getting strong hold with his arms, which would wrap around Khalil.* - Fri Oct  9 03:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: I'm glad I met you of course though. . .It's probably better this way. - Fri Oct  9 03:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing Khalil's promise, would, at this point almost drive him to do all of the dirty things he had been thinking of. Though, instead, to stop himself, he would quickly bury his face in Khalil's neck, biting down on it a bit, -playfully- while interlocking his hands behind Khalil, and pulling him as close as he possibly could to him. There would literally be no gap between the two of them at this point as Geralt began to breathe a bit heavily.* - Fri Oct  9 03:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Mmmm. - Fri Oct  9 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) hearing what Khalil had said, he would finally lose control, leaning hard into him, and kissing him, attempting to force his tongue in a bit. Though, once he had pulled away, his face red, and breathing a bit ragged, he would say, "Are you sure?" though, not really waiting for a response, his hands would move down to grab ahold of Khalil's butt. He would however contain himself here to listen to Khalil's reply, though, how Geralt was going, it might not matter.* - Fri Oct  9 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) stopping dead in his tracks, only knowing in theory on what to do, and never having actually done it before himself, he would turn his face away, only now getting embarrassed over this whole situation. "What's with the sudden willingness?" trying to hide his embarrassment with a question, he would find himself looking back, eyes all over Khalil's body.* - Fri Oct  9 03:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Well... since we are dating, we have to do it...?  - Fri Oct  9 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) having his upper clothing removed, he would be blushing a bit, even more so when Khalil started to touch his chest. Though, he would be too distracted as his own hands went to feeling up Khalil's chest as well, stopping to play with one of his nipples a bit, curious to how he would react to it. Though, at the same time, he would somewhat lay his head on Khalil's bare chest, injoying the heat, and the heartbeat within.* - Fri Oct  9 03:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing a bit as he looked to Khalil, moving a bit to get comfortable, though, it was a bit hard being that he was so 'excited'. Slowly speaking he would say, "Whatever feels good. . ." looking away a bit he would rest a hand on Khalil's face, running his hand across it, "I m-mean we had this conversation somewhat before, but really, just whatever feels good."* - Fri Oct  9 03:42:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) A bit embarrassed himself, he would somewhat look away as he reached out for Khalil's hand, and pulling it to his own buldge, placing it on it, or at least on top of the underwear. Doing the same with his own hand to Khalil's, he would rub it a bit, "S-see." while saying this, his one free hand would go to Khalil's butt, rubbing it quite well.* - Fri Oct  9 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Embarrassed by the whole thing, he would remove the underwear Khalil had been wearing, revealing him completely. Looking at his size he would say, "You aren't that bad either." though, before he could say anything else,  he would feel Khalil's hands on him. Enjoying the pleasure, he would let out a feel sounds, that really can't be described. "Y-You're too good. . ." saying such, he would have one of his own hands go to Khalil's, rubbing it a bit, though, while he wanted to please Khalil, he was more focused on something else, as his free hand would go towards Khalil's but hole, tracing around it, and such.* - Fri Oct  9 04:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing heavily, he would say, "I-if you say so." upon saying such, he would move forward, more of wanting to play with it first, as he prodded it a bit with his fingers. Being that he didn't have much experiance, and he wasn't sure what else he could do to make things easier for Khalil he would say, "R-ready?" as he rested the tip of his member against Khalil's hole, waiting for an okay from the boy. * - Fri Oct  9 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Licking his lips a bit, he would say, "If it hurts, let me know. . .and we won't have to do it" having said such, he would -very- slowly begin to insert himself into Khalil, making sure that every little bit he'd check to see if Khalil was alright before he thought about the pleasure, or anything else.* - Fri Oct  9 04:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Something the matter? - Mon Oct 12 16:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: *Mental sigh* This acting nice thing is a bit old, I'd rather go down with a blaze of glory than continue this bullshit. - Mon Oct 12 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Mon Oct 12 16:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Simply shrugs a bit, looking to the kage, "Are you sure? Your actions say otherwise." having said such, he would pull out an old black book obviously worn with age.

He would thumb through it while waiting for a reply.* - Mon Oct 12 16:32:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Finding himself somewhat bored, he would simply sigh, he was sick of pretending to be the nice guy around the area. Thus, in turn he would find himself flipping to a page in his book, that honestly, rarely ever saw use. Glancing it over, he would smirk. He figured it was about time to use it.

Thus, he slowly mumble the words that were written on the page. If someone was close enough to hear them, they would be a very satanic feel and sound to them. Though, once he was done, he would tuck the book away back into his jacker, only speaking out once he was done, "Enter." Having said such, a dark portal would open up beside him. Dark gray clothes appearing at the edge of the portal would slowly pull the mass of the body foward.

A beast, pulling itself from the portal would eventually show itself fully to stand beside him, the portal closing. Looking around the area, his eyes would settle on Kagami, "Care to play a game of life and death?" having said such, he would put himself behind his newly summoned ally, ready to fight now that he had dropped his mask of friendlyness.* - Mon Oct 12 17:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he hadn't heard a reply from the man infront of him, he would begin to get a bit aggrivated. "Hmph, It's no fun if you just stand there." having said such, he would quickly look to the one beast he had already summoned. "Perhaps one of you wasn't enough of a threat?" shaking his head at this, he knew that he wouldn't be able to summon another one, as he didn't yet have the skill to do it.

"We'll just have to find another target." upon saying such, he would motion for the Gargoyle to follow him, he was sure that he would be able to find someone to kill off. And thus, he would begin to explore the village, monster in tow. It was obvious that he planned to pick a fight, he was -absolutely- sick of the nice guy act he had, and after Khalil had basically left him, he had no reason to keep it up.* - Mon Oct 12 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Maloth? - Mon Oct 12 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had been walking around, he would have caught sight of Maloth first, thinking that perhaps he would be a perfect target, though his mind would quickly travel back to the time that the man had basically man-handled his beast. Thus, looking around once more, his eyes would land on what seemed to be a black haired fan user. "Perhaps you'd like to play a game of life and death?" Saying such while raising an eyebrow, the gray, living beast beside him would step to put itself between Geralt and Marrisa.

Looking to her he would again say, "Care to oblige me?" having said such he would wait for a response, he would allow that much before starting something up.* - Mon Oct 12 17:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ossa, Baen(Ama No Murakumo) says: Oooh, fun. - Mon Oct 12 17:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow at her, he would simply shrug, "I have about fifty-grand on me. Take it if you kill me." having said such, he would quickly step to where he would be directly behind his own monster. 

It would seem that while he liked to pick fights, he never liked to attack first. Staying behind his monster he would speak out, "And it even seems we will have a spectator." having said such he would chuckle. He would have a someone to watch as he either died in battle, or got another kill to his record.* - Mon Oct 12 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow he would speak, "How noble of you." chuckling a bit after saying such. Though watching as the womans fan lit on fire, he wouldn't move, and neither would the beast that he was using. He would simply stay behind it, waiting for the women to move, he had no reason to rush off when he could make her come to him.

Though, as he though about it, he was curious to if she would ever attack or not.
* - Mon Oct 12 17:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he been a bit lost in thought, he would be surprised with her sudden actions. Not exactly as fast as the attack that was coming, he would think to attempt to dive out of the way, though thinking better of it, he would stay planted behind his gargoyle, and duck down, hoping that his monster would take the brunt of the force.

His beast, taking the hit would basically scream in pain and horror as it began to burn to death. Though, as it quickly died out, a good portion of the flame would still come through and hit Geralt. Basically lighting his coat on fire, and burning through to his skin, doing a good bit of damage. Though, being he wasn't going to give up when he wanted the death of the women, he would stand, glaring at her. He had basically reverted back to his normal self, and craved the death of basically anyone he could deal it to, and thus, he would attempt to run at her.

Though it was a feeble attempt, he wanted to close the distance and attack. Though, it was likely he would just arrive at her as soon as she attacked again, but that wasn't really the thought on his mind.* - Mon Oct 12 18:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had blindly rushed forward, he would be unready for the attack that had come when he had gotten where he had aimed for. The sudden rush of air that was coming at him would catch him completely off guard. 

Not exactly having any way to counter the move that had been used on him, he would be helpless while the air caught him, throwing him skyward, and also cutting at him. The invisible blades would quite easily cut though his coat, going through to the skin. This, causing blood to begin to seep out, and basically ruin anything he had on his person. Being, the items he was wearing, and the money he was holding. So, while looking defiantly to Marrisa he would simply think, <At least If I die here, I have the satifaction of ruining the prize she gets out of it.> * - Mon Oct 12 18:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Storm(Sisbro55) thinks: What the fuck is going on. - Mon Oct 12 18:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he was all cut up at this point, and a good height into the air, along with the burns on his back, he would be in no position to try and catch himself as he fell. He knew at this point, that with Kumo's lack of medics, and the way his body was, that in this game of life and death, he had lost. 

Thus, as he fell he would let a small grin form, he would be going off to the land he belonged in, one of fire and brimstone. His body, hitting basically like a belly flop, would cause damage internally. He'd likely be moments from death. Though in this time he would look to Marrisa, "S-seems you have won this battle." upon saying such, he would painfully reach into his ruined coat, pulling out a large sum of bloodied money and dropping it inches from where he had retrieved it.

It was the reward he had offered for the fight, and would be the last thing he did as life left his body.* - Mon Oct 12 18:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit being that the entire village was basically empty, probably because it was being rebuilt, he would take a look around. He figured now was as good a time as any to get to practicing. Thus, he would go to the top of the mountain. Taking a look around to make sure that no one was there, he would let out a chuckle. He didn't know why he was looking, the town was basically empty anyway. Thinking this, he would quickly move towards the water, it would help him in the start, as he had learned when he started this jutsu for the first time.

Forming a hand seal, he would start to focus his chakra, his water chakra at least, as he fed it towards the water. Mixing it with the substance, he would will it together. Keeping his concentration on how much chakra he was using, or trying to at least, he would watch as water-like hands appeared at the edge fo the pool. This, followed by a somewhat shakey mass of water, would pull itself up to the edge, and out of the pool. The mass, standing there would only be a bit of a rough outline at best.

Looking to this and shaking his head, he would start to focus more chakra into it, more than what would needed by someone who had trained it, but being this was only the start of his training, he would greatly over-use his chakra. Forcing the mass to shapen up, it would start to round off and begin to look like himself, at least in shape and not much of anything else. Frowning at this, he figured that perhaps he wasn't controlling it well enough yet and thus, he would again start to focus more on it.

His vision blurring around him as the only thing he was actually paying attention to being the clone, he would continue to push charka, and his focus onto it. Sweating a bit more than any one person should while practicing, the clone would begin to change color to match what he actually looked like, though, he was thinking that this whole process was taking longer than it should. After this thought though, the clone would basically be looking exactly like himself.

Excited by this, he would let his focus slip for a second, which in turn would cause the clone to crash down where it was, making the ground, and his shoes a bit wet. Shaking his head at this he would simply mumble, "Don't get distracted next time, and it'll work out." having said this, he would simply turn to walk back down the mountain, figuring that he was in the clear for the moment, and that he deserved a good break. He was sure he'd be able to find someone in the square.* - Mon Oct 12 22:26:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, he would walk out a good ways, having gotten a mission from his kage. Opening the scroll, he would slowly read through it, curious to what she would want from him. Though, as he looked at it, he would only find disapointment in the mission. He could have obviously been assigned something more exciting, but, who was he to complain to the current leader of his village. Already having a game plan in mind, he would start to walk off in an eastern direction.

Having gone off and found himself a wagon, and a shovel, he would be pulling it behind him, heading off to site the supposed construction company. Arriving to see a large pile of dirt, along with the hole that it had come out of, he would rub the back of his neck, already not wanting to be doing any of this. Raising his arms above his head, he would let a sigh out, stretching his body out the best he could before he was forced into work. Grabbing the shovel, he would walk over to the pile of dirt that was once in the hole, now a good distance away.

Shoveling away at the dirt, putting it into the wagon he had brought with him, he would slowly fill it up, making sure to get as much in it as he could, being that he didn't want to make more trips than he had to. Thus, once he had filled it up once, he would quickly wipe the sweat from his brow and wheel it over to the hole, tipping the wagon and pouring it into the hole, though, being that it was only half full at this point, he would quickly walk back to the dirt pile, starting to shovel the rest into the wagon, prepared to finish the job.

Basically dumpping the last bit of dirt into the hole, he would throw the shovel into the wagon, walking over and stopping the dirt down a bit, packing it in so that it was even. Nodding a bit at this, he would quickly use the wagon and move it back to where he had gotten it from to start, putting everything back in order before heading off to give the news to the kage that he had finished filling in the hole for the company that obviously needed to pay more attention, and ask more questions about where they dig.* - Tue Oct 13 01:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Walking back into the area he would look to the kage and say a bit apathetically, "One mission down, two to go."* - Tue Oct 13 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Get them done. - Tue Oct 13 01:15:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he heard the Mizukage's orders to get his other two missions done, he would quietly walk off, of course following orders like a good little shinobi. Once he was well beyond the square, he would reach within his cloak. Pulling out the second scroll he had recieved from the Mizu, he would slowly unroll it and begin to read away. Shaking his head a bit he would mumble, "At least with this one I get to do something almost exciting." having said such, he would begin to run off, going quite fast for someone such as himself, searching for the dog.

Running through the rubble of the village, he would jump over a few things, trip over others, and go around masses of buildings. It appeared that looking for a dog was going to be harder than he had thought originally. Though, continuing his search, he would pick up a bit of speed, being that he wanted to be done with this whole thing as fast as possible. Basically going at top speed, he would find himself coming to a skidding halt, as he caught sight of something. It would seem the beast he was looking for was nothing more than one of those tiny purse dogs, and it seemed to be eatting away at the bones of some unidentified being.

Slowly walking up on the animal, he would do his best to stay as quiet as possible, though, he wasn't a very quiet person, and thus, he would stumble on a bit of rock, causing the animal to turn on him. Quickly throwing his hands up to show that he meant no harm, he would take a few steps back looking at it. "C'mon boy, I don't want to have to hurt you." though, having said such, he would be disapointed as the dog attacked, jumpping forward and snapping at him with its small jaws. Aggrivated by this he would simply say, "You have your chance." all sounds of emotion gone from his voice.

Having said such, he would take a few small steps back, starting to preform a few hand seals, while at the same time, he would be building up wind chakra inside of his body. Looking to the small beast he would say, "Have fun in dog hell." having said such, he would quickly direct the chakra to his hands, right before clapping them together and causing a rather large wave of air to be expelled forward at the animal, hitting him and slamming him somewhat violently intot he wall behind him, most likely killing it on impact. 

Once he had done this, he would walk over to the animal, checking it with his foot to see if it was alive. Noticing that it wasn't he would quickly remove the 
collar on the animal as proof that it was taken care of. Then, feeling a bit guilty, he would quickly dig a small, shallow grave and put the animal in it, feeling that at least that much should be enough for the beast. Nodding at this he would quickly walk back to the square, showing the Mizu the animal's collar, "Second mission complete, one left." having said such he would wait for a reply before starting the last one.* - Tue Oct 13 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Having gotten nothing out of the Mizu, he would simply walk out of the square one last time. Again looking into his cloak for the scroll he had been given. Reading through it he would simply chuckle, he should have known that he would be helping the company out that he had filled in the hole for. Thinking this, he would quickly walk off in the direction specified by the scroll he was given, ready to once again get back to the manual labor he had left behind only moments ago.

Once he had left the area and arrived on the work sight of the company that needed help building a house, he would quickly get his orders, nodding each time something was said. Now knowing what he needed to do, he would grab hold of a shovel and begin to dig what would be the foundation of the building, leveling everything out and clearing away rubble and trash from the destruction of the village. Wiping away sweat as he went, he would continue to go on for some time until a good square footage was cleared, and was completely level.

Once he had done that, he would quickly return the shovel before going onto the next bit of business, walking off to retrieve a few boards to start the structure of the house, making multiple trips back and forth to get more and more gathered. Once he had gotten them all he would quickly start to assemble the frame of the building, starting with the strong post that would be the corners of the building before heading on to the actual full on 'bones' of the building, making sure that everything that something else would be attached to would be in place.

Once he had done that, he would take a bit of a break, again wiping swear from his head, and getting a bit of water to drink, being that he actually found himself a bit tired this time around. Though, once he was done with this break, he would quickly jump back to his feet, again walking off before re-appearing with larg peices of wood that would in turn be the walls of the building. Taking his time going around the house and nailing the boards in, he would be careful not to hammer himself, or the boards in an incorrect mannor. 

Having continued to do this all the way until all four walls were put up, he would look around to see everyone else well on there way to getting this house done. Nodding at the fact, he would again go off to get more boards, this time for the floor. Putting them in, he would go about it the same way he would have with the wall, making sure he had it right, and that he didn't accidently hit himself with the hammer. Once he was one-hundred percent certain that he had the floor straight, he would again stand, sick of the work at this point.

Though, he wasn't going to complain openly about the whole thing, and thus, he would watch as this time, everyone else seemed to be getting the boards for him to help him out with all of the hard work that he had been doing, and in turn, he would let a small smile form, going to the roof to start putting the boards for that up, going about it the same way he had with the walls and flooring. Once he had finished with the actual wood, he would of course shingle the roof and such before coming back down.

Deciding to ask what else he could do, he would be turned away, it would seem he had done all that was needed of him, and such, he would happily shake the man's hand, and start to walk off, sick of the work, but proud of what he had accomplished. Making his way back to the square he would again speak to the kage, "Three, out of three done." having said such he would nod, "I'm going to train now, I assume you don't need anything else from me." having said such, he would again walk off.* - Tue Oct 13 01:56:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he walked away from the square, he would take a look around. He figured that it was about time that he started training again. Thinking this, he would quickly take note that no one was around. Once he had done this he would move to the water. Looking down at it, he would take note that when he had a source of water, it become much easier to make his jutsu work than when he didn't. Nodding a bit being that this was probably common knowledge, he would nod, thinking that he probably should start now, he would take a seat.

Reaching into the water, he would let it run over his skin, trying to get used to the feel. Nodding used to it by now, he would start with a hand seal. Though, while he was getting it right, he would be building up chakra at the same time. Taking a bit longer, and using a bit more chakra than someone with practice would normally take, he would let a sigh loose, stressed out by the fact that it was taking as long as it was. Shaking his head, he would continue to build it up. Once he was content, he would let another sigh loose, and nod.

Looking to the water he would begin to pressure his chakra through his body, putting it through his hands and into the water, he would let it mix, making sure that he was doing it properly, he would continue to push his chakra in, until he had used all that he had built up. Once he was done, he would take a few steps back and look down to the water, waiting for what he knew was sure to happen within a few moments, though, as he waited he would make sure to keep a look out around him, he didn't like the thought of getting jumped in a broken village.

Looking back to the water, he would watch as shaky watery hands would again appear at the side of the pool. Watching as the water began to pull itself up, he would whistle a bit.  The water, slowly making its way out of the pool, would stand at the same height of himself. Though, it would only be about the same height and width as his own body, other than that, it wouldn't have any real shape or color. It was simply at the moment a standing blob of water. Shaking his head at this as he had this problem last time, he knew that he had to in order to fix it.

Keeping his vision on the clone, he would keep his chakra tied to it, and his focus along with it. Focusing on the actual shape of the water, he would attempt to mould his chakra that had mixed with the water. Focusing on the outline, he would begin to force the water to turn into a more refined shape, taking on the same look as himself. Once he had done this, he would nod once more, happy that he had gotten that done, and a bit faster than the last time he had done it, at least it would seem such. Stretching a bit, he would be ready for the next part.

Keeping himself focused on the clone, he would begin to regulate it a bit more, forcing the water to turn different shades, and turn more opaque. Sweating a bit at this point, he would squint a bit, losing focus on everything else around him. Forcing the clone to change to the exact colors dealing with himself, and the clothes he was wearing, he would again nod. It would seem that he had done everything needed with the clone. Though, he figured he would need to get faster at the whole process, and more efficient chakra wise.

Finally finishing training this time around, he would look to the clone, "You have done what I needed you to do, if you would, go away now." Having said such, he would let the chakra that he had kneaded with the water die out, as he cut his connection to it, watching as the water fell back down to the ground, soaking the ground, and his own feet, "I really need to step back further next time. This is the second time that has happened." Saying such he would slowly make his way back to the square.* - Tue Oct 13 19:42:43 2015
