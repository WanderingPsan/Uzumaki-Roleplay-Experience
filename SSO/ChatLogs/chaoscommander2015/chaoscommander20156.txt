<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow as he looked to Durn, and what he was doing, he would let a sigh escape his mouth. He wasn't used to being personally taught by someone, and was more used to simply learning things himself from a scroll, and thus, he would simply make sure that he did his best when watching, trying to pick up on anything that he could that could perhaps help him learn it faster. Not exactly picking up on anything, he would let one more sigh escape his mouth, though he wouldn't complain being that he was the one who had asked for this.

Though, thinking back to what he had said about hitting up chakra and transfering it to his hands, he would have a bit of a realization, it was a bit like how he used his fire run technique. Thinking this, he would take it a bit too far. Basically doing what he would do for his fire run technque, minus the hand seals. Starting up with building chakra, he would hold it there as long as he could, wrongly, still comparing it too much to the fire run technique. Though, continuing, he would finally send the chakra to his hand.

Having done this, and expecting it to work, he would be greatly disapointed when absolutely nothing happened at all. It would seem that he had done it too much with the technique he already had in mind, and thus he wasn't geared toward using this new technique, realizing this, he would once more, let a sigh escape his mouth. Realizing his mistake, he would quickly glance to Durn, hoping that perhaps he didn't realize that he had messed up, and that he thought he was just taking his time. Though, shaking this thought away, he would decide to try again, obviously.

Releasing the chakra that he had built up, he decided that he would try again from scratch. Taking a few good breathes and thing about what Durn had said, he would close his eyes to try and help with his focus. Once more taking the time to build up chakra, he would hold in just enough for what he assumed he would need in order to use this technique. Once he was sure that he had it, he would once more let it move up through his mody, and towards his right hand. Trying his best to will it there, he would open his eyes when he felt like he had done it correctly. Catching sight of only a tiny flame on one of his fingers, he would get a bit overjoyed, and thus, when he let that take over, the flame would instantly go away.

Nodding a bit to himself, happy that he had at least achieved a little bit of it so far. Taking a deep breathe once more, he would come to the conclusion that he would need to dump more chakra into it. Thinking this, he would again close his eyes. Getting back to the chakra building portion of the jutsu. Building up as much as he could, he would put more in that he ever had before, thinking that perhaps it just took more since the jutsu didn't use any hand seals. Thus, he would push the chakra through his body, and again to his palm. Though, feeling the heat a bit from it, he would open his eyes to see a massive amount of fire simply going wild on his hand and arm. Obviously having put too much chakra into it, he would quickly stop, and shake his arm, trying to force it to go away. Once it was out, he would simply shake his head. He hadn't had this much trouble learning something before.

Sighing -again- much sounding like a leaking tire at this point, he would mumble, "Too much chakra." saying such he would again go back to the start of the whole thing, chakra. Once more going back to the chakra building process, he would make sure to build about half of what he had built up before. Once he was sure this time around that he had about as much as he was going to need, he would once more go ahead and start to push it towards his hand. Once he had done this, he would once again open his eyes. Watching as the flame rose up in his hand, and stayed there, he would be a bit happy. Though, as he tried to throw it, it would basically stay attached to his hand. So, letting it die down, he would take a moment to think things over.

Realizing that he needed to cut it off from the actual flow from his body, and let it be its own gathering as he threw it. And upon realizing this, he would once more start to go through the process. From the chakra, to sending it up to his hand. Though, this time as he went to throw it, he would disconnect it from the flow of chakra he was using to substain it. And as it flew forward, a bit shakily, and hit the wall, it would leave a small burn mark, and knock a bit of dirt off of it. It would seem that he had learned how to do it, and that if he took the time to master it, after a bit it should come easier, and stronger. 

Nodding about this he would look around for Dur- Kilm. Not seeing him, he would assume that while he was working on this jutsu, he had to have walked off with that other man.* - Sat Oct  3 19:30:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he managed to find his way away from all of the people, and towards a tree, he would sit underneath of it, realizing that he needed to get back to training. Thinking such, he would go about as he always had in the past. Slowly make the single hand seal needed, though he would pause on it of course to make sure that it was right, before starting to build up chakra inside of his body. Building it up the best he could, to what he thought would be the perfect amount of course.

Once he had built up the amount he needed, he would quickly open his mouth as he let the chakra come up and out, this time in the form of a large amount of mud. The mud, hitting the ground would stay resting for a moment, before suddenly starting to move and take shape. First, it would rise up higher and higher until it reach to be about his height. Then, it would begin to morph its shape around until it had the same figure as himself, before suddenly morphing color to match up one-hundred percent.

Happy with the looks of it, he would raise an eyebrow, getting a bit of an idea. Quickly making the single seal again, and building up the right amount of chakra once more, he would quickly spew out another good amount of mud as a second one would slowly rise beside the first. Deciding to test how mobile they were, he would start them fighting back and forth, or at least he would have if it wasn't for the fact that when they both went to turn a certain part of their body into mud to block each others attacks, they would just stick together.

Seeing this issue, he would let one of the clones drop back into mud. once he had done this, he would look over to the one remaining clone and decided that he would see how well it would be able to hold up under attack himself. So thinking such, he would quickly pull out a kunai and explosive tag, quickly throwing it at the clone and watching as it imbeded inside of it. After a few moments the explosion would sound off, and the mud would fly everywhere. Having expected this, he would watch to see how fast the clone could form back up, which it seemed to be in the process of doing.

Content with the time it had taken the clone to reform he would nod to it and speak as if it mattered, "Good job." and once he had said such, he would let the clone drop back into its original mud shape. Feeling as if he was done, he would quickly look around the area, making sure that he was safe after the recent assassination attempts. Concluding that no one was around, and that he was fine, he would start to walk back towards the plaza, hoping to have something fun to do now that he had gotten a bit of training done.* - Sat Oct  3 21:25:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that the man who was talking to Taiga, was begging to get really weird, and wayyyy too close for comfort, he would watch as Taiga moved back a good ways. "Taiga, you're doing it all wrong, you have to make them move." and with saying such he would turn back to Baen before saying, "Please back up a bit would you?"

Having said such, he wouldn't wait for a reply as he suddenly started up a few hand seals. Moving through them releatively fast, he would be at the same time building up chakra and releasing it into the air around him. Once he was content on the positioning of it, being right around him, and just close enough to baen where it would physically hit him, he would let the jutsu take hold, being that the area of the spread chakra would begin to spin at high speeds, acting as a literal spherical barrier of air, which would protect him if need be, and how it was taking effect, would collide with Baen, and hopefully either send him back, or make him want to step back.* - Sat Oct  3 23:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) His technique, being avoided, would have already come to an end, and being that Baen and vanished, and he now heard Taiga talking behind him, he would quickly turn, seeing that Baen had appeared back beside him. 

Aggrivated, he would quickly start a new set of seals. Going through them quite easily, he would quickly transfer chakra through his body, and direct it towards his hands. Waiting just long enough to see if Taiga's sword would hit, he would go on to slam his hands into the ground, sending a line of fire heading towards Baen, after he had either dodged, or been hit by Taiga's attack, hoping to surround him with a ring of fire. 

This wasn't meant as a meaningful attack, simply a distraction really for Taiga to get in another hit, and for himself to think of what to do next.* - Sat Oct  3 23:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being with the way everything was going, he would quickly go on to his next technique of choice, quickly knocking off what needed to be done for it, he would quickly force chakra up and out of his mouth, this time in the form of mud.

Once it was all out of his system, the pile would quickly form up to be an exact copy of himself, only made completely of mud. Both of these forms walking forward to stand next to Taiga he would speak out to Baen, "You know Taiga really does have a point, and I plan to back him up whenever he needs it." explaining why he had jumpped into this whole thing.* - Sat Oct  3 23:38:14 2015
