I find you quite attractive, and I need someone to pleasure me anyway.

"You have such a sexy body, it's basically asking to be came in." 

moving on, he'd run his fingers down from her face, between her breast, and to her stomach, teasing he with his fingers on her bare skin, "Feels good doesn't it?" saying such, he'd move down her legs, before moving back up to her bra, "Let's see what's behind door number one!" saying such, he'd cut the strap on the middle of the bra, exposing her breast to his view.

"So pretty, I wonder how they feel and taste." saying such, he'd move one had to her nipple, and breast, groping the entire things for a bit before pinching at the nipple. His mouth however, would go to her free nipple, licking, sucking, and biting on it. "So good~" saying sucn, he'f be at this for a small bit of time.* - Sat Nov  7 09:40:41 2015

Saying such, he'd continue to rub it while he licked on her nipple. One more line of thread escaping from his robes would go up, "Enough talking, just let lust take over." saying such, the threads would move to enter her about, and imitate a dick, moving in and out, and going to the back of her throat.* - Sat Nov  7 09:56:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly as he entered the other room, he'd again remove his mask, and his robes. Revealing a black under shirt and pants, he'd suddenly make a seal.

White smoke appearing around him, he would be revealed to look almost the same, that is, aside from black stitches all of his body and face. Putting a hand forward, he'd let threads break from a stich, rising up, "I'm no longer human. I was infused with these as a child, and they make up almost all of my body now."* - Sat Nov  7 22:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) saying such, he'd start to walk back by Mei, stopping he'd lean over and kiss her forward teasingly, "Good girl, turning him down. My pet won't be playing with others." upon saying such, he'd put his hat back on and make his way to the stairs.* - Sat Nov  7 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Having moved to an area devoid of people, he'd look around. He didn't want anyone to know that he was heavily lacking in terms of techniques, and power. Thus, he'd sigh, nodding at the fact that no one was around. Stretching out, he'd move to sit in a shaded area that was hidden from sight. Remembering back to oh so long ago when the Mizu had taught him a very basic water technique, he'd try to remember what it entailed, and what he would have to do to perform it. Taking him some time to think back, having had a hard time, being that many things had happened since he had learned it, and he now had a lot on his mind.

Finally coming back to the memories that he was looking for, he'd go over it in his head, trying to remember every little detail. It being a bit fuzzy, he'd start with the seals that came with the technique. Starting slowly, not exactly trying to do it really, more like trying to refresh himself on it, he'd get through it at a snails pace. Moving through the seals once, messing it up, he'd sigh, forcing himself to go back through it all once again. This time, getting through it fine, just at a slow pace, he'd shrug, he figured that'd be good enough for his first dry run of the jutsu since learning it. Though, he planned to get better.

Nodding feeling like that was more than enough for the seals as of the moment, he'd move on, wiping his head a bit as he lay back against a tree, being that was what was providing the shade. Thinking things over for a moment he'd simply huff out, "I need to get stronger, I need to protect Kirigakure." Saying such he'd lean back forward, starting to close his eyes as he needed to get on to the second portion of the jutsu, which would be building up water chakra, and then using it to actually perform the technique. Thinking this over, he'd sigh, forcing his chakra to gather in his stomach, and switch over to a water base. Though, letting it disperse, he'd sigh. This was all still new to him, and it was causing strain.* - Sat Nov  7 22:56:51 2015
