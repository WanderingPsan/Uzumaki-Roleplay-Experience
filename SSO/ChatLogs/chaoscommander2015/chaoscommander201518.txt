<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more, he would find himself shrugged off again. Having walked to where he wanted to train, he would again take a seat on the dirt, looking around to see if anyone was around. Taking note that no one was around, he would nod, figuring that he was safe to go ahead and start to practice, and that it was likely that he wouldn't be interrupted. Closing his eyes once more, he would start to focus himself, getting his breathing right for the technique to come.

Once he thought he was in the right mind to start practicing, he would go back into the same process he had been in before, mentally inserting himself into his chakra flow, grabbing onto it and trying to force it to slow. Though, like last time, he would find himself having an issue. Taking his time to go over it, he would find himself eventually stopping his chakra flow once more, which he was content with. Once he had done this, he would simply nod.

Being content with what he had done, he would again let his chakra start back up. Bored of the whole thing.* - Fri Oct 23 21:17:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Trilliam(VantetheGreat) says: Wait. - Fri Oct 23 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Having found himself completely aggravated by Saeza, he would again find himself at the upper corner of the village. Looking around, he would decide to make this his home for the time being, as he needed to train, and he didn't need any distractions from it. Thus, he would sit himself down on the very corner between the two walls, refusing to move until he knew he had come a good distance with multiple techniques. Nodding at this thought, he would take a few deep breathes, thinking things over a bit on what he could possible do first.

Thinking things over, he would come to the conclusion that he would need to master the jutsu he had been working on lately before moving onto any of the other ones. Thus, he would start as he normally had before in the past, closing his eyes to begin with, then following it with the leveling of his breathing, he would start to calm his mind, blocking out all the thoughts he had been having lately, and trying to push Saeza out of his head for the time being. Eventually doing so, he would find himself in a calm state.

Having forced his mind to obey him, he would let a small sigh escape his lips, diving back into his own mental world. Looking around, he would head off to the place where he knew his chakra flow originated from. Once getting there, he would look it over, taking in the sight of the calm flow. Though, knowing he had to stop this flow, he would slowly make his way to it. Reaching out to grab a hold, he would test the waters so to speak as he gave a small tug in the opposite direction to see if it was going to be easy to stop. Noting that it wasn't, he would simply shake his head. Being that he had slacked off a bit, it would seem that it would be hard to do all over again.

Shaking his head at this thought, he would quickly settle himself in for the long haul as he knew this wasn't going to be easy. Thus, he would reach forward once more, grabbing a hold of his chakra flow. Doing his best to hold on and pull back on it, he would simply find himself getting pulled along with the flow, having no real affect on it what so ever at this point. Letting himself be dragged along with it for some time, he would simply shake his head, it really was going to be harder than he thought it was going to be. Moving back to the place he had started, he assumed he'd start again.

Having positioned himself back to where he had started, he would once again grab a hold, using all of his mental strength to pull back on it. Though, as he strained to pull it back, he would feel himself starting to be pulled forward again. Stressing himself out more than usual, he would feel the flow of chakra waver for just a moment, though as he felt it slow for about a second, the flow would suddenly jump back up to normal speed once more. Gritting his teeth in aggravation at this, he would simply give up for a moment, deciding to take a break.

Having taken a moment to get a bit of water, he would toss back a canteen, drinking a good amount before tossing it to the side and going back to closing his eyes, determined to get this entire thing over and done with. Moving back instinctively to his flow on chakra, he would once again grab a hold, using all of his concentration to slow it down as he began to pull once more. As he pulled at it, he would finally start to feel the flow slow to a painfully slow stop. Though, only having done so by using most of his own energy to do so, he'd find himself struggling to hold it at a stopped position.

Deciding to build his energy back up while he could, he would simply focus on holding the flow at a stand still, letting it back up the most his possible could as his body continued to produce chakra. Letting a sigh lose while he did this, he would continue to regulate his breathing, making sure that once he had built his energy back up that he would be ready for the next part. Once his energy had finally built itself back to a usable level, he would simply move on.

Having dove back into his own mind, he would look to the chakra flow that he had been holding at a halt. Now, ready to force it to flare, he would quickly start to let it flow again, though, as he did it, he would also flow with it, pulling it along and trying to speed it up and let it flare. Doing such, the chakra would flare up, and burn off any other form of chakra that would perhaps be over him. Once he had done this, he would find himself bringing his chakra flow back down to normal level.

Slowly bringing himself out of his own mind, he would simply lay back onto the ground, being a bit more tired than he expected himself to be. Though, after a few moments he would force himself to sit up and look around. He was unsure if he wanted to continue to practice or not, he would let himself continue to sit there, lost in thought as he was unsure what to do with his time now, though, he knew he didn't want to go talk to anyone at this moment in time. Thus, he would be sure to stay where he was at least for the time being.* - Fri Oct 23 23:07:31 2015

Raising an eyebrow as he didn't show any signs of that much of a reaction he would simply respond, "If anything, that helps. I'm into older women." saying such he would tilt his head a bit, "I think you're just afraid to be close to me."* - Sat Oct 24 03:47:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he would simply smirk to her, "Lead the way~" saying such, he'd let a dumb smile stay on his face for a moment until he started to follow Saeza, which then he'd let it drop.* - Sat Oct 24 03:51:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Taking a sip of his drink he would simply shake his head playfully, "There isn't much to say, I'm a member of an old clan, the Lyzerg clan, which as you might have guessed, is about gone." saying such he would take one more sip.

"Though about mer personally? Well, I guess I may as well be like everyone else, though, I'm not?" laughing a bit he would go on to explain, "I basically grew up with a care taker, learning about my family until said person died, and, basically have lived my life as a shinobi since." pausing once more he would think things over, having a hard time between the drink, and looking at Saeza, "Anywho, I'm basically a persistant person and I do what I want." saying such he would say, "Anything specific you'd like to know? I know I'm rambling at this point haha." taking yet -another- sip he would look to her then saying, "And what of you?"* - Sat Oct 24 04:27:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Taking yet another sip from his drink her would chuckle, "Because regardless of how much older you are, or how much longer you're going to live, I'm too persistant to leave you alone, so I'd rather hear my own name rather than kid if you would~"* - Sat Oct 24 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Sat Oct 24 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head playfully he would say, "Guess I'll have to work a bit harder?" saying such he'd stretch a bit, still laughing it off, before a sudden serious look came over his face as he rolled his drink around. Humming one of his songs for a jutsu, he wouldn't actually inact it, but is Saeza was a fan of song, she'd likely hear something pleasing. Though he'd stop it to finish off his drink, sitting the cup back down.* - Sat Oct 24 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Ordering yet another drink, feeling himself flush a bit from the first one he had consumed he would simply say, "Trust me, I have no intention of leaving you alone at this point~" saying such, he'd wait for his drink to show up. "Plus, who is going to help you out when you need it? I wouldn't feel good enough if I let someone else do it~" saying such playfully, he'd simply lean on the counter? Resting his head on his hand, looking to her.* - Sat Oct 24 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her he would simply say, "Oh? I thought it was because I needed to be around longer? Now I need to be a benefit to you as well~" saying such  he would smile at her, "What's wrong? Lost your thirst?" saying such he would wink at her a bit playfully, knowing full well what she may actually need after her statement about being a vampire, he simply didn't want to say it.

Shrugging a bit he would then go on to say, "I think I could be plenty of benefit though, if you really must know." though he wouldn't name the reasons why as he took yet another sip of his new drink, it was sure he was feeling pretty good at this point, but not bad enough to forget anything.* - Sat Oct 24 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, raising an eyebrow he would simply say, "Well, if you have an issue drinking -from- me, perhaps.  ." saying such he would simply reach over to the first glass he had emptied,  quickly pulling a Kunai out and pressing it to his own skin, "I hope you can handle it with high blood alcohal content~" saying such as a semi-joke, he'd look to her for either a nod or some form to see if she was fine with this, as Nalenth didn't really care.* - Sat Oct 24 04:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he would simply put the glass to the side and the Kunai away, "I see that even if you are so much older, you still can't take a joke I assume?"  though, again pausing as he was at the point where he'd basically say anything he thought, and find himself unable to lie being from the drinking he would again move back to rest his head on his hand, "You're gorgeous. . ." saying such he'd simply look to her face, for some odd reason unable to look away.* - Sat Oct 24 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he would shake his head, "No you don't!" his face still red from the drinks, he would keep a stupid smirk on his face.* - Sat Oct 24 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Would note, he had stopped staring.* - Sat Oct 24 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow to her he would simply say, "A fool out of myself? How so?" saying such he would then go on to say, his blank face back, and his monotone voice, "Sorry to say, But, as I said, I'm a bit persistant. And I decided." saying such to her 'friend' statement.* - Sat Oct 24 05:03:21 2015
