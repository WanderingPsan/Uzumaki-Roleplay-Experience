Looking to Eri he'd simply shake his head sadly. Pulling his arm back, he'd attempt to throw it forward to hit her in the shoulder. Though, upon impact, she'd likely feel nothing, or at most, like a small breeze had hit her.

Hurting his own hand on impact, he'd look to his, realizing he had hit her with his left hand, "Well. . .playing guitar is gonna suck."* - Tue Nov 17 08:40:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Was obviously joking at this point, and would laugh to show such, "Look, I'll try alright, no need to keep pushing." saying such he'd say, "Anyway, mind showing me what you can play? I hadn't exactly met anyone else who could," saying such he'd go to remove his guitar, "Though perhaps away from their fight? I don't want to get hit in some weird crossfire."* - Tue Nov 17 08:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as she started orignally, he'd keep tract of her movements at first. Though, the more she played, he'd eventually just close his eyes and listen to what she was doing. Nodding a bit every now and then as he was enjoying it. 

Of course once she was done, he'd open his eyes, and let a small smile hit his lips, "That was pretty good."* - Tue Nov 17 09:09:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Taking the instrument back, he'd move to sit, "Well, my turn I suppose." Looking to her he'd say, "Don't judge me too bad on this, It's something new." saying such, he'd look down, getting his hands into the right spots. Once he was sure, he'd nod to himself. Starting to play, he'd stress a bit, trying to keep up with the speed of it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Having walked into what seemed to be a fight between Ortho, being his leader, and someone he had called, Ryutaro, being a stranger. To him, it was obvious what he had to do. Moving one step forward, he'd look down to the instrument hanging on the front of his body. His mind already being geared towards Ryutaro, he'd start to let chakra flow to his hands.

Reaching down, and touching the string, letting his chakra flow into it, he'd quickly pluck it in a mannor where when it mixed with his chakra, the sound would be more than easily heard by Ryutaro. If that was the case, it would seem to the boy that the strings of hsi instrument would fly off, closing the distance quite easily, and wrapping around Ryutaro regardless of what he did.

If this all worked out like it should, the man would be unable to move, and to add insault to injury, the man would suddenly develope quite a bad case of seasickness, or in other words, he'd be dizzy.* - Wed Nov 18 04:04:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly as he looked to Rias, he'd move to bring the guitar off of his back, "You seem confident in your abilities. I guess I should be happy about that if you're to teach me, but I can help but be aggravated at the same time." Saying such, he'd position the guitar in its usual place around the front of him.

Nodding a bit, he'd flow chakra through his body and into his fingertips. Quickly reaching down, he wouldn't even play a song, he'd simply pluck one string, as this was only the first Gen out of a series he had in mind. Once he had done this sounds waves would rush forward, the effects only being focused on Rias. 

If it hit and took effect, it would seem to the girl that the strings of his guitar had forcefully ripped off, and in a heat seeking motion, wrapped around her, and stopped her from moving at all. As to add insault to injury, it would also come with a side effect of dizzyness, enough to likely have a hard time thinking straight for a moment.* - Wed Nov 18 20:41:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Nodding to her slightly, he'd say, "I'll try my best, but you seem even better and genjutsu than I am. So do me a favor, don't roast me?" having said such as he looked to her hand seal, he'd suddenly feel the heat of would would seem to be in his mind a rather large fireball coming down towards him from directly above in the sky. At first, his intial thought would be that it was real, though being that he had been informed of it being a genjutsu to start, a part of him would know, and attempt to try and break it.

His mind quickly recalling the seal that the girl had made, he'd attempt to do as he had seen. Though, as she hadn't given him a good explanation, he'd do his best to fill in the gaps that she had left. Though, the feel of what seemed to be a giant fireball over him didn't help the process. Quickly focusing on his own chakra flow, he'd attempt to slow it down and stop it. Though, struggling with the process, it would be start to show as sweat gathered on his brow from the focus, and the fake fireball. It would seem that he wouldn't be able to stop the flow of chakra on his first go around.

Sighing, rushing a small bit to go and restart it, he'd again retry, closing his eyes and starting over. Reaching into himself, and metaphorically grabbing a hold of his chakra flow, as if it was a river, he'd pull on it, doing his best to stop the flow once more. Which, would eventually work out for him. Though, as he nodded, and knew that he had to restart it now and let it rush forward, which as he attempted to do so, it would seem that he wouldn't be able to get it to flow fast enough to work out correctly, as the most it would do was get back to the normal speed at which it normally went.

Now, visably stressing in, and outside of the genjutsu, he'd again go in to try it once more, a bit of worry on his face as he didn't know how this genjutsu would end if he got hit by the fireball. Thus, he'd again dive back in, slowing his flow of chakra, and then, forcefully pushing it forward and letting the small bit he had explode forward. Though, even with the actual completion of the technique, it would seem that Rias's Genjutsu was too strong to be broken by his feeble attempts, and thus, he'd simply crouch down, hunched over so that if it hit, all of the pain would be in his back first.* - Wed Nov 18 21:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Upon saying such, he'd sling the instrument over his back, "Off to this Sanoke person to attempt and sway his opinion."* - Wed Nov 18 21:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: Oh. Good then. - Wed Nov 18 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly now, he'd quickly unravel the scroll he had been given. Looking it over, he'd nod slightly, being that the technique had been used on him, he felt like he already had a good understanding of it, but he had to make sure by reading the scroll he had been given. Glancing down the page, he'd mull it over slowly, wondering what he would have to do in order to get it as perfect as the girl had, and if he would be able to use his instrument to play it, and use it. Shaking this off, he'd set the scroll down for now.* - Wed Nov 18 22:00:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly having entered the Hungry Ant, having taken a seat, he'd look over the scroll that he had been given. Being that he had been in the jutsu once already, he'd have a bit of insite on what he would need to do in order to use the technique, and how to tweak it, though, wanting to be able to add his on notes on such, he'd start to mark down the page with his own ideas and how they would work into the jutsu if he ever had the chance to use it. Once he was done, he'd pick it up and make sure that all of them were right and that he'd be able to understand what he had put himself.

Moving on, he'd get something to eat being that he was in the place serving food. Once he was done, he'd quickly look it over, feeling that if he got in once last read that everything would be alright, and that he'd be able to use the jutsu effectively. Nodding at this thought, he'd scan it a few times, taking every small detail to memory, which wasn't that hard being that he had to do such for everything he did in life, and it had become somewhat of a habit. Nodding once he was sure that he had it all, he'd quickly roll the scroll back up and hang onto it for the time being.* - Wed Nov 18 22:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had learned all of the techniques that he could from everyone in the area it would seem, he'd move off a ways, wanting to get in some practice with them all. Quickly making sure that no one was around, he'd move to work on the Genjutsu: Kai technique he had learned by trial of fire. Nodding a bit at his own decision he'd move to sit under what seemed to be a dying, decrepit old tree. Getting his breathing right, he'd slowly move his hands together, trying to get the seal right before he had to do anything else. Once he was sure that he had the seal, he'd of course close his eyes and begin to bring his focus in.

Once he was sure that he was completely focused on the task at hand, he'd nod a bit more, which would be pointless being that no one was around, but he'd do it anyway. Once he was ready, he'd imagine himself inside of his own head once more. Floating a bit, like what you'd imagine you'd be able to do inside of your own head, he'd make his way to what he imagined to be his chakra flow, which in this form, would look like a rather large river flowing along. Moving to it, he'd sigh a small bit, reaching forward with his hands and trying to grab a hold of it. Though, when he did such, he'd only be drug with the current, unable to do anything.

Fighting back at this current, he'd do his best to stop it, or at the very minimum slow himself down so that he wouldn't be carried along with the current of the whole thing. Though, finding this harder than he thought it would be, the current would only slow a very small amount, and now enough to be anywhere near the required amount for the technique. Thus, he'd simply let it go and open his eyes, he was tired, and needed something to drink being that he wasn't used to the kind of heat he was feeling here in Sunagakure. Thus, he'd pull out some water and quickly gulp it all down, wiping his brow as he did so. "So much harder than I thought it would be."

Once he had taken enough of a break to continue onward, he'd again close his eyes, focusing his breathing, and his mind. Diving back in, he'd go back into his mental world. Once he was there, he'd take note of his chakra flow again. Moving forward to it, he'd once more grasp it, trying his best to once more slow it down, though again he'd get pulled along with it. His eyes clenching with effort, he'd again try to pull back on the flow, feeling it finally start to slow, and then eventually stop. Once he had done this, he'd keep his focus on holding it there while he wiped his head. It was more tiring than he thought it would be.

Now that he had it stopped, he'd take a few deep breathes, needing a moment to get ready. Pushing his chakra forward now, he'd let the flow pick up, bursting forward with surprising speed, enough so to complete the technique and continue on. Once he had done this, he'd of course let it stop down to its normal levels as he nodded. Opening his eyes, he'd once more wipe his head, and drink a bit more water. The heat of the village was getting to him too much. Sighing slightly at this, he'd move to stand, looking around for someone else to attempt to learn something from, or at least have a conversation, being that he barely knew anyone here.* - Thu Nov 19 01:23:12 2015
