<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd look to Trill, somewhat upset that he had to go about training a jutsu. Starting out with the hand seals, he'd go through them slowly, though fast enough to where it would be usable in battle. Once he had gone through this, he'd sigh, looking off to the side. Once he had done do, he'd quickly place his hands to the ground allowing his chakra to flow into it. Once he had done so, a small flow of mud would go streaming towards the wall, though of course he'd mess it up, and it would die short.

Glancing back to Trilliam, he'd make the 'Tch' sound before turning away, not wanting to hear anything from the boy. Once he had done so, he'd again go back through the seals required by the technique, slightly faster this time. "Come on damn it." saying such aloud, he'd again put his hands to the ground, starting to push the chakra he had gathered up to the ground, and towards the wall, this time causing a small flow of mud to go out, and actually make it that far, barely.* - Fri Nov 27 07:46:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, looking around the area, he'd know that he had to work on his jutsu or else people would bitch at him, mainly Trilliam being that he was now his teacher. Shaking his head, he'd slowly walk to the training area and and look around, checking to see if anyone would be in the way of his training. Once he realized that there wasn't, he'd let out a sigh and rub his neck. Closing his eyes, he'd slowly go over the signs needed in his head to make sure that when he started that he'd be able to do them. Once he had gone over them, he'd open his eyes and be ready to begin.

Being that he had recalled all of the signs needed, he'd slowly start out on them, making sure that he could do them all first before he really attempted the jutsu. Being that this was still a new jutsu to him he'd have a hard time with the seals. Getting down to the last few, he'd suddenly mess it up, being that he was unsure which seal was meant to come next. Sighing at this and again shaking his head. "This is come frustrating shit. . ." saying this openly, he'd take a break and wipe his head from the sweat gathering from the heat.

Sitting down beside the large stone wall of the training area, he'd find himself in the shade for the moment. "Well I guess I should try again." saying such, he'd again slowly go through the seals, doing his best to get them right. Once he had gotten to the seals he had messed up before hand, he'd quickly recall what he had messed up and would fix it. Doing such, now having done a dry run through the signs needed for the jutsu correctly, he felt as if he could go ahead and start to work on what came next after the signs.

Feeling that he was now ready to move on from the seals, he'd nod, making sure to stay in the shade of the wall being that he was sick of the hit and was used to a more shaded, tree'd area. Shrugging though, he'd run through the seals once more. Having no issue with it this time, he'd move to the next step. Building up doton based chakra inside of his body, he'd struggle a bit, trying to keep his focus on it being that he had been too used to just his crystal release here lately. Shaking his head, he'd let the chakra die out, he was having a harder time than he thought.

Taking a good amount of water from a water bottle he carried with him since he entered Sinagakure, he'd drink it down, more tired than he thought he'd be. Shaking his head though, he wouldn't give up. He was determined to get better, and impress the kid who had been teaching him. Moving to stand now in the shade, he'd again go through the seals, by this point not having an issue with it. Reaching into himself, he'd build up doton based chakra. Keeping his focus on it now, he'd be sure to gather a good amount, not wanting a repeat of the first time he used it and it barely went anyway.

Nodding once he felt he had enough, he'd finally lean down, placing his hands to the surface and letting the chakra he had built up flow out of his hands and letting it react with the Earth. Doing such, a sudden rush of mud would rise up from the ground and stream forward towards the wall. Hitting it and slamming into the wall. Standing back up now, he'd look over his handy work and nod, "See Trill, I can do this easy. . ." saying such to himself really being that Trill wasn't here at the moment, he'd shrug and decide to walk off and find something better that he could maybe do while he was here for the time being.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) His aggravation getting to him at this point, he'd quickly form two seals. "I'm leaving. Though, I'd like to state, you're a shitty priest." saying such, he'd build up chakra in his body, sighing slightly as he did so. Looking to Kariudo, he'd shake his head, "Until we meet again then. Which, from the way you look, is hopefully never." 

Turning his attention to Nigen, he'd say, "I'll get you that information regardless. I'm not letting you give me a way out that I didn't earn." once he had said such, he'd release his chakra into the ground as it took a different form, transforming the dirt beneath him. A large pink-crystal dragon rising out beneath him, he'd stand on its back.* - Fri Nov 27 23:52:19 2015
