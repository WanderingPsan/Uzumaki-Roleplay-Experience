<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head a bit, he would quickly make his way between Baen and Reguel. Standing a good distance away from Kyu, he would simply speak out, "So, since you think you can hide your own uglyness by putting me down, fight me, let's go." grinning at this he would stretch a bit, before saying again, "Should I start, or shall I be nice enough to let you?"

Having said such though, he would start up a string of seals, going through them quite easily. Once he had done this, he would simply stand ready, starting to gather chakra inside of his body to use once he was sure this fight was actually going to go down, ready to use the technique whenever he felt he should.* - Fri Oct 23 03:17:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: So you're pretty weak. - Fri Oct 23 03:41:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he saw the boy start to move forward, he would quickly let a smirk of his own take hold. Deciding to get the distance between them to be a larger gap, he would quickly dash as far away as he possibly could. Once he felt he was far enough away, he would skirt to a halt, turning back to face the boy.

Quickly bringing his hand to his mouth, he would quickly let the chakra that he had been forming start to flood up, and out of his mouth, flooding out in the form of a brown, sticky fluid which would coat the ground around, and under him. Hoping to stick the boy where he stood, he would watch to see if it would take hold. If it had, he would be prepared to move on to his next technique, and if it didn't he'd be prepared to evade, or counter whatever the boy tried.* - Fri Oct 23 03:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Hmm. - Fri Oct 23 03:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to the boy, raising his eyebrow as he was a bit suprised by the fact that the boy could move, he would simply state, "Not bad, Must be quite strong to be able to move through that, even just a bit." Having said such he would go into another round of seals this time, not wasting time to let the boy make an advance. All the while, he would have been building up chakra for the technique.

Once he had finished the seals, he would quickly reach into his cloak, pulling out a stack of shuiken. Setting them in his hands, he would quickly pull both of his hands apart, then reversing the direction he would slam them together, along with the shuriken inside of them, releasing the chakra he had built up in the form of a large force of wind that would carry the shiruken with it. Though, he would have aimed it towards the boy's legs, thighs, and shins, basically anything below the waist trying to end and advancement that he could.* - Fri Oct 23 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow he would simply sigh, "I'm disapointed. I didn't even get a chance to use any major techniques." having said such he would mumble under his breathe, "The boring one is back again." 

Though, being that he had now lost interest he would simply walk over to Baen, turning to speak back to Kyu, "Keep the Shuriken, the blood lessens the value they hold to me." saying such he would speak to Baen, "So, wanna go do something else?"* - Fri Oct 23 05:01:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Squinting at her a bit, noticing her going for her blade he would say, "No, of course not, they aren't real." though, feeling a bit defensive at this point he would tuck his hands away into his cloak.* - Fri Oct 23 06:27:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Raising his eyebrow at her statement he thought that perhaps she was messing with him. Thus, he would drop his guard, "You're just fucking with me right?" having said such he would begin to laugh at first. 

Though, as she dashed forward, he wouldn't be able to react as she started to suck the blood that was flowing into his body, "A-And I thought you were cute." having said such, he'd feel a pinch, too surprised by everything that was happening. Not reacting at first, being that he was too shocked, he would suddenly feel a rush of pleasure. Feeling too many things as once, he would simply fall, slowly being drained of all blood, and likely falling, and simply dying right there. 

It would seem after leaving Kirigakure, and going through everything he had been though, his life would end from a surprise attack from a cute little girl.* - Fri Oct 23 06:37:39 2015

Feeling worse for her then anyone, he would simply remove his own cloak, holding it out for her to use to cover herself, "Put this on." saying such in a monotone way to try and hide the fact that he could be a caring person.

Then, looking around at the people close to him, he would simply say, "Can we get this guy out of the ground, and get him to a doctor perhaps? I think he learned his lesson." having said such, simply just in case, he would begin to build up chakra inside of himself, anyone close to him would perhaps take notice of this.* - Fri Oct 23 16:17:55 2015

Closing his eyes for a moment, he would quickly release the chakra that he had been building up. His chakra, pulsing outwards would come into contact with everyone around him in a few feet radius. This, if they had a weak mind, would quickly cause them to be plunged into a dark world where they would come to experience the worst fear that they had hidden away inside of them.

Once he had done this, he himself would fall to his knees, the use of chakra too much for him at this moment. * - Fri Oct 23 16:23:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Walking into the room, and setting her onto the bed, he would simply look to Bryson, "Not to be rude, or be in your space, But I'd like to stay and apologize when she snaps back too. I did something. . .wrong to both of you." having said such, he would quickly be interupted as Saeza jumpped into action, though, in a feeble attempt, he would try to reach forward, grabbing her shoulders to stop her, "Calm down! You're fine now!" though, he would feel somewhat responsible for all of this, so if he got hit, he'd be fine with it.* - Fri Oct 23 17:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as she turned into bats, he would simply follow after her, she was too far away for him to inact his genjutsu again, not that he wanted to, but that mofo still had his cloak, and he -was- going to get it back.* - Fri Oct 23 17:25:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Of course, he would follow Saeza the entire way, creeping behind her, and trying to gather his chakra back as he was still too lacking to re-attempt his genjutsu if need be.* - Fri Oct 23 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) continues to follow her, keeping his cool before finally speaking up, "Why not burn the whole place down it you're that mad?" saying such as a joke, though said in a monotone voice.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Looking at her, he would find himself blushing a bit, though, feeling a bit weird he would say, "If you stare at me long enough you might just lose your sight~" saying such he would would wink at her. 

Though, when he did this, he would inact a small genjutsu causing her to lose sight for a few moments, and in this time he would take a step back, "So, your name is?"* - Fri Oct 23 18:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her he would simply bow as low as he could, "And I apologize for that, I simply didn't want to be caught in the middle of something." saying such, he would put on an act of falling to one knee, "Sorry Mi'lady." obviously trying to gain her favor while in reality, he was already building up chakra once more in case he needed it.* - Fri Oct 23 18:06:17 2015

I mean, I find your extremely attractive perhaps? Or Is it more that I find you adorable?" regardless he would only give her an actual smile, and pat her head a bit, "Everything is fine now though, but, if you want to hurt me, I understand, go ahead." hsi masochist personality kicking in with his last sentence.* - Fri Oct 23 18:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Being thrown into the air, he wouldn't be able to do much as he was sent higher and higher, though, he would begin to gather the last of his chakra, ready to use it if need be.* - Fri Oct 23 18:19:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had been caught from falling, and a number of people had saved him from damage, he would simply feel himself being brought to the ground before standing back to his feet. Looking around he would simply sigh and say, "Thank you everyone. Though. . " walking back up to Saeza he would simply say, "Leave her be if you would, I derserved that in all honesty." having said such he would once more bow to Saeza, "Allow me to apologize again." 

He knew this was probably stupid, but he felt he had been wrong to begin with, and felt like he needed her to accept his apology.* - Fri Oct 23 18:38:43 2015

"I'm sorry that the rage you had against me was put to waste. And, that your attack against me went to waste. . .I was somewhat looking forward to the pain I deserved." saying such he would move back up to a standing position. Looking to her, his face would twist back to its normal form. "Though, if you still have anger for me, I will gladly accept it. . .if I at least get your name."* - Fri Oct 23 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Bowing again he would say, "I wouldn't dream of using one on someone as beautiful as you again, it was simply I didn't realize how close you where when I used it."

Though, if you want me gone, so be it." saying such he would pause, tilting his head a bit playfully, "I thought it was pretty funny though when you kicked his face in." 

Saying such, even though it was a bit fucked up he would slowly start to walk past her, and back to the square/barracks? "When you're willing to actually talk to me, mind finding me again? If you wouldn't mind I'd like to learn more about you." saying such, he would think of what else to do, but he figured he had done enough as he waited for a reply before starting to walk off* - Fri Oct 23 19:12:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Once more bowing to her he would say, "If that's what you wish. I enjoyed you company while I had it." saying such he would smile a bit, trying his best to hide exactly how much he liked her company.

Though, letting the smile drop, he would shrug a bit, letting his eyes rest on her for longer than perhaps they should have, "As I said before though, if you could, find me when you're up for talking." saying such he would finally start to walk off unless for some odd reason he was stopped.* - Fri Oct 23 19:49:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I'll be honest - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I worked really hard trying to save you - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Chunin. What matters, though, is that Hassan gave me permission to punish Susumu. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It'd be a shame for you to die - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I asked. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Very well. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: I risked my own life to do so - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: He implied I can even kill him if I choose to do so. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I intend to if it seems appropriate. - Fri Oct 23 20:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: It hurts, huh? - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: Hmm...I don't believe that his death at your hands would be good enough for him.... - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: He doesn't deserve it.... - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Should we speak in private? - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: We should. - Fri Oct 23 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: This is such a terrible situation - Fri Oct 23 20:03:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he looked around, the girl that he had decided he would work towards having pushed him away, he would decide that it would be time to practice his clans jutsu, not that anyone would be there to help him as he was one of the last surviving members. Shaking this thought off he would walk a good ways away from everyone, taking a seat. Closing his eyes, he would start to control his breathing, being that what he was about to do came naturally, he still needed to get used to what was to come. Being that even if it was apart of him, he had to control it somewhat.

Bracing himself for what he had been trained to do originally, he would start to focus in on his chakra. Doing his best to grab onto it, and slow it down, he would mentally visualize him going into his chakra stream. Once he had done this, everything from this point on would be done in a mental manor. Reaching forward to attempt and find his actual flow of chakra, he would search around for some time, finding it a bit harder than he actually thought it would be to do. Though, after a few minutes, he would finally find himself stumbling onto it.

Once he had gotten his focus onto it, he would let a sigh release from his lips. Mentally reaching forward, he would grab a hold of his chakra, doing his best to slow it down, he would tug on it with all of his strength. Though, getting no where with it, he would shake his head. Going back in once more, he would hold onto it, pulling back with all of his mental power, feeling his chakra flow budge just a moment, slowing down a small bit, and staying at that speed, though, it wouldn't be enough for what he needed.

Knowing now that if he really tried he would be able to slow down his chakra flow, he could, he would go back into it once more. Tugging on it continuously, he would feel the flow start to slow once more. This time, he would continue the pulling though as the flow would slowly come to a complete halt, and his jutsu would waver, at least it would if he had one cast on anyone. Happy that he had done this, he would allow himself a second while he gathered his thoughts before moving on.

Now, being that he had done this, he would release his flow on his chakra, letting it flow freely now. Happy with what he had accomplished for the time being, he was simply walk off now.* - Fri Oct 23 20:27:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) says: I suggest you not talk to her like that. - Fri Oct 23 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Takes a few steps forward, having been talking to Madelyn.* - Fri Oct 23 20:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, having dealt with more than enough bullshit today he would simply say, "As of the moment, being that I was told I wasn't allowed to do something, I won't do anything, it was simply a suggestion."* - Fri Oct 23 20:34:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Glancing as she walked forward, he would simply sigh, the aggravation draining from his face, "Sure, whatever." saying  such, he would suddenly hear Madelyn's statement. Now, looking back to Saeza he would say, "Saeza. . .could you take a few steps back?" being that he had used the technique on her before, he was sure she would understand what he was getting at.* - Fri Oct 23 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Lyzerg, Nalenth(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as the animal was summoned, he had no issue with the being, though, glancing at the boy atop his mount, he would simply make eye contact with him, sending his own chakra outward with a simple look, which would in turn if it hit would cause temporary blindness.

Once he had done this, he would simply look to Saeza, "Fine. Whatever." saying such, he would start to walk off, heading east towards the gate of the village, though, before he got there he would detour.* - Fri Oct 23 20:44:09 2015
