<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he wouldn't allow this as he quickly made two hand seals. Spreading his chakra to the ground, it would begin to change and take shape underneath him, turning into a crystalined structure before suddenly two massive dragons would rise out. 

One circling Asin, and the other moving to wrap around himself as protection, "Would you like to test that theory?"* - Sun Dec  6 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: You are willing to teach me after what I pulled? Are you trying to punish me some how? - Sun Dec  6 19:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, havng already wasted the chakra on the technique, he didn't plan to let it go without at least frightening the boy. Thus, he'd continue to let the dragon chase after and wrap around him. Feeling that changing an entire body structure would eat chakra quite fast.

"Oh~ Are you sure? I thought it'd be quite fun~" saying such as he looked to Zenaki, "Oh hush. I'm just playing with him/" basically ignoring the pink haired boy as nothing more than an annoyance.

Sighing, manipulating the dragon that was wrapping around Asin to come back, and act like a second guard he'd mutter, "Asteroth was right, this place is boring."* - Sun Dec  6 19:46:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Walks into the shop, ordering a glass of green tea for himself, "Get wait you want Miss Asteroth, I'll cover you."* - Mon Dec  7 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Nodding to her as he went ahead and layed a rather large amount of money on the table to cover anything that they would order for the night, he'd glance to her, "So, enlighten me, what have I missed of late?"

Pausing thinking, "You are hanging out with a new bunch."* - Mon Dec  7 03:01:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking back to her, he'd shake his head playfully.

"I tried to kill off a boy today who was rather annoying. Though your cousin wouldn't let me have my fun~" saying such he'd shake his head looking around as his tea showed up.

Sipping on it slowly, he'd look to her, looking her over wondering it perhaps she had found someon being that she wasn't on him like she was when they first met.

"I guess it's joyous. I wouldn't know myself."* - Mon Dec  7 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he'd shake his head, "While I know the one you speak of, he is not it. Some visiter, was quite annoying." shaking his head again he'd look to her, studing her face.

"I'm already a murderer, as soon as the Mizu killed himself on my jutsu. And do you forget? I am not a part of this village, and haven't been for many years."

Shaking his head slightly, he'd finish his tea, ordering another glace before looking back to her seriously, "Have I lost your interest?"* - Mon Dec  7 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her hand on his chin, he'd smirk a bit, any embrassment he had shown when they first met gone, as his depression was gone as well.

"You seemed distant from me is all." shaking his head lightly, "You know he was trying to get close and touch you, yes? I saved you." chuckling a bit as he had come into some information about it. Watching her devour her food, he'd simply chuckle.

"What would you like? Alcoholic or other?"* - Mon Dec  7 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd quickly order her some sake, letting it be sat in front of her. "Not exactly a murdurous side. The boy simply needed to be taught a lesson. He was rude to a few individuals, and he attempted to shoot a water jutsu at me simply for play." sighing softly he'd mutter, "I can't handle annoyances anymore.

Noticing her quicky finishing half the boy he'd grin a bit more. "Why do you care if I mind killing or not?"

Though thinking a bit, he'd shrug and move on, "No, I travel from village to village still. I'm simply taking a break for now."* - Mon Dec  7 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling at her fake point he'd say, "Macho side? I simply want those who annoy me gone." shaking his head a bit, he'd sip at his own drink looking her over. "Though, I have it in check. . .most of the time. Depends on how far people push me."

"Diffcult to see me? You keep drawing more guys to you from what I see, I feel like it would be a dishonor to those people to steal you from them~" laughing a small bit he'd go on some more, "And, I am fond of you. Though, I don't want to stop you from amassing what seems to be your little group.~" making his own fake pout.* - Mon Dec  7 04:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow, as she called his jokes cheesy, what he had been aiming for he'd speak up, faking a pout, "Oh? You're going to leave me behind? I was looking forward to spending more time with you~" chuckling a bit he'd shake his head.

"I'd be possessive too with someone like you beside me." pausing, thinking things through, "I'm probably more boring than you think."* - Mon Dec  7 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Getting kissed on the cheek, he'd blush more than he thought he would, bringing his hand to his face. Simply watching as she went, he'd let a light sigh out, "Such beauty, perhaps one day I'll capture it for myself." 

Turning back to the counter, he'd order a round of drinks, needing it.* - Mon Dec  7 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing softly as he had just awoken, he'd notice Claudette sleeping against the statue. Smiling softly, he'd look her over one good time, "That's cute." chuckling to himself, he wouldn't bother the girl, simply leaning against the statue, and look to the distance.* - Mon Dec  7 18:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: *looked - Mon Dec  7 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing somewhat, looking to her, he'd feel somewhat bad, he assumed that position couldn't be comfortable, and he'd also come to a conslusion, "She works at the hospital right? They have beds there. . ." saying such aloud, he'd attempt to walk over to her, unsure of what to do.

Kneeling down beside her he'd somewhat mumble, "Excuse me~" as he attempted to pick her up gently, and carry her to the hospital, feeling it was only right.* - Mon Dec  7 18:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her head against his chest, something in him wanted to almost cuddle this girl, even though they had only met a few times. Though, shaking his head, feeling her curvatious body in his arms, he'd move to slowly set her in the bed, unless for some reason he couldn't get her out of his arms, and slowly back towards the door, trying not to wake her.* - Mon Dec  7 18:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Still looking at the women, the temptation to do something to her rising, a few dark thoughts would run through his head, though. Being as he didn't know this girl all too well, and knew that she had some connection to Asteroth, he'd hold back, not wanting to upset the balance at hand. "Tch. . .I need to go get laid." saying such, he'd stretch a bit before considering if he should leave or not.* - Mon Dec  7 18:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) His eyes falling on her large chest, he'd bite his bottom lip slightly, "Fuck it, I need this." moving forward, rummaging around in his coat, he'd pull out wire usually used for tying hands, or people up as he carefully went over and tied her arms and legs tightly to the bed, that is, if she didn't wake up.

Doing such, if he was allowed, he'd look her over again, "Tch, Too much." saying such, he'd reach out and caress her face a small bit before running his hand down it, and down her neck. Eventually getting to her chest, he'd grope it a small bit, upset about the clothes being in the way.* - Mon Dec  7 18:39:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her mouth, he'd smirk a bit, almost wanting to kiss the girl in her sleep, as even for her weird skin color and such, she was pretty to him. Though, he was a fan of weird things. Aiming to pull her shirt up slowly, tyring to reveal her breast without waking her, he'd move any bra or the such, starting to caress one breast as he leaned down to suck and lick on other, obviously taking this as a game to see how far he could make it before she woke up.

Eventually, a hand would move down her stomach and to the outside of her crotch, rubbing above her clothes. His eyes looking to her face for some sort of reaction, he'd still find himself wanting to hold and kiss this girl. Was he starting to be soft in his time in Konoha?* - Mon Dec  7 18:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Omit all RPs with Claudette, both parties agreed.* - Mon Dec  7 20:08:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, suddenly realizing what he was doing he'd stop, frowning. Reaching to pull her shirt back down, and remove his hands from her, he'd look at her sadly, "Calm down. I took this a bit too far." saying such, he'd reach forward, caressing her face again.

"I saw you asleep by the statue. . .I carried you here. I didn't intend. . . .you just looked so beautiful. . ." sighing slightly as he tried to explain, he'd continue to caress her face. "I let myself slip a bit too much. Don't hate me."* - Mon Dec  7 21:55:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd take a few steps back as he preformed the hand seals needed for the technique, barely able to remember then at this point. Though, once he had done it, he'd quickly reach down to the ground, looking away from everyone. Releasing his chakra into the ground, a wave of mud would shoot out, coating the ground. "Meh, I didn't find it fun enough to train really." saying such as he turned back to Trilliam.* - Mon Dec  7 23:32:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly as he heard Trilliam speak, he'd grunt a small bit. Quickly shaking his head he'd mutter, "Go easy on me if you would." saying such, he'd quickly preform two hand seals. Once he had done such, he'd build up chakra in his body and slowly let it seep into his feet. Doing such, he'd then force it into the ground. Doing such, the sand would suddenly start to crystalize, changing shape as -two- dragons rose up.

The first, wrapping all the way around Abraxas like a snake would provide defense as his was was the only part that could be seen. The second, would rush towards Trilliam. It would seem that Abraxas wasn't holding back, thinking that Trilliam was goo enough that even if he didn't, his attack would be evaded.* - Mon Dec  7 23:41:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as his jutsu was shattered after hitting Trilliam, he wasn't bothered a bit. It actually wasn't the first time he had seen it happen. Shrugging a bit, he'd simply grab his dragon, letting it shoot into the sky as he was attached to it. 

In truth, he was low on chakra from just making the two beast. Though, he wasn't going to let that be known. Once the dragon had leveled out, he'd call down to Trilliam, "looks like you win, I'm already low on Chakra. These things are a bitch." saying such, he'd wait for a response.* - Tue Dec  8 00:01:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head lightly, he'd let the dragon carry him to the ground, "Meh. I've been slacking lately. I was in Kirigakure for a while and got used to drinking. I then went to Konoha and was surrounded by women. So forgive me." chuckling a small bit, he'd let the dragon fall into nothing but dust.* - Tue Dec  8 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd look to Trilliam. "Look, I was busy alright?" saying such, he'd slowly calm himself, getting his breathing to where it needed to be in order to regain his composure. Once he had done so, he'd shake his head, moving to sit as he thought. Once he had gained enough chakra back from his bit of meditation, he'd eventually get ready to go ahead and practice to get Trilliam off his back. Of course, starting with the hand seals that he had learned from him.

Once he had gone through the seals, he'd eventually let his chakra build again. Pushing it into the ground. Once he had done this, a sudden rush of mud would appear, flowing towards the walls.* - Tue Dec  8 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hiroshi(Marchie15) says: Well you got anything else for me? - Tue Dec  8 01:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing softly as he decided to continue to practice, he'd again go through the seals, starting to get ready for another round of chakra waste. Once he had finished the seals, he'd again build up the chakra inside of his body, reaching down with his hands and letting his chakra flood out. It hitting the wall again, mud that is, it would splash up coating the wall of the area.

Once he was sure that he could go again, he'd go through the seals once more. Building the chakra, he'd sigh, "This is a pain in the ass Trill." saying such, he'd reach down, letting his chakra flow out, and turn into mud once more, slamming into the wall again. Sighing, standing up he'd say, "Are you sure I can't learn something else yet?"* - Tue Dec  8 01:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to the scroll he had been given, he'd shrug lightly, moving to open it. Once he had, he'd glace over the pages with curiousity. "Hm, seems interesting." having said such, he'd look for seals, explinations and the such on how to do it, hoping that perhaps there were a few tips on the page. Once he had gone it over once, he'd nod slightly and lean back, "Let me guess, I'm going to have to master this one as well before I get another one?" asking such he'd sigh.* - Tue Dec  8 01:28:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more as no one answered him, he'd simply shrug, figuring that he may as well continue to go over the scroll he had been given. Glancing it over, he'd feel as if he had gotten the gist of it, and could likely do it. Though feeling like he should try it out once, he'd make a dry run, testing out the seals to see how well he could do it, and practicing the chakra gathering. Once he was sure he'd be able to do this, he'd decide it was best to actually make a run with it.

Sighing lightly, he'd quickly start to do as he had before, trying to run throught the hand seals the best he could without messing them up. Once he had gotten them right, he'd then move onto the chakra portion, letting it build up in him before he let it sink into the sand, allowing him to dip into it completely.
