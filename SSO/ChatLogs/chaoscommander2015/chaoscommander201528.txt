<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit more, pulling one hand out of his jacket to rest on his neck he'd say, "Sorry to disapoint, but I'm no where near you. I wasn't exactly looked on as 'something' to train."* - Thu Nov  5 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head a bit he'd simply respond, "I see no point in fighting a battle so weighted to one side that it will yield no progress for me." saying such, he'd move to return his hand to his jacket, looking to her with a rather blank face. He wasn't one to purposely walk into a slaughter.* - Thu Nov  5 01:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her now he'd simply sit where he was, not wanting to say anything, or move any closer being he was afraid of some sort of backlash from her if he did, "I will make a deal with you though. Promise not to use your blade. . .or jutsu, and I'll train with you. I lack either of those. I simply have my threads."* - Thu Nov  5 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit he'd chuckle and say, "What is this? A divorce? We're both trying to talk each other out of something." chuckling a bit more he'd finally straighten up, saying, "I'm fine with that, but I'm still unsure how much of a challenge I'll be for you."* - Thu Nov  5 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing her words, he'd almost panic, wanting to fall back to using his threads. Though, being that he had agreed to it, he wouldn't even put up a defense. He figured if he was going to get a beating, he'd not make a fool of himself by throwing up a pathetic defense.* - Thu Nov  5 01:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) basically outmatched in every aspect now, he'd simply take his beating, not even trying to avoid any of the hits. Basically getting beat to a pulp at this point, he'd be hit with the punch to the stomach, sent back, hitting the ground. At some point in this entire beating, it had come to him that being he couldn't put up a decent fight, that he'd simply let her beat him, and get her anger out of her system, he was somewhat used to it by now.

Being that he had been hit back, he'd slowly stand back to his feet, rubbing his jaw a bit before then going to rub his stomach. In truth, he felt like he was in a rather large amount of pain after all of the hits added up on him, but he wouldn't show it, "What? Is that all you have?" saying such, he'd continue to stand where he had landed.* - Thu Nov  5 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I said before. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Even if I did. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It wouldn't matter. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: The outcome would be the same. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It would be better than just sitting around beating on someone. No thank you. - Thu Nov  5 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit he'd shrug, "I'm not going to put up a defense that can't match up to the attack. Nor am I going to attack when I know my attack it outmatched by your defensive abilities."* - Thu Nov  5 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Okay, then nothing will happen. It's that simple. - Thu Nov  5 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her again he'd simply say, "Well, I guess I'll make a fool of myself this once." saying such, he'd attempt to make his way forward, not exactly very fast in terms of speed, he'd aim a punch towards Nina's jaw, though, he had second thoughts about hurting her, even if he knew he'd likely be avoided anyway. 

If this worked, he'd simply stop, just wanting to show her that it was mostly pointless for this fight.* - Thu Nov  5 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Being pushed back, he'd keep a straight face. Rising once more to his feet, he'd shrug, "Well then. No point in me staying here. I don't seem to be of any help." saying such, he'd dust himself off and contemplate where he wanted to go.* - Thu Nov  5 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Well, do what you decide to do, and I'll decide what to do in return. - Thu Nov  5 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Shrugging, looking to her once more he'd ask in a monotoned voice, as he was asking this in a logical manor, "Does me being around help you at all?" as he had originally only came here because of her in the first place.* - Thu Nov  5 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: It could in the future, you never know. - Thu Nov  5 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: But it isn't now? - Thu Nov  5 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Like I said, you never know. - Thu Nov  5 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not asking of the future. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: What if you leave and someone tries to attack me. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Two against one could scare them off. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: So, like I said, you never know. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Let me rephrase. - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Do you want me here? - Thu Nov  5 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I don't care if you're here, as long as you're on my side. - Thu Nov  5 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov  5 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Hell, I don't care if Ortho is here. - Thu Nov  5 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: That doesn't exactly help my problem. - Thu Nov  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Look, I'm going to be straight to the point. If you want to leave, then leave. - Thu Nov  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: That's on you. - Thu Nov  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) sighing a bit more, he'd sit where he was again, rubbing his stomach where he had been hit, "I'm looking for a reason to stay or leave. I'm basically undecided."* - Thu Nov  5 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head he'd say, "Power is but a bi-product. I cam here orignally for you." saying such in a simple manor he'd then go on to say, "Though I'm sorry to inform you, but Kirigakure is basically gone. They all fled to Suna. Thus, why I plan to take hold of Kirigakure once I have the power."* - Thu Nov  5 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Whoever sit around instead of helping Violet will die. - Thu Nov  5 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: By my hands if need be. - Thu Nov  5 02:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: And the one with her swords will die slowly. - Thu Nov  5 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: No matter what village they are occupied in. - Thu Nov  5 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .I see. - Thu Nov  5 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I said, I came here originally for you. Though if you plan to go on some big revenge, why are you still with Ortho? He was the main cause to it. - Thu Nov  5 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Would not have happened if the village had helped instead of letting her fight alone. - Thu Nov  5 02:26:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Multiple people died fighting him. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Multiple people also sat around watching them fight because they're cowards. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: The ones who didn't help were either not there at the time, or were too weak. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'd rather fight and die with someone than to live and watch them die. - Thu Nov  5 02:27:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) simply shakes his head and sighs again, he was beginning to think this was all a bad idea on his part, "So you're telling me, what you blame the village more than you blame the man who purposely went there to kill her? Is it because you're related?"* - Thu Nov  5 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing he'd simply look to her and say, "You're but a shell now. I'll talk to you again once you learn how to use your emotions again. At least the ones besides hate." saying such he'd move to begin and walk away. He may have been weak, but he had his mind set again. He had taken back his original choice to stay with Nina, and would deicide to walk a different path now.* - Thu Nov  5 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Having made his way to Konoha, only to realize that he felt he had made yet another bad choice, he would have made his way back. Upon arrival, he'd sit, not saying anything.* - Thu Nov  5 02:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) seeing a person suddenly poof into the area, though, being that he had just been in a sort of argument, it really wouldn't affect him. Sitting on the path up to the higher building, he'd raise a hand to them, "Yo."* - Thu Nov  5 04:06:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Hmm. - Thu Nov  5 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: What brings another soul to Kumogakure? - Thu Nov  5 04:08:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Indeed. - Thu Nov  5 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: And why would that stop me? - Thu Nov  5 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Unknown. - Thu Nov  5 04:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: This village tends to have no one around it. - Thu Nov  5 04:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Meh. - Thu Nov  5 04:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I tend to visit empty places. - Thu Nov  5 04:16:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: A wandering soul. - Thu Nov  5 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Around these parts I am the only thing alive. - Thu Nov  5 04:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Thu Nov  5 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: That blows, I assume. - Thu Nov  5 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: Yeah. - Thu Nov  5 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why not leave? - Thu Nov  5 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: No need. - Thu Nov  5 04:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Konami(AxelFraire) says: The dead and I get along. - Thu Nov  5 04:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Slowly stands to his feet, brushing himself off, "Well then, I won't be bothering you anymore. I have to go find someone to 'collect' from." saying such he'd stretch some before throwing his hands into his pockets.* - Thu Nov  5 04:31:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're going to be the Mizukage. - Fri Nov  6 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov  6 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: You're joking right? - Fri Nov  6 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't joke when it comes to business. - Fri Nov  6 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I told you I'd only take that position when I was ready. - Fri Nov  6 01:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You're ready now. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Lets go. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Ortho. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not going to lead a village when I can't even defend myself. - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: .... - Fri Nov  6 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Speaking of. - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Will you two excuse me? - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I wish to speak with my sister dearest alone. - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I assume we'll finish this conversation afterwards? - Fri Nov  6 01:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: ....What's this about. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) throws his hands back into his pockets, and follows Ume.* - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Care to explain what Ortho has in mind for me? - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know, but I think you should do it. He knows what is best for you. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: And it's what you want. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Your laughing said otherwise. - Fri Nov  6 01:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Because it was 'ironic' after the effort he put in to take Kiri, he gives it to you. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Plus. I can't defend and lead a village if I can't protect myself. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: And I refuse to be a figure head. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: .... why? - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Maybe you don't need to be physically strong to be kage and rebuild the village. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'd simply be a stand in for Ortho. - Fri Nov  6 01:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Even if you were, it would be helping him and Nina. Do you want that? - Fri Nov  6 01:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm unsure what I want anymore. - Fri Nov  6 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Well I think you should do it. - Fri Nov  6 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? And why is that? - Fri Nov  6 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Honestly... I don't think you belong out here. You belong in there... and you have a dream to be the kage, and I think if you have the opportunity now you should take it. If you don't, maybe the opportunity won't ever come along again. - Fri Nov  6 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) glancing her over he'd simply shake his head a bit. "I said I wanted to be it when I was ready. I don't feel that I am." pausing to pull one of his hands out of his pocket, he'd rub the back of his neck, "Sure, it may be my dream. But I'd rather wait and perhaps miss it, then rush into it and destroy it with my own hands." saying such he'd shrug his shoulders a tad.* - Fri Nov  6 02:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: You will have help. - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Again. - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Kirigakure needs a leader, and you are the only one with the inspiration to rebuild it. - Fri Nov  6 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It'd make me but a figure head. - Fri Nov  6 02:07:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit he'd simply say, "And they wouldn't be in Ortho hadn't let an attack. But that isn't the issue." pausing again, stretching out a bit, he'd go on, "They may need inspiration, and leadership. But the one thing they need the most, I can't provide, and that's protection. Believe me from experiance, no one wants to follow someone they could beat blindfolded."* - Fri Nov  6 02:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Listening to her speak, a few questions would pop into his head, but he wouldn't voice them yet, he'd wait for her to finish, and once she had, he'd simply nod at fist. "I can agree with you I guess, but answer me this, what do you know about what it means to be a Kage? You act as if you talk from experiance, or are you simply stating what you feel they should be yourself?" having stated such, his normal blank face would form back, his hands again going to his pockets.* - Fri Nov  6 02:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Lifting his hand out a bit, letting some threads pop up like snakes he'd say, "I didn't have the pleasure of being a 'civilian' " saying such, he'd let the threads retract, and he'd shrug a bit.* - Fri Nov  6 02:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you... human? - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Of course. - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Are you sure? - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just. . .different. - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Mn. - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: At least. - Fri Nov  6 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I can say at one point I was. - Fri Nov  6 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: So you aren't anymore? - Fri Nov  6 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . . - Fri Nov  6 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) removing his jacket, and again tying his rather long hair back, again revealing the stiching he'd say, "You tell me? Does this look human? I'm threads, flesh, and hearts." shrugging a bit, he'd move to cover back up.* - Fri Nov  6 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm...not human either. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Fri Nov  6 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I never met anyone different...so ...I thought I could tell you. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Don't tell anyone though. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: And. . .do tell. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: How aren't you human? - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I'm uh.... - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't die. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Technically. . .I can't exactly either. . .if I maintain. - Fri Nov  6 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow at her again he'd go on to ask a few questions, "What ever do you mean by that? And, why tell me all of this anyway? I only ever see you talk to Ortho or Index."* - Fri Nov  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I told you why I told you.... because you are like me. Different. - Fri Nov  6 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Who made you? And what are you exactly then? - Fri Nov  6 02:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I can't tell you what I am.... - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I .... I don't know. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: I don't know what I am... or who made me. - Fri Nov  6 02:29:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's nature related. - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: What? - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. - Fri Nov  6 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: You've been listening to plants haven't you? - Fri Nov  6 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) says: Oh... I guess... I thought that was just something I was good at and everyone else was bad. - Fri Nov  6 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not exactly. - Fri Nov  6 02:31:02 2015
