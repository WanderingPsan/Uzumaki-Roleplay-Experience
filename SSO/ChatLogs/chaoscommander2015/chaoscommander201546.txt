<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) looking around, he'd shake his head, pulling out his smallest set of spare clothes, likely still too large for her, he'd chuckle, "Good luck." though eventually walking her to the bathroom and explaining it he'd say, "Take you time, no rush." before trying to turn and leave.* - Fri Dec 11 23:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her with a chuckle at how she looked, and at her coming out in the larger clothes. "I'm sorry, seems I gave you somehting too big. Mind if I help you?" asking such he'd move towards her with some rope.

If allowed, he'd pull the bottoms up and tie them up, tight enough for them to stay there, yet not tight enough to be uncomfortable. Moving then to roll the bottoms up to be at the right length he'd nod. Looking to the shirt. Scratching his head in confusion, he'd move to pull it tighter on her, tying it on the knot on the side to hold all the extra clothing in. Basically, it's look weird, but everything would likely be held in place, and it would be comfortable for her.

Perhaps Abraxas had experiance in taking care of others?

"There, all better."* - Fri Dec 11 23:48:25 2015

Moving to get a bit of oil boiling, he'd go about peeling and cutting them, eventually frying them up, and seasoning them to taste as good as any others, if not better, "Go crazy~" saying such after they had cooled a bit, he'd hand a plate to her.* - Fri Dec 11 23:57:48 2015
