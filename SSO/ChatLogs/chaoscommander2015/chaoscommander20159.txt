"Well Kat, if you'd like, you could always come relax at the place I've been crashing at. It'd get us out of the sand, and better yet, I wouldn't have to hear everyone else speak for the time being." making a small effort to show what he meant when he started to rub his head. He would be a million times happier ICly and OOCly once this shit was healed.* - Tue Oct  6 02:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) leads Kat through the obvious tons of people being that it was a massive village, until he arrived at a small sand building, much like the rest of the building in Suna. Opening the door to let walk in first, he would hold it open for her to follow before closing it.

The first room would be an obvious place to drop shoes, followed by a small living room which would hold a couch that would be a bit too big for the room, a chair, and all the other usual items one would find. This room would then connect to three other directions. 

One, being a kitchen, which would be fully stocked with accessories and such, and a full fridge. One, would be the main bedroom, with a extra large bed, being that Kang was one of those people who rolled around a bit unless held still, and a few other items such as a dresser, and small bathroom in a side door. The last door connected to the living room would be a hallway with a bathroom connected off to the side, and at the end of the hallway would be a spar bedroom.* - Tue Oct  6 02:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Would note he would immediately head to the couch once Kat had made her way in, making sure to rub his eyes a bit, it would seem bright light also bothered his head a bit, which was quite aggrivating.* - Tue Oct  6 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) After taking his shoes off and headed in, as stated before, he would have been on the couch beside Katsune, "This isn't so bad is it?" it was a serious question. He was sure it was obvious, but he wasn't good at this, at all, and thus wanted actual feedback, which might seem silly.* - Tue Oct  6 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) raising an eyebrow he would say, "Ya know, I really enjoy being around you. While I sometimes can't figure you out, It's nice to be able to talk to you, even if you do sometimes come to hate it, or seem to be annoyed by it at least." shrugging a bit he would glance her over, wanting to pay her another compliment of what he thought, when he -knew- he really shouldn't, he thought perhaps since he was injured he'd be able to get away with it, though it would be said in a bit of a mumble, and absentmindedly, "You really are beautiful, Hair, eyes. . ." pausing, trying to stear clear of being perverted, "And believe it or not, I actually really like your personality." shooting her a smirk at the end to show that the -way- he said the last sentence was a bit of a joke, meaning that he simply liked her personality, the 'believe it or not' part was simply to plat a bit.* - Tue Oct  6 02:29:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow as he had said all of that, and gotten a reply such as what she said, he would shrug a bit, nothing he could do about it, "If you want you can use the spare room here." making only a suggestion, "Though of course if you don't want to, I understand" figuring staying in a house asleep where she hadn't been before might be too much for her.* - Tue Oct  6 02:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Sure. - Tue Oct  6 02:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, he would position himself across from Sanoke. Rubbing his head for a moment, only a numb feeling left really. Shaking this off, he would state, "I guess I'll start first." upon saying such, he would quickly make a motion with his hands. Building up chakra inside of his body, he would quickly let it out, spewing from his mouth in the form of mud.

This mud would then form up to be an exact copy of himself,  it would be positioned infront of him, kneeled down.* - Tue Oct  6 18:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he didn't have the ability to keep up, or even guess where Sanoke would stop, he would have no chance at what was going to come, so thus, he would be hit, almost going down instantly. Though, he must have had retained a bit of control as the clone basically dove at Sanoke, aiming to colide with his around head area.

If this worked, the clone would instantly turn back to mud, and aim to clog both his nose, and mouth. Though, in all likelyness, the clone would miss, and Kang would be left on the ground in pain.* - Tue Oct  6 19:10:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Laying there, he would cringe, as the clone that had missed him would walk back over, helping him to his feet. "I was told I needed to be hit, obviously. Plus, I was curious." saying such he would let a few breathes be released. The clone, now holding him up. Forcing himself onward, he would attempt to go through a round of hand seals. 

Being a bit with his seals than his normal speed, if he somehow made it to the end without Sanoke attacking, he would quickly let the chakra out  he had been building up, obviously during the hand seals, in the form of a massive fireball, with decent speed, heading for Sanoke.* - Tue Oct  6 19:20:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he saw his jutsu basically be Tanked by an ugly lizard in a shell, he would say, "I'm done, thanks though Sanoke."* - Tue Oct  6 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Wow! I hope that didn't intimidate you. - Tue Oct  6 19:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Still had a bit of a head injury, and it seemed to be affecting him in the way that, he didn't realize how easily he could be killed, and didn't seem to care either, if anything he seemed, grumpy?* - Tue Oct  6 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I know someone here is up for it. - Tue Oct  6 23:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing him he would say, "Let's go then." stating such, he would quickly preform a set of hand seals as he turned to Shin, quickly building up chakra to the highest extent he could for the jutsu before letting it come flowing out of his mouth.

The chakra would come out in the form of a large fireball, headed directly for Shin. He wouldn't be holding back, and the fireball would be going at full speed. Quickly yelling after, "I hope you can fight!"* - Tue Oct  6 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) being that his own fireball would be pushed back, before the both of them would explode in a ball of flame, he would flinch back a bit. Sighing, he would look ot the boy, "I see you can use fire style as well." upon saying such he would quickly form a seal, once more getting ready for a jutsu.

Once more building chakra inside of his body, he would again let it flow out of his mouth, this time in the form of mud as it dropped to the ground. Though, it would only be there for a moment before suddenly forming up and taking the shape of his own being. "How about Earth?"* - Tue Oct  6 23:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) would note that Kang was already having difficulty physically.* - Tue Oct  6 23:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) being that it seemed that clones would begin to show around the area, he would get slightly paniced. Eyes a bit wide, and sweat beginning to form on his brow, he would again ramble off another set of seals, doing his best to continue on with the fight.

Quickly slaming his hands onto the ground, he would send out two different lines of fire, one streaming a firey circle around himself as defense, and another attempting to circle all of the being that were coming at him, that is if they were close together to do so. It is to be noted that the mud clone was now having to help him stand.* - Tue Oct  6 23:36:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) shook his head, in his mind, it may seem like a giant ball was coming down at him, but it wouldn't stop him. He didn't plan on giving up, even if he knew he couldn't stop the ball, so thus he would sputter out, "If I'm going to lose, it won't be to you." 

Having stated such, he would bring a hand to his head, it still obviously hurting greatly. Bringing his hand back down to his vest he would touch something inside of it. Letting a smirk cross his lips, as it seemed something had happened to him mentally as well when he had gotten injuried, even though for some time he had appeared normal.

Unless by some magic someone had seen what he had done, after a few more moments the mud clone holding him would drop back to regular mud to encase his body and restrict his movement. About a moment later the mud would expand and explode, flying everywhere as the explosive power of multiple tags that had been hidden on the inside of his vest would be enforced onto Kang inside of the mud, it would appear that the boy would be attempting, and probably end successful at taking his own life rather than dying to someone else's hand.* - Tue Oct  6 23:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Simply eyes the two different people, feeling like what ever squabble they were having, would be no gain to him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, all of the activity causing him to have a hard time focusing, "If you'd two like to dance, perhaps do it somewhere better fitted for it?" having said such, he had more said his thoughts, than actually be speaking to the two. 

Having thought outloud, he would calmly close his book, blank look on his face as he attempted to walk to the west, towards the empty walkway.* - Wed Oct  7 05:20:00 2015

Though, I can't help nature." pausing looking to her, he would let a small laugh escape, unable to contain it, "It's nice to have someone I actually like to converse with." showing that he actually found what she said to be funny while it was probably meant to offend him originally. 

"Though didn't you hear me when I first spoke? I thought I got across that I wasn't good for anyone, good people and I don't get along, unless another person like myself disagrees with me, or decides to change on me. Then it always seems like the good people appreiciate when I kill someone similar to myself. Who can you trust these days?" shaking his head a bit at this statement. "You can only trust the barebone, horrible monsters, you can always expect what they'll do."* - Wed Oct  7 06:32:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Don't miss the enemies. - Wed Oct  7 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: People who were convinced, killing you was completely fine and people who had no second thoughts about it. They were right too. - Wed Oct  7 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: I fortunately haven't had enemies strong enough to think about staying around me yet. - Wed Oct  7 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: And as for killing. - Wed Oct  7 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I said, I myself don't exactly kill. . .I sort have am, a middle man of it? - Wed Oct  7 06:37:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Information broker? - Wed Oct  7 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, deciding that it would be easier to show her than try to explain, plus, he didn't exactly care about who knew what he could do, most left after they saw anyway, either to return with a mob to try and kill him, or to get -very- far way from him.

Opening his book to a certain page that looked as if it had just been added to the book, "Let me simply show you." having stated such, he would slowly read over the page, a few very dark sounding words in another language would be heard coming from as he did. Slowly coming to the end, he would simply state one word, "Enter." 

Having said such, a rift in space-time would literally open beside him, a small, hairless beast coming forth from the dark rift. Once it was through, the portal would close. The being, standing to about waist height of a normal person, seem to be able to move a bit fast, but have no real means of attacking, this would be one of his weaker summonings. "This is one of my workers." showing such to hope that she would catch his drift by this point. * - Wed Oct  7 06:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Wed Oct  7 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow he would reach over and pat the small best on the head, "What ever is the matter? Going to run off like most? Or try to kill me like a good few do?"* - Wed Oct  7 06:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, "Come back any time~ I'll keep the place nice and dead like." saying such in a monotone voice, though it was an obvious attempt at a small bit of humor as he looked to the imp, "Exit." causing a rift to appear at its feet, sucking it back down to where it came from.* - Wed Oct  7 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he looked around, he would find himself starting to get a bit hungry. As if to reinforce this, his stomach would suddenly make a loud noise. Shaking his head at this he would slowly reach into his jacket. Pulling out a rather old, blood stained book, he would open it. Looking around to see if anyone was left in the outskirts of the ghost town of a village. Seeing that it appeared no one was around to watch, at least no one living, he would start to read away from the page he was on.

Slowly spewing out words and sounds that would sound like something out of a horror movie, he would let a devilish smirk cross his face. Quickly coming to the end of the page he would speak out, "Enter." having done such, a waist high portal would rip open from thin air beside him. Its dark aura and power fluxing in open air. After a few seconds small red hands would appear at the edge of the portal. Pulling itself forward, a small red beast would start to appear, its body something never seen in the living world.

Once it was completely out of the portal he would look down to it. "Go get me some food. Bread, anything of the such, maybe even some fruit." saying that, he would then go into greater detail of exactly what he was speaking about so that the beast would know exactly what he wanted. Upon having explained such, he would then go on to say, "Go." having said such, he would watch as the small beast scampered off, actually faster than he himself would run.Shaking his head he would say, "He better bring something back good."

The imp that had ran off, would have searched for some time, keeping to the shadows running at its full speed, would have apparently come across an apple tree that had somehow managed to survive all of the damage done to the place. Climbing the tree, it would quickly pick a few apples, doing its best to carry them all. Once it had done this, it would run all the way back to Geralt. Handing them over, it would stay seated, looking to Geralt as if its only purpose was to serve him.

In response to getting the apples from the best he would look down, "Good work. For a reward, the next time I summon you, I'll make sure there is a nice amount of meat for you to eat. And maybe more." having said such, he would put all but one of the apples away. Taking a bite of the one he had left out, he would nod in enjoyment. Looking back to the beast, he would give a smirk. Quickly muttering a few more strange words he would end it with, "Exit." upin saying such, the same type of portal that had tranported the beast here, would suddenly open below it, sucking the monster back down slowly, taking it back to where it had come from.* - Wed Oct  7 18:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he was reading a book, he would take a second to finish reading his page. Once he was done, he would slowly close it and tuck it away before turning to face the boy who seemed to be the hokage now? 

Keeping a blank face aside from a raised eyebrow he would calmly, and apathetically speak out, "Oh? I like the peace and quiet this village now brings, though, since you ask me why I am here, perhaps I can ask you as well?"* - Wed Oct  7 18:58:20 2015

Eventually making his way to what seemed to be a training area, he would stop at the entrance, sitting down, leaning on the fence with a blank face.

Though, some scene of violence seemed to be taking place to him, he would let a smirk take hold on his face for mere moments before it faded back to his apathetic look. Shaking his head a bit, he would reach into his jacket, pulling a book out before starting to read over it, not exactly caring if the people killed each other, it would be entertainment for him. Though, he would be prepared if by some chance he was actually noticed, and was realized not to be a shinobi from this village.* - Wed Oct  7 20:20:16 2015
