<br><font color=yellow>*Abraxas Kurina(Chaos Commander2015) This is a practical application of the Multi-Size Technique, which lets one expand their own body. The point of swelling a single part of the body is to use the weight to increase the power of one's physical attacks. Any body part may be augmented this way, but for ease of use the arms and legs tend to be chosen quite frequently. The speed of the expansion is exceedingly sudden, which makes it extremely difficult to avoid. Like the majority of the Akimichi clan's techniques, this one requires a considerable amount of chakra. Because of this one may choose to use one of the Three Coloured Pills.* - Thu Sep 03 23:14:08 2015

Not much really going on that could entertain him at the moment. A few people lazily talking, and a lone person off to the side practicing jutsu. Thinking for a moment he would simply shake his head as all of this barely interested him.

Only letting it bother him for a few moments more, he would slowly move towards the bench to the side to sit. If he was going to be bored, he was going to be lazy at the same time.* - Wed Sep 23 22:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No shinobi is honorable if you think about it. The motto being striking from the shadows. - Fri Sep 25 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Killing without being seen. - Fri Sep 25 19:04:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I agree with him, what is a honorable ninja. - Fri Sep 25 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He did it out of blood lust. - Fri Sep 25 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Does there really even need to be a reason? - Don't get me wrong, I understand your pain, Yan-San. - Fri Sep 25 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: You want revenge. - Fri Sep 25 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: He's killed councilmen, he's killed innocents. I want vengence for what my village could have been if we had an ounce of peace. - Fri Sep 25 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: If I do not kill him, it will be because he killed me. And I wouldn't have it any other way than one of those two. - Fri Sep 25 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: And that's all there is too it. - Fri Sep 25 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Will you avenge the innocent lives here too? The one's that Kirigakure snuffed out for having special traits? Or do you only care that you've been done wrong? - Fri Sep 25 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Or your village? - Fri Sep 25 19:06:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ...? - Fri Sep 25 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It should attacked on all fronts. - Fri Sep 25 19:06:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: What's the point killing Edge? - Fri Sep 25 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *yawn* Theres no such thing as evil. - Fri Sep 25 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Only opinions. - Fri Sep 25 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: No, I see you've been listening to Seisuke.. Obviously.. There are such things defined as good and evil, it is a matter of perception. - Fri Sep 25 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: I think theres evil... Its just most people think their right. If one to look at its based on empathy more then societ or personal views. One who cares what their goals cost and those that don't. - Fri Sep 25 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I will gain what I need in order to bring anyone to justice that does wrong to the innocent... - Fri Sep 25 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And theres the key word. Perception. - Fri Sep 25 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Does that make it any less real? - Fri Sep 25 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Where one person will see themselves as good another can see them as evil. - Fri Sep 25 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: No human can be astute enough to see all the facades the world has. But those who actually avoid those goals that cost lives, or those who understand the pain their goals will cause. - Fri Sep 25 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: In the end, neither are good or evil. They simple have different opinions. - Fri Sep 25 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Nah... I still think theres evil. - Fri Sep 25 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: Yet my point still stands. - Fri Sep 25 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: It still exists. - Fri Sep 25 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *shrug* Everyones entitled to their own opinions. - Fri Sep 25 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: But evil and good aren't opinions its just what you catagorize someone and their actions. We wouldn't have the words good and evil, other wise. The only thin were argueing is that evil and good has many viewpoints that are based on prejuidice. - Fri Sep 25 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: But if there was some neutral universal observer, it just impossible to set our selves to that view point. - Fri Sep 25 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: So if we go to war with another village, if we kill each other in battle and raid their villages. Which one is evil? - Fri Sep 25 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: The answer might be simple, we're all evil. - Fri Sep 25 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: ..... - Fri Sep 25 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: *Shrug* Your opinion is your own. - Fri Sep 25 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: I personally think, we simply do what we have to in order to survive. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Maybe thats evil in itself. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: No. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Thats instinct. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Anyway. I'm gonna go train some more. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: You say we do what we have to do in order to survive. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: And don't many wish to believe their above the dog and cattle they use. Instinct, the role of lift itself is all based on selfishness. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: There's a difference between evil and good, you simply do not know what you are talking about. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Didn't you get the memo? - Fri Sep 25 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Humans are selfish - Fri Sep 25 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: And that in itself shows ignorance. Everyone is entitled to believe what they want. Theres no wrong or right answer. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Jirun Lanzi(JoJoSpirals) says: Thus we are all evil. Selifsh for revenge, indifference, protecting, and so on and on. - Fri Sep 25 19:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Well - Fri Sep 25 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(Bailey42) says: Training time. - Fri Sep 25 19:15:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) says: I suppose I will take my leave. - Fri Sep 25 19:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Has two custom jutsu, and my setup. The C rank apparently was approved and used before, so says Yan. And another someone made up for me. Mind approving/Denying em? - Fri Sep 25 20:46:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Whistles a bit, looking around, boredom finally driving him to look around for something to do. Sighing a bit, his eyes would finally rest on a girl he found quite cute, though that was as far as his opinion went, or he cared for it to go. 

Walking up to her, raising an eyebrow he would say, "Hello there."* - Fri Sep 25 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hi. - Fri Sep 25 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I've seen you around before, and thought I'd introduce myself. The name is Kang. - Fri Sep 25 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Kohaku. - Fri Sep 25 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: A pleasure to meet you. - Fri Sep 25 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Rubbing the back of his neck at this point, he would sigh a bit. He hadn't really talked to anyone around here before, and had almost zero clue on what to talk about. Being that it seemed training was talked about a bit too much, he would try to stay away from that topic.

Hoping that it was the right choice, he would simply throw his hands behind his head and say, "I've been somewhat confined lately, and haven't exactly seen much of the village even though I've lived here my entire life. Know anything interesting to do?" obviouly lying a bit through his teeth, he knew about most of the area, and simply wanted someone to hang with for a bit.* - Fri Sep 25 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nope. - Fri Sep 25 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit, having been shut down pretty fast he would then simply give up, unable to contain his own amusment, "You get right to the point don't you?" saying such he'd shrug a bit.* - Fri Sep 25 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: All I do is train. - Fri Sep 25 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: ALL I KNOW IS PAIN. - Fri Sep 25 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? I'd offer to train with you, but I lack the ability to keep up with everyone at the time being. - Fri Sep 25 21:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: *Shrug* - Fri Sep 25 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What is your speciality? - Fri Sep 25 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Elemental Jutsu. - Fri Sep 25 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: You? - Fri Sep 25 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Nintai. - Fri Sep 25 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. - Fri Sep 25 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What elemental jutsu? - Fri Sep 25 21:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm currently trying to even myself out with the elements I'm able to use. Though, I'm better with some than others. - Fri Sep 25 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What elements. - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: So, I guess multiple. - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What is your main? - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: At the time being? - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yes. - Fri Sep 25 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Wind. Though I am able to use Fire, and Earth as well.  - Fri Sep 25 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hm. - Fri Sep 25 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I hope to work with all three. - Fri Sep 25 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not just a 'main'. - Fri Sep 25 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Well have fun with that. - Fri Sep 25 21:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: You say that like I'm stupid. - Fri Sep 25 21:23:24 2015
