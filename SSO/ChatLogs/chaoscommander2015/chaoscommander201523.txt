<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to the soda, he'd set it aside, not too fond of it himself, simply having grabbed it to offer, "Or, we can do something else completely, I'm happy just to be around you."* - Wed Oct 28 19:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) getting grabbed by the cheeks, he'd be pushed back to the ground, Masa forcefully kissing him, though he wasn't complaining.* - Wed Oct 28 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being held down still, and continuing to kiss Masa, he'd be surprised with how long she kept it up, needing air he'd try to break the kiss, "What's gotten into you?~" 

though saying such, he'd feel something entire his pants, "Wha-"* - Wed Oct 28 19:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing a bit he'd say, "I wanted real affection that you want to give me, not because I say so." saying such he'd feel the slug enter his underwear, "M-Masa, what is your friend doing?"* - Wed Oct 28 19:31:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Getting pinned back down, he'd have no choice but to go with it, locking lips back with Masa, trying to push back with his own lips. Though, feeling the slug going over him, it'd feel weird, but he didn't find it completely crazy as it started to cause him to react a bit. 

If he had an arm free, he'd attempt to wrap it around Masa, pulling her closer to him.* - Wed Oct 28 19:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Keeping his arm wrapped around her, as she pulled back he'd say, "T-That depends on what you mean. . .I-I'm sure you've read just as much as I have." Saying such, he'd gulp a bit at he felt the slug run over him, "She must want to be in this relationship t-too" saying such as he couldn't help but get a bit hard from the soft, wet feeling.* - Wed Oct 28 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) As he got pushed down, he'd find himself with his heart beating quite fast again, as he tried to pry open Masa's lips with his tongue, though only playfully. If allowed a second to talk when the slug started going up his shirt he'd say, "Y-You're using her to your advantage, no fair." 

Upon saying such, he'd break a rule he knew he'd probably shouldn't keeping one hand on Masa's back to keep her close, and slowly moving the other one down towards her butt, as if he was going to have one hand grab it.* - Wed Oct 28 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing as she didn't mind where he was touching, he'd slowly run his hands down her back before resting both on her butt, grabbing it and such. Though, ignoring the slug now as he was too excited to care, he had simply been joking, he'd lock lips again with her, trying to pry his tongue into her mouth, losing his mind a bit, but still in control.* - Wed Oct 28 19:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling Masa's tongue pushing back, he'd in turn push back slightly, trying to be a bit playful as he pulled his tongue back into his own mouth after a moment, simply trying to continue and lock lips.

Though, finding himself a bit lost in the moment, he'd use his hands that were on Masa's as to try and bring her lower half closer, sticking his leg inbetweem hers, moving it only slightly to 'test the waters'.* - Wed Oct 28 19:55:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, a bit hurt he'd only say, "M-Masa. . ." before looking to the side, "Please don't be that way. . .I didn't mean to go that far. . ."* - Wed Oct 28 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'm just saying. - Wed Oct 28 20:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Wed Oct 28 20:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to the side, obviously too 'excited' to simply stop, "Masa. Please?" saying such he'd go on to sit up, rubbing his neck, "I was. . ." coughing a bit he'd pause, "Enjoying it. . ." saying such he'd look to the side, avoiding her gaze.* - Wed Oct 28 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: I know you were. - Wed Oct 28 20:04:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Mm...Maybe later. - Wed Oct 28 20:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Still a bit too excited, he'd stand up and most likely to one of the stupidest things he could possibly do in this situation, walking behind her he'd try to wrap his arms around her midsection, leaning his head into the back of her, "That's cruel and un-usual punishment." saying such jokingly as he shifted his legs as to -not- let what was in his pants rub against her.* - Wed Oct 28 20:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: You just wanna kiss me all day..But you forgot I'm your bodyguard - Wed Oct 28 20:09:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down at the message that he had gotten back, he'd crumple it up, aggravated by the response more than he should've been. "I'm going to rest Masa. Wake me if you need me. "(Not actually going anywhere.) saying such, he'd remove his shoes and lay on the bed, his mind wandering to many different places as he thought over what he could possibly do.* - Wed Oct 28 20:59:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Rolling over and looking at Masa quite seriously he'd say, "I'm going to make that blade as soon as I possible can." saying such he'd get up, and walk over to his forge, determind to get more knowledge, even if he worked himself into the ground.* - Wed Oct 28 21:05:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Finding himself aggravated by the response he had gotten from his letter, he'd move to his forging materials, looking through what he had. Pulling out a few pieces of metals, he'd look them over, curious to if they'd make good blades or not. Throwing them towards his forge, he'd decide to make use of every single material he had available. He wanted to advance his knowledge, even if it was thought trial and error, and cost him something else, like it had cost his eye originally. Having gotten all of his material to the forge, he'd move on and grab his tools, finding them where they normally were. Nodding at this, he'd move back to his forge with them.

Looking over his forge, he'd grab some nearby wood, throwing it in with the charred bits of the last fire, being that it still had heat from the last time he had used it, it wouldn't take long to start it up. Flaming the heat the best he could, he'd let the forge flare up. While this happened, he'd walk over to the nearby water source, filling a container and making his way back to the forge with it, setting it to the side. Nodding at this, he'd get himself situated in the middle of all of it, making sure his forge was lit. Setting his tools to the side to be accessible he'd nod. * - Wed Oct 28 21:26:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Though,  getting to this point, he'd simply call it quits, turning everything off and stopping. Something making him not want to work on.* - Wed Oct 28 21:34:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Listening to her comment he'd smirk, "Oh? Are you sure you want to joke about that? I could do things to your feet that would amaze you." saying such, he'd chuckle, in truth he'd seen some things having to do with feet in a magazine, bit he wasn't going to mention that.

Moving to her toes, he'd rub them a bit, moving to the top of her feet, doing his best with them.* - Thu Oct 29 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd laugh a bit, "Oh, I don't think I'll let you go through that amazment." saying such, he'd run his hands to the bottom of her feet again, running his fingers lightly on the bottom, trying to tease her. 

"I mean, I've seen some pretty perverted things having to do with feet that I'm sure neither of us want to experiance~" chuckling again, he'd shake his head, moving now to the tops of her feet, near the ankle, massaging the area slowly.* - Thu Oct 29 05:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shrugging a bit he'd say, "I do work with my hands for a living ya know~" saying such, he'd simply wink at her playfully, laughing, he'd move up to start on her legs, first lightly running his hands over them, and coming back down, just using his finger tips, applying pressure down her legs. Going about it as slowly, and relaxingly as he could.* - Thu Oct 29 05:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Would note, only on the top of the legs for now.* - Thu Oct 29 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her laying back he'd simply shrug, taking it as a sign that he was doing well. Moving to the outside of each leg, he massage slowly, and over every inch. Slowing working his way to the inside of her legs he'd start to go up them, getting closer to her underwear, "Here is the part you may want to watch me~ I may get tempted." saying such, he'd get to the inside of her thighs, teasing playfully, as he went slowly about it, only to remove his hands and move to the outside on her hips, working on them, "Or not~"* - Thu Oct 29 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he'd continue though, being straight with her, "In all honesty, looking at you right now. . .I'm thinking really perverted things. . .So much I want to do. ." saying such he'd move onto her stomach, -right- about her underwear line, massaging around that area, and upwards, using his fingers to hit any spot that he thought needed it.* - Thu Oct 29 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling, he'd apply pressure to his hands, massaging up towards right under her chest, taking care not to get close enough for her to get mad. Once done with this he'd say, "Extend your arms a bit will ya?" pausing he'd then say, "Well, even if I am a perv, I can't help it when I have someone this attractive in front of me." saying such he'd then move his hands around her stomach one more time, saying, "Plus, you know you're enjoying this."* - Thu Oct 29 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Gulping, blushing a bit he'd say quite seriously, "Masa. . .be careful. . .I might not be able to resist but so much." saying such he'd move to her right arm first, again applying pressure with his finger tips, and hands as he worked over her hand. Slowly moving up her arm, he'd find his eyes drifting to the loose bra, shaking his head to get rid of the thought. Contining with her arm, he'd get to her shoulder, using both hands to squeeze and apply pressure. 

Skipping over her chest obviouly, he'd reach over and do the same to the other arm and shoulder.* - Thu Oct 29 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Coming to a close with the front of her body, he'd find his eyes drifting to the loose bra, "You do realize you're a tease right?" saying such, he'd take a big gulp of air, "You need to flip. . ."* - Thu Oct 29 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) shaking his head he'd say, "If you tease too much you might break me. . ." saying such seriously he'd work on her shoulders, going down to her back, using his hands, fingers, and even his own elboes to dig into her back, and would work his way down her back and sides.* - Thu Oct 29 05:54:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing this, knowing it was a tease he'd try and withstand himself, "M-Masa. . .if you tease anymore. . .I'll do things that'll make you hate me." saying such as he shifted his legs a bit, hiding his growing package. Still massaging her back a bit, he'd start to have his heart beat a bit fast.* - Thu Oct 29 05:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing what she said he'd go to stop massaging her at first, though as she stood, he'd watch as her bra feel, catching an eyefull of her breast, it'd be the last straw for him, moving forward, he'd go to wrap his arms around her, try to let them land on her ass. "I told you I wouldn't be able to stop. . " If allowed, he'd then go on to attempt and kiss her, his lust going a bit over board.* - Thu Oct 29 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Not being able to stop, he'd squeeze at her ass a bit, having a hard time. Removing one hand from her ass, he'd bring it up to grope her chest, "I-I Can't Masa." saying such, he'd try to keep kissing her, trying to lead her to the bed.* - Thu Oct 29 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being pushed off, he'd be crushed with one sentence. She'd lead him on to much, and couldn't handle it anymore. Watching as she curled up, he'd snap a bit. He didn't know what to do, and thus he'd make his way to the door, not sure where he was going, but he needed to get away, or either Masa would hate him, or she'd hurt him.* - Thu Oct 29 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Turning as he approached the door, he'd simply look back to her, waiting to see what she said before he decided what to do.* - Thu Oct 29 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Come back to the bed. - Thu Oct 29 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Oct 29 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) sighing a bit he'd say, "I can't Masa, it'll end with either you hating me, or me hurt."* - Thu Oct 29 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Come back to the bed. - Thu Oct 29 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hmph. - Thu Oct 29 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd simply walk his way back, sitting on the edge of the bed.* - Thu Oct 29 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Lay down and sleep. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Masa. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I can't do that. - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Why not? - Thu Oct 29 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: sh - Thu Oct 29 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head he'd say, "I can't just sleep right as I am now. Like I said."* - Thu Oct 29 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: *Sigh* - Thu Oct 29 06:23:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) being that he was the weaker of the two, he'd get pulled into the bed, though that didn't mean anything, if she really was going to force him to lay there, he'd simply leave once she was sleep.* - Thu Oct 29 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9fam - Thu Oct 29 06:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Not letting her get into his underwear, he'd simply push her away, "Let's just slip. I was just being a perv anyway, right?" saying such he'd turn his back to her, laying his head on the pillow, clearly aggravated, and if they were ever in the same situation, he'd like literally not be able to stop, no matter how much he wanted to.* - Thu Oct 29 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, his heart melting he'd sit up, "Masa. . .please come back. . .I was being stupid. . ." saying such he'd try to walk up behind her, wrapping his arms around her midsection, his head placed into her back, "You just teased a little to much is all. . ." saying such, he'd try to squeeze her a bit, saddened now.* - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Go to bed. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not without you. - Thu Oct 29 06:31:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Breaking, once more, he'd slowly release his hold on her, heading towards the door, "Good night Masa. Don't just stand there all night. Get some sleep." saying such he was thinking about heading to a village. He knew he had made the biggest mistake in this, but she had started it.* - Thu Oct 29 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd look back, for once in a long time anger actually shown on his face, "Masa, let go of me."* - Thu Oct 29 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: You're not allowed to leave without me. - Thu Oct 29 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: You got hurt the last time - Thu Oct 29 06:35:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: And I can't do a lot of things without you. - Thu Oct 29 06:35:56 2015
