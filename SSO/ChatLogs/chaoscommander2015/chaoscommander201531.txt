<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, ending his conversation with Mei on Owari's entrance, he'd move to look at her, again starting to fake a cheery demenor, "Hello there! Why can I help you with?"* - Sat Nov  7 23:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, listening along with the girls statements, he'd be left with basically nothing but questions. "I didn't see any paper work on you, but I guess it was burnt in the blaze." saying such he'd rub his neck a bit, "Regardless, What assignment did you have under Kirie?" asking such he'd look the girl over closely, tyring to see if she had anything noticable on her.

Though, now finding himself rubbing his head, he'd say, "And please talk slower, I've had a long week." saying such, he'd look intently to Owari for answers.* - Sat Nov  7 23:46:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Damn Ume for ever talking me into this. - Sat Nov  7 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Having taken note of her, he'd listen to her explanation quietly, unsure if he should interupt at all. Though, thinking that some pieces of her story, were pointless to him, he'd in the end, simply nod to her, "I see." mulling things over in his head he'd simply say, "Would you like to continue to do such? I don't have an imediate position to be filled, and I guess I am lacking a spy." chuckling a bit, he'd again sigh, rubbing his neck, "I'll leave the choice to you. If you want to continue to do so, I give you my blessing, and look forward to your reports, but if you want to stay, I'm just as happy."

From the tone of his voice, it would be apparent that enough things were on his mind to the point that this was not such a big deal for him.* - Sat Nov  7 23:55:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Simply raises his hand to wave her off, "Not busy. Just trying to pass the time until I can finally nap." not even hiding the truth, he'd let a legitimate laugh out looking to her. "No need for all of the bowing, and respect. Under these clothes I'm just another person like you." again sighing, he'd smile a small bit waiting for the girl to depart.* - Sun Nov  8 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Yelling after her a small bit he'd simply say, "I'm Jehan, for your own personal information."* - Sun Nov  8 00:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Simply watches this happening, and would move to the table.* - Sun Nov  8 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I might get too used to this. - Sun Nov  8 00:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: Its a roasted fish dish. - Sun Nov  8 00:14:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: I hope you like it. - Sun Nov  8 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Slowly moves to grab the chop sticks. Looking it over, he'd slowly take a piece of it, eatting it, "Not bad."* - Sun Nov  8 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: Thank you. - Sun Nov  8 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Taking a sip of his water, he'd shake his head a bit.

"What do you have in mind my pet?"* - Sun Nov  8 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: I guess a nice nap. - Sun Nov  8 00:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: But. - Sun Nov  8 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: If you desire to have sex with me.  - Sun Nov  8 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: You really need to learn to crave it. - Sun Nov  8 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Or it won't be as fun for me. - Sun Nov  8 00:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: I'm sorry. - Sun Nov  8 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll just have to drive you to always want it~ - Sun Nov  8 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: Well I guess It's time for me to prep. Please relax here I'll be back. - Sun Nov  8 00:23:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Sun Nov  8 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: She obeys so well now.  - Sun Nov  8 00:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Having gotten up to clean away his plate, he'd turn to watch the door, curious to how she'd come out. While waiting, he'd move back to the table, though looking towards Mei.

Catching sight of her when she finally came out, he'd whistle a bit, his member starting to move under his robes. Speaking out to her he'd say, "While it is pleasing, I only really like the Shoes, Collar, and the way you have your hair. . ." pausing to look over her body again as he bit his lip he'd say, "Next time, wear underwear~ It's fun to pull it off of you~" 

Moving now to walk to her, "I want you to wear the collar all the time now. Just without the leash when we go into public." saying such, he'd take a hold of the leash, leading her to the bedroom. Holding onto the leash, he'd push her down to be on her hands and knees, "Now tell me. Want to go slow about this? Or just full out~ I'll let my little pet decide as a treat for dinner~"* - Sun Nov  8 00:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, he'd shake his head, "I'm going to take it slow then. You need to learn to enjoy and crave this." saying such, he'd move behind her, holding the leash rather tightly, pulling back on her head. While at the same time, he'd look to her ass and pull his hand back, smacking it rather hard. Doing this for a good amount of time, He'd say, "Beg~" saying such, he'd move his hand down to rub her a bit.* - Sun Nov  8 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head he'd say, "Pathetic. You act like you don't like this? We have to change that." saying such, he'd release the threads from his body. Two different strands going to the front of her, would rip the netting around her breast. Then, wrapping around them the best they could, they would squeeze down lightly, and then hard, alternating.

Anothing thread, moving forward to rub against her cheek he'd say, "Well? How do you feel? No lying." saying this, he'd at least -wait- for an answer from her before he attempted to put the third strand of threads into her mouth, imitating as if he was there himself, moving back and forth in her mouth.

Now, reaching down to the stocking covering her lower half, he'd rip it at her folds, rubbing it and prodding it with his fingers. Removing the treads from her mouth he'd say, "Be honest. Tell me how it feels, and what you want me to do. If you're honest. I'll do it." saying such, he'd wait for her to speak up, the third strand of threads waiting by.* - Sun Nov  8 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) His guilt finally getting to him, he'd stop everything. "I'm sorry. . ." pausing, looking away he'd say, "I'm a bad person, and a bad Kage. . .I won't touch you again. . .and perhaps step down as kage."* - Sun Nov  8 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: I'm sorry I don't know what to say. - Sun Nov  8 01:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mei(Fang7777) says: Hmm, tie me to the bed and ram my asshole. - Sun Nov  8 01:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head again, he decided that he obviously had pushed the girl too far, and broken her. Removing the Hat, he'd have a mix of anger and depression on it. "I've been called a monster more than once. . ." turning away from her, he'd move to wipe his face. He knew he had messed up the last night, and he was really ready to try to be the good guy now. But after her statement, he'd turn back around, "Then hate me. Do whatever you can to kill me. Fight with all fo your life to get away." 

Saying such, he'd wipe his eyes a bit, "I liked you. Remember that when you're lost." saying such, he'd use his threads to pick her up, pulling her close to him. Quickly ripping a hole above her ass, he'd force himself in without even caring anymore. Thrusting as fast as he could, while also using the threads to move her. 

A serperate thread would move to go into her mouth, fucking her face. Lastly, another thread would enter into her folds, fucking her hard.* - Sun Nov  8 01:18:30 2015

This is what you be for being a bad pet." saying such, he'd continue to force his way into all of her holes.

Quickly thrusting into her folds now, his full length entering her, he'd place the threads into her ass.

Leaning forward as the threads were moving in her mouth he'd say, "Suck on them. Like you want it." saying such, he'd move to her chest, grabbing a hold of one of her breast, and massaging it, while also moving in to lick her nipple.

Then, feeling him slide into her mouth, and her stroking, he'd rest his hands on her head, though not doing anything.

His knees going a bit weak as she continue to spit, jerk, and suck, he'd say, "Damn girl, you are good at this, I guess it's safe to assume this isn't your first time? How old are you even?" asking such, he'd likely slide back into her throat as she tried to take him all the way in. Unable to hold back anymore, he'd try to push her head closer to his dick. Though, removing his hands quickly he'd say, "S-Sorry. I'll pay extra for touching ya."* - Sun Nov  8 03:12:51 2015

"I think you might be the first to see my face since I took up this position." chuckling a bit, he'd of course order a drink.* - Sun Nov  8 07:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Assuming the drink he had ordered finally had shown up, his faked cheerfulness would finally fade, his blank face which would normally be there would take over. His eyes losing their brightness, he'd reach for the drink, taking a small sip. "Gender is just something meant to seperate people, and divide them into groups."* - Sun Nov  8 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) says: LOL. - Sun Nov  8 08:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) hearing what she had said, he'd simply raise his eyebrow. "Why? I'm forced to be cheerful in my position. I don't want anyone in the village to be upset as I have come to be in my short life." saying such in a monotoned voice he'd move to set his drink back down, "I can't exactly help it. It seems to keep me in favor with most people." 

Looking down to the table, he'd again shake his head, he was a bit sick of all the hiding, and faking, but he didn't have a choice in the matter. "Though, if you find this weird, most people find my opinions weird. As my gender one. A few years back, I could care less of Gender if I liked you, I liked you." chuckling for a few moments he'd take another sip of his drink, "And my view on war, and fighting. I could care less about it. I simply want peace within the village, and to let everyone grow." saying such, he'd let a sigh out, "Well, I'm rambling again. . ."* - Sun Nov  8 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, the first thing he'd do was push his own drink to her, "Here. You probably need this more than I." saying such after her comment about losing her pacifist ways. Once he had done so, one of his hands would go to his neck.

"I'm not looking for perminant peace. Just while I'm around. If I have to bribe, bleed, or beg, without the villagers knowing, I will do so to make sure everyone here can live in peace, for as long as I can provide it." pausing here, he'd throw his hands into his robe, "I don't plan to become a legend. I'm fine with being small and forgotten. I'll continue to distance myself, and work, on and behind the scenes to make this village happy as long as I can." shaking his head again after stating this.

"My life span may be cut for taking this position, but if I hadn't how long would it have been before the village fell all together." it would seem he cared more about other's happiness above his own, even if he had to cut himself off from them, and do things no one should have to.

Then thinking to himself, <Even if currently I am but a weakling with no real power. I can lead and make choices, and have a bit of money to improve. I'll live as long as I can.>* - Sun Nov  8 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) simply watched her polish off the drink, being it was fine. Listening to her response quietly, he'd simply shake his head, "You have me wrong, I've only been in charge a few weeks now. I'm simply trying to perserve it until someone better comes along." saying such in a monotone voice, he'd order himself another drink, pausing to look towards her again.

"I couldn't care less if the villagers care about what I'm doing. Or if they even give me a funeral. I refused to make connections anymore, so this is my own sick twisted joy. I at least want the village I was born in to continue on." pausing looking to her, he'd wave it off, his face lacking of joy, he knew of all of the flaws, he was simply trying to get through life, "Well, enough about me. . ."* - Sun Nov  8 08:59:18 2015

"I'm sorry for all of the tragedy you've had to see in these few month then. At least mine was spread out over a life time." saying such, he'd rub his neck again, looking Ai over. Raising his drink a bit he'd say, "Though I can agree with you last sentence. The people waiting for us wouldn't want us to join them so quickly." somewhat holding his drink in the middle of the table now he'd say, "Cheers to those people." obviously saying it to shwo respect to the people they had both lost.* - Sun Nov  8 17:16:48 2015
