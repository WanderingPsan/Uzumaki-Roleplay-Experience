<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Follow me. - Thu Oct  8 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Looks to Khalil, "Seriously, don't run when you see it alright?" having said such he would quickly reach inside of his large coat, pulling out an old black book that seemed to have old dried dark -red- stains all over it. Once he had it out he would quickly open it, turning in a good many pages until he got to the right one. Once there he would quickly nod, "I'm serious, don't. It'll only make things worse." having said such he would quickly start to read.

The words being said would sound very satanic, and dark. They would be almost inaudable, and impossible to understand by anyone not of his kind. Once he had come to the end of the rambling, he would quickly shut the book and speak, "Enter." 

Upon saying this, a hole would literally open in spacetime beside him. The hole would emit a dark aura, and give off the feeling of death. Two red hands appearing at the edges of the portal would slowly start to pull the beast forward. Slowly making his way out, he would emerge completely from the portal. It's form would be of a waist high, red, beast like creature. Having horns, and being relatively agile. "This is what I do. This one in particular I use for. . .'gathering' items.* - Thu Oct  8 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, seeing that Khalil seemed to be frightened, he would quickly shake his head, "Exit." saying such, a dark portal, much like the kind that had brought the monster here would appear beneath it, sucking back to where it came from. 

Once this was done he would look to Khalil, "I told you it would be too much."* - Thu Oct  8 03:03:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Smirking at Khalil he would say, "Don't try to be cool~ It doesn't work for you, If you were scared, I can always comfort you." obviously joking, as he wasn't one to actually comfort, he would jokeningly hold his arms our for a hug, which, he didn't do hugs either. So, it was obviously all teasing.* - Thu Oct  8 03:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: Don't lie, it's so not cute, and I wanted a hug~ I'm a bit upset now. - Thu Oct  8 03:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Kicks the dirt again, "Meet me halfway?"  Walking half the distance, and holding his arms out, he would look away. this is hard to act for him, but he was making it work. It was -miles- away from his true personality.* - Thu Oct  8 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing a small bit he would reach forward, grabbing Khalil and pulling him to his chest. Hugging on with the passion of a mother to their child. Looking away from Khalil as he did this he would say, "This is. . .different."* - Thu Oct  8 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) actually, really enjoying this moment, he would hold onto Khalil while he tried to pull away, one hand rubbing his head a small bit. Acting like a parent would. Once he realized what he was doing, he would snap back ro how he normally was. Letting go on Khalil he would say, "I-I'm sorry, I dunno why I did that." seeing as it was likely Khalil would take a few steps back, he would mumble to himself, "No need to back so far away . . "* - Thu Oct  8 03:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: I just thought.. - Thu Oct  8 03:35:28 2015

Loads of different thoughts running through his mind on what he could do at this exact moment, so many, many -wrong- things, he would hold himself back. He would reach up and simply put a hand on top on Khalil's, in a very intimate mannor. Not saying anything at all.* - Thu Oct  8 04:03:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) He knew almost nothing about the boy behind him, but, he was sort of an evil person, and being that it was one of those 'First sight' reaction, gutt feelings, he would quickly turn around to stare into Khalil's eyes, "I think I might be feeling a mixture of the last two towards you. . .So I'll understand if you'd like to stay away from me." having done all of this while somehow having managed to still have his hand in him own.* - Thu Oct  8 04:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Basically losing all composure, he would move even closer to him. "Y-your actions aren't proving your words. . ." upon saying such, he would bring a hand to Khalil's face, moving his thumb acorss it slowly. "You aren't helping me at all. . ."* - Thu Oct  8 04:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) The last little bit of resolve starting to slip he would say, "You'd have to fight my monsters. . .and I don't want you to face that horror." saying such his would continue to brush his hand across his face. His free hand going to the small of his back, pulling him even closer. Not enough to touch, but they may as well be face to face as Geralt looked to him. "Do you dislike this. . .?"* - Thu Oct  8 04:30:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he knew he was going to far, he would loosen his grip just enough to where Khalil could back away a -small- bit if he wanted to, "I'm not good with fighting myself. . .I have to use my monsters." saying such he would then go on to say, "I-I'm sorry, this is weird isn't it?" saying such he would still continue his hold on Khalil, but was looking away from him.* - Thu Oct  8 04:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Would be sweating a small bit, and blushing heavily, it was obvious his grip on the situation loosened each time it was brought up.* - Thu Oct  8 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Alright, we can stop talking about it, haha. - Thu Oct  8 06:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) His face lighting up even more he would look down, "Do you mind if I atleast do one thing?"* - Thu Oct  8 06:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi, Khalil(BoyLeafeon) says: Sure, hah. - Thu Oct  8 06:20:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) says: -Omit- - Thu Oct  8 06:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing heavier than he had in any of the speeches they had, he would slowly reach down and tilt Khalil's face up. Forcefully pulling him up further to where he could reach his face, he would attempt something risky. He would lean in, and slowly, and more tenderly than he had ever done anything before, plant a small kiss on his lips, or at least attempting to. If he had, he would bury himself back into his coat, embarassed over it all.* - Thu Oct  8 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Slowly bringing himself to calm down, he would left the boy up, taking him off to a place to sleep.* - Thu Oct  8 06:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: The things I could do to him right now. . . - Thu Oct  8 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: No, I won't. . . - Thu Oct  8 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) having just had a thought that he wouldn't do anything, he would watch as Khalil's butt was stuck out at him. Temptation driving him but this point, he at least wanted to know, if he was wearing all of these girl's clothes, was he wearing the underwear as well? So thus, he would move over, carefully grabbing at the edge of his pants and pulling them down just enough to see. If he was wearing them, he'd likely just cop one last feel, get a noisebleed, and go to bed and have -many- naughty dreams. If he wasn't, he'd just cop a feel and go to bed. Though, if for some odd reason he wasn't wearing anything underneath, he might lose every string of self control he had left.* - Thu Oct  8 06:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Almost loses his shit, but doesn't keeping a hold of it. Quickly getting a nice squeeze in, he would feel very dirty before heading to bed himself.* - Thu Oct  8 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Slowly wakes up, looking over to Khalil. He would smile for a moment, until the realization hit, Did he ever pull Khalil's pants back up? Panicing a bit, he would just lay there, hoping that he had, and that when Khalil woke up he wouldn't question it.* - Thu Oct  8 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Geralt(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing a bit, he figured it would be better to tell the truth. Pausing he would slowly say, "I Er. . .when I laid you down. . .it was stuck out. . .and I wanted to know. . .and." panics a bit, and again, competely opposite of his personality, he would hide under the blankets, "I only looked. . ." which wasn't the complete truth, but he didn't assume he had a strong case anyway.* - Thu Oct  8 15:51:53 2015
