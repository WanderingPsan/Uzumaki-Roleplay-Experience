<br><br><font color=teal>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) says: Never gonna hit even C+_ - Tue Oct 20 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more, having come back to his new training spot being that his usual one was still overrun with people, he would glance around the area, curious to if anyone was around that would cause him to have to move to a different location. Noting that no one was around he would let a breathe of air escape his lips, he was relieved. He didn't want anyone else to see him train, being that he felt subconscious about the whole thing, even though he usually wouldn't seem like the person to act this way. Thus, shaking the thought off, he would be ready to start getting ready.

Having once more started off the way he would with any training, he would begin to close his eyes and take a few large, deep breathes, clearing his mind. Throwing away anything unneeded, he would black out all other things, such as sound and weather, being that as usual he needed complete focus when just starting out with a jutsu, unless he wanted to fail again and again. Nodding to himself with this, he would find his mind merging into the correct place that he wanted it for this training session.

Starting with the seals needed, he would like any other jutsu start slowly, making sure he would get each one right. Though, messing up once, he would force himself to go back to the start, and redo it all. Going through them slowly in the correct order he knew he had to go in, it would take him quite a bit of time, being that for the moment he would simply work on getting his seal faster, ignoring the chakra side of the technique for the moment. Once he was sure that he could do them correctly in a fast manor, he would stop, letting himself have a small break to drink some water.

Bringing himself back to full focus, he would decide that he would skip the seal portion, being that he had it down packed from what he could tell, and would go to the chakra building portion, deciding that he would do it separately for now and combine the two when he was ready. Thus, he would begin to build up water based chakra inside of his body, taking it and compressing it inside of himself. Once he felt he had gotten a good amount, and felt it was easy to do, he would let the chakra dissipate, being that he was ready to attempt the jutsu.  

Sighing, still having a bit of focus, he would start from the begging, ready to actually enact this jutsu. Quickly going through the seals needed for it, he would find it easy to do, having doubled his speed with them from when he had tried before. Moving on, he would go onto the chakra building portion, quickly starting to gather chakra inside of his body, water natured obviously, as it gathered, he would compress it into itself allowing more chakra in a smaller area of space. Content with this, he would move onto the next step.

Straining a bit, he would start to force the chakra to move, much like the wind technique he was using earlier, he would move it slowly, making it head through his body and towards his mouth. Once there, he would force it to bottleneck up, and build pressure. Of course, if left alone for too long, this could be a dangerous thing, but he would refuse to let it get that far. Though, continuing to build it up, he would hold it there as long as he could, trying to ensure that this technique would be basically perfect on one of its first uses.

Finally feeling the heavy strain from the withholding of chakra, he would let it all loose, letting it stream forward and out, hopefully in the form of water. Though, it would seem like something would go wrong as it would basically only come out in a small squirt like it was from a water gun. Though, he would let it pass, he took it as a simple side effect of being one of the only times he had used the jutsu, and that it would simply take more uses in order to actually get a useful effect out of this technique. Nodding at this, he would sigh, deciding to take a break for the time being.* - Tue Oct 20 22:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Finding himself again back to the training ground, he would find himself starting to be depressed. The lack of activity in kirigakure was ridiculous, though he had to get stonger for the Mizukage, and thus, he would as usual, close his eyes and get his mind ready foe training, making sure that everything else was blocked out that wasn't needed. Once he had done this, he would open his eyes back up, controlling his breathing while ignoring the unimportant things around him.

Once he had done all of this, he would again make the few seals needed for the technique he had been working on recently, not missing a single one this time around as he had gotten used to them. Then, moving onto the more important part, he would begin to build up water natured chakra inside of his body, taking his time as he wanted to make sure he had the right quantity, and quality with the chakra. While doing this, he would let himself a second to breathe, and rub his neck, as all of the constant training was begging to get to him.

Being that he had built up the required chakra, he would pause, remembering what had happened the last time he had used this jutsu, he would take time to go back and go over his chakra, this time, he would start to compress it the best he could, wanting to have more of it, with more pressure before he tried it again. He didn't want to have just a dribble come out when he used this jutsu again. Thus, finding him self happy with what he had done chakra wise, he would again let a sigh loose, almost ready to advance.

Now, being that he had all of the chakra built up, and compressed that he needed, he would go onto the next step of compression, he would start to force the chakra he had gathered to flow, forcing it to go up towards his mouth. Though, when it got there, like before, he would bottleneck it, causing the pressure to grow, and the force behind it along with it. Holding this for as long as he could, he would quickly turn to find a target before he was forced to release the chakra. Finding a nearby tree, he would be content with it as a stand-in enemy shinobi.

Being that he had his chakra built, and compressed, and his target picked out, he would suddenly release the chakra, letting it now stream out in the form that he always wanted for it, a large stream of water in comparison to what he had before. This now being equal to that of a large hose, he knew it wasn't mean to be used as an actual weapon, and was meant for more of a starter technique, he would find himself happy with it as it crashed into the tree, soaking it down, and leaving water covering the tree long after he had stopped.

Happy with the result, he would have stopped his jutsu, and in turn walk to the tree to check what sort of effect it had. Upon getting there, he would note that it didn't exactly do much, though he recognized it was a lesser technique, and wouldn't have expected much to start. Thus, he would turn and walk back to the spot he had originally been, calling it quits with this current technique, and thinking about if he should finally take a break, or continue training for the time being. Shrugging, he would simply sit for the time being.* - Tue Oct 20 23:07:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing Shoji laugh, he would decide to have some fun with the boy. Quickly bolting forward, he would seem to vanish to anyone who didn't have beyond normal eyesight. Appearing  behind Shoji he would say, "Something funny?" having said such, he would look deadpan at him, actually curious to what the boy found funny.* - Wed Oct 21 00:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minabuchi Yakaze(TenaciousDeeznuts) thinks: I see, so really a spar wouldnt really do anything ... Baylea get's a feel of the person, potentially. Then, with her lackey they have a general idea of what they can do... I do think you've revealed your hand a bit too early, friend.. The child saw your card. - Wed Oct 21 00:29:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow as it seemed the boy had kept up with him, he would let a smirk come to his lips, "Oh, suprising, most can't see me at full speed." actually curious now he would slowly walk back to where he had been standing before. "Seems you are more than simply travelers. Care to be truthful? Simple 'travelers' wouldn't be able to keep up with me."* - Wed Oct 21 00:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, simply shaking his head at this point, he would rub the back of his neck. Turning to walk back a few more paces, he would start on some seals as he did so, simply to be prepared in the case that he needed them. He had seen people laugh over pointless things like this before, and it usually meant they were crazy, and prone to violence. Thinking this, he would finish off his seals and turn to look back at the two, now speaking to Baylea, "Is he always like this?"* - Wed Oct 21 00:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Sometimes. - Wed Oct 21 00:37:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: I think it's gone to his head. - Wed Oct 21 00:38:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, he would now be building up his chakra inside of his body, and a rather large amount at that. Letting it gather, he would compress it over and over, letting the pressure, and the mass of it build, "He seems a bit weird." having said such he would simply rub his neck, he had no intention of doing anything unless he had to.* - Wed Oct 21 00:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Hm.. - Wed Oct 21 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: He's so boring. - Wed Oct 21 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Remember what I told you? - Wed Oct 21 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: Mmmm. - Wed Oct 21 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: Then go at him, but try not to hurt him to bad. - Wed Oct 21 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: But Kirigakure ninja are cowards. - Wed Oct 21 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryuga, Shoji(RhapsodyManiac) says: I'm not sure he'd like to fight me. - Wed Oct 21 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Getting sick of the way the boy was talking, he would take a step forward and suddenly let himself spring into action, letting all of the chakra he had built up suddenly flood forward, this chakra, rushing towards his mouth would suddenly spew out in the form of a brown sticky liquid, and being that he had time to prep it, the liquid would be of a large quanitity, covering all of the ground infront of him, and underneath of Shoji, likely sticking him to the ground. 

Once he had done this he would simply say, "Please stop talking as if you'd attack me. It makes me want to hurt you, and the Mizu doesn't usually approve of attacking others without reason." having said such, he would already be prepared if Shoji somehow escaped this large pool of ooze.* - Wed Oct 21 00:45:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he thought the boy had been stuck in the substance he had spit out, he would get a small shock, when the boy would suddenly launch his tongue out of his mouth as a weapon. Though, being that he was ready for some sort of counter attack, he would quickly enact his own defence.

Watching as the tongue came out of the boy's mouth, he would quickly raise his hands forward, sending a quick burst of chakra into them, and thus, releasing a wave of air from both of his hands, sending himself back, hopefully fast enough, and far enough back to avoide the boy's attack.

"I'm not into tongue, sorry." having said such, he would continue to be on alert if he had avoided the attack.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit he would look to the man, "Who knows, I haven't really kept tabs on all that, but I guess so." having said such he would then go on to say, "You may see me as the annoying type, yet I was simply seeing what you had stored away. If I wanted to actually fight you, I would have." shrugging a bit he would then say, "You are quite interesting though."* - Wed Oct 21 01:08:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: I suggest, if you want to live, you better be able to be as commited as you say. - Wed Oct 21 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Mia, a sinister look forming on his face behind the mask, being that he no longer had to keep the blank slate with it on he would pat her on the head, "Good doggie~ If you hold out you might get a treat~"* - Wed Oct 21 03:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Baylea(JustCallMeGnar) says: MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE. - Wed Oct 21 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Pulling out a bit of rope, feeling like his plan was starting to die out, as he himself was getting a bit excited, he would speak to Mia, "Hey now, any more than that, and you're dead~" having said such he would slip the rope into a circle around Mia's neck, much like a makeshift collar before then taking a firm grip on the end of the rope, ready to tug back, or even strangle her enough to kill her if she made a move.* - Wed Oct 21 03:39:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Having whispered something to Mia, he would feel the urge to mess with her a bit, tightening the rope he had put around her neck some minutes before, "I can't tell is she'll be able to take this or not~"* - Wed Oct 21 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Perhaps this is far enough? - Wed Oct 21 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Finding himself a bit excited, he would do his best to keep it hidden, instead turning his Attention to Mia, "Well, you're doing better than I thought~ Perhaps I should reward you?" asking her such he would slowly remove the mask and slide it into his cloak, he himself didn't know exactly how much control he had. Thus, he would look to Mia, seeing if she was even still in a position where she even heard him. If she couldn't he would simply take the rope that he had put around her neck at an earlier time, and pull it, hard. Likely hard enough to tear her eyes away from the two in front of them, and cause her to be looking at him. * - Wed Oct 21 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Simply sits in the corner, cause what the hell else is he going to do at this point?* - Wed Oct 21 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Simply lets a shrug take over his body. "Mind opening the door? I need to go do some things." having said such, he would stand to his feet, he usual monotone voice taking back over.* - Wed Oct 21 04:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he was in the house that his new group of 'friends' had brought him to. Feeling a bit weird as he had never been out of the village much, he would look around, finding it a nit lacking. Though, thinking that he could perhaps get this thought off of his mind, he would walk to the door, going out. Looking around, he would simply decide that it was once again time to start training, or else he would never get strong enough to meet his own goals in life. Thinking this, he would find a suitable tree, and simply stand in front of it, ready to start.

Once he had gotten himself comfortable, he would go on to pull out a strand of wire, looking it over a bit. Then, looking to the three, he would start to focus his chakra, doing his best to send it into the wire. Once he had, he would quickly toss it, trying to get it to wrap around and tighten onto it. Though, as the wire hit, it would simply fall to the ground as if it was completely useless. Aggravated by this, he would simply walk over, retrieve his wire, and start to walk away, obviously done with this for now.* - Wed Oct 21 14:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*ANBU Agent(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more he would once more walk back outside, looking around. Shaking his head, he would rub the back of his neck, only now looking around the area, taking in his surroundings. Shaking his head, he would decide to start training once more being that everyone still seemed to be passed out. Having come to this conclusion, he would once more look for a tree he thought would be suitable. Seeing one that he thought would do just fine, he would walk over to it, standing just a few feet away.

Once more pulling out a bit of wire, he decided that he should perhaps focus more on that. Thus, he would close his eyes, once more taking in a few deep breathes. Building his chakra inside of his body, he would attempt to move it, and make the wire an extension of his own body. Finding this to be a harder process than he thought, he would open his eyes, aggravated. "This is a pain." Having said such, he would close his eyes once more. Moving back to his chakra flow, he would attempt to mentally grab on, ready to try once more.

This time around, he would slowly start his circulation much like he normally would. Though, with each circulation through his body, he would attempt to force it into the wire, trying to incorporate it into his flow. Finding this to be harder than he thought, he would struggle with it for sometime before he suddenly felt a small give in the process. Feeling his chakra slowly start to ooze into the wire, he would keep up the task, doing such until he felt the wire was an extension of his own chakra.

Feeling content with this, he would then open his eyes, still holding the wire, he would tuck it into his sleeve, keeping the chakra flow to it going, being that he had to do the seals before it would even be useful, thus, he would start up on the seals needed for the technique. Though, finding it harder than imagined, he would mess up a few times, forcing him to restart the seals. After a bit of time and practice, he would finally find himself getting them right, and as such, he would be ready to actually initiate the end game of the technique.

Quickly throwing his hands up, he would launch the wire towards the tree in front of him. The wire, flying a bit strange at first, would find its way to the tree, and wrap somewhat loosely around it before suddenly tying itself completely around. Content with this outcome, he would walk up to the tree and look it over, trying to see how tight the hold would be simply on impact. Seeing that it was basically just enough to hold it there, but not enough to dig into the tree, he would simply nod, he had no issue with it.

Deciding to test the waters even further with the jutsu, he would tap into the chakra that he still had flowing to the wire. Trying to compress the chakra in the wire around the tree, he would in turn be trying to force the wire to tighten. Which, to his joy, it would, and quite well as bark on the tree would begin to splinter. Finding himself content again, he would then expand the chakra, causing the wire to loosen and fall from the tree. Nodding, he would simply cut his chakra to the wire, and pick it up, returning it to where it was hidden in his cloak. "That's enough for today."* - Wed Oct 21 18:28:28 2015
