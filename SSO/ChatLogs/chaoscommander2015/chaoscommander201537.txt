<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) walking back into the area he'd sigh a bit, mumbling, "Always a last resort. . .always the one stopping the fighting." shaking his head as he spoke under his breathe. Moving to sit by the tree again he'd simply look to Eri, ignoring Menma for the moment, "What did I miss while I was gone?" asking such in a tired sort of way he'd turn his attention to Menma.

"Show me that jutsu later. . .I'll have to be practicing my own later anyway and want to see if you have the hang of it."

Now, again sighing he'd turn his attention to the gate area, still on alert being that Ortho had told him that he'd send a guard if a fight broke out.* - Sat Nov 21 12:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Why would he send for Hatsu.... he trusts him so much, it agrivates me. - Sat Nov 21 12:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing lightly he'd glance towards Eri, "Ortho have you learning genjutsu as well aside Menma here?" curious if he was needing to hand out more scrolls. "If so, make Menma toss the scroll I gave him to you." saying such, he'd rub his eyes tiredly, it would be shown that he hadn't slept peacfully in some time, and had been traveling more than his body could handle.* - Sat Nov 21 13:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just the Death Mirage technique. - Sat Nov 21 13:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I simply told the guy I'd sit and talk a bit. - Sat Nov 21 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Regardless, wanna go grab a meal and walk around Konoha at the least, if you're afraid of being punished? - Sat Nov 21 14:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: You'd leave me here? - Sat Nov 21 14:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Saying such, he'd throw his guitar over his back, his body moving even slower than usual. He wouldn't admit it, be he'd been moving non-stop and it was getting to him. "You guys coming?"

Walking towards the gate, he'd move to head to the path, and North towards Konoha, not exactly paying attention but so much to if they were following.* - Sat Nov 21 14:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. - Sat Nov 21 14:59:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I wanted a reason to hang out with -you-. . . - Sat Nov 21 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Yea. . . - Sat Nov 21 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Just didn't know if you guys were hungry. - Sat Nov 21 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't eat out much, I cook mostly so you pick the spot. - Sat Nov 21 15:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Either of you smoke? - Sat Nov 21 15:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) shrugging slightly, he'd begin again to walk off, heading further north. "Oh? Home made food? Must be nice. I'll have to convince you to cook for me one day." saying such as being he never exactly stopped anywhere, he was always eatting on the go.

Hearing Eri he'd shake his head lightly, he wasn't going to speak up until they were stopped.* - Sat Nov 21 15:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: *East and then North - Sat Nov 21 15:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I never said I didn't. I just didn't respond. - Sat Nov 21 15:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Niiiiiice.~ - Sat Nov 21 15:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) saying such, he'd pat his jacket a bit.* - Sat Nov 21 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Though, in return. - Sat Nov 21 15:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I expect to at least try your food.~ - Sat Nov 21 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) saying such, he'd chuckle slightly before ordering some simple ramen.* - Sat Nov 21 15:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .....fine. - Sat Nov 21 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Really kid? - Sat Nov 21 15:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Deciding to joke with Eri he'd say, "Or you could let me take you on a date~ I mean, that or I get to try your cooking.~" it was an obvious joke, being that he simply wanted to see her reaction, hoping it was something funny so he could at least feel like he got a bit of payback for her punching him a while back.

"Give him a break, he'll learn to be a bad boy eventually, hanging around you at least." chuckling some, he'd finally let the small smile he had die before putting his guitar to the side, sick of the extra weight. Looking to his wrist, he'd check to make sure they were back to their normal color, mumbling, "Well at least if my back hurts, I now can't complain about my wrist."* - Sat Nov 21 15:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) raising an eyebrow he'd smile faintly, "Well, I was wanting a better reaction, but that works too." laughing a small bit he'd say, "I mean, I could have just asked you in a straight forward mannor." moving to eat a bit of his food, he'd eventually stop again to say, "All jokes aside, we should hang out a bit more. I'm always away, or when I'm back Ortho always sneaks you away somewhere." shrugging a bit he'd look past her to Menma.

"How's the food kid?" asking such, he'd quietly hand over enough money to pay for all three of them, trying to do such before anyone noticed. He didn't need to catch crap for it.* - Sat Nov 21 15:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: This was a better time then I though it'd be. - Sat Nov 21 15:30:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Smiling a small bit, he'd begin to focus on eatting, being that he rarely had a chance to sit for a long period and enjoy it, "So, what has Ortho been teaching you?" asking such, he'd move to grab his guitar, again putting it to his back as he was almost done eatting.* - Sat Nov 21 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Mn? Oh. - Sat Nov 21 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Little bit of everything. - Sat Nov 21 15:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I assume you want a break? - Sat Nov 21 15:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Sometimes, but it's necessary. - Sat Nov 21 15:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Sat Nov 21 15:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Nov 21 15:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd move back to Menma, "Anyway, like I asked, what have you been up to?" asking such, he'd yawn a bit, knowing that he still had more traveling ahead of him today.* - Sat Nov 21 15:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm. . . - Sat Nov 21 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Could be worse. - Sat Nov 21 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: You could land a hit on him and hurt yourself. . . - Sat Nov 21 15:51:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) coughs a bit.* - Sat Nov 21 15:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Hm... - Sat Nov 21 15:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: He's pretty interesting to fight against though. - Sat Nov 21 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: I need to find someone around my level though. - Sat Nov 21 15:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Covince her to fight you~ - Sat Nov 21 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I mean you did look up her skirt, I'm sure she won't hurt you but so bad~. - Sat Nov 21 16:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't really fight just for fun. - Sat Nov 21 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . .anyway. - Sat Nov 21 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Having finished his food, he'd move to stand, "Enough of this. . .what to do now."* - Sat Nov 21 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I think we should go to Kumo.... - Sat Nov 21 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .I'm not taking two people. - Sat Nov 21 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I can cover one at most in battle, and if Ortho gets mad. - Sat Nov 21 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Two, then I'm pushing it a bit. - Sat Nov 21 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...You think I need covered in battle? - Sat Nov 21 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: I'm allowed to go to Kumogakure. - Sat Nov 21 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Kumogakure is safe. - Sat Nov 21 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Not from what I saw yesterday. Though, do as you please. Not like I'm your keeper. - Sat Nov 21 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Saying such, he'd sigh once more, walking out of the place with his hands in his pockets.* - Sat Nov 21 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ...What do you mean from what you saw yesterday? - Sat Nov 21 16:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: Some kid knocked us all out with a Genjutsu. Apparently Ortho faught him. - Sat Nov 21 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: And the Mizu was there. - Sat Nov 21 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: I suggest avoiding talking about being associated with Ortho while you're out. - Sat Nov 21 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: A Genjutsu that knocked multiple people out..? - Sat Nov 21 16:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: People tend to dislike us. - Sat Nov 21 16:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Sat Nov 21 16:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, feeling it was a bad idea to return next to her, he'd walk over, hands still in his pockets as he looked at her blankly.* - Sat Nov 21 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down to Eri blankly, he wouldn't let what he took as a threatening tone get to him, simply shaking his head his own dark eyes looking back to hers, "I wasn't telling you what to do. It was a simple suggestion. Regardless, I have yet to be backed up by anyone. Ortho is the closest anyone has come to having my back." keeping his voice level, and devoid of emotion, "If anything, this is -me- looking out for -you-." his eyes now showing a bit of anger, he'd shrug slightly, calming himself.

"Regardless, I need to head back and stock up before I go out again. Enjoy the rest of your meal." having said such, he'd attempt to turn and again make his way outside, though before he hit the exit, he'd reach into his jacket and toss her a bag, it was obvious what it was from the color, "Straight from Sunagakure. Enjoy. Don't bring the kid into the habit unless he really wants to try it."* - Sat Nov 21 16:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I guess I shouldn't mention what I heard the Raikage speaking of. . .I'll keep it to myself.  - Sat Nov 21 16:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Try to hang out with him...and this happens. - Sat Nov 21 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .I'll already be there before you get the chance. - Sat Nov 21 16:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) saying such, he'd now step out the door, heading to the shops, and eventually a place to hitch a ride.* - Sat Nov 21 16:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: .....right. - Sat Nov 21 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Are you alright....Sai-chan? - Sat Nov 21 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah.... - Sat Nov 21 16:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Would step out from behind a few trees, "I really suggest you don't go. I was there for a second before I paid the caravan to come back. Cost me a rather lot too."* - Sat Nov 21 16:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Supaiku, Eri(-Assassin.R-) says: ..... - Sat Nov 21 16:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly he'd look to Eiyu, "That I have, though it seems with a combination of short memory, and the events that took place, I was thrust out of his memory, that, or he didn't care." saying such he'd sigh slightly, moving forward with his guitar, "Once again, for the third time. I'm Hatsujin."* - Sat Nov 21 16:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: This guy needs memory training. - Sat Nov 21 16:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'll simply hold back on the talking, too aggravated. - Sat Nov 21 16:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Watching the hug take place, he'd sigh a small bit, not knowing what to think. Though, moving a bit south, he'd start to strum his guitar, simply watching things.* - Sat Nov 21 16:58:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I take one step forward, two steps back with that girl. . . - Sat Nov 21 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Whatever. - Sat Nov 21 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Just looking out for you. . . - Sat Nov 21 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Gah, less people, more guitar. - Sat Nov 21 17:06:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) trying to ignore the conversation now, he'd zone himself out, and into the sounds coming from his instrument.* - Sat Nov 21 17:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd look up, tearing his attention to Eiyu, it was him who he was having issues with, "Hm?"* - Sat Nov 21 17:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: Let me explain more. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The Mizukage and his men visited Kumogakure without me knowing, I hadn't even realized they sent a bird my way. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: When he arrived. - Sat Nov 21 17:11:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I told him to end his crusade against Ortho, as I had no intention of fighting. - Sat Nov 21 17:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: He laughed in my face, and vanished. - Sat Nov 21 17:12:06 2015
