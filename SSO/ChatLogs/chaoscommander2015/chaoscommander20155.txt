<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Simply shrugs, staying where he was for a bit before deciding to head back in, only mumbling as she left, "Night. . ."* - Fri Oct  2 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he took a look around, he caught sight of two other people in the area, and other than that, it seemed to be a bit empty. Thinking that it was time to practice the jutsu that he learned the day before, he would slowly go through the movement, getting his seal straight before trying to continue in anyway.

Sure that he had done it right, he would build up chakra inside of himself, before  pouring it into the ground through his feet. Once he had done this, the earth beside him would start to Form up, and mold into basically an exact replica of himself, made completely out of mud. The strain from this being more than he expected, the clone wouldn't stay up for long, and thus, would fall back to a heavy mud like structure on the ground beside him.

Taking a deep breath, he figured that he needed to be able to hold it longer than that if he actually wanted to accomplish something, and thus, for the time being he would take a seat on the ground, curious to how long it would take him to get the hand of this jutsu.* - Fri Oct  2 12:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he was bored out of his mind now, he would look around, taking a few steps away, he would decide that he should go ahead and practice the use of his new jutsu once more. In turn he would take a seat in the dirt, being that he aways seemed to start off better if he was relaxed. Nodding to himself, he would start.

Starting with the needed parts, seals, and what not, he would move on to building his chakra up. Using this chakra, he would extend it into the ground, causing the actual jutsu to take affect. The dirt beside him, again would start ti shift and turn before it would start to form up again, once more looking like an exact copy of himself, though made of mud. Nodding to it, he would send it to walk around a bit, making sure that the chakra would hold his body together for the most part.

Being that after only a few steps, the body would start to faulter, he would instantly release the jutsu, aggrivated. Shaking his head he would mumble to himself, "Things are always so hard to start with." saying such he would simply stand back up looking around once more, finding training to be boring at this point, he would look around for someone else to talk to, or train with. Seeing that everyone was busy, he would again sigh, and simply stand there until he decided upon something.* - Fri Oct  2 13:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, as he somewhat zoned back in after being somewhat lost in thought. Taking a moment to look around, he would catch sight of Ko, almost wanting to speak to her, he would let it lay, he figured it would be better if he waited for her to to talk to him, and such, he would turn back to how he was before. Stretching the best he could, he would mumble, "Guess I need to get back to training some."  upon saying such, he would stand to his feet, and ready himself for the task ahead of him.

Taking a few deep breathes, he would work on the jutsu he had recently learned. Doing as he had a good amount of times now, he would work with the hand movement for a moment, making sure he had everything correct. Then, building up earth chakra iside of his body, he would get it to the point that he had multiple times now, just enough to make the jutsu work, but hopefully not enough to be overusing, though, being that he still had a ways to go with the technique, the likelyhood of using too much chakra was up there.

Once he had gotten to a spot where he was content, he would release the chakra into the ground, urging it to his will. In response, the earth beside him would begin to rise up, in a painfully slow way, it would begin to take the shape of himself. Once it was fully shaped up, it would basically be an exact copy of himself, only made from mud. Nodding at this fact, he would simply let the jutsu fade away. Content with what he had done for the time being, he would shrug a bit to himself, and in turn, simply plop back down to sit once more.* - Fri Oct  2 15:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Walks forward, getting a bit sick of this silent act from Ko, "Look, just come with me." Saying such he would wait to see if she would comply or not before deciding to walk off or stay.* - Fri Oct  2 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fine. - Fri Oct  2 20:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Coming to just outside the gates of the village, he would sigh a bit before walking just to the side of the path. Looking around both ways to make sure no one else was around, and also that he was far enough away from the guards at the entrance to where they wouldn't be able to hear, he would sit right there on the side of the path.

Patting the dirt beside him in a gesture for Ko to sit down as well, he would go on to say, "We can spar or what not after we talk a bit." saying such he would make an effort of stretching his arms, as if his joints were bothering, and would wait to see what Ko would do before saying anything else.* - Fri Oct  2 20:53:58 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit he would simply shrug, "Then go ahead, I'd get some sleep out of it, and you'd likely get some frustration out." saying it in a matter-o-fact sort of way he would show her a small smirk.

Throwing his arms to the side and shrugging his shoulders as if to show that he was ready for whatever was to come.* - Fri Oct  2 20:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not kissing anyone's ass. I'm literally giving you an outlet to get your anger out. If doing something like this kills me one day, then I guess I deserve what I get, huh? - Fri Oct  2 20:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow at her, he would let out a little bit of a laugh as she finally walked over. Watching as she sat he would shoot her a bit of a smile, "See, was that so bad?" saying such a bit out of happiness.

Though as he sat, he never thought he would get this far, thinking things through he would say, "I'm not the one here who needs to vent~" saying such playfully, he would let a sigh out, suddenly getting serious, "Look, I'm not sure what is going on with you, but I'd like to help, even if I am just someone to talk to." 

Having said such he would find himself with his eyes locked to looking at her face.* - Fri Oct  2 21:05:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) would be listening closely, nodding after every pause she took, making sure that he took the whole thing seriously. Though, with the last thing she said, his face would twist a bit, and obvious mixture of first shock, and then anger would come over it. Though, containing his thoughts for a few moments, he would take his time when choosing his words.

"That's. . .obviously wrong. Who were they?" knowing full well that if he were ever to come into contact with the person, if they were capable of fighting Ko, he would stand no chance, though, he thought that at least he could tell the person off before anything started. Keeping that thought to himself he would then go on to say afterwards, "How could someone treat you that way. . ."* - Fri Oct  2 21:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her closely, he was unsure about what to do with the long stretch of silence that had taken over the two of them. Though, as she seemed to be reaching for something, he would hold steady.

Watching as she twirled the kunai around her finger, his first thought was that perhaps she was going to take him up on his offer and use it against him. Though, he was even more terrified when she stabbed it into her own leg, trying to speak out he would start, "What are you doing! That's- " though he would quickly stop as smoke came into his field of vision.

Watching as the smoke cleared, and a different, somewhat familiar face was attached to Ko at this point, he would be left confused, having a hard time placing the face, as he had only seen it for a bit of time.

Though, hearing her speak out, his face would pale a bit, before rushing back with color, actually turning his face red. He had done so many things wrong. For starters, he had become attached, and attracted to the rightful Hokage, and then to finish it off, he had forced her to reveal herself.

Already a bit panicy, he would try to control himself, "I didn't kno-w." pausing for a moment he would look down to the ground, thinking things over for a moment, "Does this mean you're leaving?" being that he wouldn't exactly understand why someone would show themselves unless they weren't planning on being around anymore, "I pushed too hard didn't I?" obviously referring to his questions. He was actually worried that she would leave now, and leave him behind in the process.* - Fri Oct  2 21:29:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Does she trust me? Or plan to kill me. . .I mean, I didn't mean to pry as much as I did. . .she revealed herself, and hurt herself in the process. - Fri Oct  2 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) While thinking about her hurting herself, worry would instantly replace the look on his face. Quickly pulling his sash off he would say, "Your leg!" not thinking about her personal space, he would instinctively lean in pulling the kunai out quickly if it was still lodged there, and the he would try and wrap the clothe around it, pulling it tight to try and stop the bleeding, that was about all he knew how to do, "Keep that there."

Though, as he hopefully was allowed to do this, he would also be paying attention to her as she spoke as well. "Well, I'm glad you decided that. . .just be careful, I guess. Unlike myself, you matter to a bunch of people. So you can't afford to be killed." not saying that as if anyone could kill her, he simply meant that she mattered to a lot of people.

Thinking things through again he would go on to speak, "Do you plan to stay here a bit longer?" it was a change of subject, yet, it was more of him hoping than it was a question.* - Fri Oct  2 21:38:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being that she didn't seem to want to hold the clothe there, he would tie it in place, still concerned over her. "That's good. . .and, I won't tell anyone about you. . ." saying such, a look of concern still on his face.

Standing back up to look at her, "Well, if you're staying around to relax, I'm glad. Let me know what I can do. . "* - Fri Oct  2 21:42:36 2015

Leave the stress of all of it behind you. He will eventually burn himself out."* - Fri Oct  2 21:51:08 2015

That being said, he himself would quickly preform a few hands seals as well, at least, quick for him, and being that there wasn't any direct danger, he should have had plenty of time. And thus, while he did this, he would spread he chakra out into the air around him and Ko, ready to activate it if needed, "Now, please wait will you?"* - Fri Oct  2 22:05:39 2015

Sitting against the rock wall looking to the sky for a moment, he would speak out, "Do you mind if I touch you for a moment? I know it sounds strange but I want to show you the real way to relax, I promise I won't do anything strange."

Hoping that she would be comfortable enough like that, and enjoy watching the clouds as much as he did.

If he was allowed to do this, he would gulp a bit of air down, already embarassed. Though, he wanted to do one more thing, but, being that he had done this much already, he would hold himself back from doing what he wanted. "Try and relax now. . ." blushing a bit, he would look away, that is if any of this was allowed.* - Fri Oct  2 23:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Shrugs a bit, "Well, ask away then, of that's what you're worried about." saying such, he would slide down, putting his own body in a position to where he could see the clouds, which if it wasn't obvious at this point, was something that he liked to watch.* - Sat Oct  3 00:29:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, sitting outside of a house, he would look around to make sure that no one was watching him, being that he felt a bit odd when others watched him train. And thus, once he was happy with the fact that no one was around, he would sit. Taking a couple of breathes, he would nod. Doing the usual needed things, being starting with seals, and such, he would go on to building up the chakra needed with the jutsu. Taking his time with this to make sure that it was all right, he would put all of his focus towards it.

Once he was happy with the amount of chakra he had built up, he would slowly release it into the ground, merging with it. Looking over to where the jutsu was to take place, a pile of mud would begin to form upwards, slowly making its way to be about his height. Once it was finally tall enough, it would start to morph and design itself after his own body. Next, the color would be toned to match as well, making the pile of mud basically an exact copy of himself. Nodding at this he would let a smile escape his lips.

Finally after a bit of time, he would let the jutsu drop down back to a giant pile of mud, with its only purpose now to slow people down. Once he had done this he would nod again to affirm that he had gotten a bit better with the jutsu before turning and walking back into the house. Once he was in he would look to Ko, "So, what do you want to do now Ko?" being that he wasn't exactly sure what to do, and figured that perhaps she would be able to think up something interesting.* - Sat Oct  3 03:24:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, he would stand back up, throwing his hands in his pockets, "I'm gonna go grab something to eat." saying such, not exactly being that hungry, he was just getting a tad sick about hearing the same thing over and over, he understood what she was dealing with, but she was starting to sound a bit like a broken record, he wanted at least a small break from it.* - Sat Oct  3 05:15:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighed heavily, resisting the urge to walk after her, he would simply, lay right back down where he was, rubbing his forehead a bit, as if it were hurting him. "Just make sure whoever they are isn't a spy looking to kill you." saying such he would rest his arm over his eyes, hoping to stop the headache he felt coming.* - Sat Oct  3 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) says: Fuck. You. - Sat Oct  3 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Ko as he walked to the plaza, he would resist the urge to go and speak to her. Sure, he had made a bit of a fucked up comment, but she had started it. Shaking this thought off, he would think that she would't speak to him anyway, being the 'Fuck you' he had recieved.* - Sat Oct  3 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Keiko(Shimizu3598) thinks: Literally everyone ever liked me until Erebus decided to "help me out." This is stupid. - Sat Oct  3 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'm not sure why I like her anyway, I'm just probably a temp. anyway. Once she gains a few people's favor, I'll be fogotten about. - Sat Oct  3 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Taking once last long look to Ko, he would simply speak out to her, "Can we talk after I'm done here? Just want to apologize, that was kinda fucked up of me to say." getting that off his chest, he would turn to face the Kazekage. 

Chuckling a bit at this point, he would quickly make a few hand seals. This, being like second nature to him at this point, he would let his chakra flow up towards his mouth, and out, shaping it with his hands. The chakra coming out in the form of a large fireball, aimed right at the kaze.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing that his jutsu had missed, and that he would aiming to throw shuriken at him now, he would quickly preform a few hand seals, not needing to check if they were alright, being that it was as if second nature for him. And while he was doing this, he would be building chakra inside of his body at the same time. Once he had gotten it to the needed point, he would release it to the air around him.

Once he had done these things, which would all happen in a matter of seconds, he would quickly activate the jutsu as the shuriken approached, causing the air around him to spin at incredible speed, making the thrown objects completely useless. Once he had held it up long enough to block the shuriken, he would let the jutsu come to a stop, which would take a few seconds itself, as the wind had to completely stop.* - Sat Oct  3 06:22:17 2015
