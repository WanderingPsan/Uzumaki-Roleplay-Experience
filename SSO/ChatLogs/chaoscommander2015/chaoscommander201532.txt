<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Clearly. - Thu Nov 12 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: I'm done with this. Consider yourself an only child. - Thu Nov 12 00:58:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighs slightly, "I didn't come here to act as a fucking parent." saying such, he'd suddenly throw his arm forward, wrapping threads around Nina. "You're both going to stay here, and talk it out until you become friendly again."* - Thu Nov 12 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: She needs herself a boyfriend.. seriously. - Thu Nov 12 01:01:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: As if I can't evict her from the house -I- built.. - Thu Nov 12 01:01:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: That shit is -my- name. - Thu Nov 12 01:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's funny how you're getting so mad. You just through a fit over what someone else said that don't even concern you. Then, when you call me a idiot while I still think you're in your little bitch-fit, you get even more mad. I never knew you as someone that gets mad over words. - Thu Nov 12 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: If I was to get mad over everything you've said to me, I would've never attempted to make peace with you. - Thu Nov 12 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: You say the most shit and I just let it go. - Thu Nov 12 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Now stop acting like a brat and train. - Thu Nov 12 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, deciding not to have his threads ripped up, he'd simply release her, "You're both acting spoiled."* - Thu Nov 12 01:05:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Damn it Nina. I'm sorry, okay? I'm wrong. You're not a bitch, I'm an asshole and I should've known you're joking. - Thu Nov 12 01:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: The hell does Index even have to do with this..? - Thu Nov 12 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Whatever. Bye Ortho. - Thu Nov 12 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ...... - Thu Nov 12 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright then Nina. - Thu Nov 12 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Do you. - Thu Nov 12 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Nina(Ninasky115) says: Mhm. - Thu Nov 12 01:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Ortho, he'd shake his head, "Alright I guess." though upon saying such, catching the seals that Ortho had done with it, he'd start to attempt to copy them himself, though, finding it hard do ge them down pact, being that it had been some time since he needed to use a jutsu. Taking longer than it should to get the seals right, he'd eventually move on. Thinking about what he had said about chakra, he'd start to build it up in his stomach, letting it liquidfy as he had said. Though, he wouldn't do it near fast enough, or apply near enough chakra. Thus, when he went to release it, it would be just a few drops of water, having obviously not focused well enough.

Shaking his head he'd simply say, "It's been some time." saying such, he'd shrug it all off, deciding to move on and try again. Again moving through the hand seals in an easier manor this time, he'd go onto the part he had issues with before. Again forcing his chakra into his belly, converting it to liquid. Trying his best to then force it up and out of him with a larger amounf of chakra, he would again fail, it coming out in the form of a small amount, much like the basic water gun technique he already knew. Thus, he'd sigh, "Takes more chakra than I thought it would I guess."

Looking to Ortho he'd say, "This is more of a pain than I thought it would be." saying such, he would again run through the hand seals, finding them a bit easier his third run through. Quickly forcing as much chakra as he could into his stomach, converting it to water until he felt like he'd burst, he'd turn in the direction void of people, again openin his mouth, this time the water flooding out and covering a good area. Once it came to an end, he'd wipe the sweat from his head and say, "Well, one done, however many more to go."* - Thu Nov 12 01:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Good, good. - Thu Nov 12 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I guess. - Thu Nov 12 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Ortho, he'd nod, he wanted to learn, but he was just now realizing how much of a pain this day was going to be. Again following along with Ortho's hand seals, he'd do his best to keep up with the pace he had set. Taking his time now, trying to replicate the seals that Ortho had done, he'd of course mess up a few times. Which, causing him to have to restart, aggravated him. Once he had done them correctly, he'd move onto the chakra portion. Doing what he had been told, he'd again start to build up chakra. Though, getting to the point of expelling it, he'd of course, somehow find a way to only let a small bit of water out, and it wouldn't even by syrupy.

Looking to Ortho again he'd say, "Is it always this hard?" saying such, he'd sigh. Again going back through it, he'd start to go through the seals, a small bit more speed added to them this time. Though, once he had managed to get through that, he'd come to the hard part. Again building his chakra up in his belly, he'd try to liquify it, and add as much chakra as he could. Thinking that perhaps he had it down pact, he'd again move to release the technique. Though as he did such, as it came out, it wouldn't exactly be a syrup, more of just water again. Shaking this off he'd say, "Damn it." 

Shaking his head once more, he'd stretch a bit, finding himself tired now. "How many more by the way?" saying such he'd move to roll through the seals once more. Going through them faster than he had before, he'd complete them, and move onto the hard part, again. Building up the chakra inside of him, he'd start to liquify a portion. Though as he did this, he'd simply add more chakra into, thickening it up more than it had been before. Looking forward, he'd open his mouth, pushing the mixture to flood out. Coating the ground, it would come out at the desired effect, "Two down. . ."* - Thu Nov 12 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, looking to him, he'd shake his head a bit, "You say it like it's an easy thing." saying such, he'd of course watch the hand seals again, making sure that he could commit them to memory. Once he had, he'd of course try them himself, and taking a bit of time to get used to them. Though, once he had, he'd of course move on like he normally did. Building up chakra inside of his body, he'd start to think about what Ortho said. Unsure on how to do such, he'd simply try to will it to do so. Though, one of his hearts kicking in, he'd suddenly feel like he could do it. The chakra starting to vibrate, would flow to his hands, though wouldn't cause more than static. 

Shaking his head at this he'd say, "Damn Ortho, how the hell did you learn all of this stuff." saying such, he'd again move to retry it. Starting through the seals, he'd move at a faster pace. "Let's try this again." saying such, he'd again build up the chakra, trying to do as he was told. once he had a decent amount, he'd try and force it to vibrate and surge up as he was told to do. Once he had started this, he'd again tyr to force it up through his body, though, as it went up his body, he'd again move to come out of his hands. Though, only in the form of a small spark. "Damn it Ortho. This shit is hard." saying such, he'd sigh, wiping his head.

One last time, moving to get a bit of water from a container he had in his jacket, he'd drink it down. Once more going through the seals, he'd find them easy to do once again. Though, moving on, "Now the hard part." once he had said this, he'd start to fill up on his chakra again, starting to get tired with his low supplies of it. Though, once he had enough, he'd again start to let it vibrate. Continuing to let it for sometime, it would eventually start to surge. Directing this effect to his hands, he'd direct it at a tree, allowing it to shoot off, hitting it, and likely doing a small amount of damage. "Heh. Three down I guess." saying such, he'd simply shrug some.* - Thu Nov 12 02:04:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Moving from behind Ortho, he'd sigh, he hated being pushed into this, he didn't know much about starting conversation, or talking to people he was interested in. After being the Mizukage for so long, he was used to people coming up to him and talking.

Making his way towards Eri, he'd stand in front of her, waiting to see of she'd take her earbuds out. If she did, he'd finally speak up, "Yo, I'm Jehan. . .haven't seen you around before."  unsure if he was following what Ortho had said, he'd throw his hands into his pockets, keeping an apathetic face, waiting to see if she'd reply.* - Thu Nov 12 03:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I won't lie, i'm a little uncomfortable being here. - Thu Nov 12 03:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: May I ask why? - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Because it just seems odd. - Thu Nov 12 03:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And suddenly someone is taking in our refugees? - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I've been a refuge, I've been in your shoes. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't like how it fits on my feet. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm just wondering why you're taking people in. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: And what you're offering people. - Thu Nov 12 03:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'm a murderer, yes.. but I only take the lives of those who deserve it. - Thu Nov 12 03:54:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: In that intercom announcement, you offered training. - Thu Nov 12 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What kind? - Thu Nov 12 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Fuck ah. . . - Thu Nov 12 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: What now. . . - Thu Nov 12 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: What would Ortho do. . . - Thu Nov 12 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What form are you looking for? - Thu Nov 12 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I need to learn a few more jutsu. - Thu Nov 12 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I've got someone to kill. - Thu Nov 12 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, his hands still in his pockets, he'd simply remove one of them, making a sign as if to show that he wanted her to remove one of her ear buds. Then, standing there longer until she finally did so, he'd say, "Kinda hard to hear what I'm saying while hogging all of the jams to yourself." saying such he'd kneel down a bit, looking to her, "Just wanted to introduce myself, I'm Jehan." * - Thu Nov 12 04:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Hmph. - Thu Nov 12 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. - Thu Nov 12 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Spar him. - Thu Nov 12 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can't. - Thu Nov 12 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I would, but I physically can't. - Thu Nov 12 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: Tough break pal...she ain't interested. - Thu Nov 12 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I came here to learn things rather than spar people. - Thu Nov 12 04:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..How can I know what you're capable of without you sparring someone? - Thu Nov 12 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd stand back to his feet, looking down to her. Shrugging, he'd look to Ortho, "I'm heading back to Kirigakure. Send a message to whoever took over for me and tell them that I'm on my way back." saying such, he'd move to pull a scroll out of his jacket, unsealing his Mizukage clothes, moving to put them back on, "I don't have a reason to be here." 

It would seem he was back to his apathetic ways again.* - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I was poisoned a few hours ago. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: It took a lot to just walk here. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I physically cannot fight that man. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Then rest up. - Thu Nov 12 04:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If you want to know what i'm capable of, I'll tell you. - Thu Nov 12 04:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd simply begin to walk off, trying to find a caravan to pay for that was heading to Kirigakure.* - Thu Nov 12 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm back. - Thu Nov 12 04:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Welcome back. - Thu Nov 12 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: Can I ask what you're doing. . ? - Thu Nov 12 04:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Wow. We come back right as the power vacuum starts and the trouble begins. - Thu Nov 12 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I thought the month away from the village would be enough.. - Thu Nov 12 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd mumble, "Ortho swoops in on a girl I like, and now someone is trying to overthrow me. Great." saying such, he'd take a few steps forward, "Kill me then." upon saying such, he'd simply slowly remove his hat, "And show me who it is who is challenging my lead."

Having said such, he'd simply stand at the ready. "I don't exactly have time to waste arguing, so either kill me, or step down from this."* - Thu Nov 12 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Watching at the hat was thrown, he'd quickly sidestep it, trying to avoid it. Focusing on Liu, he'd watch the boy start to use the fan on his back. Shaking his head slightly, he'd suddenly have threads burst from his clothing, moving to intercept the attack, and hopefully drive the attack off. And being that his threads weren't conductive, the eletricity from the attack would simply go to waste.

The threads, slaming into the Fan, would not only hope to block the attack, but send him back a bit too. If sucessful, he'd say, "You'll have to do better than that. 

If all of this worked out how he wanted too, he'd be left standing, waiting to see what the boy did.* - Thu Nov 12 04:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, watching as the rather large fan had gone by him, he didn't trust it, he had seen people do many things with it before utilizing the Kawarimi technique, so thus, as it went by him, he'd attempt to jump back, moving to attack the fan that he gone by him. 

Quickly aiming to punch straight down to break the fan. Whille at the same time, he'd keep his eyes on Lei, his threads moving to put themselves between the two of them. If it all worked out well, he'd be left to stand up facing Lei again, and the fan would be broken.* - Thu Nov 12 05:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing the boy exclaim something, he'd quickly again make a move backwards and to the side, trying to avoid it, while also using his threads as a shield to block the incoming spray of what seemed to be water.

Though, as he did so, he'd be going about hand seals himself. Once he had hopefully avoided the water, or blocked it, he'd come to a stop and look to the boys, "So, what makes you think you're fit to lead this village?" still being apathetic over it all, being that he no longer cared what happened to himself, only on what happened to the village.* - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing the boy's spew he'd simply respond, "So you were spoiled? And felt like you deserve it? I see." Upon saying such, he'd keep his threads at the ready, Aiming to snake around the boy's arm, neutralizing the eletricity, and hopefuly slowing his punch enough to where he could continue to back step.

If this was sucessful, he'd then go on to continue to force his threads to snake around the boys body, aiming to wrap around his neck and literally choke him to death. Any sign of hesitation was gone. If the boy had been more humble, and realized how much work he had already put into making the village better, perhaps he wouldn't be trying to kill him, but from Jehan's point of view, the boy was simply too spoiled and priviledged. * - Thu Nov 12 05:27:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) his treads being broken there, he'd grunt a bit. Having heard the boy yell, he'd of course know that there was force behind the attack, and being that he didn't want to move, he'd quickly start to do hand seals, while threads from his lower half, from his waist to his feet shot down into the ground and stiffened there to keep him in place.

If he was allowed to stay in place, from his own sheer will, and from the threads, and hopefully having done hand seals, he'd of course retract the thread, and send it forward to wrap around Lei, trying to keep him close.

If everything worked out how he wanted, he'd aim at the boy's head, even grabbing at it if it was in range, he'd release a charge of electricity directly into it, trying to fry it.* - Thu Nov 12 05:45:36 2015
