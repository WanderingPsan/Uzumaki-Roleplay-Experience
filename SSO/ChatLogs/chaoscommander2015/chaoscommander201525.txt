<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) having this be his first time drinking, having been conviced into it by the locals, he'd likely be deathly sick in the morning, but he'd say, "Ohhhhhh No. I told all of my friends that I'd stay and drink with them." gestures to the empty bar, everyone having left already. Realizing this he'd look to the bartender, "I paid for more drinks still." obviously a bit out of it, having only done this to get his mind off of Masa having gone to Kirigakure.* - Sat Oct 31 03:35:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Upon getting there, he'd bury his head into the toliet, renching his gutts out for a good amount of time, until basically all of the alcohol he had consumed was basically out of his system.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, hands still on the toilet, "L-Leave. . .I'll get in." saying such he'd look back down to the toilet, only quietly saying, "S-Sorry." waiting for her to leave, he'd move to get undressed and get in to sit.* - Sat Oct 31 03:46:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Soaking, and getting clean and such, he'd get everything out of his system, soaking for -quite- a long time. Eventually getting out he'd realize all he had in there at the moment was a towel. Wrapping it around himself, clothes in one hand, holding his head in the other, he'd walk out, "I'm going to throw these away." talking about the clothes. 

Then walking over to the dresser he'd say, "Turn away if you would. . .I don't need to add more embarrassment to my fuck ups tonight."* - Sat Oct 31 03:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Pulling out a set of sleep clothes, as he wasn't planning on going back out tonight, he'd get dressed, not checking to see if Masa was looking, as he trusted her, and even of she did, she'd probably have seen it before. Walking back over to Masa he'd simply say, "My bad. . ." not really knowing how else to apologize.* - Sat Oct 31 03:52:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Holding his head still he'd say, "I-I am never doing that again. Why did I listen to them. . .that sucked." saying such he'd look down to Masa, "T-Thanks. . .I'll try not to get upset so easy again." saying such, he'd try to flash a stupid smile, only to cut it short as he say, "S-So. . .turned out of Kiri huh?"* - Sat Oct 31 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down to her, he'd reach out, rubbing her head playfully, "You're fine. I didn't follow your order not to leave. It's my fault. So punish me as you will."* - Sat Oct 31 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her lips on his, he'd look to her face, Eyes wide. Getting pulled onto the bed with her he'd say, "W-What is this about?"* - Sat Oct 31 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her lips back on his, and then her tongue going in, he'd try to break it, "M-Masa. . .Why are you doing this? Because if you're doing it for the wrong reasons. . ." saying such, he'd look away, worried that she was doing this because she felt bad, or that perhaps she'd try to please him and leave or something. He was simply worried what the motives were behind this whole thing.* - Sat Oct 31 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her he'd say, "I love you too Masa, I'm just making sure you're doing this because you actually want to. . ." saying such he'd move his face back, halfing the distance between them.* - Sat Oct 31 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Nodding a bit, he'd know that he'd likely had caused this change in her mood again. Moving back to a standing position, he'd try to tuck her in, attempting to kiss her on her forehead, "Sleep tight then." 

If sucessful with all of this, he'd move over to the sink, feeling he needed some water.* - Sat Oct 31 04:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) having walked into most homes, he'd check this particular one, walking straight into a trap it would appear, getting met with a burst of smoke, he'd attempt to cover his mouth, assuming that it was simply a smoke bomb, and would attempt to push forward, looking around the house, feeling that if it was trapped, she had to be in it somewhere.* - Sun Nov  1 01:34:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: R-Run and get the Kage. - Sun Nov  1 01:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Walking forward, still coughing from the trap that had been sprung, the poison gas now likely disapated, but he still infected he'd catch sight of Arata. In a bit of a rage, he'd move to be across from him, staring him down the best he could, "W-here *Cough Insert here* Is Masa!?!" noting that if he was coming out of the  bathroom alone, and the place had been rigged, this was the only possible place for her, and being that they had a history with Arata, it was in his mind that he had done this.

Pulling out a hatchet that he had tucked into his pants, he'd look to Arata, staring into his eyes, though, if Arata was looking back, all he would see was straight anger.* - Sun Nov  1 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being helpless as the man speed by him, it'd take him a second to realize he had made it by him. Quickly trying to turn as he was too distracted by the other boy in the room, he'd try to line up where the man had gone too. Trying to turn, and catch sight of him, he'd pull his hatchet back a bit. 

If being fast enough, which he would likely not be, he'd try to swing it down into the boy's back, though with the little strength he had, even if he hit the odds of doing anything to him were basically zero. If he could do this, and failed, he'd in turn attempt to grab him from behind in place of the failed attack.* - Sun Nov  1 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Would also be coughing still, the poison bombs he had walked through still getting to him slowly.* - Sun Nov  1 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) having Hanai thrown into him, even of he was holding onto Arata, he'd basically drop his weapon in reflex, trying to catch the boy. Though, getting hit with him most likely, he'd fall back to the ground in pain, as he wasn't exactly the most durable person. During this, he'd again find himself coughing, the poison still affecting him. 

If he was able to move after this exchange, he'd try to get back to his feet, anger still boiling in him as Masa was still no where to be seen, and he assumed the worst. Either she wasn't here, or something terrible had happened to her, which this thought would only fuel his anger as he tried to think of what to do, clearly outclassed by both people here.* - Sun Nov  1 02:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he didn't have a way to get back into this fight, he'd simply leave it to Hanai, figuring that the boy could handle himself, as obviously shown infront of him. Coughing a bit more now from the poison bomb, it obviously starting to make a bigger effect on him, he'd look towards where Arata had originally come from. Knowing that something bad had to be in that room, he'd start to crawl towards it, not really being able to stand.

If he had somehow made it there while the other two were distracted, he'd only be able to look in in horror.* - Sun Nov  1 02:37:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) being that he had heard loud crashed behind him, he'd continue to ignore them, not wanting to know who was winning, only the same thing that had been on his mind to start with, the condition of the girl he loved. Thus, he'd continue to crawl forward, likely getting to the bathroom, only to see his beloved dead on the floor. Though, being hit with grief to start, not having believed that she'd go down so easily, he'd start to cry. The tears starting to form, he'd suddenly get hit with another round of coughing, the poison still spreading, killing him slowly from the inside.

Rage filling his mind now as the thought about what had been done, he'd turn, resting against the door frame of the bathroom, "T-hat bastard. How dare he." though coughing again, he'd look now to see the dead body of the man who had caused all of this. Being that he was dead now, the realization that he couldn't even personally get revenge would hit him. Tears coming to his eyes, he'd see the Mizu come into the building at the door.

Pulling one of his picks for smithing that he usually carried around for work, he'd look to the Mizu at the door , "Fuck you! You're the reason this happened! You didn't punish him enough when he attacked us last time!" pausing moving the pick over where he felt the increase in pumping in his chest, grief stricken, he'd again yell, "I curse this village! I hope it burns to the ground, and all of the water around it isn't enough help to put it out!" saying such, he'd grasp the pick, which looks like sort of a long nail, and attempt to slam it into his own chest, where he knew his heart to be. He was trying to end his suffering before the poison, or heartbreak could do it.* - Sun Nov  1 02:56:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Elon make sure the soldiers ser up a perimeter around the house. - Sun Nov  1 02:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling his hand grabbed, he'd look up to the Mizukage, tears streaming down his face, though, an unmistakable look of hatred behind them. His hands shaking as he continued to try and take his own life he'd simply use his free hand, pointing to Masa's dead body just on the otherside of him in the bathroom. Coughing a bit from the poison he had breathed in between words he'd say, "-Your- shinobi took my Masa. . .and killed here." saying such he'd cut himself off, coughing again, now mumbling, "I couldn't even avenge her myself."

Saying such he'd look up the the Mizu again, his hand still struggling to come down to his heart, "Curse you and your village! It's your fault he was allowed to do this!" saying such, he'd grasp around for anything he could use to speed up his own death, grief having filled his body at the sight of his beloved bodyguard and other half. Though, another thought coming to mind, being that he now blamed the Mizukage for all of this mess, he'd turn the force around with the pick, trying to push his hand back towards her and flip the tool around, "I-If I couldn't take him, I'll just have to take you for letting this happen!" his mix of emotions causing him to do this.* - Sun Nov  1 03:14:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) feeling himself being grabbed, he'd simply look to her, tears still streaming down his face as he was thrown towards the other wall across the room, making his failing attempt to end one of their lifes come to an end, being that when he hit, he'd drop the tool that he had used thousands of times now to work with while forging. Slamming into the wall, he'd fall, and slide down it, falling to his side to look up to her, "U-Ungreatful? T-This is your fault, You and your shitty village." getting that bit out before coughing up a good portion of blood, he'd let his head slump.

Though, saying one last thing he'd get out, "Kirigakure. . .g-gets zero out of five stars from me." adding a last bit of humor before he was suddenly hit by what seemed to be a large chakra hammer. Slamming between this and the wall, he'd  basically be dead from that hit alone, bones breaking, and more blood pouring from his mouth. (Note, his wallet would fall out at thsi time)Though, to make things worse, the pressure would continue on, sending him through the wall and basically smashing his body to a pancake as the wall crushed behind him. Being sent through it, his lifeless body would likely skid to a halt, not even a twitch of life would remain inside of it.

Thus, the man who had lived simply to become the best blacksmith in the Shinobi world, and ironically, for his bodyguard would have his life come to an end, unable to meet his dreams, having cursed Kirigakure all the way to the end for causing him this pain.* - Sun Nov  1 03:40:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Out of curiousity. - Sun Nov  1 15:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Before we do this. - Sun Nov  1 15:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I simply wanted it to be interesting. . . - Sun Nov  1 15:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: As currently I'll only be able to go hand to hand. . . - Sun Nov  1 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) says: You can initiate. - Sun Nov  1 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to the boy in front of him, he'd sigh a small bit, it was a pain fighting while having to hold back who he really was, but he couldn't simply let everyone in the area see his true self, or else he'd probably end up in a bit of trouble. Shaking his head, clearing this thought, he'd make his way forward to Inobu, as fast as he could, though still being slow.

Clearing about half the distance, he'd find himself almost to Inobu, but not quite yet.* - Sun Nov  1 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing the boy rush forward, he'd attempt to dodge the attack, trying to side step it. If sucessful, he'd let another sigh leave his mouth, now aiming his own punch towards the boy's jaw. Though as he did this, he couldn't help but think how easier it would be if he could fight normally, though he refused to do so.* - Sun Nov  1 15:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Hello, Mizukage. - Sun Nov  1 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Being that his own attack was dodged, and that the boy had gone passed him, he would have turned around to see where he had ended up. Paying attention to the string of seals that had been started, he'd attempt to jump back, trying to avoid the jutsu, though, even if he couldn't evade it, he'd likely get hit with it, and simply take it. 

Looking to Inobu he'd say, "I never did give my name, Thaenan." saying such, he'd take a minute to regroup now that the boy decided to use jutsu in the spar.* - Sun Nov  1 16:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: M-Mizukage-Senpai! - Sun Nov  1 16:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Good. - Sun Nov  1 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Who the fuck is that? - Sun Nov  1 16:20:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: So why are these two fighting? - Sun Nov  1 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Probably a spar. - Sun Nov  1 16:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing his name, he'd shrug a bit. Watching as the jutsu came to an end, he'd in turn wait for Ino to get close to him, making himself ready. Completely ignoring the Mizukage's exsistance, he'd be too focused on the spar. 

Seeing the boy's attack, he'd again back step, trying to avoid it. At this point, he was focused on dodging, as he contemplated if he wanted to reveal his hand or not, and if it would get him into trouble. Shaking this off, he'd zone back into the spar, again waiting for Inobu's advance, as it seemed the boy was now simply wanting to aggress.* - Sun Nov  1 16:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: So..U-Uhm..Mizukage-Senpia, how're you? - Sun Nov  1 16:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Again, back stepping to avoid the hit he'd simply say, "Look, neither of us are doing anything. Maybe we should just stop?"* - Sun Nov  1 16:44:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to the boy in front of him, he'd throw his hands into his pockets, "Perhaps after some training we can both try again."* - Sun Nov  1 16:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inobu(Punka) says: Yeah. - Sun Nov  1 16:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Well. . . - Sun Nov  1 16:57:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you guys are done, mind taking Ino with you when you leave?  - Sun Nov  1 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I want to relax here without feeling like someone is staring at me. - Sun Nov  1 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyubishu(Dillion13) says: Alright. - Sun Nov  1 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) saying such, he'd lean back into the tree.* - Sun Nov  1 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: And you? - Sun Nov  1 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: H-Huh? - Sun Nov  1 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Aren't you leaving? - Sun Nov  1 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: Y-Yea! - Sun Nov  1 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Then get moving. - Sun Nov  1 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Now alone in the area, he would make his way up to the two fresh graves he had been told about, apparently some poor souls had done something to get themselves killed. Thus, while no one was around, he'd walk off, grabbing a shovel. Making his way back with it, he'd dig into the fresh dirt of the first one, the male named 'Arata.' Apparently, though not caring for who he was, and only what he had, he'd start the process of reclaiming the body from the soil. Breaking a sweat to do so, but rushing as to make sure no one else would stumble upon this. Eventually getting to whatever Arata had been buried in.

Using the shovel to break open the 'coffin?' he'd look to the body inside of it. Smirking at the body below him, he'd quickly pull a knife, seemingly from the folds of his jacket, and would start to cut around where the boy's heart would be. Having opened him up enough for him to see within the body, he'd quickly look around, making sure that no one was there to see him. Noting that there wasn't anyone that he could see, he'd quickly unzip his own jacket, showing bare skin, and black stitched threads. These threads starting to move and wiggle a bit, would suddenly tear open from the cut in his own chest.

The black threads, moving forward like a snake, would suddenly thrust into the cut he had made into the bodies chest cavity, worming their way around carefully to get to the heart within. Slithering through the body, he'd cut the valves connecting the heart once he had found it. Then, the threads wrapping around it, they'd slowly pull it out, moving it into his own body and integrating it into his own system, adding another heart to himself, and likely helping him live along with the threads he was cursed with. Once he had done this, he'd be nice enough to use the threads to stitch the boy's chest closed, moving out of the hole he had dug.

Looking down to the grave, he'd quickly use the shovel, starting to fill the hole back in as he didn't want anyone to know about what he had done, making sure to go fast about it, but also taking his time as he wanted it to look like it had before he had dug it up. Starting to sweat at he did this, he'd again look around to ensure no one was watching. Nodding once he had done so, he'd quickly finish filling the grave, patting it out to make it seem as if it had been like it was before. Even going as far as to throw some flowers on top of the grave to make it seem like someone actually cared for this poor bastard, he'd move on, done with said grave.

Now, looking to the other one of someone by the name of Minimasa, he'd shrug, not exactly caring about who it was, only that it was fresh enough to have a usable heart. So, thus, he'd do as he had before, starting to dig the grave up while making sure no one was around to see it happen. Making even more haste this time around, feeling a tad more energy with the extra heart he already had, he'd find himself hitting whatever she was buried in as well. Nodding a bit, he'd again use the shovel to break it open. Throwing the shovel up to the side of the hole he had made, he'd kneel down, tearing it up a bit more.

Again looking down to the body, he'd pull the same knife out that he had used before, moving over her breast, not caring about her as he didn't find much attractive, thus, simply slicing right through, into her body, he'd go about cutting through tissue and such until he was sure his threads would be able to get into her body. Quickly using the women's own clothes to clean the blade, he'd tuck it away back into his jacket folds. Looking around one more time before he got on with everything, being that he was suspicious of someone finding him out, he'd move back to the body.

His own chest cavity opening up again as threads started to weasel their way out and around like a snake, they'd slowly go into the body below him, worming their way through all of the organs and fluids, looking for the only thing that he needed right now, her heart. Once he had located it with the threads, he'd do as he had before, quickly separating the valves from the rest of her body, and slowly enclosing the heart in his own threads, pulling it out slowly. Looking it over for flaws, he'd nod, letting the threads bring it into his body, and incorporate it to work with his own system, hopefully helping him get through day to day life, and fights a bit easier.

As before, he'd use his own threads to close the body up, stitching it closed. Jumping out of the hole as before, he'd suddenly grab the shovel, putting all of the dirt that he had gotten out of it, back into it. Then, stamping it down as he had the other grave, he'd again add flowers to it, trying to hide the fact that the dirt had been moved around. Now, once done, he'd look to the third grave, though, not having heard about it, he'd leave it alone, figuring if it was apart from these two, that it was probably older and he wouldn't be able to get any use out of it. Thus, he'd -again- check to see if anyone had seen him, if not, he'd brush himself off, and zip his jacket up, heading back to the square.* - Sun Nov  1 17:49:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Moving to sit across from the Mizu he'd say, "I want to show you something. . .and ask something as well."* - Sun Nov  1 19:28:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, a blank look on his face as he looked to Kirie, "I assume you remember a while back. . .a person who used black threads?" saying this, as it was common knowledge about the person now.* - Sun Nov  1 19:31:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more, he'd look at her quite blankly, "Well, he wasn't the only person in existance who is one of those 'Monsters' as I've heard a few say." saying such, he'd unzip his jacket, and move his hair out of his face. Showing that he was covered in black stitching. If to make it more obvious, he'd raise his hand up in front of his body, looking to his own plam as small black threads started to rise up like snakes, "I also make use of them."

saying such he'd again sigh, "I simply wanted to let you know before I simply sprung it. . .and ask for protection if someone wants to take that man's actions and place them onto me."* - Sun Nov  1 19:35:28 2015
