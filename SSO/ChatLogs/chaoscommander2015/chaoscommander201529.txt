<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Having been observing everything that had been happening, he'd catch sight of Ketsu begin to inhale air. Having been caught in this jutsu once before, he'd be prepared. Quickly kneeling, he'd release his threads, though with his sleeves covering his wrist and hands, it'd be unlikely that anyone would catch sight of him with everything that was going on. The threads, hidden between the robes, and the ground, would slam into the groudn and stiffen, holding him in place. 

He'd take damage from the wind, but he'd be able to stay where he was.* - Fri Nov  6 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit being that he was now finally alone and didn't have to worry about others finding out who he was, he'd remove the hat he was forced to wear at all time, and would set it to the side, letting him rub his face a bit. Stretching some, he'd look to the side of the room, noting a training dummy that he had made sure was there. Looking to it, he figured that this would be a good time to train, being that he couldn't do it in front of anyone else, or they'd figure out who he really was. Nodding at this, he'd then remove his robe, looking to the dummy. Looking to all of the stitching on his body, he'd nod, deciding that he'd train with those for now, and nothing else. Thinking this, he'd pace himself to be in front of the dummy, standing a good distance away.

Looking down to his hands, he'd let the stitching undo itself. Rising up like a snake, he'd look at it fondly, it was his body after all. Watching as it rose by itself, like it was its own beast, he'd chuckle. Looking to the dummy, he'd look up, staring it down. Holding his arm out, he'd let the threads shoot out, moving to wrap around the figure, and tighten, much like wire. Doing this, he'd smirk, trying to tighten it to the point that any human would be begging in pain. Though, loosening it, he'd retrieve the thread back into his body. Chuckling once more, he'd take a few steps back, wanting to practice a few other things before he was forced to go back out and be the leader or Kirigakure. Nodding about this, he'd move back into position.

Letting a rather large amount of thread reveal itself from his arm, it would suddenly entwine itself together more and more, and tighten to a point. Doing this until it was rather thin, yet of a high strength, he'd again look to the dummy, he wanted to see what else he could do. Drawing his arm back, he'd let the thread shoot forward, aiming for where the chest would be. The black, tightened thread would slam into it, and rip right through it, making short work of it. Slowly drawing the thread back into his body, he'd let it cover back up. Nodding, he'd decide to do one last thing before he completely called it quits. Pulling out a kunai, he'd look to himself and smirk. Twirling it around a bit, he'd think of where he wanted to use it, and what he wanted to do with it.

Rolling his sleeve up, he'd take the kunai to it, cutting himself rather deeply. Yet, it didn't matter, he didn't have any blood left in his body, and thus, nothing would come out. Looking to it, he'd put the kunai away, thus, letting stitching come out of his other arm, it would go to the cut open spot. Piercing through his skin, it would start to go in and out, stitching himself back up, and closing the cut. Nodding at this, he'd quietly move to cover himself back up, putting the robe back on, and then the hat. Knowing that he no longer had time to train like he wanted annoyed him, though he couldn't do much about it, even if he wanted to be stronger, he now had to lead a village first. Thus, he'd make his way back out into the public, wishing he could make both happen at once.

Once he had made his was back out, he'd take note of the fact, it would seem everyone was off doing something else. Thus, he'd take this opportunity to test the last idea he had for his threads. Moving off to the small area that actually had trees in Kirigakure, he'd set up a rig to help him. Taking a rather large stump, he'd move his thread to tie around it. Then raising this thread up and over a large enough tree limb to hold it, he'd tie it off and move to do something else. Moving in front of the log, he'd again let his thread run out of his sleeves, moving to wrap around the tree the log was hanging from, and then to the log, pulling it back to make it like a ram when it was released, Much like a -smaller- version of the ewok trap in starwars.

Now that the log was pulled back, and he was standing in front of it, he'd smirk nervously. Releasing the thread, the log would suddenly come swinging towards him, which in his defense, he'd quickly form a small area of weaved thread where the log would hit. Which, this caused him to be sent flying backwards, landing in the dirt, though the thread had taken the brunt of the force, which allowed him to remain undamaged. Picking himself off the ground, he'd retract the threads, leaving his contraption hanging in case he wanted to test it again later. Though for now, he'd brush himself off and head back to look for anyone that he could assist. Simply lost in thought as he walked if anyone would even follow him anymore after Ketsu had pulled his stunt and likely blew his cover, shaking the thought off though, he'd continue to walk. * - Fri Nov  6 22:28:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Taking note of Lera's defense, and her attempt to get get up and get away, he'd in turn not allow it. Too much fighting and been going on in his newly aquired village, and he was getting sick of it. Taking a few quick steps in her direction, he'd try to call out, "Wait, You aren't allowed to leave, no one is until I get an apology for this mess. I've waited for it to end long enough." obviously saying this in attempts to get her to stop, and ignoring the fighting between the other two groups.

Raising his hand upwards, needing to close the rest of the distance between Lera and himself, he'd suddenly release a rather large amount of threads, attempting to wrap around her arms, and body, holding her tight. If sucessful, he'd then draw her back towards him in attempt to get all of this mess to stop, he was sick of it all. In his mind, if it kept up, he'd have to dump more money into fixing everything.* - Fri Nov  6 22:47:53 2015

Now, moving to put his hands back into his pockets, he'd begin to walk off. He had a few things to do, and he didn't want to take thsi pathetic sight in anymore. He had enough of this sort of thing already.

Shrugging as he turned, he'd move past Nigen, whispering as he did, "If you are here for me, I'll be in the mansion, If you are here for something else, as you can see, we are having enough issues, so please leave." once he had done this, he'd continue his walk, heading towards the mansion while he contemplated todays events. If he had stopped Ortho from attacking Lera would it have been different? If he had killed Lera when he had her in his grasp would it have saved Ume's life and take his in replacement being that any anger would be to him.

Shaking this thoughts from his mind, he'd stick firm to his new ideal that connections were pointless.* - Sat Nov  7 03:20:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: I see..I'll be right with you.. - Sat Nov  7 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) watching as a rather unique individual entered into his place of resisdence, he'd sigh, he had dealt with a lot of things today, and here was yet another new person coming into the fray. Looking him over, he'd take note of the large fan, and anything else of particular interest on the boy. Watching as the boy kneeled, he'd simply wave his hand at him, letting him know that there was no need for what he was doing, "Usually I'd be all for formalities, bit today is not one of those days."

Pausing as he said this he'd remove one of the hands from his robe, moving it to rub the back of his own neck. Moving to put his hand back into his pocket he'd simply say, "What can I help you with?" upon saying such, he'd lean forward onto the table, curious.* - Sat Nov  7 03:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow under the cover of his hat, he'd speak out to the boy, "I assume you are a shinobi of this village? Sorry if I don't recognize you. I just took over recently." saying such he'd pause, thinking things over, "Though, if you are a shinobi of my village, I can give you some now if you'd like."* - Sat Nov  7 03:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: .... - Sat Nov  7 03:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Noding a bit, he'd simply pull out three scrolls from one of the slots in the desk. Looking to Liu, he'd sigh once more, saying, "Catch." upon saying such, he'd slowly toss one after the other to Liu, "Sorry if they seem a bit lame. We've been lacking on shinobi, and on real missions, so those are from around the village, most shinobi complain of boredom, but hang tight and do them if you would."

Having said such, he'd nod to the boy, and would look to the man behind him.* - Sat Nov  7 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm.. - Sat Nov  7 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Nigen, he'd nod a bit to him, taking a look over him to catch anything that might stick out, though after doing such, he'd let out on more sigh, "Honestly, I just rebuilt the place from scratch. A lot of money was put in from me personally, and I'm doing my best to make the residents, and Shinobi happy. . .Kirigakure needed a leader. I couldn't let my home village stay broken." rambling a bit with this, he'd shake his head.

"I'm sorry you had to see that sight. They are not related to Kirigakure, it simply seems it was my misfortune to have them all appear here at once, each on their own seperate visit."* - Sat Nov  7 03:49:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Chaos Commander2015) says: And I assume you want to try and continue that deal? - Sat Nov  7 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Be it in Kirigakure's current status to a scroll containing arts. - Sat Nov  7 03:52:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: My end of the deal hasn't been returned.. - Sat Nov  7 03:53:23 2015
