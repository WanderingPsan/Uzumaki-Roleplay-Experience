<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Being that it would seem nothing interesting was going on, he would quickly make his way back to the same water source he had been at before while practicing. Once there, he would again look around, liking to know who was in the area before he started to train. Taking note that no one was there, he would glance to the water. Thinking things over for a moment, he would start to walk towards it before stopping. He figured this time around that he would try the best he could to do without a water source, and to do it all himself. Chuckling about this, he would move back away, ready to get on with it all.

Having moved a good distance away from the water, he would take a seat, figuring that he would need to have complete focus this time around to do what he was trying to accomplish. Thus, he would again make the single hand seal required with the jutsu. Making sure that he had it right, which was quite easy at this point, he would nod to himself and start to build up chakra, doing his best to build up even more water based chakra than he had before, he assumed that he was going to need a lot this time around, which was obviously true without a pre-existing water source.

Having built up a good amount of chakra that he assumed he would end up using all of, he would quickly work on transferring it over to an actual water source. Putting all of his concentration towards this, he would quickly attempt to direct his chakra towards his mouth and out of it. The chakra would end up coming out in the form of a large amount of water, which would seem to be like a living being. Looking to it, he would be happy with himself, though a bit more drained then usual. Again though, after looking at it for a bit longer than he should have, he would realize he was again having the issue of it just being water at the moment, and not yet having taken form.

Rubbing the back of his neck and sighing, he would look to the moving water. "I guess I am practicing for a reason aren't I?" having said such he would again focus his chakra, and his attention onto the form. Refining his chakra in the blob, he would he would force it to begin to stretch itself out and upwards, making it to his own height, he would nod once more. Then, forcing it to expand its width it would end up being about the same as him. Happy with this, he would again speak aloud, "And now I just need to shape you up correctly, and change the color. . .Right?" saying this as a mental checklist, which would accidently be spoken aloud.

Shaking this off he would quickly get back to actually get into this process. Focusing on the clone, he would quickly mentally go over the clone. Shaving the excess water off in his mind to shape the clone after himself, and it would seem to anyone watching, that this would be going on to the actual clone as well, the shape of it starting to copy Amiel's shape. This, going in a slow manor, would bother Amiel more than it should, though, shaking it off, he would quickly mentally finish shaping the clone, which would mirror on the actual clone.

Having finished up the shape of the clone, he would allow himself a bit of a break, wiping his brow a bit before focusing back on it. Once he had done this, he would quickly focus on the color and such, again in his mind. Imagining the opaqueness of the clone to deepen, he would basically make his chakra in the clone do the same. Once he had done this he would then focus on the colors, making them the same as they were on himself, and the clothes he was wearing. Opening his eyes to check on it, he would nod, being that it would seem he had done it all correctly.

Being once again, done, he would quickly walk a few steps back, remembering what had happened the two times before. "Alright, I should be far enough back this time." Having said such, he would quickly cut the chakra to the clone, watching as it fell back to a puddle of water on the ground. Having been far enough away not to get wet from this, he would nod, happy with himself for the time being. Shrugging a bit though, he would again walk back to the square, hoping that perhaps -now- someone was there to greet him, and perhaps be a bit entertaining.* - Tue Oct 13 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Having gone to the square to check and see if anyone had been there, he would simply sigh, of course, no one had been there, and he had made his way back to the water area. Once more checking around to see if anyone was around to see his training, which of course no one would be as the village was still in rubble. Chuckling at this, he would simply once again sit down and start to work on his jutsu. Thinking that perhaps he had come a good ways, and that he wouldn't have to work on it much longer.

Making a single hand seal, he would once more focus on his chakra, building it up quite fast compared to how he was doing before. Quickly sending this chakra to his mouth, he would expell a large amount of water before him, which would quickly form to be the same shape as himself without having to focus on it much. Happy with this he would let a small grin take over his face. "Seems I am better at it." having said such, he would quickly notice that color was still lacking.

Having taken note, he would quickly put his focus, and chakra into fixing said issue. Again focusing on the color, he would watch as the clone infront of him quickly formed to the correct color. Happy with this, he would simply rub his neck, feeling as it he had done everything he could to fix the issues he was having orignally. Tilting his head a bit, he figured he should explore the limitations of the clone for the time being. Nodding that this thought was likely the correct one, he would look to the clone and nod.

The clone, taking this as an order would begin to run as fast as it could away from the original. Though, after a certain distance, as if there was an invisible barrier, the clone would basically explode back into water, unable to hold its form after a certain distance from the being that was providing it with chakra. Nodding at this and taking note, he would try and remember that for the future if he ever actually needed it in a fight. Shrugging a bit, he would quickly walk towards where the clone had been dispelled, counting how many footsteps it had been mentally.

Once he had measured the distance in his own mind on how far away a clone could be before it would be forced to crumble, he would again think aloud, "Well, that's basically all I can do with the clone for the time being I guess." having said such, he would again, for the third, or perhaps fourth time, he couldn't remember, walk back to the square where people would usually gather. Hoping once more that someone would be there for him to train with, or even talk to, he didn't exactly care which, but he assumed that it was likely no one would be there, and he would have to get back to training again after checking.* - Tue Oct 13 21:38:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he was a bit of an apathetic person, he would have only made that offer because it was the Mizu that was being annoyed, and he had already seen her kill one person. So thus, he would quickly dash forward, basically grabbing at Lulu to man-handle her off of the Mizu, which, with the likely difference in strength hopefully making it an easy task, and one that wouldn't cause the Mizu to be more annoyed than she already was.

"Stop bugging out leader." having said such in a monotone voice, he would quickly attempt to toss Lulu back a ways, hoping that she would stay there, and if she wasn't, he would be prepared to make her.* - Tue Oct 13 21:53:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he had gotten the mission from the mizu, he would watch in annoyance as the girl known as Lulu continued to edge her way towards the Kage. Being that usually he was an apathetic person usually, he would almost think about not doing anything, though, it was the mizu that the girl was approaching, and it was obvious that the kage wanted no part with the girl at the moment.

Thinking such, he would quickly reach inside of his cloak. Retrieving a Kunai from a pocket hidden inside of it, he would again quickly dash forward, a blank look on his face as if this was a normal thing for him. Quickly trying to close the distance between himself and Lulu, he would attempt to put himself between the Mizu and Lulu, trying to bring the Kunai forward to be under Lulu's chin, resting inches from her throat, "I was sure the Mizu issued you some missions, and that it was made clear she didn't want you near her." having said such, he would keep himself between the two, though that would only be if everything went as he wanted it.* - Tue Oct 13 22:12:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) being hit in the head very anime style, he would clutch at his head, rubbing it a bit as he retracted the Kunai from Lulu, "Mizukage-sama, To be honest, I only see a few things as allies, you being one." having said such, he would tuck the kunai back away into his cloak, instead simply standing between the two people instead, not needing a weapon really to repel Lulu if needed, "Plus, with the plant reference, I prefer the cold when all plants are dead." saying such with a monotone voice, he would shrug a bit.* - Tue Oct 13 22:25:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he had been given three more missions much like the day before, he would walk away, guessing that he should do them. Once he was outside of the square, he would quickly pull the first one out, glancing over it. Shaking his head a bit, he would tuck the scroll back away. Walking off, somehow finding a shovel, he would appear at the scene where a hole apparently needed to be dug. Once he was there, he would converse with the company who wanted it dug.

Having talked it over about where it needed to be dug, he would nod a bit before going to the spot and begging to dig away, going somewhat slowly, and sweating a bit more than he normally would, as it seemed to be a hot day. Getting a few feet down, he would wipe his brow, thinking about how much farther he needed to dig. Shaking these thoughts away, he would continue. Once he had gotten about six feet down, he would stop, being that he was at the required 

Happy with the job he had done, he would quickly again converse with the leader of the construction site, confirming that he was done. Once he had done this he would quickly make his way back to the square, walking in, he would quickly glance around, having put the shovel he had borrowed back to where he had gotten it. Looking for the Kage, he would spot her, walking up he would nod to her saying, "One down, two to go." saying such, he would hand the scroll back with the signiture of the construction site manager on it.* - Tue Oct 13 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, being that he had turned his first mission in, he would quickly walk back out of the gate, finding himself annoyed with the fact that he was being suckered into more and more missions as 'Rewards' though, it was for his kage, so he thought that he had no choice but to do it, and thus, he would again reach into his cloak, checking the scroll. Looking it over he would again sigh, it would seem that another dog had gotten loose. Hopefully this time, it would be a pocket version.

Thinking this, he would begin to run off, thinking that if he got it down fast, he would perhaps get some praise from the Mizu. Once more going at top speed through the rubble fo the village, he would go around rocks, broken buildings, and over other piles of random mess. Going at this for sometime, he would only stop to wipe his brow once. Taking a sip of water, from a bottle he had on him, he would again begin to run at full speed, looking for this animal. Though, right as he was about to stop, he would catch sight of what seemed to be a large, black colored fur of an animal.

Having stopped once he had seen it, he would quickly approach behind it, not releazing how big it was. Slowly tapping it on the back, he would quickly jump back as the now, obviously large, dog turned, and snapped at him. This, angering him he would say, "I already killed on of you, back off." having said such he would watch the dog closely, ready to attack when need be. Though, he wouldn't have to wait long as the large dog would jump forward at him, causing he to have to dodge to the side.

Standing up to his feet, he would quickly grumble, "Your death." having said such he would quickly go about a ring of seals, while at the same time building up chakra inside of his body. Once he had built up a good amount, and had done the hand seals, he would quickly grab a stack of shuriken, about five to be exact, and he would quickly smack his hands together, causing a shockwave of air, which at the same time would carry the weapons forth. These blades burrying into the animal would basically kill it on impact.

Shaking his head once it was all over, he would make his way to it, not even checking to see if it was dead, he already knew. Retrieving his weapons from the dogs corpse, he would kick the animal to the side, trying to hide it under some rocks, though, only after he retrieved the collar. Once he had done this, he would quickly go back to the square, shaking his head, somewhat sick of killing dogs at this point. Having gotten back, he would look for the Kage, "Two out of three done." pausing he would say, "So you consider this an reward huh." shaking his head, he would drop it there.* - Tue Oct 13 23:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had only a small conversation with the Mizu, he would once again walk out of the square, basically sick doing missions, and just wanting to relax, but he figured at this point, he didn't have a choice. Thus, he would quickly remove the last scroll from his cloak, looking it over. Sighing at it he would say, "Well, more manual labor, sickening." having said such, he would tuck it back away and starting to walk away, hoping that when he finally returned that this time around he would get some bit of praise.

Having walked away, he would go to the nearest area he knew that he would be able to get the tools for the mission. Picking out a few different blades, and axes, he would take the ones that would seem to be the most effective. Once he was content with it, he would sling them over his shouder, and begin to walk over to the nearest usable trees. Looking around, he would take note of a few trees, he would have a bit of trouble trying to decide which ones would be the best to cut down. Once he had finally taken stock of the good ones, he would slowly cut it down to a single tree.

Happy that he had picked the one tree that he needed, he would slowly set the tools that he had gathered to the side, leaving one very large, sharp axe still left in his hands. Looking to the tree, he would stretch just a bit. Starting to swing away at the tree, he would take note that it would probably take a long time to knock the tree down. Going about it for what seemed like multiple hours, it would get to the point to where it was basically just needing one good push to knock down, though, he wasn't in the mood to use chakra and waste a jutsu to knock it down, thus, he would pull the axe back one last time, swinging with all of his strength, hitting the tree, tumbling it down, and ending that portion of the mission.

Once the tree was down, he would drop the axe, and would then grab a rather odd looking saw. Once he had it, he would move to the center of the tree, starting to go to work on cutting it into managable peices. This process, again like the last, would take a good bit of time. Thus, he would take multiple breaks during which he would drink rather large amounts of water, being that he was sweating a large amount of it out of his system. Though, as he came to the last cut he would make, it would seem that he had gone well beyond what he was asked to do, as the wood had been turned into usable lumber. 

This whole process taking much of the day, he would start to load up the lumber he had in a cart that he would have ran off to get. Taking his time stacking it a system that would make it next to impossible for it to fall out unless someone purposely tipped the cart. Once he had done this done, he would grab hold of the grips of the cart, wheeling it back into the village, and hopefully to a place where contruction crews would be able to get to it, to use it to rebuild the village. Shaking these thoughts off, he would continue walking, the small bit of heat getting to him.

Once he had gotten the lumber to the right place, he would slowly, as he was tired, return all of the materials he had borrowed from around the village. Once he had done this, he would take a detour to change into some fresh clothes, being that the current ones he was wearing would be covered in sweat and dirt. Once he had done that, he would make his way, again, back to the square. Seeing the Mizu he would speak out, "Every mission you have given me has been accomplished." saying such in a monotone voice, he was hoping it hid the fact that he wanted to be praised from the Mizu.* - Wed Oct 14 00:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, feeling that he should get started he would say, "I guess I'll start now." having said such, he would quickly walk to the base of the tree. Looking upon it he would sigh a bit, wondering to how he would manage this. Though, he did have advice from his village's leader. Closing his eyes for a second, he would start to focus his chakra, sending it to his feet. Though, not liking the idea of being blasted off of the tree, he would only put a small bit forward that he assumed he would need for this. Though, as he started to step, he would make it about two steps before he would suddenly slide off, and fall to the ground.

Bringing himself back to his feet, he would bursh himself off, thinking aloud, "I see what she meant now." having stated such, he would quickly look back up the tree, knowing now that he needed more chakra, and had a good guess about how much he would need for this. Quickly applying what he assumed to be the right amount, he would quickly take a step onto the tree, one step at a time, quickly walking up it, before coming back done, much like it was a simple task for him at this point. Having done this he would say, "Alright, got that part down." saying such in a mono tone voice.* - Wed Oct 14 00:35:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Having heard from the Mizu that he needed to start to attempt the technique, he would quickly start to focus his chakra again, though, doing the same amount he had on the tree, it would likely not be enough. Thinking that it was enough though, he would step out onto the water, holding up for about two seconds before falling in. Quickly surfacing, as he was actually quite fond of the water he would say, "Don't laugh. . ." having said such, he would quickly pull himself back out of the water. Aggrivated by it, he would think, "Guess I didn't use enough chakra. . ."

Having thought such, he would quickly shake his head to get the water to stop dripping in his eyes before again starting to focus his chakra. This time though, he would just dump a bunch in, thinking that it would be the cure to his issue. Which, in reality, it would only make it more commical to anyone watching. Stepping out onto the water, he would again stay there for about two seconds before suddenly being launched into the air before falling back into the water, causing a splash. Once more pulling himself out of the water he would say, "Again don't laugh." saying such as he started to pull off his wet clothes, leaving only an undershirt and his pants. "I like water and all but this is crazy."

Once more closing his eyes to get his chakra straight, he would go to about the middle level of his last two attempts, applying it to his feet. Looking to the Mizu he would say, "I'm going to get it this time!" saying such, he would confidently step out onto the water. Standing there and regulating his chakra to match the water, he would realize, much to his amazment, being that truthfully, he thought he'd fail again. Walking out to the Mizu he would say, "S-see told you I'd get it." saying such much like a surprised kid, when in reality, he was close to twentyl* - Wed Oct 14 00:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he had made his way out of the square one more time. Needing to make himself more needed in the village, he would again be prepared to start practicing jutsu. Slowly making his way to the mountain, he would as usual look around. He wanted to make sure that no one would be spying on him, and thus, taking note on what was around him, he would take a seat, looking to the water. He decided that the pool in front of him would be a good target for the use of the jutsu in mind. Nodding at this, he would stretch his arms out a bit, making sure that they were good to go, being that they were really the only moving parts of this technique.

Standing back to his feet, having gotten his mind straight, he would close his eyes, starting to get himself focused on what was to come. Working on the hand seals, he would start off trying to go somewhat fast with it. Though, only one the second seal in, he would mess up rather badly. Shaking his head at this, he would go back to the start, deciding to take it slowly this time around. Going through the hand seals, this time obviously at a snails pace, he would make note of what he considered any wrong positioning, or movement, and attempt to fix it. Getting all of what he see wrong, back into the right order, he would move on.

Having gotten the hand seals straight in his opinion, he would go on to working on the chakra for the technique. Building up wind chakra inside of his body, he would get as much of it as he could for this first run, knowing that it always used much more than thought when you started out with a jutsu. Thinking this, he would begin to compress it the best he could, while continuing to pile more on top of it. Which, would seem to take a painfully long time, and be a bit useless in actual combat at the moment, though, when he had finally gotten the amount he would think needed, he would open his eyes and let a smirk take his face.

Quickly forcing the chakra he had built up to go through his body, and out towards his hands, he would attempt to compress it even more as he would suddenly clap his hands together, in turn releasing a huge wave of wind towards the water, not only cause much of it to splash out, and show the bottom, but it would also exhaust Amiel. Once he had done it once, he would let a tired sigh escape his mouth. He knew he had used a lot of chakra in order to perform the technique, but he was upset at exactly how draining it really was. Thinking this, he would continue onward.

Deciding that he would try it once more, he would again go through the process, being a bit more confident with his seals this time around, and cutting a small amount of time that it would take to get his chakra right. Though, this time around, he would dump all the remaining chakra that he could spare into it. He was hoping that perhaps he could make this into a rather large air wave. Thinking this, he would quickly clap his hands together once more, though, with a reverse effect. It would turn out to be the same size, and do the same thing. Thus, it would simply result in a huge waste of chakra. Shaking his head in anger at this, he would sit back onto the ground.

"How stupid can I be, I should've known nothing would have happened differently without more practice." Having said such, he would tiredly wipe the sweat from his brow, readying for one last attempt. Forcing a small amount of chakra forward, he would again do the seals needed, clapping his hands, and in turn, only release a small puff of wind. It would turn out that he didn't have any chakra that his body would let him use without causing damage to himself. Thus, he would fall to the ground right there, having pushed himself a bit too far. Exhausted, he would do his best to stay away at this point. Mainly, anger keeping him awake.

After some time, he would slowly gain his energy back, he would work his way to the waters edge, slowly dipping his mouth to it, drinking a small amount of water. Taking quite some time to regain his chakra, he would eventually make it to a meditating state to quicken the pace of his chakras return. Once it was to an acceptable area, he would, in a painfully slow manor, make his way to his feet, and start to make his way back to the village square, hoping that perhaps someone new would be around to talk to, since the Mizu obviously saw him as a kid. This thought, was obviously aggravating him.* - Wed Oct 14 01:36:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, having made his way out of the village square, he would look around, somewhat tiredly. He knew that he had to continue training, or else he wouldn't be able to help out with protecting his already broken village. Thus, he would sit infront of the water, ready to start up his training once more. Shaking his head, he would be confused about what he could do, but he just assumed continuing to use his techniques would help him work towards making them better naturally. Nodding to himself, he figured he should start about now.

Closing his eyes, he would slowly go over the hand seals in his mind, making sure he remembered all of the ones he needed to do, and in the order he needed to do them. Thinking this over, he would again open his eyes, starting to go through them as fast as he thought he could, though, still making mistakes, he would have to go back and restart, finding himself getting increasingly aggrivated by his failure, "This is a load of shit. . ." having said such, he would put all of his focus on his seals, finallt getting them right.

Having gotten the hand seals out of the way, he would begin to take a few deep breathes in and out, feeling the air going in and out. Enjoying the feel of the wind that would be whipping around, he would take these thoughts in as he began to build up wind chakra inside of his body, each wave of chakra being compressed on top of the other. Continuously compressing this into a smaller and smaller source, he would prepare to release it all, making sure that he wouldn't over use what he had built up.

Having gotten the chakra to where he wanted it, he would quickly force the compressed source of wind chakra inside of his body, up, and towards his hands. Containing it the best he could, he would quickly slam his hands together, aiming it towards the water infront of himself. This blast of wind, causing a huge flux of where the water was pooled, would leave the river bed bare in that particular area for a moment as the wind tore forward, though, after it ended, it would quickly come crashing back down, and be as if it had never happened.

Sighing as he wiped his brow, feeing the strain from the constant training he was doing, he would slowly stand to his feet, the chakra drain finally starting to get to him again. Stretching out, hands over his head, he would give himself a shrug, heading back to the square, he would do his usual check for people to talk to, and any entertainment that he could perhaps get out of them. Though, as per his usual expectations, he figured there wouldn't be anybody, and it was likely he would be right back out here, training away again. Though, if it helped his village, he assumed he'd have to get over it eventually.* - Wed Oct 14 02:30:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Once again walks off, unsure of what he was going to do.* - Wed Oct 14 02:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, being that once -again- that he had found himself completely bored, he would again head out to the river. He planned to get better now, no matter the cost, and forget about socializing for the time being, it seemed like no one else wanted to anyway. Thus, it was pointless for him to continue to try and seek it. Nodding to himself about this, he would look out over the water, thinking over a few ways to make training a bit more entertaining, he would have a mass of less than good ideas before finally coming up with a good one, though, he figured he'd get around to that after a few more dry runs. Thinking this, he would settle into the mind set he'd need to start training once more.

Having fixed his mind into the right set, he would quickly once more hope into the hand seals needed for this jutsu, making sure that he would be able to get them all right when it came to having to rush into it. Noting that he was able to do them somewhat fast now without having to check on them, or getting them wrong, he would find himself being a bit happier than he had gotten at least that far with his hand seals. Shaking his happiness off, being that it was simply a distraction from trying to get better with the technique that he had been recently working on. Instead, he would focus back onto the task at hand, knowing that once he had mastered this technique, he might be able to hold his own in battle.

Moving onto the chakra portion of the jutsu, he would as usual start to build up layers upon layers, compressing it as much as he could. Though, he would realize this time around that he no longer needed ad much chakra he felt to get the same effect that he had when he started working on this jutsu. Smirking at this thought, he would quickly put the pressure on a bit more, seeing how big of a technique he could make at this point at time. Putting in a good amount of chakra, he would constrain the power inside of his own body, still ready to direct it at a worthy target. Which, he would note, he was now aimed at a tree.

Finally getting to the point that he felt he was able to release the chakra with a good mind about the whole thing, he would direct the energy inside of his body, now looking for a way out as fast as it could, to his hands, when he would spread apart before clapping them together, letting the compressed chakra explode outward in the form of a fast, strong wave of wind. Hitting the tree, it would start to crack and bend, letting few branches fall, and the bark starting to crack away. Though, once it was all said and done, the tree would be still standing, and he would be left somewhat tired.

Even though he was tired, he would keep in mind that he had one good idea about this jutsu, and felt that he needed to try it out at least once. So thus, he would quickly start his seals up once more. While, at the same time going through the chakra compressing process he had gotten a bit used to at this point. Though, before he would go to actually initiate the jutsu this time, he would quickly grab out a stack of five shuriken out, holding it within his hands as he went to slam his hands together. When he did this, the usual wave of wind would be release at the wall, though, alone with the shuriken, making the technique quite deadly now, as it contained bullets basically. 

Watching as the shuriken slammed deep into the tree, he knew he wouldn't be able to retrieve them, and thus, he would leave them buried into the tree, and would simply dust himself off, figuring that this would be all the training he would need for the day, and he also felt that he had made leaps and bounds in the use of the jutsu. Checking around him one last time to make sure no one was watching, he would do the obvious thing that he would normally do at the time. That would be, walk back to the square, still hoping for some form of entertainment from everyone there. He was hopeless with this, but who knew? He might get lucky.* - Wed Oct 14 03:03:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he made his way from what seemed to be a lesbian make out scene, he would again find himself at the water. Shrugging a bit as he made it there, he would look around, checking the area to see if anyone would be around to see him training. Taking note that no a single soul was around, he would quickly move to the waters edge. Ready to start training, he would quickly stretch his arms out over his head, making sure they were ready to go.

Starting to go through the hand seals that he had now come to get used to, he would basically go through them flawlessly. While at the same time, he would start to build up chakra inside of his body. Compressing it down upon itself many times over, he would nod once he had gotten enough. Quickly forcing it through his body, and towards his hands, he would quickly direct his aim at a nearby tree, clapping his hands together as a large shockwave of air would slam into the tree, forcing it to bend quite a bit before snapping back into place.

Once he had done this, he would quickly sigh, feeling that he now needed to work in aiming objects within the jutsu, so thus, he would quickly go through the process once again, though this time around as he was getting his chakra straight he would quickly grab a stack of shuriken out of his cloak. Quickly clapping his hands together, the large wave of air would quickly extend itself from the wave, shooting the weapons along with it. This, again causing the tree to bend, and for the weapons to embed itself into it, he would feel a bit over training.

Quickly moving to the tree, he would begin to retrieve the weapons from the tree, quickly making sure they were still usable before tucking them back into his clock. Shaking his head he would brush himself off and start to walk off, wondering if now, he could talk to someone without interupting their weird lesbian scene. Thinking this he would quickly shake his head. making his way to the last place he had seen people.* - Wed Oct 14 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as it would seem he had gotten the hang of two different jutsu, and that the was getting over training a bit, he would decide that he may as well go ahead and start working on his other two techniques. Nodding to himself, he would start to walk to the river. Looking at it, he would take the time to think over which techniques that he wanted to practice first. He figured he could probably get the hand of another one down before the day was over. Shaking his head, coming to a conclusion on which one he wanted to start on. Nodding at this, he would go through his usual process of looking around to see if anyone was watching him. Taking note to of it, he would get his mind straight, ready to start.

Closing his eyes, he would take in the thought of the water in front of himself. Trying to take in the feel and the thought of it, he would let his mind wander to how he usually did his water clone. Nodding a bit at the thought of it he would quickly take in a few deep breathes. He knew from having learned the technique when he started it, he was going to need a good amount of focus, and chakra for the technique to be pulled off in the correct manor. Knowing this, he would open his eyes for a moment, again taking in a few breathes before looking down to his hands. It was time he started with the hand seals.

Having gotten this into his head, he would start to go through the seals, perhaps thinking that perhaps he would be able to go through it a bit fast. Though, making it about two seals in, he would mess up terribly. Angered by this, he would again take a few breathes, thinking that he needed to calm down, and then start it all over again. Thus, having done so, he would start to go through the hand seals once more, taking his time as he closely watched himself to make sure that he not only got the actual seals right, but the order that he did them as well. Nodding to himself as he came to complete them, he would move onto the next process in the jutsu.

Starting on the chakra building process of the jutsu this time around, he would start to focus it much like he normally would for his water clone technique, making it so that he had a good amount of water chakra built up inside of his body. Though, as he was thinking back to the first time he had used this jutsu, something would be off about the way he was building up chakra. Confused by this, he would simply shake it off thinking that perhaps it would simply work itself out as he went through with the training. Shrugging a bit, he would come to the limits of the amount of water chakra he would be able to build up in his system.

Quickly starting to force the water chakra out of his system, he would quickly release it all, forcing it towards his mouth, and out in the form of a large amount of water. This water, would cover the large amount of land in front of him, soaking it down, and leaving it laying on the surface. Though, as he started to walk out onto it, he wanted to test to see if it had worked out, being that he had that weird feeling once he had started to build up chakra. Having walked onto it, he would find himself to be very disappointed, it would seem that the water was just that, water. The sticky form that he wanted out of the water, wasn't there.

Frowning a bit at this point, he would find himself aggravated. Shaking his head, he would simply walk off of the substance and back to where he had started, thinking that he would redo it all and get it right this time. Thus, he would again start on the hand seals that he had messed up originally. Taking his time as he went over them, he would find himself still messing up at a few points, only pushing his aggravation up a few more times, and forcing him multiple time to start over until he finally forced himself to calm down and go over the entire process, with calm, steady hands.

Having powered his way through the hand seals that he had to do, he would then get to the next thing that he had messed up on the last time, being his chakra. Again starting to force the chakra inside of his body to build up over and over, though this time, he would focus on making it a thicker layer of chakra, more that just a lot of spread out thinning chakra. Once he had, in his mind, thickened it up, he would then do the same inside of his body. Once he was sure this time around that he had gotten it right, he would laugh a bit, he was sure that he had it this time.

Once he was sure that he had gotten everything correct, he would again force the chakra up through his body, directing it as it came out of his mouth in almost a dark yellow color, coating the ground in front of him. Smirking as he finished, he would know that it would have worked out this time as he quickly grabbed a stick beside him, and put part of it in the goop, trying to pull it back out with no success. Happy with this, he would quickly send chakra to his feet, focusing it to make sure he would be safe as he stepped out onto the goop. Being able to walk across it, he would again let out a small laugh. He had gotten it right this time.

Slowly stepping off of the muck, he would simply leave it there, eventually with rain it would dissipate by itself with time. Brushing his cloak off, he would wipe a bit of sweat off from his head, being that it was a bit hot out. Walking back to the square, he would look around hoping again that perhaps someone worth while would be there to talk to. Though, the obvious underlying thought would still be in his head. Speaking it aloud he would say, "Though odds are, no one worth while will be there, and I'll be right back here training again.* - Wed Oct 14 19:43:08 2015
