<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he looked to Minimasa, his eyes would clearly shown to be sad, as he attempted to fake a smile, "We. . .well, you seemed to draw a lot of attention on our first trip. . ." saying such he'd say, "I know you Guard me. . .but try to be more. . .hesitant?" rubbing his neck he'd mumble, "If we could have avoided yo-, er, someone getting hurt, with just items I don't see the issue."* - Sun Oct 25 06:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Sleep. - Sun Oct 25 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Use the bed. - Sun Oct 25 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: You earned it. - Sun Oct 25 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: The bed is for you. - Sun Oct 25 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Don't make me force you into it. - Sun Oct 25 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: And I'm forfieting it to you - Sun Oct 25 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Nope. - Sun Oct 25 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright, that's safe. - Sun Oct 25 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Simply sighs a bit, "Then I guess no one will be using the bed." saying such, he'd sorely walk over to the wall, dropping his pack of materials, a visable pain being shown as while he was a blacksmith, he wasn't exactly the strongest, and he was sore from carrying the things.* - Sun Oct 25 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Either comfortable or protected. - Sun Oct 25 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Your choice. - Sun Oct 25 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being suddenly swept off his feet, he'd blush a bit, even having been through a lot at his age, like the loss of one of his eyes from a smithing mistake, even this was new to him. Though, he was determind to stick to his guns.

"I guess you'll just have to sleep in the bed with me in your arms, because I refuse to take the bed. You deserve it."* - Sun Oct 25 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being carried around like he was nothing, and suddenly being in her lap, a blanket around him, and his head was rested on her chest, he wouldn't be sexually excited like some might in this situation, instead, he'd feel his heart beat a little faster, almost as something was pulling at it. Blushing he'd say, "You don't have to go this far. . .you're just here for protection right? No reason to do this. . ."* - Sun Oct 25 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) For some odd reason he'd feel as if his heart was in his throat. "J-Just having you in the room is enough. . .I mean. . .who is going to protect you? Like that guys touching you today. . . you put up with it. . .you deserve to sleep in the bed." 

saying such, as for some reason he was feeling all weird, he'd try to skwerm away.* - Sun Oct 25 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having her arms wrapped around him, he blush a bit more, "Wha-" though as he heard her start to speak he'd listen, though the more she spoke, the more it felt like his heart was going to burst. He wasn't sure what it meant, but he felt over joyed with what she said, "W-where did all that come from?" saying such, he'd almost have a hard time breathing, huffing a bit more than usual as his body was reacting to the weird feeling that he was getting from having what he could only desrcibe as a 'strong' feeling towards someone?

"I-I want you to sleep on the bed. . .but no need for me to be in it. . .I'll just lay on the floor beside you. . .Y-you really don't have to go so far. . ." though as he said this he'd look down to the necklace he was wearing (Profile pic.) thinking some things over.* - Sun Oct 25 06:40:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her eyes, he'd swear that his heart was literally going to explode. Pushing this to the side he'd try to sit up, "I told you to have the bed. . .that means blanket and all." saying such, he'd look down at his necklace again, "Hey Minimasa. I want you to have something." taking the necklace off, he'd reach up, and put it around her neck, tying it off.

Though as he did this, his heart, and his feelings would hit the limit as he said, "I don't feel so. . .well. .I think? " saying such, his feelings would get to him as he laid back, the feeling he was having so intense that it actually made him clasp at his own chest.* - Sun Oct 25 06:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as she got under the covers with him, he'd feel even worse. "N-No. . .It's just . .rushing. . ." saying such, he'd blush, his eyes staying to her face, "You don't realize what your words do. . ." saying such he'd try to steady his breathing to calm himself down.* - Sun Oct 25 06:52:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing a bit he'd say, "I don't think you understand. . ."  finding himself reaching up to his eyepatch he'd simply mumble, "You've raised more feelings than I knew I had in the past few hours. . ." saying such, he'd just now notice how close she was, causing his heart to race again, his hand going to rest on it. "Only if you at least consider what I saw. . ." Looking at her face, he'd mumble, "So beautiful. . ."* - Sun Oct 25 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Only letting a small chuckle lose he'd try to put into words what he'd been feeling, "Masa. . .You still don't understand. . .I'm not being a pervert. . .You make my heart race, the things you say. . .you protect me. ." feeling like his heart was in his throat again he'd choke out, "I find myself liking you. . 'alot'." saying such, he'd look to the Necklace he'd given her, "I'm glad you liked it . ."* - Sun Oct 25 07:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Finding himself mentally facepalming, if she would be paying attention, his body would actually shake each time his heart gave a beat, his feelings flooding through his body, giving him a sense of false adenaline, causing it.

"You still don't understand. . .it's not because of that. . .I feel. . .I more than like you." saying such, the stress he was feeling mentally from his feelings would be obvious with his body ad he attempted to hide under the blanket so that she'd not worry. Continuing his deep breathing, he'd try and calm himself down.* - Sun Oct 25 07:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling like if he didn't get this straight now, he'd literally have a heart attack he'd say "No! You simply aren't getting it!" saying such, he'd jump up, leaning forward to attempt and kiss her, quite hard he'd note if he had sucess. Pulling back he'd say, "I find myself feeling I love you. Not you protecting me. Just you." 

Knowing full well what he had done was probably perverted to her, he'd wait for a punishment.* - Sun Oct 25 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being slapped, he'd cringe, being that he wasn't a very durable person, even something like that would physically hurt him. Though, while the physical pain hurt, emotional pain would be a bit, more, causing him to frown, an obvious look on his face told him that he felt he had done something wrong. Thus, he'd simply attempt to stand, and remove himself from the bed.

If sucessful, he'd move to the opposite side of the room where he'd sit, head between his knees, "S-sorry I guess."* - Sun Oct 25 16:29:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being tossed back into the bed, he'd simply accept it at this point. "I wasn't trying to be perverted if that's what you think." though, saying such, he'd go into a mini state of depression, if allowed he'd take the blankets and basically bury himself into them, not wanting to even be seen now.

Though, while he did this, he'd also try to push Minimasa away, "I know you don't want to be this close to me right now. . .Train. . .or something."* - Sun Oct 25 16:36:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having been curled up, he'd feel her move away, and thought that perhaps now he'd be fine to move out of the bed. In truth he was tired to the point he didn't think he'd be able to carry his pack, but after what he had done, he felt it'd be wrong to sleep. 

His mind, having jumpped to multiple conclusions, he'd figured that he was stupid to do any of that to begin with. She may have said all of those things. . .but now he completely understood it was because she was simply his guard. Though, it didn't change how he felt.

Trying to slowly move to get out of the bed, he'd attempt to walk to his pack, and rumage around for a few things.* - Sun Oct 25 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Why're you not sleeping? - Sun Oct 25 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I don't deserve to right now. . .I need to do something. - Sun Oct 25 16:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) saying such he'd tiredly pull out a small hammer and a few assorted pieces of iron. Already having a thought on how to attempt and make it up to Masa. * - Sun Oct 25 16:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Mm.. - Sun Oct 25 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having pulled out the hammer and metal, he'd walk over to the obvious forge that he had set up at some time or another when Minimasa was distracted with training. Walking over, he'd start to crank a fire up. Though, being that he was tired, it would take longer than it usually would, and he was worried that he'd have another accident. Thinking this, he'd reach up to his eyepatch, shaking the thought off that he'd not have something like that happen again. 

Once the fire had gotten going well enough, he'd stick the metal into it, heating it up the best he could. Letting it go until it was redhot. Once he figured it was hot enough, he'd quickly grab it out with a pair of tongs, moving it over to the anvil that he obviously had setup. Hammering it out flat and thin, he'd cause sparks to go everywhere, continuing to do such until the entire thing was thin enough to mold. Grabbing it with a smaller pair of tongs he'd start to bend it and shape it to his will.

Once he had it shapped to his liking, he'd quickly dip it into water, cooling it. Pullling it back out, he'd nod again, happy with his work. Nodding, he'd decide to temper it a bit more so that it wouldn't break. Thus, he'd stick it back into the fire, heating it once more, before -again- pulling it out and dipping it into the water. Once he had done this, he'd reach for a few oil based compounds and a rag, polishing the metal to a shiny, onyx black. 

Looking it over, he'd find himself content. Walking back to put his forge out, and put his tools away, he'd walk back to Masa, the look on his face shown with the fact he was close to passing out. Holding it up to her, it'd be a beautifully done flower, shining an iron black. It was shapped so that it could be put in ones hair, above the ear, or simply be kept as a charm, It could be used in multiple ways. Speaking up, regardless if she took it or not he'd say, "A beautiful iron flower, for another beautiful iron flower." though, he wouldn't say this in any way to advance, he simply was trying to apologize in his own way. 

Once he had done this, he'd give a sad smirk, "Perhaps I should have slept after all. . " finding himself sore from the work he had just done.* - Sun Oct 25 17:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Glad that she had taken it, he'd simply smile, "And miss watching your progress? It's only fair I watch over you every now and again as you watch over me all the time." saying such he'd move to the bed, though, he'd refuse to sleep, he'd simply sit upright, the blanket covering only his lap, though he'd almost nod off a bit.* - Sun Oct 25 17:07:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Hmph. - Sun Oct 25 17:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking at her fondly, he'd simply smile, "You're quite good at that aren't you? Though wouldn't it be better to have an actual person to use it on?" saying such, he'd force himself out of the bed, "Use me." saying such he'd move to stand in front of her, He was too tired to care.* - Sun Oct 25 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Sun Oct 25 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: I don't want to hurt you. - Sun Oct 25 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll be fine. I can't be worse then. . . - Sun Oct 25 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) points to his eye, "The pain I felt when that happened.* - Sun Oct 25 17:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: *Sigh* - Sun Oct 25 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright. - Sun Oct 25 17:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling himself grabbed, he had a bit of an idea what was to come as he had seen it used on the girl back in Suna. Feeling himself being pulled, he'd suddenly find himself being flipped over Minimasa, getting thrown hard into the ground.

Coughing a bit, he'd say, "T-that was good. Want to go again?" hiding the pain it had caused him, he'd stand to his feet in front of her once again.* - Sun Oct 25 17:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking into her eyes, he'd feel a rush to his heart once more. Though, feeling her leg against his crotch, he'd flush completely. He wasn't sure if this was part of the technique or not, but he'd try to ignore it. His face flushed, he'd suddenly get knocked out of the thought when he was again thrown to the ground.

Not even speaking yet as he simply thought, <Was that on purpose? No. . .she wouldn't. . .> though his mind was racing a bit.  He'd stand back to his feet, "Again?" Thinking that if he got thrown around a bit more, he'd forget about the thought.* - Sun Oct 25 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head back he'd say, "Not until you master that technique."* - Sun Oct 25 17:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: *Sigh* - Sun Oct 25 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Why do you care so much? - Sun Oct 25 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Because. . .you're my Guard. And. . .I care about you, and what you do. - Sun Oct 25 17:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Fine. - Sun Oct 25 17:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her leg against him again, he'd unintentally get a bit excited. Though, again he'd get thrown, hard this time, knocking any thought of excite out of him. Once more coughing he'd say, "You really are strong. . ." saying such he'd slowly climb to his feet, rubbing his back, "I think you're getting better everytime you do it though." saying such his mind would run back to where her leg had been. Shifting slightly at the thought he wouldn't say to do it again, in fear of what would happen. Though, he wouldn't stop her if she went to do it once more.* - Sun Oct 25 17:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her leg go between his harder than before, he'd have a small rush of excitement, before realizing what it meant. Getting lifted, and thrown quite hard into the wall he'd slam into it. His mix of being tired, along with the damage he'd recieve from this, he'd collapse to the ground in a heap.

Pain obviously shooting through his body he'd simply mutter, "You really know to to deal both pleasure and pain don't you? Though I guess you probably didn't notice. . ." saying such, he'd basically stay where he had landed, his body basically giving out on him.* - Sun Oct 25 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Not wanting to be carried around by her anymore he'd simply stuggle to get free. "I can keep going. . .It's for your own advancement." saying such, if he was let down, he'd literally force himself to stand with sheer will.

"Though if you would. . .watch your thigh. . .it. . .kinda rubs. . .you know."

saying such, he'd blush heavily, for a blacksmith he'd act a bit shy.* - Sun Oct 25 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Oh. - Sun Oct 25 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Sorry. - Sun Oct 25 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Well, I think that's enough then. - Sun Oct 25 17:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Let's head to konohagakure or kirigakure. - Sun Oct 25 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I mean. . .I didn't mind. . .it's. . I just don't want you to think I'm perverted is all. - Sun Oct 25 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: You're not. - Sun Oct 25 17:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Heh . .We aren't leaving until you get it perfect. - Sun Oct 25 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Then we can go to Konoha. - Sun Oct 25 17:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: It's fine, Vessul. - Sun Oct 25 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Let's go. - Sun Oct 25 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to the man who had magically popped out of the bathroom, he'd be a bit shocked, unsure how they had missed him in the house. Quicly going to his things he'd grab a Kunai, though, not like he could do much with it as he wasn't a fighter, "How'd you get in here!?"* - Sun Oct 25 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: How did Masa miss him in the house!? - Sun Oct 25 17:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to him he'd simply say, "Why the hell would you do that? There isn't even anything to take? And you dog a hole through our floor???" saying such he'd simply throw his weapon back to his pack, he simply shook his head, "It takes money to repair that. . .I'm not even sure we have enough to fix it. . ." saying such he'd fall to the ground, back against the wall shaking his head.

It was obvious he was stressed over money.* - Sun Oct 25 18:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: He broke into our house and stole whatever, and ruined some of our house. - Sun Oct 25 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: The least he can do is give us money. - Sun Oct 25 18:08:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .You should at least think that perhaps some people are stronger, and think things through. . . - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: She is going to get herself killed one day. . . - Sun Oct 25 18:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he was already afraid when he saw the fireball before it was amplified by the wind technique, he'd be helpless to do anything as Masa suddenly jumpped and wrapped herself around him.  Watching as the fireball came in and hit her back, he'd feel his heart go to the roof of his mouth. He was terrified for her now.

Though, hearing her whisper, it'd only make him worry more, his feer, and rage building at the same time, helpless to do anything.* - Sun Oct 25 18:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Still panicing as Ortho moved close he'd simply Speak out, "What do you want from us. . ." basically having his mind race in a million different places at the things going on.* - Sun Oct 25 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he'd have a seal put on him, he'd really not notice it. He was too worried about Minimasa at this point, he simply thought the man was trying to kill them, and changed his mind.* - Sun Oct 25 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Ortho he'd simply say, "Please leave us be. . ."* - Sun Oct 25 18:50:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Going to have to heal her soon.. - Sun Oct 25 18:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he saw him going to her back, He'd again speak out, "Please leave us be. . .I'll work for you for free in the future if need be. . .We've been through too much already." saying such, he'd feel himself basically begging at this point.* - Sun Oct 25 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Ortho, still a bit worried, "I plan to master the art of smithing. . .along with sealing. I plan to be this worlds best blacksmith. . ." saying such he'd look to Masa sadly, "Thank you for not doing any more damage. . .she was simply looking out for me. . " saying such, he'd then go onto say, "If there is anything I can do for you now. . .I gladly will." obviously worried over Masa, and doing what he could to try and convince the man to let them out of the trap so he could make sure she was alright.* - Sun Oct 25 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to him he'd speak once more, "Eh. . .I thank you for that. " noting his position at the moment he'd meekly ask, "Would it be too much to ask you release us? I need to see that she is taken care of. . .and forge her a new blade." though thinking at his lack of money to make such a blade again, he'd frown. Trying to stay in casual conversation as to not upset anyone.* - Sun Oct 25 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being that they were released, he'd simply mutter to Minimasa, "Go lay down. . .rest. I'll talk with. . ." looking to him he'd say, "I don't recall if you gave your name. . .I'm Vessul. . .and this is Minimasa." saying such he'd try to somewhat support Masa towards the bed.

Once he had hopefully gotten her there, he'd turn to speak back to Ortho, waiting to see what he said.* - Sun Oct 25 19:14:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Gosh.. - Sun Oct 25 19:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking at it a bit shocked he'd simply say, "Thank you." staring at it a bit mumbling, "I can make Masa another weapon now. . .maybe even armor. . ." saying such he'd simply look up to reply to his last statement, "Find me in a year or so. . .I'll make sure to be able to make amazing creations."* - Sun Oct 25 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: My back.. - Sun Oct 25 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Hurts.. - Sun Oct 25 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Still.. - Sun Oct 25 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I should get back to Masa. . . - Sun Oct 25 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: Next time...Fire-resistant..Clothing.. - Sun Oct 25 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Now, turning, since he had said what he wanted, he'd make his way back to Masa.* - Sun Oct 25 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: .... - Sun Oct 25 19:32:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: That's not my intention. - Sun Oct 25 19:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Turing back to Ortho he's say, "Anything else we can do for you? I want to take care of Masa. . .and I can't repay you enough for this money. . ." he was trying to hint at wanting to be alone with Masa, though he wasn't going to push it. If Ortho wanted to stay he couldn't exactly do anything to say no.* - Sun Oct 25 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you wouldn't mind. . . - Sun Oct 25 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll find you as soon as I get better with my smithing abilities. - Sun Oct 25 19:38:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I want to be able to repay you somehow. - Sun Oct 25 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Understood, and don't worry about repaying me. Consider it a gift. - Sun Oct 25 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Moving back to Masa, he'd look her over, knowing this was his own fault for being weak, he'd quickly walk away, going to the sink with a towel. Wetting it in cold water and then squeezing the water out, he'd walk back over to Masa, "Brace yourself.. . .this is going to be cold." saying such he'd slowly put the cold rag over her back. 

Sure the wound would heal, but as he years as a blacksmith being burnt and such, he'd know how to make it feel better.* - Sun Oct 25 19:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Basically too worried at this point he'd sit on the side of the bed with her, "Never do that again. Ever." saying such he'd remove the towel, just now realizing he was seeing her bare back.

Reaching out to touch very lightly where the scars were, he'd find himself starting to get upset again. Removing his own shirt, leaving his upper half bare, showing his own countless burn marks and such from all of the 'experiences' he had with smithing so far, he'd place his own shirt around Masa. "I mean it. . .if you were gone. . ." he'd simply trail off.* - Sun Oct 25 19:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9rah - Sun Oct 25 19:52:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down sadly he'd say, "And who is going to protect you?" saying such he'd look up to where the flower was in her hair. Frowning a bit he'd again say, "You need to look out for yourself too." saying such, being that he had been worried sick, he'd again lean forward, kissing her forehead next to the flower, "I was worried. . .I thought. . ." again he'd trail off.* - Sun Oct 25 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, he'd blush heavily, finding himself unable to look away at first, though forcing himself to he'd say, being somewhat firm for once, "Put my shirt on, lay down, and shup." saying such in a serious manor he'd then go on to say, "I'm not letting you do anything until you're better, and I've crafted more items for you to use."* - Sun Oct 25 20:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, still finding it hard to look away he'd feel his face redden, "No. Either you lay down and rest, while I make -you- new things, Or I quit." saying such simply he'd quite literally sit down to the ground, huffing like a child.* - Sun Oct 25 20:10:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Stuggling a bit he'd simply whimper, "Can't you let me worry over you. . .at least once?" saying such he'd then go onto say, "Though if I have too, I'll make you have to stay. . "

saying such, -IF- she didn't listen He'd reach forward, grabbing the shirt, being that it was a button up, and pulling it loose, though, he wouldn't look himself, "You can't go out without clothing. "* - Sun Oct 25 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being tossed down on the bed, he'd look to her, being a bit unable to take his eyes away, "D-Does it not bother you?" saying such at the fact she wasn't covered he'd attempt to scoot off the bed.* - Sun Oct 25 20:22:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Glancing away, and rubbing his neck he'd say, "Because I told you. . .How I feel now." looking down he'd say, "And I am a guy. . ."* - Sun Oct 25 20:26:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Speaking out a bit without thinking he'd say, "I really Lo- cutting himself short as it was already awkward enough he'd simply say, "Are you doing this because you don't want to be any closer to me? Or are you really that dense?"* - Sun Oct 25 20:29:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) moving to his forge he'd sit down on a nearby seat, "Counter-Counter-Counter propsal, we date now until you're eighteen, then get married, and act as I said before, and, I'll agree to listen to you from now on unless I feel strongly about it."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: A pat on the head. - Sun Oct 25 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Huh, no fun - Sun Oct 25 20:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her stupidly, he'd shake his head, grabbing the iron he had out. Quickly going over to the forge and starting the flames, he'd fan them up the best he possible could. Once he had done this, he'd let them take hold the best he could, and build up heat. Once he was sure it was hot enough he'd quickly place the iron inside of it. While he waited for the metal to heat up he'd say, "Also, you better not let anyone else touch you. . .or I might have to make a weapon that castrates." 

In the time it took him to say this and give her a serious look, he'd go back to the iron, grabbing it out and moving it to the anvil, hammering it out much to the form of the last sword she had. Once it was about the same shape, he'd like before, drop it into the water. Pulling it back out, he'd look it over some, nodding.

Quickly placing it back within the forge, he'd let it heat up once more, deciding to give it one more round. Pulling it back out, he'd again hammer at it, making the edge the form of a soon to be sharp killing weapon, and the other side a blunt pain giving strip of metal. Then, taking it to a foot driven sharpening wheel, he'd begin to sharpen what he deemed the cutting edge. Only stopping once he had gotten the entire side.

Once he had done this, he'd lay the weapon to the side, getting another peice of metal along with some leather as he began to craft the hilt. Making short work of this, he'd quickly attach the two, producing almost an exact replica of the weapon she had before. 

Letting it cool, he'd walk over handing it to her, "Don't let this one break. Even if it's to protect me. It's a gift I made for -you-. Treat it as such." having said such he'd say, "If I make this armor as well, you at least consider letting us have -a- date, as in one, in the future?" saying such jokeningly, he'd already be on his way back to the forge.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling himself get tapped, he'd feel an immense amount of pain in his shoulder, as it would pop out of socket. Knowing full well it'd start a massive attack from Masa, he'd do his best to suck it up, letting out a gasp, and grunt of pain, though managing to stay on his feet.

Fighting through the pain he'd simply stand there, taking his all just to stay up, without screaming out in pain. Though, it would be obvious just how bad it was as tears would stream down his face. 

Being that he was a smith, he had never faught, and thus, he'd basically not be well off enough to do anything about it. The only thought he had was that perhaps his smithing career was over.* - Sun Oct 25 22:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being pushed to the side, he would see what had taken place. Noting that the man had touched her back, he'd find himself in a bit of a rage. Standing up, ignoring the pain in his arm -- not, he was fucking crying like a bitch -- he'd walk towards Arata, "Get away from her!" going down to look over Masa's back as he knew she'd been injured there once already.* - Sun Oct 25 22:57:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having his shoulder popped back into place, he'd let tears stream out again. Howling in pain, it would still hurt there after. "Leave her be. . ." saying such he'd walk over and pick the sword up she had dropped, not wanting to leave one of his works laying around, "I think what you did to her was enough."* - Sun Oct 25 23:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as her shoulder was dislocated, he'd step forward, his anger boiling at this point. "Please put her back as she was. I'll gladly apoligize for her. We need to get going." simply ready to be away from this -second- trashy village.* - Sun Oct 25 23:11:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had Masa's blade, he'd grab her by the arm with his free hands, helping her up, and making sure that she wouldn't try anything else. . .yet. "Masa. We obviously need to come back later when the Kage is around. For now, let's go somewhere else."* - Sun Oct 25 23:17:45 2015
