<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Come with me. - Sun Nov  1 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) whispers: I've been one for a short while overall. I'm still trying to decide what i'm going to do with my life other than random ass missions that obviously accomplish nothing. - Sun Nov  1 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Being that someone had rudely stepped between then, he'd lean around him, "Would you like to go grab some food and continue our conversation? You're the first one I can deal listening to."* - Sun Nov  1 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Not at the moment. Maybe later though. - Sun Nov  1 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I see. . . - Sun Nov  1 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Moving to the other side of the trashcan, he'd say, "Though, even if it's not over a meal, I want to continue our conversation." shrugging a bit.* - Sun Nov  1 22:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) whispers: *Sigh* I really don't want to do these. . . - Sun Nov  1 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, having been giving a mission to do, he'd walk around, moving to just outside of the square to look over the scroll he had been given. Opening it, he'd sigh, seeing that it was just a stupid mission to pick up trash, thus, he'd roll it back up and move to the local merchants. Buying gloves and trashbags, he'd move to walk around the village, in search of trash that the kage had been bitching about earlier in the day. Shaking his head at the fact he had to.

Once he had started to look for trash he'd pick up what he saw, large amounts of filth outside of the Smithing area, Dead fish piled by the pond, and other large amounts of trash.  Gettung about five bags in, he'd tie them all off, moving them to a pick up area in the village where someone would haul them away to some other place. Nodding at this, he'd take a small break, wiping sweat from his head. Though, after a few moments, he'd force himself back to his feet, needing to finish up.

Having moved back into the village, he'd make short work of all of the trash that was left in the village, picking up five more bags before he finally couldn't find anymore trash to get. Thus, he'd carry them all off, having them tied up and set to be picked up. Removing his gloves, and rubbing his neck he'd say to himself, "These are stupid." having said such, he'd take the scroll back to the Kage, making sure to turn it in and voice his displeasure about the silly missions he was given.* - Sun Nov  1 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) whispers: Which is decent. I'd rather have defense instead of stamina.) - Sun Nov  1 23:42:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) thinks: Too bad I suck at social interaction. - Sun Nov  1 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What are you aspirations? - Sun Nov  1 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Sun Nov  1 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I dunno. . . - Sun Nov  1 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Haven't thought about it. - Sun Nov  1 23:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: What brought you to Kirigakure? - Sun Nov  1 23:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I was born here actually. . . - Sun Nov  1 23:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hidden away for a bit. - Mon Nov  2 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Why's that? - Mon Nov  2 00:00:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh. . . - Mon Nov  2 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm not sure if I'm comfortable sharing that yet. - Mon Nov  2 00:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Why do you ask? - Mon Nov  2 00:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) sighing slightly as he walked back out of the square, looking over the new scroll he had been given. Raising an eyebrow at it, he'd find himself a tad bit aggravated by the stupid missions he had been given, but he knew if he questioned it, he'd be in trouble. Thus, he'd simply close the scroll, and walk towards the Kage house, grabbing a nearby broom before he made it there. Getting there, he'd look around and simply say, "I feel like a damn maid." saying such, he'd simply rub his neck pissed at the situation.

Walking towards the steps, he'd note that they were covered in leaves and dirt, shaking his head about how the kage was always on them about being clean, yet couldn't keep her own doorstep that way aggravated him. Moving to it, he'd slowly start to sweep it off, getting the first few steps with ease. Moving up, he'd slowly take his time as there weren't that many steps anyway, thus he'd quickly finish it up, making sure that everything he had sweeped off, was out of sight.

Once he was done with that, he'd set the broom to the side, wiping himself off again and making his way back to the square, though stopping to get water, he'd be sure to give the kage a piece of his mind this time. Thinking thus, he'd walk into the square, determind to turn her scroll in and demand better missions, though in all likelyness, he'd probably just turn it in, grumble a bit, and then walk the hell outta there.* - Mon Nov  2 00:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I can respect that, but it does kill my curiosity.  - Mon Nov  2 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Mon Nov  2 00:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Mhm. - Mon Nov  2 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'd tell you, but you can't spread it around. - Mon Nov  2 00:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Fair enough. - Mon Nov  2 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So do you really want to know? - Mon Nov  2 00:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Sure. - Mon Nov  2 00:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) sighing a bit, he'd move his hair away from his face and neck, and unzip his jacket, revealing a under shirt, and his skin, which would seem to be covered in black stitching. As if to reinforce it he'd raise his palm, showing around his wrist where the thread was, and would let it raise up out of his skin, like a snake. "I have a particular trait as you can see. A very destructive man once had this as well, and it's viewed as bad. So I hid." saying such, he'd try to cover all of the stitching up.* - Mon Nov  2 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Interesting. - Mon Nov  2 00:47:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Put simply. - Mon Nov  2 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: If you tell anyone. - Mon Nov  2 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm in deep shit. - Mon Nov  2 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So, if you would, until I personally reveal it, keep it to yourself. - Mon Nov  2 00:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: The Mizukage gave me permission to use it, and that she'd protect me if anyone came, but I've seen what happens here. - Mon Nov  2 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: So I'm not taking the chance. - Mon Nov  2 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Unless I need to. - Mon Nov  2 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Makes sense. I wish I had a special ability like that. - Mon Nov  2 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Mon Nov  2 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: I get to be the pinnacle of average. - Mon Nov  2 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Of course i'd assume it's not as nice as it seems from the outside. - Mon Nov  2 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's not always what it's cracked up to be. - Mon Nov  2 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Because you have to always hide it. It also makes you a target i'd assume. - Mon Nov  2 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: People view it as evil. - Mon Nov  2 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I need. . .certain things. - Mon Nov  2 00:50:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mana(Mirandawashere) says: Hmm.. - Mon Nov  2 00:52:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more, walking out of the village square, he'd unroll the scroll he had been given. Looking it over he'd once more sigh. He was sick of getting silly missions. Shaking his head, he'd roll the scroll back up and tuck it back away. Looking around he would make his way up to the waterfall, figuring that if he was going to start, it may as well be there. Thus, upon getting there, he'd stretch a small bit, knowing that most animals didn't want to be caught.

Having stretched, he'd start his search. Looking around the area slowly, making sure that he didn't miss anything, he'd make his way around the waterfall. Though, not seeing anything, he'd shrug and start to make his way into the actual village. Once he was there, he would again look around. Though, not seeing anything for a good amount of time, he'd get a bit demotivated, as he was already sick of these stupid missions. Though as he was about to start, he'd catch sight of a small black animal running away.

Seeing this he'd suddenly take off after it, trying to run down the animal. Though, being that he wasn't that fast, he'd be lagging behind the animal rather much. Following it through most of the village, he'd thought he had caught it a few times, though, he'd of course lose his hold on it. Sighing at this, he'd again chase after it, following it down a path he knew would end at a dead end. Sweating heavily by the time he got there, and had the animal corneded.

Now that he had corned the cat, he'd look to it, knowing that if he went in to grab it, it would just run by him once again, so in turn, making sure that no one was around to watch, he'd roll his sleeves up, revealing his arm which was coated in stitching. These stitches, coming undone, would shoot forward and wrap themselves around the animal, pulling him back to him lightly. Grabbing the cat with his free hand, he'd allow the stitching to fix itself, and he'd slide his sleeve back down, hiding it.

Looking to the animal, he'd simply sigh, he wasn't exactly a cat lover, but he needed to get it back to the kage, so holding onto it, he'd slowly make his way back, cat in hand, to give to whoever had lost it. Once he had done so, he'd report to the kage about having finished his mission, and hopefully he wouldn't get any other stupid missions like this one. Though, he knew better than to hope, and would simply take what he'd get in the end.* - Mon Nov  2 17:33:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down to his own hand, he'd say, "Though if you kill someone again, minding making sure it's some one who has something aside from Suiton and Doton?"* - Tue Nov  3 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: Sure. - Tue Nov  3 01:59:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Glancing to Momura he'd sigh, "I guess I'll simply reveal myself anyway." saying such, he'd unzip his jacket and remove the hair from around his neck, now with the open light getting to his face and body, it would be noted he was covered in stitching. And upon a smirk, it would all come alive, moving up and out of his skin like it was living, "Put simply, I guess I'm a monster." saying such in a bit of monotone, blank voice, he'd let the threads retreat back, recovering himself, "I like to trade parts out." * - Tue Nov  3 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: .... - Tue Nov  3 02:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, watching as Momura was pulled away by Hanai he'd simply say, "And this is why I can't make friends."* - Tue Nov  3 02:05:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighs a bit, "Well I don't have anyone here I'd like to talk to, I'm outta here." saying such, he'd attempt to walk away, though staying focused on Momura as he didn't trust the female-looking boy.* - Tue Nov  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: B-But.. - Tue Nov  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: S-Spar...Me.. - Tue Nov  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: No thanks. - Tue Nov  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I have a scroll to read. - Tue Nov  3 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: B-But.. - Tue Nov  3 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Tue Nov  3 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: No. - Tue Nov  3 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: F-Fine.. - Tue Nov  3 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Moving back to the mountain again, he'd pull out the scroll he had been given before, once more going to open it. Scanning over it, he'd take in the key points, though, not being able to connect the points, he'd go back to the top, starting to slowly read down the scroll, taking in everything that it said. Once he was done, he'd roll it up and sigh, he'd have to take notes or something, re-read it a couple of time before he even got the jist of it. Shaking his head at this, he'd simply stand to his feet.* - Tue Nov  3 02:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he didn't want to go back to the square, he'd simply pull the scroll back out, deciding to knock it all out here. Opening it and looking it over, he'd try to memorize it, simply finding the words blending together. Sighing, he'd squint a bit, trying to get his brain to focus in on the important parts, but honestly, it was all too bland for him, and he found it hard to read. Thus, he'd sigh and let it fall to his lap, thinking there had to be an easier way.

Coming up with an idea, he'd rummage around in his coat. Pulling out a highlighter, he'd open the scroll back up, reading through it once more, this time running over what he found important with the tool. Once he had done this, he'd cap it and put it back away, looking over it again to see if he could pick up the more important things and memorize them. Nodding, finding that it was easier. He'd chuckle a bit, setting the scroll down to take a break.* - Tue Nov  3 02:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Picking the scroll back up, he'd again read through it, is eyes darting over the technique. Now simply putting the information together that he had seen, he'd come to the realization of what the technique was for. Nodding at it he'd say, "Basically for putting out fires or such, no real use for it." saying such he'd chuckle, again looking over the page as he felt that he would soon be able to have an ever better understanding, and be able to use it.

Now, going to the seals that the jutsu needed, he'd look them over, making sure that he knew each one, and that he'd know the order they'd have to be in to use the jutsu. Scanning over them multiple time, as he'd needed to get a very good understanding, he'd sigh. Feeling that this was way harder than it should be, he'd simply shake his head, forcing himself to look back down at the seals, making sure that by the time he had come to the end of the line this time, he'd know them.* - Tue Nov  3 02:35:44 2015
