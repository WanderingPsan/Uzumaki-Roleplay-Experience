<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow to the girl beside him, he would simply shrug, if this was a trap than he was going to easily fall for it. Taking them from her he would nod.

"Thanks. . .I guess." pausing for a moment, "I guess in return perhaps I have one for you?" having said such he would rummage around in his cloak, pulling out a rather old scroll to hand over.* - Fri Oct 16 11:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) says: Heh. - Fri Oct 16 11:47:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Fri Oct 16 13:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he entered the square, he would make his way to the middle, next to a few shinobi he had seen, but not really talked to. Though, still not feeling in the talkitive mood, he would silently pull out a scroll from his cloak. Raising an eyebrow as he looked it over, he couldn't decide if he should open it or not being that he had gotten it from some women he had only seen a few times before. Shrugging this fact off, he would glance aroud a bit before basically deciding 'Screw it'.

Opening the scroll, he would slowly begin to glance over it, curious to what it contained. Reading through the pages, he would nod a few times, deciding that it obviously wasn't a trap, and contained something he could use. And thus, he would carefully study it from the beginning, noting what needed to be done, and  which order and such were needed in order to preform the technique it contained. Though, once he had gotten to the end, he would shrug, he figured he had read enough to get the jutsu down.* - Fri Oct 16 13:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) sighing once more as he had awoken from sleeping, he would look around, taking in the sigh of everyone in the square at the time being. Raising an eyebrow as it seemed rather empty. Shaking his head at this, he would again, turn to the scrolls he had hidden inside of his cloak, pulling out a scroll he had been given by some strange women. Glancing it over again, still hesitant after the first one, even though it had been safe. Slowly opening it, he would let a sigh of relief leave his lips as he confirmed it was safe.

Once he was convinced it was safe, he would quickly unroll the entire thing, making note of what was inside. Going over the contents, he would realize that it was another jutsu that he could make use of. Quickly noting what seals were required, and how to apply chakra for it, he would raise an eyebrow. It would seem these scrolls were set up in a way that he could grasp the entire jutsu with just a brisk reading. Happy about this, he would quickly read to the end, sure that he could do the jutsu himself.* - Fri Oct 16 15:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) being that he had just read through one more scroll from the strange women who had given them to him, he would quickly put it away. Excited that he had this chance to learn such a variety of jutsu, he would quickly go to the next one without worry of it being a trap. Opening it, he would take the time to skim over it to start, curious to what sort of jutsu it was. Once he had done this, he would the go back to the top, starting to read at a slower pace, obviously to get a larger and deeper understanding of the entire thing.

Having done this, he would once more take note of the seals required for the technique, and the way chakra was applied, while also doing his best to remember notes written on the side that would likely help him when it came time to actually use the jutsu. Having read through it once, yet feeling like he had missed something, he would quickly run through it once more until he was content that he had gotten all the information from th scroll that he could. Feeling like he could use the technique now, he would simply nod, rolling it back up and tucking it away.* - Fri Oct 16 15:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, finding himself almost a bit tired of reading at this point, he would quickly reach in for the last scroll he knew he had. Pulling it out and tossing it in the air for a moment, he would contemplate weither he wanted to start reading now, or wait a bit. Deciding that it would be best to get it out of the way, he would quickly catch the scroll once last time, and once more simply open it and glance through it to get the general idea of what the technique did, and what it was for. Nodding once he had, he of course would want to go back over it.

Starting once more from the top, he would begin to read away, only looking up every so often to make sure that no one would bother him and distract him from this task. Taking in the seal for the technique, and what he would be forced to do chakra wise if he ever had to use it, he would let a sigh form, it was obvious to him, that this technique would be a pain in the ass if he ever actually had to use it. Thus, he would shake his head, and get back to reading down the scroll, looking for anything that could help him. Once he was content that he'd be able to do the jutsu himself, he'd tuck the scroll away, and look around once more, wondering if perhaps he should go practice everything he had learned.* - Fri Oct 16 15:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he got the one scroll he could actually use out of the three the mizu had handed him, he would quickly open it, glancing through it to see what he could possibly get from just a glance through, curious to what it contained. Though, seeing that it was something rather simple, he would shrug, he thought that this wouldn't take long. Quickly going back to the top of the scroll he would begin to actually take the time to read it, taking in as much information as he could. Taking note of the more important things, he would eventually sigh, taking a break and looking around.

Simply shaking his head at the stupid comments being made at the moment, he would quickly put his eyes back to the page. Taking in what he had to do chakra wise, he would simply rubbed the back of his neck, the whole technique seemed quite easy. Though, being that the Mizu had given it to him, he assumed it would come in some use at one point or another, and thus, he would simply nod, noting that he could most likely do the technique now.

Confident in this, he would look to the Mizu, "Here, I'm done." saying this, he would hand the scroll back to her.* - Fri Oct 16 21:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Saying such, he would stomp off, obviously a bit annoyed with the way the Mizu was acting.* - Fri Oct 16 22:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit he would have headed up to the mountain, ready to start away on his training. Obviously tired of it, he would huff a bit and take a seat. He wanted to get this all over with, and thus, he would take the usual look around to see if anyone was in the area. Noting that no one was around, he would quickly get his mind straight, scooting on the ground to turn to an area that was basically open, and had no access to the water. Happy with this choice, he would be ready to start his training.

Starting with the obvious part of the whole process, the seals. Taking his time as he started to go through them, he would encounter the obvious problem of messing up multiple times. Having to start over time after time, he would find himself aggrivated. Simply shaking his head as he knew he needed to keep his focus up. Starting back over, once more he would go through the seals, finding that when he kept his focus completely on it, that he could manage to go through the process without much issue.

Moving on to the chakra controlling portion of the technique, he would begin to build it up, taking time to insure that it would be correct. The thickness of it just enough for it to be sticky. Once he had gotten it to the consistincy that he wanted it, he would nod a few times, now simply trying to amass it and hold it in as long as he possibly could, only ready to release it when he was absolutely had to. Which, obviously was soon.

Forcing the now built up chakra up and out, he would direct it out of his mouth, forcing the chakra out in an ugly brown color which would coat all of the ground infront of him. This ugly coating would be extremely stickly, and likely hold  anything that happened to step into it. Happy with this outcome, he would nod a few times, deciding to simply leave it there. Thus, he would stand, and begin to walk off, only stopping himself when he realized he should probably continue to train other techniques.* - Fri Oct 16 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he had just worked on one of his jutsu, he would quickly decide to move onto a seperate one and work on something else. Thus, he would quickly move back to the spot where he had been before. Looking around the area he would again make note that no one was around. Happy with this, he would quickly run over what he had learned from the scroll recently that let him learn this technique. Nodding a bit as he remembered all of the small notes that had been written down, he would decide it was time to begin.

Starting with the hand seals that had been contained within the scroll, he would slowly begin to go through them. Of course, messing up multiple times, he would find himself returning to start over, time after time. Only aggrivating himself as he went. Though, reminding himself that he had to stay calm over this whole thing, he would go back to the beginning and start to focus the best he could on what he was doing with his hands. Taking his time to insure that he would get it correctly, he would finally find himself managing to skin by with the seals.

Moving next to the chakra portion of the technique, he would do his best to build up the chakra within his body. Taking his time as he didn't want to mess up in this portion of the jutsu, he would compress it the best he could inside of his body, trying to with hold the most he could in order to make this technique work properly. Finding it a bit hard to keep it contained, he would quickly wipe his brow that would have by now gained a large amount of sweat from being on the mountain in this heat.

Having found the chakra he had built up at this point to be enough for the jutsu, he would do as he had for many of his jutsu at this point, he would quicky force the chakra that he had gained to move through his body and towards his mouth, where he would suddenly let a gust of wind release from it, causing multiple tornadoes to suddenly run wild above the water that was flowing from the top of the mountain. Picking up water, and causing basically water spouts, he would watch it as it tore around.

After sometime he would watch as the jutsu, and as a result, the tornadoes die out infront of him. happy with this, he would finally decide that he would have done enough training for the day, and in turn he would begin to make his way down the mountain. Deciding that he would make his way to the square, he would hope to see someone to talk to, or perhaps even get in a good bit of training. Though, in the back of his mind, he knew that in all reality that it was likely no one would be around to talk to, and he would simply end up being given more missions to work on.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he had watched Elon start the technique. taking note of the seals that he had done, he would nod a bit, "Yea, I guess it should be easy." Watching as the man started the technique, he himself would watch on in interest.  Watching as the stream of water, going somewhat fast, hit the edge of the water. Raising an eyebrow at this, he would simply say, "Looks a bit fun." having said such, he would rub the back of his neck some, "I guess I should try now?" having said such he would step forward.

Starting with the technique, working from the handseals, he would go through them quite easily. Happy with this, he would then go onto building up his chakra. Building it, and compressing it inside of his body, he would do his best at containing it. Once he was sure that he had built up enough, he would quickly force the chakra to rush towards his mouth, and flood out as he directed the stream, aiming it towards the end of the pond. Finding it to be a bit stressful, it would only last for a small bit of time before ending.

"Heh, guess I need to practice." having said such he would again rub the back of his neck and say, "Though, not bad for a first go." having said such, he would look towards Elon for atl least a small bit of approval.* - Sat Oct 17 00:12:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Watching, his eyebrow raising as he watched on curiously. "Nice, seems useful." saying such, he would slowly attempt to copy the hand seals he had just seen. Having a bit of an issue at first, he would sigh, and restart. Taking his time this time around, he would make sure that he got them all right. Nodding a bit, he would come to the conclusion that he now needed to move on to the chaka building element of the justu, already knowing that it might be a bit of a pain.

Sighing, and closing his eyes as he began to focus so that he would be able to get his chakra to the right place, he would begin to store up large amounts, letting it build on top of itself, and compress it more and more. Though, fidning it a bit of a straing, he would decide that it was time to go ahead and use the technique. Quickly, once more forcing the chakra up and out of his mouth, it would quickly make the transition to water nature, much as Elon's did.

The water, coming raging out in a massive wave, it would cover the land, only slightly, before washing back into the pool, and causing it to overflow a bit, "Well, that's. . . nice." having said such, he would rub the back of his neck once more, "Thanks."* - Sat Oct 17 00:35:50 2015

Raising an eyebrow though, for a short second, he would quickly realize that the blade on his neck would be the dull side of the blade. 

A serious mood suddenly overtaking him, he would basically turn, ignoring the blade to look at the Mizu, "As a matter of fact, I did. Though, I did so in concern for the lack of activity from -all- of us. The fact that you let your emotional state effect your outlook on your shinobi, and when they look out for you is a bit disturbing. Though, if you need to release your anger, or perhaps relax, I'll make the offer once more. Let me help, even if it's just a match where you kick me around, or an actual relaxing activity." 

Having said such, he would let a sigh find its way out of his mouth, obviously being aggrivated with the way things were.* - Mon Oct 19 00:17:04 2015
