<br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing as his attack did no damage, he'd shake his head, aggravated. Though, hearing the boy say to die, he'd simply reply, "I Couldn't say it any better myself." though, being cut short as he was suddenly hit, he wouldn't move, and even if he did, Liu would move with him being that he was attached to him by threads.

Tanking any damage done, shrugging off the effects he'd simply keep his hands planted on his head, "Now, what were your words?" saying such, he'd quickly attempt to shift some of his threads, letting them now run out of his arms and hands, again now wrapping around his neck, going into his nose, and into his mouth down his throat, he was literally trying to drown and choke the man with his threads, he was sick of this game, and wanted it to be over with now.* - Thu Nov 12 06:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he the threads that were in the boy's nose and mouth were blown away, he'd simply move his hands, applying pressure on top of his threads, squeezing both with his threads, and his own hands, doing his best to literally squeeze the life out of him, "I shinobi uses anything he has at his dispossal." saying such, he'd keep trying to kill the boy, he was determined to show that he wouldn't stand uprisings.* - Thu Nov 12 06:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, removing one of his hands from the boy's throat, while keeping the threads, and his other hand on it, his now free hand would reach into his coat, going to try and pull something out. He pulled out what seemed to be a bag. . .a -rather large bag- containing about six-million yen. Moving it, putting it to the boy's hands, he'd slowly release the boy, threads and all, hopefully letting him drop to the gound.

"You can have the village for now. But keep in mind who got it back on its feet. I will return eventually. When I do, I expect you to listen to me. Even if I ask for my post back." saying such, it would be obvious the amount of stress his face, even if he was only in his teens, he had seen more than most could handle, and he wasn't going to have some one elses blood on his hands, when they too had the villages best intentions in mind.

"Regardless I -will- return for my post. For now, I'll allow you to look after it for me."* - Thu Nov 12 06:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Having gotten that tad bit of fake niceness out of his system, he'd look back to the boy, his face twisting in rage, "Kidding." as he said such, the threads would suddenly tighten again, his hands going back to the boy's throat, "You think I'd let someone who stood up against me live? After everything I did for this village? You're crazy." saying such, he'd tighten his grip and threads the most he could.

Another strand of threads reaching inside of his jacket, a blade would be drawn, trying to stab into the boy's gut. Obviously in reality Jehan was angered at the fact that someone would have actually stood up againt him.

"You'll die now, and my village will go back to how it used to be. You had no reason to attack me. It was getting rebuild fine as it was."* - Thu Nov 12 06:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Ignoring Heiwa completely, he'd continue to make his way forward, the threads still moving forward. Again moving to wrap then around Liu, he'd attempt to yank the boy back towards him. Not really move to make any real attack past that yet.* - Thu Nov 12 07:06:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Tetsuki, Jehan(Chaos Commander2015) Having not expected Hachirou to make a move against him, he'd simply have his head lobbed off, no way around it as he didn't have any way to counter. It'd roll a good ways away, as his body slowly died off, the threads wiggling around like a dying snake.* - Thu Nov 12 07:22:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) obviously glancing to Ortho as he seemed to lower from the sky, he'd shrug a bit, "Same as everyday." upon saying such, he'd move to sit beside the path, his guitar being rearranged to sit in his lap.* - Fri Nov 13 04:29:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Ortho, he'd simply shake his head a bit, thinking things over, "I think it's a fine assumption being that we are all here, and have been here for a good bit." having said such, he'd think things over, "That is, as long as it doesn't interupt my practice." Smirking, holding up his guitar playfully, he'd look back down, having no reason to exactly care about his response being that he was joking.

Though, as he did this, he'd of course start to strum on it a bit, keeping himself occupied.* - Fri Nov 13 04:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit already off in his own world as he had started to strum his guitar, he wouldn't even feel the girl's gaze on him. 

Starting off slow, simply warming up a bit, going through some basic scales, he'd begin to smile. He seemed to be at his happiest when he played. Moving on, he'd slowly pick it up, knocking out a number he had made up, alternating between slow and low notes, moving up and mixing with high, fast ones.

To the normal person, it would seem like a simply jumble of notes that happen to flow together, but to Hatsujin, as he closed his eyes, able to continue to play being that he had memorized everything about his guitar, he would be taken off to his own little world, literally, as an image of a barren planet suddenly spouting came to mind.* - Fri Nov 13 05:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) a stupid smirk now on his face, he'd quickly bring it down, slowing it, and letting it drift off into silence. Opening his eyes, he'd look down to his instrument, "Hm. . .needs more to it." shaking his head, he'd lean back into the grass, looking to the clouds as his hands rested on the guitar.

Suddenly getting the urge to hear something different, he'd playfully lean up again, starting the well known guitar part from 'jumper' simply wanting something a bit easier, and upbeat. Though, after about twently seconds into it, he'd come to a stop, "Nah. . .something different perhaps."* - Fri Nov 13 05:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly as it seemed that everyone was now asleep, he'd take a look around. The lack of people did bother him slightly, he'd quickly get over it being that he had plenty of time to improve his skills now. Quickly slinging his guitar from his back, he'd pull it over his shoulder, and to the ready position in front of him. Looking it over, he'd nod, feeling comfort in how familiar it was. Though, being that it had been some time since he had actually used a jutsu with it, he'd have to take his time to get back into the hang of it. Moving to be under a tree, and in the shade, he'd decide to start working now, being that no one was around to catch sight of it.

Bring his hands down to the instrument; he'd of course get the feel for it quickly, running his hands over his tool of choice. Nodding once he had done so, he'd sigh, closing his eyes. Working now on running his chakra into it, he'd focus, doing his best to get it flowing the way he wanted it to. Slowly getting his chakra to move the way he wanted it, he'd move it from his finger tips and into the guitar. Quickly reaching out, he'd first work on simply getting his chakra to disperse out with sound. Strumming one of the strings, he'd let his chakra ring out around the area. Not being as good as he wanted it to be, he'd sigh, shaking his head.

Shrugging a bit, being that he couldn't get bored when it came to playing his guitar, he'd of course look around once more, making sure that no one was around to hear what he was doing. Once he had done such, he'd again start his flow of chakra. Sending it to his fingers, he'd once more go to strum his guitar. Doing such, he'd keep his focus on the sound waves coming from his instrument. During which, he'd force his chakra into them, causing the waves being sent out to literally be a part of his jutsu, though, he'd of course not let it effect everyone, as he didn't have the chakra to allow such. He'd focus in on it, making it so that it would only affect certain a certain person that he was aiming for.

Once he had felt that he had used the technique properly, he'd slowly release the chakra that he had flowing into it, and to his guitar. Sighing slightly as he had no way to know if he had used it correctly, as he didn't have a target, he'd think of how he'd test it later, thinking that he might be able to convince Ortho allow him to try it on him. Though, shaking this thought off, he'd again go back to leaning on the tree behind him, the use of chakra tiring him out a small bit. Looking down, he'd smirk some, happy to be there, and enjoying life. Nodding at this, he'd begin to strum a few lines, letting his thoughts drift away along with his music.* - Fri Nov 13 07:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Simply happened to be arriving with a caravan as Ai came to guard the gate.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Slipping the guitar from around his back, and over to the front of him, he'd -slowly- make his way to the side of the path before sitting down. Sighing slightly, he'd say, "Mind asking?" saying such, he'd start to play, working over the instrument skillfully, going off into his own little world, adding his own image to his music in his mind.

Anyone listening would likely enjoy what they heard, unless they hated music.* - Fri Nov 13 22:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, looking around the area, he'd find himself quite bored. Shaking his head, he'd of course swing his instrument around, dropping it to the front side of him. "Well, what to play this time. . .?" asking such, he'd look over his guitar. Thinking it over for some time, he'd decide it was time to work on his jutsu again. Again closing his eyes, focusing his chakra, he'd start to get a grasp on how it was flowing through his body. Once he was sure that he knew how it was going to go, he'd nod. Opening his eyes, he'd sigh again.

Looking down, he'd put his fingers to the strings, pushing his chakra into them, he'd strum it slightly, making sure that it would go out into the air as he had hoped. Though, having a hard time making it constant with the sound, he'd sigh. Realizing that it was his mind that wasn't focused on the technique, he'd again close his eyes, knowing that he would have to have his focus right if he wanted to make this work out the way he had made it. Nodding, he'd start a sort of rythmic breathing. Taking in large, slow breathes and letting them go just as slow.

Basically going into his own head, he'd block out anything else that happened to be in there. Removing from his thoughts of the rude female he had just met, and the fools who tried to let him into the village without permission. Once he was sure that he had cleared everything out, he'd again nod happily. Keeping his eyes closed as he knew the positioning of the guitar, he'd again reach down, laying his fingers on the strings. Smiling at the feel of it, he'd strum experimentally, focusing on the sound that came with it. Feeling that the music had his absolute focus.

Letting out a long sigh, he'd nod once again. Pushing his chakra towards the strings, he'd start to play a normal song, trying to make it to anyone that was passing by look like he was simply enjoying his music, though, hidden inside of it, would be his attempt to use a jutsu. Quickly bringing his hand down to a particular string, he'd pluck it rather loudly. Doing such, he'd focus on that particular sound. If he had been focusing it towards a particular person, the jutsu would have taken an effect. Though, being that no one was around, it would simply ring out pointlessly.

Once he was done, he'd again nod, moving to look over his guitar lovingly. Chuckling, sick of waiting, he'd again slip the item over his shoulder, and onto his back, letting it rest there. Moving to his feet, he'd quickly write in a scroll before sending it off by bird, "Well, now I wait a bit more I guess." saying such, he'd stretch, and look around the place, waving playfully to a few guards, "Yo? Sup?" though, knowing that they wouldn't respond, he'd strong, wasting as much time as he possibly could until he recieved a reply.* - Sat Nov 14 00:23:53 2015

Sending his chakra out with the sound that would come from the instrument, he'd focus it on Mizumi. Trying his upmost best to preform the technique he had been working on. If it worked sucessfully, the boy would feel as if the strings of Hatsujin's guitar suddenly flew off, and wrapped around him, binding him in place.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Taking the blade from Eri, he'd raise an eyebrow, moving forward. "Nothing too personal, orders are orders." Not wasting anymore time, he'd attempt to grab the boy, bringing the blade to his throat. Shrugging some as it was technically an order from his leader, he'd attempt to dig the blade into Mizumi's throat, slitting it, and in doing such, hopefully bringing the boy's life to an end for Ortho. 

If it worked out, he'd attempt to backstep, wanting to avoid any blood spray that might get on his guitar, feeling like it would be a pain to get it fully off of it.

If it didn't work out, he'd still backstep, not wanting to be near a man he just tried to kill.* - Sat Nov 14 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Having snakes suddenly wrap around him, he'd be more worried about his guitar than he was Ortho messing with him. Looking to it he'd speak to Ortho, "Come on now, was that really needed?" asking such playfully, he'd wait for Ortho to recall his pets. Once he had done so, he'd look to Eri, "Mind if I keep this?" talking about the Kunai she had given him.

Completely ignoring Mizumi at first, he'd attempt to make his way back to Ortho, "I accomplished what I was meant to, I couldn't care less what you think." saying such in a way that made it seem like he was content.

Though, this would only be if Ortho released the snakes off of his body.* - Sat Nov 14 04:18:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Suddenly getting squeezed by the snakes, he'd cough a bit. His body wasn't exactly one that could take the damage, and it would show. Being that as the snakes coiled tighter, and his body struggled for air, it would continually give the snakes more room to constrict him. 

Suddenly falling to the ground, he'd feel his body would have a hard time being able to handle it, as he couldn't get air in to breathe anymore. It was likely if it continued, something would start to fracture.* - Sat Nov 14 04:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) having the snakes remove themselves, he wouldn't even look to Ortho, no, he'd first gain air back into his lungs, letting his body take as much as it needed. Then, of course, he'd go to check his guitar, making sure that it hadn't been damaged in any of that undertaking. Once he was sure it was fine, he'd sidestep, moving away from everyone.

Taking a seat right in the middle of the path, he'd go about the process of wiping the instrument down, and tuning it a tadm keeping all thoughts to himself.* - Sat Nov 14 04:43:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Catching what Eri had said, he'd shake his head slightly. "Ortho, mind if I go now? I made plans for later." saying such, as he thought back to earlier in the day when he visited Sunagakure, and was told to come back at a later time in the day.

Looking around, he'd take note of everyone quickly. He didn't plan on being around a bunch of assholes right now, he had music to write, nicer people to talk to. As far as he was now concerned, the only people of interest that he would want to even speak to would be, one, the boy that he had almost killed, and two, what seemed to be a person he had caught sight off standing off a ways away.* - Sat Nov 14 04:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Yawns slightly, removing his guitar and setting it to the side. Leaning against one of the trees, he'd slowly think things over.* - Sat Nov 14 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, coming out of his thoughts, he'd pick his instrument back up, playing a tune slowing, making it up as he went.* - Sat Nov 14 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Addictive my ass. . .it's the sound of stagnation. - Sat Nov 14 06:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, the lack of sounds starting to get to him. Though, still refusing to speak to Ortho at this point, feeling some adversion to him, he'd once more swing the guitar off of his back, and around to the front of himself. Looking it over, he'd smirk. This single item was likely the most important thing in his posession, and he stupidly showed that. He was simply happy that nothing had happened to it in the past incident.

Mumbling under his breath, "Screw your quiet." and having done such, he'd quickly start to knock off notes, going about one of his more liked pieces. (Profile Music) Of course, much like usual, he'd care not for the other two in the area at this point anymore, the moment he started playing, he'd be taken into his own world. Getting basically all the way through it, he'd suddenly change his mind as he was about to end it. He'd decide to use it as an oppurtunity to train his jutsu. Thus, he'd look forward, setting his target on nothing really.

As he came down to the last few notes, he'd move down to hit the string required for the jutsu. Pushing his chakra into it, and out with the sound wave, if he had been focusing on anyone in particular, they likely would have been caught in the technique. Though, being that he wasn't, nor was he in the mood to start a dispute by doing so, he'd let it come to an end, it being a bit more of a waste of time than he thought it would have been. Though, the whole thing having at the least served to brighten his mood, he'd set the instrument into his lap and lay into the grass, closing his eyes.* - Sat Nov 14 07:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: ..tch.. - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Not going to lie.. - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: The guitar is pretty cool. - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: But cool.. - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, "Tough love? Is that what's called now?" 

Having let that question hang in the air, he'd shake his head once more, "He may be running it, but he is being an ass about it." Having stated such, he'd completely ignore her statement about liking to listen to him play. While he didn't find joy in others complimenting him, he didn't do it for others, he did it for himself.

Already angered over Ortho's supposed 'Tough love' he'd move back to the place he was before, between the two trees to the south of him. Tempted to begin playing again, he'd decide against it, he decided that it would only serve to seem like their comments had made him feel better.* - Sat Nov 14 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: They all break.. - Sat Nov 14 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Finally unable to take the silence anymore, he'd again sling the instrument over his shoulder and into his lap. While he felt he'd be breaking with his want to upset the two above him, he felt like he needed to play in order to distract himself. Thus, looking over his guitar, he'd decide to go with something heavier this time, hoping that perhaps they wouldn't like it as much, while also letting him distract himself. Though, of course he'd start off slow, warming up.

Glancing back up to Ortho, the idea of perhaps putting him into the Genjutsu for the hell of it came to mind. Shrugging to himself at the thought, he'd keep chakra flowing to his fingers just to be sure. Starting off slow, he'd work his way up. Getting into quite heavy, fast notes, it would be something completely different than he had played in front of others, being more like a solo from a song than an actual song. Though, it would still distract him, sending him off to his own world as he did such, blocking out all the other thoughts around him.

His body, having a bit of a hard time keeping up after awhile, he'd draw it down, deciding again to go ahead and use the jutsu, just not on any particular target. He figured it was better than not getting used to it. Thus, he'd again hit the needed string as he came to a close, letting it ring out, taking his chakra with it on the soundwaves that went out before dissapating into nothingness. Shaking his head, he'd move the instrument down into his lap, moving to lean against the tree as he let out a tired breath.* - Sat Nov 14 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Obviously was he was rested, he'd move back up a bit.* - Sat Nov 14 08:50:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) not knowing how to react, he'd take it as a lie, or that it was forced. Not that he exactly cared anymore, "Uh. Alright." saying such in a monotoned voice he'd throw his hands into his pockets and look to him a bit confused, wondering what this was all about. * - Sat Nov 14 09:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd turn back around, he wasn't sure what Ortho was trying to accomplish with his apology, but he'd shake the thought from his head. Taking the guitar from his back once more, he'd experiment with it some, strumming a few notes, mumbling, "What to play. . ."* - Sat Nov 14 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Forget that kid.. - Sat Nov 14 09:14:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) shaking his head, taking his time to think of what he wanted to play, he'd speak out, suddenly feeling a bit bad, "Thanks for the Apology I guess. Though, honestly it was a bit pointless. What is done is done." hopefully dropping it all with that, he'd start to play seriously for once, not the usual playful stuff he did to make himself feel better, but a song that he actually considered work to play. Stressing over it, he'd focus the best he could on it, starting to stress as he moved his left hand up and down the strings, preforming the notes.

In all honesty, he was now attempting to impress the two behind him, though, even if he did, he'd likely play it off as idle playing.* - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015

I'm a traveling musician that had been visiting around looking for inspirtation." saying such he'd shrug slightly, "The last time I was here anyone of high enough rank to let me in was supposedly sleeping."

Gotten all of his words out, he'd sigh. He'd be wearing a read jacket and a black undershirt with pants. The only thing of notice on him would be a fender strat. type guitar on his back, being black around the edges, moving into red, and then an orange like a sunburst.

It should be noted that he seemed like a rather skinny person, his body not well trained.* - Sat Nov 14 21:38:46 2015

But I'm sure I can pay to stay in an inn." rubbing the back of his neck slightly he'd say, "Again, I'm looking for inspirtation, and trying to make myself a bit more well known."

He wouldn't let on to the fact he spent most of his money keeping his guitar in shape, and hitching rides on caravans.* - Sat Nov 14 21:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Having walked into the area, he'd be carrying his trade marked guitar, which if anyone was paying attention, the'd notice it being black around the outside, followed by red, and then orange in the middle. 

Not saying anything yet, he'd scan the area around him.* - Sat Nov 14 22:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Sighs slightly working his way around the village, taking in all of the sights. Walking towards what seemed to be a training ground, he'd stop, taking note of a few people. Scanning them over, he'd look for anything interesting.

Though on the reverse, if anyone was to look to him, they'd see him wearing a red jacket, a black undershirt, pants, and that he'd be carrying his usual fender strat. guitar, which was black around the edges, then going in it would be red, and then orange. If they were to look ever closer, they'd note he seemed rather skinny, and his body wasn't well trained.* - Sat Nov 14 22:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Almost completely blowing off Zenaki's aura he'd note it, making sure to stay on edge around her, his mind being stronger than to make his body faulter from a simply feeling. That, and he had been around people who felt even worse. 

"I just arrived here. I'm a traveling musician, I'm unsure of the village layout." saying such, he'd again point to the instrument on his back.* - Sat Nov 14 22:40:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shrugging a bit, he'd flip the instrument off of his back. Looking it over, and then up to Kuro he'd say, "If that's what you want." saying such, he'd look back down to his instrument, sighing slightly. Closing his eyes, he'd begin to play something rather slow, as he wasn't in the mood to be playing any heavier music for the moment. Running his fingers down the strings, while also strumming the guitar. A rather slow song coming out, he'd drift off to his own little world. Anyone of his type, that liked music as much as him would likely as well. (Profile music is the song.)

Deciding at the last moment to make this into a practice for his techniques as well, he'd start to push his chakra into his fingers, doing his best to make the sounds ring out louder. Once he was starting to get to the end, he'd simply look down, hitting the last string, and letting his chakra flood out to no one in particular. Once he was done, he'd move to put the instrument on his back. "Judge it as you may. It's one of my most enjoyed." saying such, he'd shrug, looking around.* - Sat Nov 14 22:58:08 2015
