<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Turns away and pouts a bit, "Whatever."* - Thu Nov 19 07:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Already sick of hearing Hiroshi, he'd reach to his back and bring the guitar to the front of his body. Once he had done so, he'd say, "So you wanted to hear a song right?" asking such, he'd quickly flare chakra to his fingers. Reaching down, he'd pluck a single string. Which, in turn would send out a sound wave with his chakra in it, directed at Hiro.

If it hit, and took hold, the boy would seem to see the stings of his guitar break off and wrap around him, stopping him from doing anything else. This, being a hassle as it was, would be followed by a severe dizziness. If it all worked out alright, he'd quickly reach over and tap him again, "You're it, punk." before trying to walk away.* - Thu Nov 19 07:35:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Squinting his eyes at the boy he'd say, "Bring it."* - Thu Nov 19 07:50:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd slimpy reach out, slapping the boy across the face, with no real strength behind it.

"I knew you wouldn't do anything."* - Thu Nov 19 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I don't know if I made a friend of an enemy today. . . Fuck it. - Thu Nov 19 07:55:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head he'd say, "Says the one too much of a bitch to hit me." shaking his head slightly he'd move on, "You wanna play that badly, fine." saying such, he'd move his hands up, "Watch closely, I'll show you a sure 'fire' win." saying such, he'd move to make like he was about to go through the motions of the game, though right as he came to the end, he'd quickly make a hand seal, intiating another genjutsu.

It it was successful, the boy would seem to be caught in a what would appear to be a situation where a giant fireball would be decending from the sky, causing the heat to actually hit him, and likely scare the shit out of him. Though, even Hatsu was unsure what would happen if the ball were to actually hit him, mentally at least. He'd walk a few paces away, his body visably starting to strain from the chakra use. Though, once he was sure he was far enough away, he'd let the Gen fade.* - Thu Nov 19 08:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Having his hands grabbed, he'd look to Hiro, gritting his teeth a bit in pain he'd say, "You're a real asshole you know? You can't hit me like a pain, but you can try to hold my hand? What are you gay?" asking such, if Hiro was to back off at these words, he'd again try to make the seal to inact the same jutsu he was trying before. 

It should be noted his hands were already showing signs of purple bruising from being grabbed.* - Thu Nov 19 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head lightly ignoring him, he'd attempt to pull his wrist away, "Help! Rape! This guy is a pedophile! Help!" yelling such, he'd look back to see Hiro's reaction. If it was what he had hoped for, his hands would be released. If he didn't he'd continue to try to pull his own hands away, likely hurting himself more.

Still ignoring the man's questions, he'd glance around, looking for anyone, or anything he could use in order to get away. Not seeing anything, he'd quickly bite down into his own lip, causing blood to come out. Looking to Hiro, he'd quickly aim to spit this in the boy's eyes.

Basically, he was doing anything he could to get away, and likely hurting himself in the process.* - Thu Nov 19 08:31:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, running out of ideas, his wrist even more purple at this point, he'd continue to struggle, though, now glaring he'd say something under his breath before continuing to get free.* - Thu Nov 19 08:40:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Ignoring the blood as it was something he was used to he'd look to Hiro, "On three?" saying such he'd grab the arm closest to him and act as if he was going to try and pick her up. "Rias, stop being stubborn, let us spoil you, like damn." saying such he'd look to Hiro to help lift her in the armor she was wearing, "1. . .2. . . .3." on three, he'd make sure that Hiro was helping, and would attempt to lift her, "To the Hungry ant!"* - Thu Nov 19 09:33:52 2015

I owe you for those jutsu anyway. Who knows, I might play a song or something."* - Thu Nov 19 09:52:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Fumatori, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd say, "You're being stubborn again." Sighing slightly he'd move to sit down. Speaking out he'd say in a very monotoned voice, "Well then, enough of the acting like I care. I just wanted to repay you for the jutsu you taught me." saying such, he'd think about pulling money out and handing it to her, though that didn't seem like such a good idea, so instead, he'd simply pull his guitar off of his back.

Looking to her, he'd think for a moment before shrugging, starting to play one of his more known pieces, not missing a single note, or messing one one line. 

(Profile music.) 

Deciding it was better not to sing the words, he'd just play the guitar piece to it.* - Thu Nov 19 10:07:08 2015
