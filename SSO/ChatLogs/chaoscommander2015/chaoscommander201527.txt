<br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling that he was close to be able to use the jutsu, he'd now look to the portion that would explain how to gather his chakra in order to use the technique, and how to shape and release it. Having gone over this, he'd simply shake his head, feeling that he'd need to go over it one more time. Thus, he'd read over the page again, taking note of what it said. Adding it to his memory after he read it more than any normal person would, he'd sigh.

Moving now down the page, he'd decide that he'd add his own notes to the page, thus, he'd begin to write in somethings at certain points that would make the scroll easier to understand for people like himself. Having done this, he'd quickly put his tool away, looking it all over again and nodding. Setting the scroll down one more time to take a break, he'd stretch out, all of this reading starting to give him a head ache. Which, he'd try to forget.

Now, looking to the scroll one last time, he'd read over it all again, scanning it for any little bit of infromation that he could squeeze out of it. Seeing that he didn't, he'd start to do as the scroll said, going through the seals, and gathering his chakra inside of him. Bringing his hands to his mouth, he'd release the chakra, letting it blast out in the form of a stream of water, coating the area in front of him just a bit. Nodding at this, he'd get up to walk away, sick of all of this.* - Tue Nov  3 02:42:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, having gotten a few more missions he'd take one out of his jacket. Looking at it, he'd about gag. It was some romantic bullcrap, but who was he to judge. Shaking his head, he'd walk off to a nearby flower shop. Sighing as he walked, he'd look over the scroll again as he decided to memorize the address he needed to go to. Once he had done this, he'd walk into the shop, waiting to get the flowers that had been ordered for a women. He'd simply whistle a bit as he waited.

Finally getting the flowers from the shop, he'd make his way away from the shop, heading to the address he had gotten from the scroll. Taking his time as no deadline had been given, he'd stop to get some water on the way, it being hotter out than he thought it was. Shaking the heat off, he'd continue to make his way, eventually arriving, and simply giving the flowers to the women, being that no way in hell was he going to sing a song for -anyone-. Doing such, he'd nod and leave.

Slowly making his way back, he'd make sure to tell the orignal person who had ordered the flowers that they had been delivered, and after that he would obviously make his way to the village square, looking for the mizu to tell them that the mission had been done, and maybe for once he'd voice his opinion about how he hated these missions, though, seeing how a person had been killed already, he'd probably just suck it up and get on with life.* - Tue Nov  3 04:13:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: I guess I'm going to go finish these missions unless you have any other suggestions. - Tue Nov  3 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he had gotten a second mission from the Mizu, he'd slowly walk out of the square, waiting until he was away from everyone to read what it had hidden inside. Opening it, he'd scan the contents, taking note of wait it said. Simply shaking his head as he did this, he'd simply speak aloud, "Help an old women shop? The fuck is this shit?" saying such he'd simply shake his head, closing the scroll and putting it back into his coat, figuring he better get going.

Making his way through the village, he'd pull the scroll out once more, checking the address of where he was going. Once he had done this, he'd simply nod, being that he had an idea of where that was. Thus, he'd make his way there, not in any mood to rush. Upon getting there, he'd politely introduce himself and have to deal with grabbing her list of items, and such, before walking out of the building with her, escorting her to the market to buy her items. On the inside, he'd be dying from it.

Having gotten her to the store, he'd be forced to walk around the store with her, picking up the things she wanted, and putting them into a basket. Going abou this process for some time, he'd at the end, be pushing around a rather large basket full of things. Shaking his head at the thought of having to carry it all back, he'd be forced to wait in line to pay for the women. Once he had finally paid the price of all of the items that had been picked out, he'd make his way outside, using sheer strength to carry the bags.

Being forced to carry most of the bags back to the womens house, he'd fine himself working up a sweat on the way back, needing to stop multiple times for water, and breaks. Though, once he had finally gotten himself back to the women's house, he'd make his way in, then going through the process of unloading everything, and stacking it and such where the women wanted it. Once done, he'd simply not to her, having acted as nice as he could the entire way through it.

Having finished helping the women out, he'd make his way out of the house, deciding to sit on the steps and take a break for awhile before actually doing anything else. Though, finding himself even getting bored on that, he'd quickly make his way back into the village square, hoping to report that he had finished everything up that needed to be done, and that he wouldn't be assigned anything as crappy as this mission, as he didn't like dealing with people.* - Tue Nov  3 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had made his way back into the village square, returned his mission scroll, and had been given another one already, he'd of course do the same as usual, walking out of the square, and opening the scroll to see what he had recieved this time. Looking it over, he'd sigh, at least with this one he'd be able to use his powers he thought. Though, shaking his head anyway as it was another easy one, he'd close the scroll up, tucking it back into his coat where it was orignally.

Starting to walk through the village he'd start with the waterfall, finding nothing there, he'd start to walk around the village again. Though, finding nothing for a really long time, he'd sigh, almost on the verge on giving up. Though as he was about to quit, he'd catch sight of a furry animal in the distance, running as fast as he could, he'd get to the area where he had seen it. Looking around, he'd sigh, having lost interest. Though, again catching another sight, he'd run off after it, determind.

Watching a somewhat large dog run off, he'd start to chase after it, having a hard time keeping up, he'd struggle, following it through the village. Though, almost losing sight of it multiple times, he'd have to stop and get his bairings and look for him again. Once he was on the animals trail again, he'd chase him down a path he knew to be a dead end. Cornering the animal, he'd watch as it turned on him, trying to attack him. Which, in turn would cause him to move back, aggravated with it.

Shaking his head, he'd simply pull his sleeve up, looking to the animal, "You're dead." saying such, he'd stretch a bit for dramatic effect. Watching as the dog jumped forward to attack, he'd throw up his threads, blocking the dog from getting to him. Though in turn, he'd twist his threads to a point, shooting it forward at the beast, causing them to shoot straight through the animal's neck, most likely killing the medium sized dog on impact, and it it didn't, it would simply die of air loss.

Walking over to check on the dog, he'd nod, knowing it was likely dead. Taking the dogs collar and making his way back to the villlage square he'd say, "Don't send me to kill animals anymore. I like them more than people." saying such he'd drop the collar of the animal for the mizukage, pausing and thinking for a moment on what else to say, finally deciding, "And give me real missions from now on, this is ridiculous." saying such, he'd walk off, wanting to find someting better.* - Tue Nov  3 05:46:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Watching Nina, he'd catch sight of the blood in her hands, and the tears running down her face, and it was at that moment that he'd decide. Hearing what she had said, he'd simply stick his hands into his pockets, following after her, deciding to wait until they were out of earshot of everyone else before deciding to speak up.* - Tue Nov  3 08:37:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) having followed Nina, much like he had decided to, he'd look to her once she had stopped, "Don't tell me where to stay.  ." saying such softly he'd simply mutter, "Let me see your hands."  waiting from a response from the girl, he'd think a bit.* - Tue Nov  3 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I'm not going to let her be alone. . .from what I can gather bad things must keep happening. - Tue Nov  3 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more, he'd simply shake his head, "I don't belong around these people anyway, plus I already decided. . .Now, please let me see your hands." saying such, only being maybe about half a foot taller than Nina, he'd lean over a bit, "I'm not exactly safe for this village either." saying such, he'd give a nervous smile, "Which means we both just have to leave, right?"* - Tue Nov  3 09:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as she turned away, he'd simply walk to keep pace with her, "It's rude to walk away from a conversation you know." pausing in his speech he'd say, "Would you at least like to know why I shouldn't be here? It was one reason, but it seems it's quickly evolved into two." saying such, he'd again give a small smile behind all of his hair.* - Tue Nov  3 09:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing again, he'd quickly move to be infront of her, "Can you stop for just a second? You don't even know what I'm getting at. I have my own personal reason, along with a new personal reason." saying such he'd rub the back of his neck looking to her, "Though stop worrying so much about others. . .let someone else worry over you every now and again."* - Tue Nov  3 09:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Already having decided back when he had seen her before he'd simply shake his head, "I guess I'll have to explain later then." Quickly tossing whatever required amount of money needed to catch a ride with the Caravan to the required person, he'd say, "Of course I'm going." saying such he'd move to step up behind her. "You think I'd let you leave me behind?"* - Tue Nov  3 09:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Before we get where we're going. - Tue Nov  3 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: Mind if I show you my first reason? - Tue Nov  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Fine. - Tue Nov  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) says: As I'll need to hide it where we're going as well. - Tue Nov  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Saying such, he'd nod to her, unzipping his jacket to reveal and undershirt, and more of his skin, along with moving his hair back out of his face, allowing light to get to it. All of this, revealing stitching all over his skin, including his face a bit, "I have something a few people have had apparently. And most people don't take well to it." saying such, he'd pull a sleeve back, showing more of it. Holding his hand out, he'd make it burst out from one of the stitches, raising up. After this demonstration, he'd let it back in, stitching himself closed, and rezipping his jacket and so on, hiding it again.

"I can do much more with it, but I was told it'll eventually make me a target." pausing he'd say, "My other reason would probably seem silly to you."* - Tue Nov  3 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: I see, that's quite unique. What is the other reason? - Tue Nov  3 09:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Alright.. - Tue Nov  3 10:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, he'd simply step back towards her, mumbling to her, "I swear if I lose a hand." though upon saying such, a somewhat thick black thread would start to move from one of the stitches areas hidden under his sleeve. Moving down and to the ground, he'd slowly snake its way to Ortho, wrapping losely around his foot before pulling tight, and then pulling back towards Thaenan, trying to pull the man off of his feet.

If he was sucessful, he'd let the thread lose from the man's foot, and would quickly manipulate it to come back into his body, almost ashamed he had used it for something so silly.* - Tue Nov  3 10:38:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Fuck it. - Tue Nov  3 10:47:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing that this might turn into something nasty, he'd take this time that the wall would come up to remove his jacket, tossing it to the side, revealing -many- stitched up areas on his body, from arms, to neck. Then, grabbing his only head band at this point he'd tie his hair back out of his face, revealing that hidden there were more stitchings, though once he had done this he'd say, "Do we really have to do this? She just wanted me to show you." saying it in a somewhat monotoned voice, knowing that realistically, he'd be no use.* - Tue Nov  3 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Ewwwwwwy - Tue Nov  3 10:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, being that all of this had gotten a bit out of hand now, he'd look to Nina as she hopefully was able to cut the rock that had been forming to take him out. Being that he was still unsure what to do at this point, he'd simply look back to Nina, "See what you've gotten me into?" saying such, he'd rub his neck a bit, not making a move to do anything yet.* - Tue Nov  3 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to his side as Nina was suddenly covered by a large amount of rock, he'd let out another sigh, looking back to Ortho just fast enough to see him start to work on another set of seals.Getting ready for it, he'd let the threads around his arms move out. Being on the ready as he saw what was coming, being the large rush of wind, he'd save Ortho the time, quickly dropping down to a kneeling position, he'd attempt to force the threads he had at the ready from both arms into the ground in hopes of attaching himself there, though as he had no real way of knowing if this would work, there was always the chance of simply getting blown back.* - Tue Nov  3 11:13:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Because you have nothing better to do. I'm going to take out Kirigakure. Take control and rebuild it form the ground up. That village is tainted and I'm going to cleans it.. - Tue Nov  3 19:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Simply taking the body he'd say, "I'll take it to Nina. . .she'll want to say something before we bury her." saying such, while true, he also had other motives.* - Wed Nov  4 04:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Being that everything seemed to be ending, he'd take the body that he had been entrusted with, and would begin to walk off, having a few things to do before he could get back to where he had originally come from.* - Wed Nov  4 05:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*** Peasant Girl **(TenaciousRiven) thinks: He knew them. - Wed Nov  4 05:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) being that he had made his way out of the village with the body of Violet, he'd look it over, being that there was a massive hole in the chest area, he'd be a bit afraid over the fact that perhaps the heart would be damaged. Though, setting the body down, and looking it over, he'd nod a small amount, being that a rather large hole was there, he'd be able to reach in and look around physically, not having to just go about it with simply guess work. Happy about this, he'd remove his hand, looking around to see if anyone who he actually cared about seeing what he was about to do was around. Noting there was not, he'd begin.

Removing his jacket, and shirt, he'd let his stitching out, not wanting to reach in and bumble around with his hands when he could use his threads. Nodding at his own thought process, he'd allow the stitching on his chest to open up, being that he had to use his own body as a storage space at the moment, he'd let the threading down, going to the already open chest cavity. Assisting his threads, he'd watch as the threads revealed the valves connecting it, and thus, he'd reach in with a small, sharp blade, cutting them off. Pulling his hand back out, he'd allow his threads to cradle the heart, pulling it out of the womens body.

The now free heart would be brought up to his own chest cavity before being sucked in, vanishing within the black abyss that was the inside of Thaenan's body. The threads, going to work, would attempt to attach the heart to itself, and his own bodies systems, adding a third one to his body. If this worked, he'd nod, slowly getting dressed. Brushing himself off, and cleaning the blood that had gotten on him in the water. Once he had done this, he'd move back to the body, standing over it. Shaking his head, he knew he had to take it to Nina.

Moving down, he'd decide to do his best to stitch the hole that had been made in the women's chest. Hopefully having done this, he'd pick the body up, moving to carry it to Nina.* - Wed Nov  4 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) moving to walk by Ortho and the women who had gone with him orignally to Kirigakure, he'd move to stand by Nina, holding the body of Violet. "I suggest we go talk somewhere." saying such in a monotone way, he knew if she found out that this had been done by Ortho while in his presence, it wouldn't be good.* - Wed Nov  4 05:39:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) having simply let the body be handed over to Nina, ignoring the fact that she had tried to kill him, he'd simply sigh, speaking openly, but more to Ortho than anyone, "It's obvious she doesn't want me here now. If that is the case, I in turn have no reason to be here, so I'll be going. . .somewhere I guess." saying such, he'd stick his hands into his pockets and stare off after Nina, wanting to follow, and explain, but not wanting to get his head lobbed off either.

Turning to attempt to walk away he'd simply mumble to himself, "Yet another place I am basically shut out off because of acts blamed on me." saying such, he'd of course have to pause, unsure where he was even going.* - Wed Nov  4 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) being that he was unsure of what to do, being that he wasn't sure which way to go, he'd of course stop when called out. Looking to Ortho, and then to Nina, being that he'd have seen Ortho basically just destroy all military power of a village, he'd point to Nina, "Mind if I go after her? I'd rather take my chances with her anger." saying such in a monotone voice, he'd simply shrug.* - Wed Nov  4 06:12:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) having somewhat expected something like this to happen, threads would shoot out from under his jacket sleeve, attempting to wrap around Nina's midsection, and stop her advancement towards Ortho. If sucessful he'd simply say, "It's not worth it Nina." somewhat tilting his head, he'd shrug a bit, "Find a better way to get even." if all of this worked out in his favor, he'd also be prepared himself, as Nina obviously seemed to be angered, again* - Wed Nov  4 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing her about to do something most likely in anger against him, as she had looked back at him, he'd simplly sigh at first, having not thought of doing anything more than stopping her attack. Though, hearing her weird yell thing that she had going on, and the water jutsu likely headed for her, he'd change his mind on the said pervious choice. 

Being that his threads were basically unaffected by the electricity, he'd attempt to draw them back into his body while still attached to Nina, and would pull on it physically as well,  trying to yank her back, out of the way of the water jutsu.* - Wed Nov  4 07:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nina(Ninasky115) says: Too bad. That's the deal. - Wed Nov  4 07:33:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) sighing a bit, he'd release the threads hold on Nina, "Suprisingly, I'm no longer in the mood to train."* - Wed Nov  4 07:34:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Thaenan(Chaos Commander2015) Simply sighs a bit, moving forward, and over a bit, moving to sit as well, he was about over it all.* - Wed Nov  4 07:45:04 2015
