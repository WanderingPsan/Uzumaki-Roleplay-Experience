<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as it seemed he had been given some wire, he would look it over. Curious about what he could do with it, he would attempt to do as the Mizu had explained. Gathering his chakra, he would quickly attempt to send it through the string. Though, being like learning all new things, when he rushed them, they failed. Thus, he would find himself unable to send chakra into the wire, being that he wasn't exactly focused on the actual task, more worried about getting past the predicament that he was in first more than anything. Though, being that he knew he wouldn't hear the end of it, he would again sigh and try again.

Looking back to the wire, he would basically zone in on it, and nothing else. Closing his eyes for a moment, he would pretend that the wire was a part of his own body, letting the chakra slowly make its way towards it, much like he would do if he were to need to send it to a limb, or any other part of his body. Once he had felt the connection to the wire, he would nod a bit, opening his eyes and looking to the Mizu, "Done, thanks I guess for teaching me that." having said such simply to humor her, he would in reality have found this to be a waste of time.* - Mon Oct 19 02:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Ok - Mon Oct 19 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he had made his way to the top of the mountain which had the waterfall coming from it, he would look around, having escaped from all of the people. Deciding that it was once more time to get some practice in with the techniques that he had suddenly been learning a lot of, he would find a comfortable spot to sit, being that knowing which jutsu he was planning on advancing first, would take more focus than any other ones that he had at his disposal. 

Having gotten into a seated position, he would slowly close his eyes, and start to regulate his breathing. He was trying to calm himself the best he could. Needing to get his focus steady, he would attempt to zone out from anything else around himself, ignoring people, weather, anything really, as the technique may have been a basic one, but without being One-hundred percent focused, it would be likely to fail. Thus, he would bring himself to the point where he had a clear slate in his head, feeling he was ready to get to the next part.

Having closed himself off from everything else, he would start to tap into the flow of his own chakra, doing his best to get a grasp on it. Struggling for some time trying to get a good hold on where it was, once he had finally found it, he would mentally grab a hold and go with the flow of it for the time being, trying to get used to the way it would flow around his body, and get familiar with it as before, he hadn't needed to do this as it would normally come naturally when he needed it, though, he was about to do something a bit unnatural.

Being that he had grasped his own chakra, he would begin to mentally attempt to pull back on it, trying to slow it down the best he could. Though, finding this to be a harder experience than he thought it would be, he would be carried along with the flow. Continuing to try and pull on it, he would feel it start to slow just a small amount, but not much to matter really. Deciding to try once more, he would quickly use all of his power to attempt to slow down his chakra flow, though, starting to swear from the strain, he would feel himself start to slow it down just as his mental grip on it would fail.

Opening his eyes once more, aggravated by the fact that he had almost had the first part of the technique before letting it slip he would mumble quietly, "Dammit, I was so close." Having said such, he would almost immediately go back to closing his eyes and trying to regain his focus, finding his way back to his flow of chakra, and once more mentally grabbing a hold of it with all the power he could. Once more, mentally pulling on it the best he could to slow it, he would finally get it to half the speed it was once flowing at.

Taking a moment to get a hold of himself, he would again start up, already having the flow half of what it once was. Mentally stressed by this point, he would continue to attempt and pull the flow. Getting it to the point to where he was struggling mentally, he would finally pull his chakra flow to a startling halt. Making sure that it was completely motionless, he would let an audible sigh loose from his mouth. He was content with what he had done with the first half of the technique. "Now time for the easy part." Having said such he would nod some.

Focusing back in on the mental place he was before, holding his chakra at a stop, he would now move onto the next point, speeding his flow up, and letting it flare out. Quickly attempting this, he would force his chakra to start up once more, at first slowly, and then back to normal speed, though what he thought would be the easy part, would turn out to be the hard part, as when he tried to speed the chakra up, he would find himself straining even harder than he had when he was attempting to stop it. Shaking his head to cause the sweat to fly off, he knew he would have a battle ahead of himself.

Having a hold of his chakra, he would forcefully again push it onward. Pushing himself to the point of exhaustion, he would finally feel the flow of chakra that was inside of him start to speed up well beyond normal. This chakra, flaring out would cause any other person's chakra to be cute off if one was affecting him. At least, that was the idea if it was to be used in actual combat and a Genjutsu was put on him. Happy with this, his chakra would flare for some time, only wasting his energy as he obviously wasn't good at this.

Finding that he had done what he needed to, he would keep his eyes closed, focused on what he was doing, as he needed to stop the flow and send it back to his normal levels before he could just call it quits. Thus, he would again, having kept his grip on the situation, slow his chakra back down to normal levels, being that he didn't need to be walking around while spewing out massive amounts of chakra. Once he had done this, he would simply fall back onto the ground, too tired to even do anything else for the time being.

Having slowly opened his eyes, he would find himself laying there, covered in sweat. Slowly rising back to a seated position, he would pull his cloak off, reviewing what he had done before. Realizing that he had pulled the technique off, he knew that had had made some progress, and from now on, he had a better understanding on what he would have to do next time around. Nodding at this point, he would slowly bring himself to his feet and begin to walk off back to the square, a tired look basically painted over his entire body for the time being. * - Mon Oct 19 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015)  Sighing a bit, as he had made his way to the square, and found no reason to stick around, he would again have made his way back to the mountain, deciding that since he had basically gotten a good grasp a hold of the Kai technique, he would go ahead and take it the furthest he thought he would be able to take it, being, he wanted to see how fast he would be able to do the whole process he had done before. So, once more, he would stay standing this time around as he closed his eyes, getting ready to start.

Once more controlling his breathing, he would do his best to take a hold of his chakra flow. Once he had gotten a hold of it, he would do his best to rush the whole process. Which, obviously, would cause it to fail, quite fast as he felt his grip on his chakra flow slip, making him open his eyes back up. Aggravated once more by this, he would force himself to calm the best he could. Once he had, he would again close his eyes and get back to doing his best, grabbing once more at his chakra.

Having gotten his focus back, he would quickly slow his chakra now, going at a moderate speed, to a stand still. Finding this process much easier than it was the last time, he would let a smile hit his lips. Though, again, this slight act of being distracted would let his chakra flow slip back to its normal speed. Sighing, and rubbing his neck, he realized that he wouldn't be able to allow himself a single moment if he wanted this to work out in the way he wanted it, being that if he slipped, it was now obvious so would the technique.

Once more zoning back into what he was doing, he would once more keep all outside distraction in what he would call a 'dark zone' basically everything he didn't need to know about, he would throw into the zone where his focus wouldn't be turned to it. This time around, he would once more grab his chakra flow, stopping it quite quickly this time around, being that all of the distractions he had were out of his mind. Taking a few deep breathes; he would allow himself a moment to recognize that he could move to the next step now.

Having gotten to the next step, he would once grab his chakra flow. Now, shoving it along, he would do his best to force the flow to expand, and shove out any foreign bodies of chakra. This process taking a bit more energy than the stopping process, being that it was basically wasting chakra, he would start to sweat once more. Though, noting that he had basically done the technique, he would allow himself to slow his chakra back down to normal pace.

Having gone through the technique, he suddenly felt as if he could do it at any time now, with quite an ease to it. Raising an eyebrow at this thought, he would open his eyes once more, wiping away the water that had gathered on his brow. Curious to if his intuition was correct, he would quickly do the seal commonly connected to the jutsu before basically stopping his chakra on a dime, and then flaring it up to massive proportions. Stopping this, he would raise his eyes open wide with shock. Unsure of how he did it.

"Seems the others were right when they said I learned at a faster rate than most people. . .hm." having said such, he would shake the thought away and start to walk back, regardless if people were in the square, he felt like he needed a break from all of the training for the time being.* - Mon Oct 19 18:58:20 2015

"Though, not like the teeth helped, I actually find them to be cute." having said such in a monotone voice, that wouldn't give away if he was kidding or not, he would find himself sick of the treatment he was recieving currently, "Well, if you're done worrying over me, perhaps I can go?" * - Tue Oct 20 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow, he would simply let a smirk cross his face for a moment, unsure of how he wanted to respond to the Mizu. "Sorry, it's a bit hard to have a conversation when you're trying to look out for your leader." having said such, he would look at her, actually keeping his eyes on her longer than he would normally on a person, as if he was thinking something over.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, having found his way back to the top of the waterfall where he would usually train his jutsu. Remembering back to what the Mizu had told him, he had it in his mind that he would have to master his techniques and get stronger before she would recognize him at all. While aggravated by this statement she had made, it also made want to strive forward, and become strong enough to protect her, and the village if need be. Thus, he'd get to training.

Looking around, he assumed he should go ahead and master one of the jutsu he already had a lot of experience in. Nodding at this, he would check to see if anyone was watching him or not. Noting that no one was around, he would feel that he was fine to go ahead and start. Turning to face a direction that had a good portion of open land, he would close his eyes and get his breathing right, as he didn't want to lose focus mid-technique and have to restart once more, like he used to have to do.

Starting slowly with the hand seals, he would take his time, it wasn't that he wasn't confident with getting them correctly, it was simply that he hadn't used the jutsu in quite some time, and thus, he wanted to make sure he would have them in the right order. This, taking longer than it should, he would have to restart one time, as his memory of the seals was a bit wrong to begin with. Though, the second time around, he would find himself getting them all correct.

Once he had gotten the seals correct,  he would give himself a mental pat on the back as he went on to building his chakra up. Starting slowly at first, he would build away at the water chakra levels he was storing up inside of his body. Compressing it down on itself over and over, he would build it up the best he could before then, forcing the chakra to thicken, making it ready to come out in the correct way for his jutsu. Once he had done this, he would again give himself a mental back pat.

Having done all the steps required thus far, he would hold the chakra in the best he could as he opened his eyes. Looking out to the barren expanse in front of him, he would quickly open his mouth, and let the chakra flood out in the form of a sticky, brown liquid which would coat the entire area. Once it was done, anyone or anything that stepped onto it would be caught like a rat in the substance if unprepared. Smirking at this, he would happily say, "I knew I was getting better at this. . .Though. . ." 

Taking a moment to think, he would quickly grab a nearby stick, edging forward to test the creation he had just made. Letting the stick down to where half of it would be in the goop, he would start to pull it back, seeing if he would be able to. The substance, being sticky, would hold, but not for long, being that after a few good tugs, the branch would come right out of the muck. Upset with this, he would simply mutter, "Needs to be stickier or it won't exactly work out well." Having said such, he would cross his arms and move back, thinking of what to do.

Having thought things over for quite some time, he would decide that he simply needed to redo the technique once more and simply force the chakra that he built up to be more sticky. It was really that simple to him, and he didn't think of what that would entail, thus, he would make a move to another empty area to start once more on the technique. Again closing his eyes to focus the best he could before he decided to start up with the training that was ahead.

This time, he would basically fly through the hand seals without much of a problem, being that he now had them all ingrained into his memory, and that he had almost no issue with what order that they came in, he would go right onto the chakra building portion of the jutsu, once more forcing all of the water chakra that he could possibly gather to compress in on itself and stay inside of his body until he was ready to use it. Though, this time around he wouldn't jump right to using it, he had to make the chakra a bit more sticky.

Thus, he would begin to focus more on the actual chakra he had already built up, and less on adding to it. Mentally looking it over, he would focus the best he could on changing the consistency of the substance. Forcing it to be quite thicker, and in turn, a bit more of a hassle to get out of once it was used. Then, he would imagine it being sticky, much like gum, or glue. Forcing this mental picture onto his chakra, he would in turn make it change to how he wanted it to be.

Having gotten his chakra to what he considered the right point for this jutsu to be perfect, he would once more open his eyes and look to where he planned to put the substance, letting the chakra he had built go through his body, and start to rush out of his mouth. The charka, now coming out in a brown, sticky liquid, would coat the ground once more. Happy with the results, he would of course take the same stick he had before and toss it into the substance, wanting to know how well he had done. Though, having thrown it too far, he knew he'd have to walk in to grab it to check.

Shaking his head at this thought, he would quickly send chakra to his feet, allowing him to step onto the substance without being caught in it himself. Walking a ways in, he would grab a hold of the stick, doing his best to tug on it trying to get it out of the ooze. Finding that he couldn't, he would be immensely happy with himself. Though, as he went to pull one last time, his hand would slip, causing him to fall back into the substance himself, and in turn, get caught in his own trap. Not being able but to laugh he would say, "I should have seen that coming."

Quickly ending the technique with cutting the chakra flow to it off, the substance would simply turn into a brown water, the sticky side of it vanishing. Quickly standing to his feet, he would remove his cloak, which would now be covered with mud. "Well, I guess I'll have to clean this." Having said such, he would quickly throw it over his shoulder for the time being, knowing that he should probably continue to train a bit more, so that hopefully when the Mizu woke, he could show his progress.* - Tue Oct 20 17:26:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Having said such, he would begin to walk off, being that his usual training spot was a bit crowded.* - Tue Oct 20 19:01:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(AxelFraire) says: What you need to do is apply a layer of chakra to your feet. - Tue Oct 20 19:02:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had made his way away from all of the people, he would quietly look around, making sure that had hadn't been followed. Content that he hadn't been followed, he would let a sigh meet his lips. He was obviously tired of the training that he had been doing, but he had no choice if he wanted to impress the Mizu, and thus, he would take it upon himself to walk towards the waters edge, ready to start up his training once more, only this time on a different jutsu, being that he had gone as far as he could with the last one.

Taking his time, he would close his eyes as he normally would. Taking a few large breathes, he would think things over, he was unsure which jutsu he wanted to practice next, but he knew that his focus would have to be right regardless if he wanted to do it correctly. Thus, he would start to clear away all of the distractions that were around him, starting with the sounds, and then followed by the feelings, such as the temperature and such. He wanted to have a clear mind before he started. Which, he would accomplish.

Once he had done this, he would finally come to a conclusion of which jutsu he wanted to use. Thus, he would start with the usual, being the hand seals. Starting off slowly he wanted to make sure that he didn't mess up, which he had been doing a lot of lately. Starting with making sure he could do the actual seals associated with the technique, he would then move onto doing them in the right order, doing his best to get them all correct while also going at a decent speed. Finding this easier than expected, he would let a smirk break his lips as he was ready to move onto the next part.

Moving onto the chakra building process of the technique, he would start to focus once more, drawing in all of his chakra, and slowly converting a mass of it over to wind based chakra. Doing so, he would stack it multiple times on top of itself, doing his best to compress it upon itself. Continuing to compress it and make it stronger, he would find himself starting to sweat a small bit, it was harder than he remembered it being. Though, he wouldn't let this bother him but so much as he finally came to the point where he thought he had built enough chakra up.

Once he had done what he needed to this far, he would quickly bring the chakra up, forcing it to move through his body and to his mouth. Quickly pushing it out, he would release a strong gust of wind in which would break off into multiple small tornadoes, forming up over the water and causing water spouts to form. Watching contently he would chuckle, it was a relatively easy technique, though it had endless possibilities. Noticing this he would simply nod, thinking aloud, "I'm glad I was taught this one."

Having said such, he would let a feeling come over him that he still hadn't take this jutsu as far as he could, thus he would go through it all again, wanting to make it a bit bigger than it was this time around. Finding the hand seals to be quite easy, he would fly through them, though when he got to the chakra building portion he would slow down, he needed to build up more than he did before. Thus, he would stockpile loads of it, about twice as much as he did before, trying to compress it into the size of what the first load of chakra was when he used the jutsu.

Finding himself to have stored up more than enough chakra this time around, he would quickly release it through his mouth once more, this time though, it would be a larger wave of air that would break off into more tornadoes, basically causing a wall of raging water to form in front of him when it hit the water. Watching as it made a mess of the area, he would again find himself smirking, it had been some time since he had felt actual joy from training. Shaking his head, he would simply watch the small bit of destruction.

Having let the tornadoes die down at this point, he would simply sigh, deciding once more to take a break being that he had pushed two separate jutsu to the max today, and felt like he needed a break before going onto anymore. Thus, he would start to walk back where he was sure everyone was.* - Tue Oct 20 19:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing once more as he found zero reason to stick around all of the people who had gathered at this usual training spot, he would again head off to a location where there wasn't anyone present. Though, of course he would look around to make sure of this. Once he had done so, he would do what he had done many times now, and what he did every time before practicing a technique, he would close his eyes, and start to control his breathing, trying to get his focus where he needed it to be. Once he was sure that he had gotten it under control, he would move on.

Being that the technique he had decided to work on today didn't require hand seals, he would basically skip that in his usual process, instead moving onto the chakra gathering portion. Thinking this, he would start to gather the chakra in his gut, making sure that he would as usual, force as much as he could into once place, and then compress it upon itself to make it more volatile. Doing such, he assumed it would give him a better propulsion with his technique, and help him move at faster rates of speed.

Once he thought that he had enough chakra built up within his system, he would move onto the logical last part, obviously going about this faster than he usually would, being that it felt like it would obviously be easier being that it didn't need hand seals. Starting to force the chakra to move through his body, he would do his best to direct it to his hands. Though, upon getting to his hands as he held them straight out in front of himself in hopes of sending himself backwards, only a small puff of wind would release itself, as he didn't have much experience, and was obviously rushing the whole thing.

Somewhat disappointed by the lack of response from his release of chakra, he would raise an eyebrow and somewhat look at his hands, confused by the whole experience. Thinking things over, he would attempt to come up with the reason that it had failed. Coming to the conclusion that it was because he was simply rushing into things, and not being precise with his control that it wouldn't work for him this time around, and that in reality he would, like all other techniques, have to take it slow and steady. Shaking his head at this realization he would say, "Round two, fight!"

Once more going through the new process for techniques like this, he would slow himself down even more, making sure to breathe in large breathes, and to stay focused. Rubbing his neck a bit before starting, he would again move back to the chakra building portion, making sure that he simply didn't pile it up, but built it up in a manor that would work for this technique, making it more about quality rather than quantity. Though, at the same time he was looking to make it precise, he wanted it to still have a kick, so of course once he had it sorted out how he wanted it, he would compress it, like most of his techniques into itself, making it more forceful.

Being that he felt he had built up the required power, he would get a bit curious, holding both of his hands in a downward position, thinking to see if this was actually a safe thing to be doing, though, shrugging it off, he would simply start to move the chakra in his body, though, he would move it slowly this time around. Once it started to get to his hands, he would bottleneck it, causing it to block at his hands and start to build up. This in turn would help him with propulsion, though if he let it go to long, it could be damaging.

Having let the chakra bottleneck for long enough, he would suddenly it was time to let it out, releasing the wind natured chakra from his hands, causing it to release a small, powerful wave of air from both of his hands which were pointed at the ground, thus, this would cause him to fly quite high into the air. Finding himself in the sky, he would find himself in a bit of a panic, he knew that if he were to land wrong he could injure himself, and then cause the Mizu to be mad at him. Thus, he would start to let his mind race with a solution.

Not having had much time, he would quickly come to an idea, again forcing his chakra to build up, though this time at a much higher speed. Once it was at the right amount, he would hold it there, trying to time it with his descent. Right as he started to fall back to the ground, he would release yet another burst of air from his hands as he neared the ground, offsetting his speed at which he fell, and making it so that he would land with a thump, but no serious injuries. Though, as he landed, he would basically lay back, huffing from what had happened.

Slowly raising himself to his feet, he would dust himself off, finding that he was extremely tired. "Perhaps I should take a break from this stuff. . .I'm making so bad choices." Having said such, he would again think about walking off, though he was unsure of what he wanted to do. * - Tue Oct 20 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zalyr, Amiel(Chaos Commander2015) Finding himself staying where he was, he would decide to see what he could do with the technique that didn't involve putting himself into danger. Thus, he would again start to focus his chakra. Getting it built up and compressed inside of his body, he would take a few breathes, again wiping the sweat from his body, he was a bit hesitant about using it again honestly, but he really had no choice but to get used to it he assumed. Thus, once he had the chakra built up, he would nod, holding one hand to his right.

Deciding to get this party started, he would start to send the chakra once more to his right hand, though slowly as he didn't want to accidently send himself flying across Kirigakure. Once more letting it bottleneck, he would hold it there as long as he could, until he would finally let the chakra out of his right hand, flowing out in the form of a quite small, but powerful gust of wind. This wind, shooting him in the opposite direction would die out soon after it was released.

Being shot over a good distance, he would stumble and fall, not used to it. "Wow, that was kinda cool. Need to work on the landing though." Having said such, he would shrug a bit, once more wiping his cloak off, being that it seemed every time he practiced, he would seem to get dirty.* - Tue Oct 20 21:10:11 2015
