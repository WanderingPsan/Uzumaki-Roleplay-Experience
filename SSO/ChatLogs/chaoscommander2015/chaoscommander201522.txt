<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Nodding a bit he'd turn away, still uncomfortable getting undressed infrom of her. Taking his shirt off he's slowly move to take the tube, opening it and starting to put it in the areas he could reach, "Thanks. . ." still, feeling insanely awkward, even if he had known her forever. 

Though, he felt that it didn't matter being that they basically knew each other almost completely at this point.* - Tue Oct 27 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Still flinching a bit at the coldness, and at the fact his body hurt anyway, he'd simply nod at what she said. Though, as he finished what he himself could reach, he'd simply close his eyes, enjoying her rubbing the subtance onto his back, being that it eased the pain.

Though, it would seem that having his back rubbed was Vessul's one thing that was completely relaxing for him as he almost started to doze off from the feel. Forcing himself to open his eye he'd say, "Don't say that. . .While it'd be nice, I don't even want anymore blacksmithing accidents." his hand subcontiously going to his eye, that was no longer there, still feeling a ghost pain.* - Tue Oct 27 00:28:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Removing his hand from his eyepatch he'd look over to Masa with his one good eye.

"Why? Do you need some money now? If so I can give it to you." pausing he'd rub his neck, "I was planning for us to spend all day in Kirigakure tomorrow. I simply wanted to rest up." 

though saying such he'd realize her want to change the setting, as he assumed anyone stuck with him for as long as Masa had would be getting sick of him. "Though, if you want to try and get in contact with him we can."* - Tue Oct 27 00:35:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Getting grabbed and somewhat shaken around, he'd somehow find himself pit back where he was, though he'd be a little too wobbily. Shaking around a bit he'd fall forward towards her.

Though, he wouldn't have time to do much more as he would quickly be picked up and thrown over her and a few tiles away, landing quite hard, and sliding a bit. Being that he was already sore, he'd mutter, "I didn't think you'd actually do it."

forcing himself to a sitting position he'd say, "Though it does look like you have gotten that down pact. . ."* - Tue Oct 27 01:35:34 2015

Not exactly wanting to really fight her, he'd simply aim quite a weak punch to her shoulder.

Even if the punch hit, if anything, he'd probably hurt his own hand, but he wasn't going to let it show.* - Tue Oct 27 01:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Getting pulled and held into the air, he'd have an overall depressed look to himself. His face visably warping to a frown, ". . .I know. ." Shaking his head he'd simply say, "Mind putting me down? I'm know I'm worthless for this. . ." 

saying such he'd let his body sag, truely defeated.

He felt completely depressed at this point, and felt that he couldn't be of use to anyone. * - Tue Oct 27 01:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having been lost in his own small bit of depression, he'd feel himself being brough forward. Looking up just in time to feel her lips on his he'd let his eyes go wide, not understanding what had just happened. Though, his depression would clear way to confusion as he was sat down.

Bringing his hand to his lips he'd speak out, "What was that for?" general confusion, mixed with happiness coming out in his words.* - Tue Oct 27 01:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Simply walking over to sit on the bed, he'd remove his shoes, sighing a bit.* - Tue Oct 27 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as she did this he'd raise an eyebrow, "Masa?"* - Tue Oct 27 02:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: W-what? - Tue Oct 27 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Getting pushed back, he'd fall onto the bed, feeling Masa's lips on his own. Getting held down, he wouldn't even care. He had questions, but he was enjoying it. The one last sane thought being <What do you mean since I hold deep feelings? You don't?> before letting them be washed away with the kiss, pushing back with his own lips.* - Tue Oct 27 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing heavily he'd feel her lips remove themselves, which he'd intially try to lean forward to let them stay connected, though hearing what she had said, he'd find himself staring back into her eyes, his heart again starting its rushed pace. "If that's what you want. You're off-duty right now. . you can do anything you please." saying such he'd find himself staring at her.* - Tue Oct 27 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) As she heard what she had said, he'd slowly get off the bed, moving to take his shirt and pants off, just leaving himself in his boxers. Then, he'd move back to the bed, feeling a bit awkward. Waiting for her he'd let a few thoughts run through his head, <Is she doing this because she has feelings for me too? Or because I have feelings for her?>

Though as she came back, his thoughts would cloud about that whole thing, as he saw what she was wearing, "W-Wow." thinking, "U-Um . .you look amazing. . ."* - Tue Oct 27 02:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Gulping down some air he'd try to calm himself down, "A f-few things first. One, you look amazing. . ." pausing he'd then say, "But Masa. . .is this because you have feelings for me? Or are you doing this just to please me?" saying such, he couldn't help but let his eyes run all over her body, his mind running wild with ideas.* - Tue Oct 27 03:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) His eyes running clearly to the cleavage shown, he'd almost start to drool as he heard her talk, his eyes going back to her face, "R-Really? You aren't lying? I know it's obvious. . .but I love you too Masa." 

saying such, his heart would be pounding enough for his body to shake a bit. His mind going a million miles per hour.* - Tue Oct 27 03:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her hand, and catching sight of her cleavage again, hearing what she said his face would break out in a smile, "I'm so happy. . .more than I ever have been. I love you. . .too." saying such,  one of his free hands would move up to caress her face.* - Tue Oct 27 03:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her get close he'd say, "Too many things to say. . .what about you? Anything you'd want to do?" saying such he'd find himself staring at her, looking over her entirely.* - Tue Oct 27 03:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her move down, blood would already start to flood to it, making it to when she was pulling at them, it would only be part way erect yet, was already to the size of most average people, and still getting bigger when she got to it. "I-I see." watching as his heart was beating at a million miles per hour.* - Tue Oct 27 03:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her, he'd grasp the edge of the sheets, his excitement driving him a bit crazy. Watching as she removed his boxers, he'd almost start to drool. Feeling the girls breathe on it, he'd raise his back a bit in excitement. Then, thinking that it couldn't get any better, he'd feel her tongue on him. "M-Masa. . .how do you know this?" 

Saying such he'd reach down to towards her, looking for anything to grab onto.* - Tue Oct 27 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing what she had said about the book, he'd let a sigh of relief come over him as he was glad she hadn't done it to someone before, though he would have time to think about it anymore as he felt het lips come over the tip of him, which would be at its full length now, much larger than average.

When she started to move, would hand would instantly go to grasp the sheets again, the pleasure he was feeling starting to get to him. Though, only getting worse as she start to move her tongue around it.

Hearing her next statement he'd say, "You're too good at this. . ." moving his free hand down to her head, he wouldn't do anything with it, other than rest it there as he was enjoying himself too much already, "So sexy. . ." saying such as he simply looked down to her, his heart still beating at a ridiculous pace as he was getting to do something like this with the one he loved.* - Tue Oct 27 03:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her face he'd see the look she'd give. He'd simply keep his hand where it was, not putting any pressure on her unless she wanted it. Though, as she fit what she could into her mouth, he'd let out a sigh of pleasure out, fully enjoying the entire thing. Though, before she could fully come up to speak, he'd at least give it a small push, wanting to get a bit deeper, then removing his hand he'd say, "Sorry. . .I got caught up in it." though hearing what she said he'd say, "More than anything. . ." saying such he'd look down to her longingly, wanting her to enjoy the experiance as well.* - Tue Oct 27 03:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: 9fk - Tue Oct 27 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as she took the apron off, he'd find himself licking his lips a bit in anticipation. Watching as she moved around, he'd find her lower half in front of him. Wasting no time, he'd reach up and wrap his hands around her, pulling her lower half a little closer as he raised his head and start to dig in, licking what he could without forcing his tongue in, doing his best to tease her.

Enjoying the feel of him back in her mouth, he'd continue onward, proding his tongue in her a bit, running wild with his tongue on her.* - Tue Oct 27 04:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing her moan, it'd simply excite him more, taking it as a sign he was doing the correct thing. Continuing to do so, he'd grab ahold of her ass tightly, pulling her lower half closer to his mouth as he forced his tongue further  into her, running it around the best he could. 

Pulling free for a moment as he felt his balls being played with he'd say, "You're too good~" before going back to continue his work, while now starting to thrust his hips a bit, trying to get it as far into her mouth as he could, Masa's gentle touch driving him crazy.* - Tue Oct 27 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) feeling his tongue being basically squeezed to point he found it hard to move, he'd continue to try anyway, now using his hands to grab ahold of her, and using his thumbs to spread her open the best he could, trying to do anything he could to please her as he slowly pulling his tongue back out

Now licking around before moving onto her clit, which would likely be visible. Being that he had read plenty of dirty magazine about what to do, he'd add that to the things he'd be licking and ravaging with his mouth, though, when he wasn't licking it, one of his hands would go to it to rub and squeeze on it.

Probably getting a good ways in to the point he'd be in Masa's throat, pulling back out before thrusting one more time, almost finding himself at the breaking point.

* - Tue Oct 27 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing a few small sounds coming from her, he'd take that as a good sign, though his own pleasure would cause his breathing to be a bit heavy as they went on. Being that he was sure he was close, and he refused to end before Masa had felt more than good enough, he'd again force his tongue as far as he basically could into her, one hand pulling her lower half to him, and the other going to her clit to pinch it a bit hard, but not enough to the point it'd hurt.

As for the thrusting he was doing, being that he wasn't sure if he was hurting her, he'd lower his hips for a moment, giving her time to breathe and speak before he tried it again, though, he wasn't sure he'd be able to resist long, being that the fell of her mouth and throat, coupled with the sounds he had been hearing would keep repeating in his head, though he figured, it'd help him hang on a bit longer while he did his best for Masa.* - Tue Oct 27 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her lower half shake, he'd basically do what he could, running his tongue in and out trying to get as much as the liquid as he could, enjoying the pleasure he was giving Masa. Though, feeling Masa suddenly go back to pleasuring him, he'd feel himself on the edge now, no matter how much he was trying to hold back.

Slowly moving his hips to meet her, he'd feel himself about to blow, in which case he again attempt to force himself into her throat, thrusting his hips as hard as he could. Doing such, he'd suddenly spurt out a good amount of the white liquid straight down her throat before slowly lowering his hips back down to the bed, his mind blinded by pleasure.

Though about the time he himself would cum, he'd basically squeeze Masa's clit a but unintentionally harder than before, probably still not enough to hurt her,  while removing his tongue from her.
* - Tue Oct 27 04:52:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing her moan, He'd feel confident that he had pleased her just as well as she had him. He'd also realize that he'd have his mind in a bit of a daze, going every which way. Simply trying to catch his breath he'd lay back on the pillow and look down to Masa, "S-So good."

Though as he said this, he'd feel her move her head off and to the side, giving him one last lick, which he assumed was a tease towards him as he started to soften up again. Though, this leaving his mind as she turned around to lay beside him, he wrap his arms around her, not really knowing what to say, nor feeling like they needed to get dressed. 

Looking to her face he'd simply let a small laugh out, it was his fault she looked that way, and thus he'd grab the sheet and wipe her face lovingly for her, thinking that they needed to be washed anyway at some point. Though, he'd note how fast she'd fall asleep, to him it would seem she'd put all the effort in the world in to please him, which would leave him overjoyed and he held her even tighter, leaving no distance between them. Simply pulling the blacker up over them, he'd rest his head on the pillow, likely to fall asleep shortly after her.* - Tue Oct 27 05:06:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he sat waiting, he'd look around, curious to what to do while Masa slept. Shaking his head he'd simply walk over to his things, grabbing out a few pieces of metal. Looking them over he'd start to wonder about what he could make with the scraps that he had. Having a hard time of it, he'd simply shrug, thinking that he'd figure it out after he had gotten everything up to snuff. Setting the metal pieces back down he'd move over to the forge.

Slowly lighting it, now throwing in large amount of coal and other fuels, he'd close it slightly, trying to let it blaze up and build up the heat he required. While this was happening, he'd walk over to his tools, grabbing out what he needed, being a hammer, tongs of multiple sizes, some vices, and of course he'd then move to grab a hold of the metal he had set down. Once he had done this, he'd move to be back near the forge, setting everything he had grabbed down into his work space.

Thinking over what he wanted to make he'd slowly settle for a few different things, from figures, to jewelry. Starting first with a peice of metal he had decided would be for a bracelet, he'd grab it with the tongs, moving to the forge to open it open, and put it inside of it. Doing such, he'd simply bide his time while he waited for the metal to get hot enough to where it was glowing orange. Though, while he waited, he would quickly fill up a bucket of water, needing it shortly.

Reaching back in to grab the metal, he'd quickly move it over to his anvil, hammering it down to the shape of a rod. Taking quite a bit of time to do this, he'd get it to a long circular shape. Being that during this time it took to get it that way it'd start to cool, he'd quickly stick it back in for a moment, heating it back up to a temperature he'd be able to work it. Pulling it back out, he'd grab two tongs, grabbing each side as he began to twist it, giving it a swirling look in the center of the rod.

Once he had done this, he'd quickly take the two ends in, bending them to be like an oval shape to fit on someones wrist. Nodding, he'd quickly take a wedge and happen, and hammer the wedge in to cut off the excess. Once he had done this, he'd quickly squeeze the ends to be rounded balls with the tongs, being careful to keep his piece intact.

Dumping it into the water momentarily, he'd pull it back out and again condition it in the forge, pulling it back out as get a small metal looking pick. Using this and the hammer he would hammer in small ornate designs, making it somewhat unisex if for some reason a male would want it. Once he had done this he'd simply drop it into the water and pull it back out, setting it to the side for continued work later.

Moving on now he'd basically grab a large hunk of iron that used to be something that he had messed up on, and was now basically just a ball of hardened metal. Looking it over he'd come up with a pretty good idea he thought. Sticking it into the forge, he'd let it heat up and he got out a rag and a few liquid agents for the polishing process later. Also, he'd grab a few files out and such for grinding off any hard edges.

Once he had done this, he'd move back to the forge, grabbing out the hunk of iron. Using the tongs he'd stretch it a bit, making it a weird oval shape. Then, moving one half of it higher up, he'd round it off a bit like it was a circle conjoined to teh oval. Then, pulling out the other side of the oval, he'd make it come top a somewhat pointer end on said side. Once he had done this, he'd stick it back into the fire.

Heating it up again he'd pull of the metal, now going to the circular end, putting a point on one side of it a bit. Turing it over, he'd attempt to hammer it flat on said side. Putting it back into the fire once more he'd go to grab the pick. 

Pulling the metal back out, he'd use the hammer and pick to go to town on it, giving it eyes, a line around it's mouth, and feather like patterns on its side and tail. Once done, he'd drop it into the water before pulling it back out. Setting it to the side, he'd move to shut his forge off from air, killing the heat that would have been going inside of it, as it had no air to continue to burn.

Moving now with his file to the two items he had made, he'd get rid of any shapr edges, and fix any issues. Then, grabbing his rag, he'd polish then for a long amount of time as he wanted to be able to see his own reflection in the dark black metal. Once he was done he'd simply mumble, "I wonder if Masa would wear the bracelet." though he'd shake it off, being that he'd already given two things to her and he doubted she'd want it.* - Tue Oct 27 20:42:27 2015

Starring to the roof, he'd find himself lost in thought.* - Wed Oct 28 02:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Thanks. . . - Wed Oct 28 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm more comfortable when you're close and we're on good terms. - Wed Oct 28 02:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Resting his hands on his chest, he'd start to think, in deep thought as he asked, "Hey Masa. . .have you ever asked yourself what would have happened if something in you past changed? Like, what if I hadn't been a Smith?"

Simply spewing out the thoughts going through his head.* - Wed Oct 28 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: I'd still protect yo. - Wed Oct 28 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: How do you know? - Wed Oct 28 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Because you're still you. - Wed Oct 28 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: - - Wed Oct 28 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Masa. . . - Wed Oct 28 02:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Simply trailing off, being the softy that he really was, he'd have a stupid smile on his face, and being that he basically was a wuss, a small tear of joy would be in the corner of one of his eyes, "Look what you've done to me. . ."* - Wed Oct 28 02:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: What have I done? - Wed Oct 28 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Wiping the tear away, hopefully before she could see it he'd say, "N-Nothing Masa. . .just don't change."* - Wed Oct 28 02:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having gotten the mushiness out of his system, he'd shake his head, clearing the thoughts, and emotions, going back to a more serious, straight face. "Hey Masa, this is pervy, but . . ." he'd start to reach for her ass, though, stopping himself remembering what she'd said about hitting him before, he'd move to sit up.

If allowed, he'd reach forward, going to rubb her back, being careful to avoid the places where the scars were, and attempt to give her a massage.* - Wed Oct 28 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Smirking a bit he'd say, "Don't worry, I'm not strong enough to be rough with you, even if I wanted to be." saying such, he'd trace his fingers around her back, slowly and gently going over the scars, doing his best not to hurt her.

Having teased her enough with fingers, he'd start from her shoulders, putting his hands on them lightly, and starting, applying pressure gently as he massaged them. He'd then move down from there, running his hands slowly over her back, and bringing them back up to rest on her shoulder blades in her back, rubbing around them carefully. Simply hoping she'd enjoy it he'd say, "Tell me where feels the best." not ashamed to get help from her if he needed it. He'd already shown enough of his mushy side today, he needed to grow up.

In his mind he was a blacksmith anyway, so why not simply be like metal? A man, rough and ragid when it needs to be, but also soft and flexible. Thinking this, he'd start to aim to be this type of person, who could be whatever he needed to be, when he needed to be it.* - Wed Oct 28 03:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling the tension in her bag, and then the sigh she'd let lose, he'd nod, finding that he could at least to this for her, "Alright., excuse my hands. . ." saying such he'd literally work her back over in completeness, using his rather large hands, and even his own elbows to rub into Masa's back and relieve what tention that he could.

Moving down her back with these method, he'd simply get to her lower bach, and carefully push into it with his thumbs, massaging her the best he would with his own -torn, ragid hands- (Aka why he said excuse my hands) using his thumbs as his hands where around her to push into her back, "Anywhere else that needs to be massaged?"* - Wed Oct 28 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow he'd hand his hands still rested on her back, "Nothing else feels sore? Or uncomfortable?" saying such he'd run his hands down her back one more time, quite slowly.* - Wed Oct 28 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: My whole body is sore after today. - Wed Oct 28 03:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he'd say, "Why didn't you say so before? I could have been doing this everyday for you." saying such he'd pause and simply say with a chuckle, joking about it, "Well, I'll just have to massage your whole body. What's the next most sore part of your body?"* - Wed Oct 28 03:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head a bit, not having expected her to actually say such he'd say, "Here, take the bed, lay on your back."* - Wed Oct 28 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Knowing that Masa would hate him if he did anything perverted, he'd lay his hands on her well toned stomach, again, much like he had with her back, starting to rub, and massage it. Applying pressure with his thumbs, and running his hands up and down, he'd take it all the way towards her breast, but not getting close enough to touch them, and then all the way down to her pants hem, but not any lower, only rubbing everything in between, "Don't worry, I'm not feeling pervy right now. . .I just want to help you relax."* - Wed Oct 28 03:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her he'd say, "Not your legs too?" saying such, he'd again rub his hands over her, now going to the sides of her stomach, applying slight pressure to all of her as he went, "Don't take this in a perverted manor, But you know you are beautiful, right?" 

Saying such he'd look to her face, smirking a bit as he continued to work on her stomach, almost wanting to stare at her chest as he'd only seen them, and he'd imagine what they'd feel like, though, shaking the thought off, he'd calm himself down as he looked back to her stomach, applying pressure as he ran his fingers over her midsection.* - Wed Oct 28 03:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Coming to a stop, he'd rest his hands on her stomach. Simply leaving them there to look at her face, "You keep getting any more attractive and I might have to attack you one of these day." adding a laugh to the end, Masa after knowing him all this time would known it was a joke

Moving his hands back up and to the sides, continuing to massage her he'd say, "You should have told me about how you body felt years ago, I wouldn't have minded helping you. I'm not -all- pervert. I can resist most of the time."* - Wed Oct 28 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down to her lovingly he'd simply say, "Well, put your shirt back on and make room for me as well then." upon saying such, he'd wait for her to get dressed, and make room. To be honest he wasn't tired, but he had learned something recently. When he saw her asleep, he was happy enough to where he himself would knock right out.* - Wed Oct 28 03:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as she slid under the covers, he himself would move underneath, having already removed everything he needed to. Moving to lay next to her he'd say, "Hey Masa. . .I know you see this as perverted. . .but. ." pausing in hopes of her turning to face him, he'd try to go in to give her a quick kiss on the lips. 

If allowed to do such he'd go on to say, "Do you mind if I hold you while we sleep?" doing such if she said yes, and falling off to sleep.* - Wed Oct 28 03:49:07 2015
