Taking his time with this, he'd eventually make his way down to her shoulder blades, and back, using his elboe a bit if needed. Though, as he moved to her lower back, his eyes would lock on her butt, temptation running through him. Though, he had a bit of self control, and would simply ignore it, rubbing her back some more.* - Sun Nov 22 21:44:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd already make preperations to take the attack.

Quickly going through four seals, he'd attempt to run chakra to his arms, allowing his unique nature to take effect. His chakra, suddenly crystalizing on his arms and taking the shape of two long blades. Looking them over, he'd shrug a bit, curious to what he'd be able to come up with in the future.

Looking them over again, he'd start to swing them around a bit, trying to get the feel for them being on his arms. Once he had done such, he'd shrug a bit, suddenly letting them fall basically into nothingness, as the remains just dusted the floor, "Well, I'll need more work  for that."* - Mon Nov 23 23:14:46 2015

Thinking this over, he'd again go ahead and make four hand seals, thinking that he should practice. Once he had done so, making sure that he had done them correctly, he'd move onto chakra.

Closing his eyes, and forcing it to follow what he wanted, he'd send it to his arms, allowing crytal blades to suddenly form on the sides of his arms. Once he had done such, he'd shake his head, rubbing them together. Chuckling, he'd again let them disapate, no reason to have them out really, he just wanted to play around with them.* - Tue Nov 24 00:56:19 2015

"Someone wanna call these guys off before I had to do something about them?" asking such in a monotone voice he'd go on, "I need to make my way back to Konoha, it was stupid to leave." saying such, he'd keep his hands to his sides now, having moved them.* - Tue Nov 24 02:25:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) would have stepped off a caravan, stretching his legs a bit as he threw his hands into his pockets, and kept a pleasent face. Walking to the gate, he'd inform whoever it was that he wasnted access.* - Tue Nov 24 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, looking the person infront of him over, he'd think about his response for a second, unsure what he wanted to say. Once he had finally came to a choice, he'd remove his hands from his pockets he'd say, "I came from Kumo, though." pointing to his konoha headband he'd say, "I'm orignally form Konoha." saying such, he'd huff a bit, thinking.

"I came here because the Raikage seemed to dislike you. And I disliked Kumogakure. They were all a bunch of savage assholes, aside from a girl there. So I assumed this place must be the opposite. Thus, If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to join in." saying such as if it were normal everyday talk, he'd yawn slightly.* - Tue Nov 24 04:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow, he would have made handseals before he had left Kumo, and they were still in play if he needed them, as he had made sure to stay on alert as he followed the Mizu in.* - Tue Nov 24 04:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hmph. . .So you want to know why he doesn't like you? - Tue Nov 24 04:14:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd shake his head a bit, "Apparently the Raikage is upset over an attack that happened from one of your shinobi? I only know vague details." saying such he'd look around the place.

"I came from Konoha, an abandoned village. I went there, I hated it. From what I heard, they were part of Sunagakure. That only left this place." saying such, still keeping a lot to himself.* - Tue Nov 24 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh. . . - Tue Nov 24 04:20:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly he'd say, "The last time I made a choice right away, I almost got killed in Kumogakure for defending myself against one of its annoying shinobi who had threatened me."

Pausing he'd shake his head, "Can I at least know what sort of village you're running? Or how I'd fit in?"* - Tue Nov 24 04:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: I don't exactly care for family. . .Tch. - Tue Nov 24 04:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd mumble a bit, "That must be nice." though continuing he'd say, "What are the chances of me progressing then if I join you? Which, I may as well agree to doing, I've burnt all my other bridges."* - Tue Nov 24 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I want to end pointless violence. I can't exactly do that by beng weak. - Tue Nov 24 04:34:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, as he had seen enough violence in his life. It was true that he had a problem with viloence without reason, but he believed violence with reason such as trying to end the pointless violence of life.

"Then that is fine with me. . ." he'd then look to the table, a mix of emotions on his face.* - Tue Nov 24 04:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Combat prowess, while important, is not the most important thing about a new member of the village, especially considering the fact that you are not allowed to enter into combat within the village walls without my supervision for now.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: For now..You guys. come line up alongside me. Yumiko, you're not tired right? - Tue Nov 24 05:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Not sure, about to find out. - Tue Nov 24 05:31:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: .... - Tue Nov 24 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: If it's not known if he's in Fuuin or Gen..why am I being put in charge of him? - Tue Nov 24 05:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'm about to get my ass kicked aren't I? - Tue Nov 24 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Don't know. - Tue Nov 24 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: This guy is older than me...hmm. - Tue Nov 24 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Tell me. . .Yumiko? Do you use a sword? - Tue Nov 24 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: The individual isn't a Fuuinjutsu or Genjutsu User I'm sure, but he's on probation and you're the chuunin that I want assigned to him currently - Tue Nov 24 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slighly, he'd move across from her, "Well then, you'll likely win this fast I'd assume." saying such, he'd stand there somewhat loosely, his hands by his side, waiting. He had already done the seals for his only jutsu, and it wasn't a long ranged one, so he was somewhat hopeful that this would turn into a hand to hand fight.

"After you."* - Tue Nov 24 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: Yumiko has no chill...Like does she not know how to hold back? Hahah. - Tue Nov 24 05:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: You're not teaching him. Simply watching over him..Making sure he doesn't get into any trouble. - Tue Nov 24 05:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing the bow being raised, he'd already be on alert Shaking his head slightly, he'd sigh, "This is going to be a pain isn't it?" saying such, he'd simply pick up his focus, keeping track on when she released the arrow as he suddenly raised both of his hands. Controlling the chakra in his body, it would start to move to be on his arms, molding itself in the form of a blade on each arm. Though, as this happened, it would suddenly start to harden, actually taking the form of blue crystal blades on each arm, attached to them.

Looking to the arrow, he'd simply side step, avoiding it rather easily. Then, picking up his speed, he'd keep his eyes on her and the bow. Closing the gap between them, he'd have made his blades blunt for the sake of not wanting to kill anyone. If he could get to her, he'd aim to hit her rather hard with on blade on the hand, trying to get her to drop the bow, his other hand aiming to hit her ribs.* - Tue Nov 24 05:49:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Eh? Foul? - Tue Nov 24 06:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Watching as the kage suddenly showed up in front of him, taking the attack fromt the water jutsu, he'd stop, standing straight up, as he was a bit bummed now, "That's no fun. . .You know how long it took me to make this jutsu? I wanted to see how well it would hold up." saying such, he'd shrug a bit, crossing his arms as the blades stayed pressent.

Huffing a bit more, he'd shake his head, "Well, Whatever."* - Tue Nov 24 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Yumiko... - Tue Nov 24 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: Hmmm? - Tue Nov 24 06:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Never put your weapon down unless you want it used against you....Especially since you're still training with it. - Tue Nov 24 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: While your strategy was excellent...Top knotch even.... - Tue Nov 24 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: -Never- place your weapon on the ground.... - Tue Nov 24 06:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You don't even have a Novice level of skill with it... - Tue Nov 24 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You shouldn't be placing your weapon down...For anything. - Tue Nov 24 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: These kids don't play. . .I'll have to go off and make a few more inprovements with my crystal jutsu. . . - Tue Nov 24 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Let me show you something.... - Tue Nov 24 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: Guess we're done here. - Tue Nov 24 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd simply let the chakra that had made the blades fall into nothingness, simply being dust on the ground now.* - Tue Nov 24 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . . - Tue Nov 24 06:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: 3 Demerits equals immediate ejection from the village. - Tue Nov 24 06:19:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I simply want to gauge your abilities and then I'll place you for work. - Tue Nov 24 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Higashi, Nori(Shawn45) says: Hm. . - Tue Nov 24 06:21:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: By the way...Yumiko hold back a bit...You're sparring...Not in a deathmatch hun. - Tue Nov 24 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: Hmm..If he's an earth user then I'll begin by teaching him a bunch of Earth Jutsu. - Tue Nov 24 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: And wind *cough* -omit- - Tue Nov 24 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd say, "You've seen them. I spent my life on this. It's all I have right now." Though even as he said such, he'd suddenly start to go through four seals. Sighing as he did so being that he was really already over it. Once he had done so, he'd again let chakra flood to his arms, again making blades on his arms, like they materialized out of no where.

"Well, Let's start I guess." saying such, he'd suddenly move upwards, not trying to ger closer like what might had been assuemd he would. He'd simply try to get a bit of payback on the kage, making it so that if a jutsu was used on him, and he managed to avoid it, there was a chance it would hit either him or Nori.* - Tue Nov 24 06:24:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: ( she whom? ) - Tue Nov 24 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: (You missed my earlier statement when i explained in OOC. Nori.) - Tue Nov 24 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: Said she'd been asking for a while and no one responded. *shrug*) - Tue Nov 24 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) whispers: ( one cannot simply obtain a clan after creation. Espcially -this- far after. But I can ask. ) - Tue Nov 24 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: (Aye. I realize. But I heard Nina got Uchiha like..) - Tue Nov 24 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: (2 weeks after creation or something far like that.) - Tue Nov 24 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) whispers: (So I told her it was possible.) - Tue Nov 24 06:38:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Watching the girl move forward, and slam her hand into the ground, he'd know right away that something was up. Watching around him, he'd suddenly feel something start to rise from the ground below him, his eyes going a bit wide for a second, he'd quickly attempt to use the blades on his arms to block, and redirect the chains. If this was possible, he'd then attempt to Rush forward. Though, if the chains were to start to wrap around the blades when he went to deflect them, he'd just let them disconnect from his arms as he ran forward.

If everything went well to this point, he'd make the four seals as he ran forward again, trying to one more force chakra to his arms as the blades would again pop up. Though, again this would be all based off if he managed to get past the chain. Moving forward, with -blunt- blades as he wasn't aiming to suriously injure, he'd attempt to swipe the girl in the legs, hoping to knock her to the ground.

On the other side, if he was caught, he'd be caugh, unable to resist but so much.* - Tue Nov 24 06:41:55 2015
