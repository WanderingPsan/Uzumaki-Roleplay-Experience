<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing him say that he would be able to start the battle, he would quickly nod to him. Chuckling a bit he would say, "Well, I guess I'll start." saying such he would go through some hand seals that were basically second nature to him. Doing this, he would put some chakra he had built up into his hands.

Once he had done this, he would throw his hands to the ground, and in turn a line of fire would flow heading towards Taiga. Though, it would quickly turn and form a ring around him, not exactly doing any damage, but it may have been close enough for him to feel the heat, and get burned it he was to move in a wrong manor.

"As I said, I'm not too good, and my jutsu somewhat reflect that." shrugging a bit as he said this, he would ready himself for what Taiga would do, though he hoped he had blocked a few options he may have had before.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Having expected an easy spar that would go back and forth, he wasn't ready at all for what came next, he would have thought that maybe he would have gone with something else, but, he hadn't expected him to use a fire jutsu as well. Somewhat panicked over the whole thing, he would only be able to attempt to jump to the side, though in all likelyness, the flame would still catch his back, burning him.

Being that this was his first actual fight, he would basically fall from the shock of the burn, never even having felt pain like this before.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Listening to the man's praise, that he basically took as another strike at his pride, he would quickly move to a sitting position. A bit of anger coming to the surface over another loss, he would quickly make a few hand seals.

While doing this, he would pool together what wind chakra that he could manage with the feeling of pain he had from the burns. Once he had done this, he would quickly spread it out around him, which Taiga would likely see. Once he had done this he would quickly say, "Please back off, I lost. I'm not very good at losing and then having the person be as nice as you're being right now." saying it less out of anger towards Taiga, and more out of anger at himself, he would hold his jutsu at the ready if he felt Taiga was too close.* - Sun Sep 27 00:34:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Eh? - Wed Sep 30 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Alright. - Wed Sep 30 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: It's an easy mission. - Wed Sep 30 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing after hearing what Taiga had said, he first instinct would be to want to complain, though thinking back to what the kazekage had said, he knew of he did, or just decided to not do it, he would be killed. Thinking about this he would quickly say, "Alright give me one moment. I'm going to grab some things." saying such he would quickly walk off into the distance. After a few minutes had passed, he would return with a shovel, and a cart, almost if he had got them magically.

Nodding to Taiga when he had returned he would say, "Time to start." chuckling after saying this he would then go on to say, "I'll be back, I'm going to get some dirt from nearby." saying such he would then again walk off with his shovel and cart. Arriving at a what seemed to be a nearby disposal area for dirt, he would quickly start to shovel it into the cart, filling it up the best to his abilities. Getting to the point to where the cart was filled, he would quickly wipe his brow of sweat, already feeling a bit tired from the whole thing.

Having filled the cart he would make his way back once again. Coming to the hole he would look at it a bit quizmatically. He knew that it would be easier to simply dump the cart into the hole to fill it up, but he decided that shoveling it back out of the cart and into the hole would be a good means to build a bit of upper body strength. So, this thoughts having entered his mind, he would quickly start to do so, putting shovel-full after shovel-full of dirt into the hole. Once he had gotten to the point of where the cart was running low, he would realize that the hole was still only about half full. Shaking his head at this fact he would say, "Guess I'll be back one more time."

Having said such to Taiga he would quickly walk off again to the same dirt pit. Once more starting to fill the cart up, he would find himself to be a bit tired, though not much being that he had always been full of energy ever since he was a child. Shaking what bit of fatigue he felt away, he would quickly finish filling the cart, he would quickly pull it back to the hole. Again shoveling it into the now semi-full hole, he would finish it up within a few moments. Patting the dirt down, he would quickly put the shovel back into the cart and wheel it back to where he had found it. 

Once he had put everything back a way, and found his way back to Taiga he would say, "All done."* - Wed Sep 30 22:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Alright let's go. - Wed Sep 30 22:10:46 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Hm, what to do now. . . - Wed Sep 30 22:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit after having just finished the mission that he had been assigned, he would quickly make his way back with Taiga. Upon having made his way back, he would quickly find a good spot in the area to sit. Upon doing so, he would look around quickly in a bag he happened to be carrying. Once he had found what he was looking for, he would quickly unroll it, and start to read away, ignoring the now obvious spots that Taiga had said he had underlined. Hoping to learn the technique 'hidden' in the words, he would continue to read for the time being until he had something else to do.* - Wed Sep 30 22:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Is there anything you want us to do sir? - Wed Sep 30 22:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Oh right Tetsu. - Wed Sep 30 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: See that blue haired guy. - Wed Sep 30 22:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: He'd be a good sparring partner for you. - Wed Sep 30 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Oh? - Wed Sep 30 22:22:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Having read for a bit of time, he would look up for a quick moment, glancing between everyone. Though upon seeing that there really wasn't anything happening yet, he would quickly look back down to his scroll. Glancing through the section that he had been on before, he would take note of all of the things he had ignored before, being Taiga's underlined portion. Now that he had gotten a bit of understanding, he now could look at the underlined portions, finding even more help from that. Continuing to read as he heard Taiga talk he would say, "One moment, almost at a good stopping point and I'll ask him to." saying such he would quickly ready to the end of the line, basically by this point having a pretty good idea of the whole thing.* - Wed Sep 30 22:23:34 2015
