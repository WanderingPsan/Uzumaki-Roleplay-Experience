<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) sighing, looking around, he'd catch sight of what seemed to be a blonde haired girl in the area. Leaning against the kage statue, he'd say in a lacking tone, "Hey there. . .sup?" his mind was obviously somewhere else even while he spoke.* - Sat Nov 28 03:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Ignoring her sharp tone and glare, he'd simply speak, "I was just trying to make conversation. Chill. . ." though turning to look to the ground he'd mumble, "Everyone is jumpping on me lately." likely not loud enough for Asteroth to hear, she'd shake his head and look back up.

"Sorry If I bothered you, no need to get harsh." it was obvious he was down on his luck in life, usually he would have jumpped right back down her throat if it was any other day.* - Sat Nov 28 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow he'd shake his head slightly, "At the moment? Everything. Though here recently I potentially ruined a bystanders life, and ended up owing someone a favor who I don't wanna owe." shaking his head slightly, he'd brush away his depression, his face falling back to its usual blank look.

"So, Who're you?" saying such now in a level tone he'd tilt his head to the side a bit. As if he had changed, and no longer cared, even though below the surface he was in severe depression.* - Sat Nov 28 03:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Having caught sight of movement out of the corner of his eye, he'd be distracted by the people walking by. Turning his attention to them he'd quickly speak up, "Uh, excuse me, are you two going to be here for some time? I'm tyring to get to know everyone who is around here." saying such, he'd look them both over, trying to keep his attention balanced between everyone here.* - Sat Nov 28 04:04:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, suddenly losing everyone's attention, he'd shrug, "Well, no one wants to talk? I see how it is." though, as he said such, he'd already be moving to walk away as well.* - Sat Nov 28 04:09:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I had to answer a question. He asked where Suna kept its jutsu scrolls. I didn't know. If I had gotten it right, he would have helped the girl. If I got it wrong, I owed him. - Sat Nov 28 04:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Depression set in I guess. - Sat Nov 28 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What will you do now? - Sat Nov 28 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd speak out, "Unsure. I've been traveling around village to village." shrugging slightly, he'd rub his face, trying to push his depression down. 

"It's quite rude to act as if you care by the way." pausing he'd quickly interject, "And I'm only submissive when it doesn't matter." saying such he'd begin to walk by her, rubbing his neck slightly.* - Sat Nov 28 04:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Turning back to Asteroth, he'd raise an eyebrow, "Okay smartass. Don't believe me." though even as he said such, he'd turn his back to her and start to walk off away, forming two quick handseals and then placing his hands into his pockets, ready incase he needed them, he was a careful person usually.

Shaking his head as he went he'd simply mumble, "I need to go back to not caring about people. All of my issues would be fixed."* - Sat Nov 28 04:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Turning towards her, he'd shake his head, "Sway your opinion? Perhaps I just wanted to show off to a pretty girl?" saying such, he'd quickly let his chakra flare, pushing it through his body and into his feet. Then, letting it go from his feet and into the ground, the earth that it came in contact with would suddenly change form and structure.

As if it would form out of nowhere, a giant pink crystal dragon would appear from the ground, rising up and wrapping around him body protectively.* - Sat Nov 28 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her as she moved around him and his creation, he'd make sure that she wasn't trying anything, as most people took this as an act of aggression whenever he had done it in the past, "I'd think so. It took years." saying such, he'd chuckle a bit. 

"I'm currently working towards making multiple of them."* - Sat Nov 28 05:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her hand on his face, his eyes would go wide as he blushed. He was unsure on how to react or feel at the moment. Trying to avoid eye contact, he'd speak up, "I try not to reveal my hand to people if I don't have to." pausing, trying to maintain control on his dragon, being if he lost focus it'd srop.

"Plus. . .I've learned never to underestimate people. If he said he would find me, I take that as a threat, and thus he must have been confident enough in his abilities to make the threat."

Still embarrassed about her being so close he'd mumble, "Plus. . .it takes more chakra to maintain my abilities than normal jutsu. . .it's a struggle."* - Sat Nov 28 05:26:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) looking back to her slightly, Being that Asteroth was looking his face over, she'd catch sight of a few scars, and bright, strong purple eyes.

Having his face pulled up, he'd look into her eyes. Blushing by how close she was, and feeling her breath on him, this, followed by what she had to say, he'd gulp a bit, looking back to her, trying to keep his composure. "I g-guess that's true. What do you mean you'd like to see more. . ."

Keeping eyecontact now, he'd notice the look, and find himself caught in it, "You're quite attractive. . .aren't you." saying such, the dragon, still out, would wrap itself around him protectively, aiming to cover sight up to his stomach.

"I'm afraid. . .u-uh I'll fall for that beauty and those words." saying such blantently, he'd follow it with, "Though, it wouldn't be the first time someone would use that against me." coughing a bit, trying to cover himself with these words, it would already be obvious he fancied her a bit.* - Sat Nov 28 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head at the fact she was so self absorbed to assume she was perfect, he'd chuckle a bit, "Demonstrate what?" Though, even as he asked such, his dragon would move to allow him to stand on its back to ride it.

His eyes this entire time would be drawn to her body and face. While it was true it left little to the imagination, he almost wanted to see under it. Though, shaking these thoughts off, he'd force himself to remember his old conclusion, <Looks are only half of it. .don't let her use you. . .right?> having these thoughts he'd look down to her from his dragon.

"Lead the way."* - Sat Nov 28 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her hips more than he should, he'd be riding on top his dragon, keeping it at the ready in case it was needed. Following on it, he'd eventually arrive at the water behind her. Watching her sit, and put her feet into the water, he'd let a small laugh out.

"I may have potentail, but I lack many more abilities. I could perhaps tell you them and the general description of what I use them for, but as I said. . .this one dragon uses more chakra than I'd like. . if I do much more I won't be able to stay awake." saying such, he'd look to her playfully, still trying to resist her charm.* - Sat Nov 28 06:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Glaring to her he'd say, "I don't see why you'd be inclined to do so." his attraction towards her dying when she basically pointed out that he had nothing more to show. Shaking his head somewhat he'd say, I can only do two other things. Form blades, and then a simple earth jutsu to make a flow of mud."

Huffung a bit, obviously getting defensive being that his dragon would curl up around him like a snake once more he'd say, "I'm sorry I'm so unimpressive. My special chakra release is more work than you'd think." basically spitting the last sentence at her, he'd continue to glare.* - Sat Nov 28 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Not being able to keep up with her speed, his eyes would go a bit wide as she appeared infront of him. Feeling both her hands on his shirt, pulling him forward from his dragon, and close to her face, he'd smile a small bit. "You shouldn't let me be this close, I might get a wild hair and want to kiss you~" chuckling a small bit as she grinned.

Hearing her next line though, he'd blush a small bit before again following it by as laugh as she leaned back, he was used to people being in his face, but not beautiful people. "Like me? I'm just a normal person with a unique ability. It's the ability you like, not me." saying such playfully he'd say, "Plus, regardless if you want to grow closer to me or not, you put out the aire of someone important. Which, I don't like being below others. I prefer equal grounds." saying such as a joke, he'd manipulate the dragons head to be close down beside them.* - Sat Nov 28 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slowly, "I guess it would, wouldn't it." Hearing her say that she was going to head home, he'd simply call out, "If you want someone to keep you company, I could come with you~" saying such teasing;y, not even expecting a reply, he'd also add, "I mean, how am I meant to find you later?"

Shaking his head, letting his joking die, he'd shove his hands into his pockets and be a bit more serious, "I'd be happy with Tea. Thank you for taking this time. It helped me more than you'll know."

Of course, unless she took his joke seriously, he'd watch her figure closely, shaking his head wishing he'd be able to go with her.* - Sat Nov 28 08:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Quickly forming two hand seals as the boy approached Asteroth, he'd start to build up chakra in his body and would eventually expell it into the ground. Once he had done so, he'd allow the matieral to change over by reacting with his chakra and in turn, a giant crystal-pink dragon would rise up from the ground and move to be between Asteroth and the boy, "Don't touch her."* - Sun Nov 29 03:35:28 2015

Thus, rising out of the ground underneath him, and allowing himself to stand on top of it, he'd look down to Takuma as it was a rather large beast, "I used this to put a wall around Asteroth.
