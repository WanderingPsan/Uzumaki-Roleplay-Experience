<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Though that might be a ways down the road. - Fri Sep 25 21:27:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right. - Fri Sep 25 21:29:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Tell him to come find meeee. - Fri Sep 25 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: Um, will do? - Fri Sep 25 21:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow at her statement, he would simply chuckle, "Will do, but as I said, I can't exactly keep up, so if I fall from the strain, you'll help me out right? haha." obviously kidding about the help part, he would simply shrug and walk a few paces to the side.

Starting to go through some hand seals somewhat carefully, as he was still getting used to the jutsu, he would take a few deep breaths. Quickly build up chakra before applying, and releasing it in the air in a spherical area around him. While doing this, the air around him would move at high speed, basically acting like a shield in all directions for him.* - Fri Sep 25 21:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: And if I'm prod?0 - Fri Sep 25 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit having shown off his jutsu and gotten zero response from Kohaku, he would simply shrug. He figured that she must not have been impressed with it. So, in turn he would say, "Guess I'ma head out and practice somewhere else then.* - Fri Sep 25 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Bye. - Fri Sep 25 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit, having walked a ways away to what appeared to be a waterfall, he would stop. Stretching quite a bit he would crack his knuckles. Already having rested quite a bit, he would start with his hand seals once more. Slowly going through it, doing his best not to mess them up, he would start to build up chakra once he had finished them.

Building the chakra up, he would focus it and extend it outwards to a spherical area around him. Once it was spread in the thickness he wanted it, he would then put it into motion. The chakra, being wind in nature would mix with the air around him. This in turn start in motion the actual jutsu.

The air around him would begin to spin at high speeds. Making him basically safe from all attacks if there was one to come. Though, once it was over, it would leave him extremely out of it, as, he didn't exactly have the chakra to use the technique in such a sloppy way that he had been.* - Fri Sep 25 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Once more, having taken a break after using his jutsu, he would chuckle a tad bit. He was actually getting into practicing his jutsu, and training. He now understood why everyone else was always doing it. So in turn, he would stand up, and of course get back to it. Once more starting his hand seals, he would stumble across them a bit before stopping, and starting over again. Getting it right this time, he would again build up chakra.

Once it had built up to the right amount, he would again, mix it with the air around him. Actually going with the jutsu now, the wind chakra would begin to spin around him at high speeds, likely fast enough to stop any Ninjutsu and Taijutsu that hopefully, anyone on par, or lower than him would be able to use. Once he was again done with the move, he of course be basically out of energy, though a quick rest would basically fix this.* - Fri Sep 25 22:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Having practiced quite a lot for the time being, he would Make his way up the mountain behind him, being that he thought he heard a small bit of noise. Making his way up he would catch sight of a girl standing at the top. 

Somewhat curious he would stand to the side, watching. Only speaking up after a bit of time he would say, "So, what are you up to?"* - Fri Sep 25 22:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow he would say, "Without anyone to teach you? Isn't that a bit hard?" asking such he would rub the back of his neck a bit. Saying such he would pause for a moment before saying, "Well, I guess everyone has their reasons, or lacks someone to teach them."* - Fri Sep 25 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Chuckling a bit he would simply step back a bit, "Well, don't mind me, I'll just be practicing my jutsu, you go ahead and get back to it. Saying such he would move towards the edge of the mountain, and if to affirm what he had said, he would begin to make a few hand seals. Going through this process slowly though, he would sigh as the slowness basically annoyed him.

Once he was done with them, he would lean down and place his hands on the ground as rings of fire would go forward. Lighting up the side of the mountain with fire, he would smirk a bit. He wasn't yet good with the jutsu, so the flames went out quickly, but he was happy. He was needed to get better with the jutsu, though he was just happy to be able to use it.* - Fri Sep 25 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Having used his jutsu, and rested from it a bit, he would hop back to his feet, ready to go again, as he thought that there was a large rush to improve his skills. So in turn he would go through the same process again. Making a few hand seals he would focus his chakra. Once he was happy with the amount he had gained, he would again put his hands to the ground. Releasing it outward.

Once he had done this, fire again would streak the hillside. Trying to enjoy himself a bit, he would test himself. Making a larger circle, with smaller ones inside and on and on, much like a bullseye. Though, only making it to two rings, he would start to sweat. The amount of chakra he had, and the amount needed to do what he wanted to do was too demanding. So in turn, he would let it die, and sit back to the ground simply shaking his head.* - Fri Sep 25 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking himself from the strain practing the jutsu had put on him, he would force himself back to his feet. He was determind to get farther with this jutsu than he had before, which would simply mean that he would have to be able to hold it longer than he had been. So, again he would drone on like a machine, going through the process he normally would go through. Hand seals, to holding his chakra at the ready.

Compressing it, he would again put his hands to the ground, forcing his chakra out, and making it run down the mountain, though this time he would make it jump, leaving the mountain completely. moving into the sky, and ring of fire would form. Flying through the air for a moment, it would quickly disperse, being that the transition from ground to air was a bit much for him. Sighing at this fact he would stand and kick the ground a bit, "Tch, I need to get better."* - Fri Sep 25 23:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, again getting back to his feet after a bit of a break, he would stretch out. He was beginning to tire of this whole training thing, though he guessed he should continue on with it and get as far as he could before calling it quits for the day. So in turn he would go throught the whole thing again, though this time he planned to start off with it being in the air. So, going through the hand seals, he would sigh, compressing and readying his chakra.

Looking to the sky, he would hold his hands up, releasing his chakra out of them, a ring of fire would form, getting a bit larger and moving quite fast in a straight line in the air before disapating. This all putting a strain on him, he would wipe his brow and shrug a bit. He assumed he was making progress, because from what he could tell, he had to use less chakra to intiate the jutsu that he had when he started training.* - Fri Sep 25 23:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: 9atm - Fri Sep 25 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: This terrible.. This will take forever to to learn - Fri Sep 25 23:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: You'll be fine. - Fri Sep 25 23:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Thats what you say... - Sat Sep 26 00:08:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing as he heard the girl talk about how it would be impossible for her to learn a new elemental power, he would simply shrug to her, as he wouldn't be able to help her in any way. Yet, he could help himself by progressing with his fire jutsu. So in turn he would do what he had now done many time before. Starting his hand seals he would do them this time with less strain, and now with a certain quickness to them.

Pooling his chakra to his hands he would smirk, ready to do the jutsu again. Reaching to the sky he would release the fire from his hands into the air. One massive one which he would focus to try and keep there. Then, he would follow it by a quick attempt to launch another one inside of the previous one. Though, as the second one reached into the sky, the first one would disapate as the focus on the second one was too great.

Sighing at this, he would wipe the sweat from his brow. Having let the second one disapate as the first one had before it. Chuckling a bit he would turn back and say, "If I can put this much effort into training, you can learn that element." Saying such he would quickly sit down and try and get his chakra back up.* - Sat Sep 26 00:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Again, deciding that he needed to practice a bit more he would stand to his feet and look around. They girl behind him had gotten a bit quiet, and his figured that perhaps she needed some rest, so in turn he would walk back down to where the water would pool up. Upon getting there he would start to go through the hand seals that he had become used to doing.

Coming to the end of them, he would apply the chakra again towards his hands as he looked to the pool of water. Bringing his hands to the ground he would aim for the fire to run towards the water. Streaming forward to where it would circle over the water, it would quickly be put out as it hit the edge of the water.

He had aimed it at the water, being that all around him was grass, and it seemed pointless to burn up the landscape anymore than it already was in this area. Though, shaking these thoughts from his head, he would quickly nod. He thought that it would be enough training of the jutsu for the time being, and such, he would wipe the swear from his brow, throw his hands in his pockets, and walk off.* - Sat Sep 26 00:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, having spotted a few people, but being shunned off, he would shake his head. He came to the conclusion that even though he had said he wouldn't train anymore today, he would quickly change his mind as people were starting to annoy him now. Though looking around to where he had come to now, he would come to another conclusion, this would be a fine place to make some funny art.

Thinking this, he would quickly take a few steps back and start to go through hand seals that seemed like second nature. Coming to a close with them, he would quickly apply chakra to his hands. Putting them to the ground he would quickly let fire run forward, forming a large circle of burn marks on the ground, being that he had let the fire die fast.

Doing this once more, he would go on to use the jutsu to make two eyes on the larger circle. And being that he had somehow gained a larger pool of chakra, this all seemed like a regular day to him, without putting much strain on his body. So once he was done buring in eyes, he would quickly walk to where a mouth would be, and used his foot to drag a line as a mouth. Happy with himself at this, he would chuckle a bit and say, "A good use of a jutsu if you ask me."* - Sat Sep 26 00:54:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Get wrecked. - Sat Sep 26 01:33:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as Sanoke just had some killer lines laid on his ass, he would glance at Kohaku and smirk a bit. She may say that all she does, or wants to do is train, but to spit lines like that she most definetly must be some fun if she took the time away from training. Though shaking this thought out of his head he would quickly go back to what he was originally going to do when he had moved a few paces over.

Staying seated, he would slowly begin to go through some hand seals, taking the time to make sure they were all correct. While at the same time he was doing this, he would also be building up a rather large amount of wind chakra inside of his body. Then, while coming to the end of both he would release it out into a spherical area around him. Being that he still wasn't good at this technique it would still take a bit of time to do this of course.

Snapping back to reality after thinking about how slow he was with the jutsu he would quickly finish it as the actual jutsu came into motion and the air around him would rotate at high speeds, fast enought to block Taijutsu, or Ninjutsu depending on the strength of the attack, though enough to likely be causing a bit of a breeze for Sanoke and Kohaku, even though he had moved a few paces away.* - Sat Sep 26 01:40:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Mmm..Why dinner? - Sat Sep 26 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Why not? If you guys want, we can just do something else. - Sat Sep 26 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'm not hungry. - Sat Sep 26 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm. . . What about a game of dice? - Sat Sep 26 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Dice..? - Sat Sep 26 01:53:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Yeah. Meaning gambling. - Sat Sep 26 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Sure I guess. - Sat Sep 26 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: What're we gambling? - Sat Sep 26 01:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: I'unno. Put a wager. - Sat Sep 26 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: If I win, you strip. - Sat Sep 26 01:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as they two again continued to bicker back and forth about what to do, he would simply raise an eyebrow and he would decide to try something a bit stupid. Going through a set of hand seals that seemed like second nature to him, he would quickly apply chakra towards his hands. Slamming his hands down infron of him, a line of fire would spring forward and then turn to circle him. Putting enough chakra forward to where it would burn for a bit without going out, though as he was about to go onto do another jutsu the idea of gambling came up, his former idea would quickly die out as he was suddenly interested, the fire infront of him going out as well, speaking up he would say, "It'll have to be an interesting wager."* - Sat Sep 26 01:57:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Because you should. - Sat Sep 26 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .That logic is intense and all buuut. . . - Sat Sep 26 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Being as Kohaku had moved towards him, he would stand and take a few steps back, towards the water, "Not exactly a good enough reason."* - Sat Sep 26 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Hmph. - Sat Sep 26 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Right well. - Sat Sep 26 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: I'll just have to beat it out of you. - Sat Sep 26 02:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: One moment, Sanoke. - Sat Sep 26 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing the words of the girl, he would quickly stall, "Alright alright, I'll teach you. Though for starters, you have to close your eyes and turn around while I ah. . .get ready." saying such he would hope that she would believe him, because if so, he would most definetly turn towards the water, attempt to jump in, and swim away.* - Sat Sep 26 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Uh-huh.. - Sat Sep 26 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Okay. - Sat Sep 26 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Seeing the clone, he would basically walk towards the water. Upon getting to the edge, he would stand just close enought to Kohaku's clone to where his next move would help him out. 

Slowly making a few hand seals, he would again get his wind chakra straight inside of his body. Pushing it outward to where Kohaku's clone would be in distance of being hit by it, he would quickly inact his jutsu, letting the air around him blaze to life, moving extremely fast, and most likely throwing the clone back a distance.

If this was sucessful, it was likely he'd be tired, but he would still have enough enegry to jump in and swim away, which he would attempt.* - Sat Sep 26 02:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as everyone around was basically being dead quiet. Deciding to take this time to work on things, he would walk down a few paces. Getting to where he wanted to be, he would slowly start to work on a few hand seals. Taking his time to make sure that he had gotten them all right, he would at the same time build up a small store of wind chakra.

Once he was content with both, he would slowly release the chakra out around him to make a spherical shape with it. When it had gotten to the point he wanted it, he would start to inact it. The chakra mixing in with the air around him, it would start to spin around him at high speeds, forming into a literal sphere of wind around him.

The wind from this technique likely blowing a bit of dirt towards the others, "Sorry." saying such as a precaution, he would sigh a bit and wipe the sweat that would have formed on his forehead. Doing this he would then look around a bit, hoping that he in fact hadn't bothered too many people.* - Sat Sep 26 05:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, being that there seemed to be some issues going on centered around the black haired girl, and thus, being that he didn't exactly want to listen to bickering. 

Thinking this, he would in turn throw his hands in his pockets, thinking next, that now probably wasn't a good time to ask someone to train with him. Thus, he would begin to walk off, thinking of a few different places that he could perhaps get in some training alone.* - Sat Sep 26 16:38:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he had finally made his way away from all of the other people and the drama they had going on, he would look around. Having come back to his usual training spot, he would check to make sure that no one was around before moving to sit on the ground, it's not like that was part of the jutsu, it just made it easier for him.

Breathing deeply, he would start to go through the hand seals. Though, while he went over them quite calmly, he would also be building wind chakra up inside of his body. Once he had finished with both he would nod a bit and he expelled the chakra from his body, letting it surround him in a spherical manor. Once he had done this, the chakra would mix in with the air surrounding him, and start to spin at highspeeds, making a physical wall of wind around him in all directions.

Once he had let the jutsu come to an end, he would wipe his brow a bit, being that he still needed to advance the jutsu further, and refine it so that he would be able tp preform the same technique without all of the chakra he was having to use at the current time to make it work. Thinking such he would sigh again and rise to his feet, he figured that perhaps if he walked back now, the bickering would be done with.* - Sat Sep 26 16:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing, having forced himself back to his training spot after the whole nagging incident still taking place, he would again check around to make sure he was in the clear. Once he was sure that he was he would stretch a bit more before again sitting back down, making him think that the stretching part he had just done was kind of pointless.

Shaking himself from those thoughts, he would again go back to what he had been doing before. The same process somewhat boring for him, he would go through the hand seals while building up his wind chakra. Once he was content he would go about the process to spread it into the air around him rather faster than usual.

Somewhat rushing it, he would quickly inact his jutsu. Though as the air started to rotate around him, the spherical shape that would normally be there, would suddenly falter and disperse. It would seem that he had rushed it too much for the level of mastery over the jutsu. Shaking his head at this fact, he would basically hold his hand to his forehead and speak aloud to himself, "Slow, Calm, don't rush." 

Having said such, he would quickly go through the process again, taking his time. And thus, the jutsu would start and work out correctly this time, the sphere holding its shape til the end. Though once he was done, he would fall back onto the ground and lay. The only thing that he could think of was the fact the training was going way to slow, and that training alone was probably one of the most depressing things he had ever known.* - Sat Sep 26 17:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kang Tetsu(Chaos Commander2015) Pulling himself from his little depressing episode, he would walk to the side of the pool of water, quickly leaning over and splashing some in his face to get his mind straight. Shaking his head he would only sigh as he thought of the few people he had actually talked to, and if one of them would train with him. Shaking this thought away, he would again look back to the water, getting an idea.

Moving to one of the shallower parts of the pool, he would stand in ankle deep water. Smirking to himself, he figured he'd water the grass or something, at least give himself a small objective that wasn't just training. So with this in mind, he would be standing there as he began to go through the hand seals. Building up chakra as well at the same time obviously, he would quickly nod when he was done.

Letting the chakra flow outward, he would happily, and quite skillfully at this point, initate the jutsu as the air around him started to flow at high speed, kicking up the water that was around his feet in three-hundred and sixty degrees. Basically, watering the ground all around him. Keeping this up as long as he could, he would chuckle a bit before letting it end.

Being that he had basically ended any fun he'd be able to even try and get from practicing jutsu at this point, he would head back, and if the bickering was still going on, he'd just ignore it.* - Sat Sep 26 17:07:50 2015
