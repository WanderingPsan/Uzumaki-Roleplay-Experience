<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Fine. - Fri Oct 30 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright. - Fri Oct 30 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing looking about, having stayed awake all night, he'd sigh. He knew he needed to work on his smithing skills, and thus he'd walk over to his forge, starting it up the same as he normally would. Looking it over, he'd make sure everything was in place before he went on to other things. Nodding, feeling that it should be fine, he'd walk and get his usual tools and materials, again setting it all around hi forge in easy reaching distance if need be. Though, one he had done this, he'd scout through his materials, unsure about what he wanted to make, or if it even mattered if he made them. Shaking this thought off, he'd simply bring the materials to him, thinking that perhaps he'd just make simple shinobi tools for the time being. Nodding his head at this, he'd get started on the process.

Picking one of the smaller pieces of metal out, he'd grab it with a pair of tongs, moving to the entrance of the forge. Sticking it in, he's let it heat up for a long time, until the metal was a white hot color. Pulling the metal out, he'd look it over, grabbing his hammer and putting the metal to the forge. Hammering the hunk of iron out, he'd flatten it almost, leaving a good amount of width to it. Taking a rather long time to do this, he'd want it to the perfect thickness, and thus he'd continue onward. Once he'd have it to the right thickness, he'd again stick it back into the forge, heating it again up to a high enough temperature to where he'd be able to work on it, again causing him to have a wait for it to get to a certain heat. 

Once the metal had been heated, he'd pull it back out again; ready to continue to work on it. Setting it onto the anvil, he'd take a wedge, and put it to the metal, hammering into it to cut off chunks of metal. Doing this, he'd cut it into the shape of a shuriken, though, of course, it's only be the rough outline of it, as he'd still need to sharpen it and so on. Then, moving forward he'd grab a pick, putting it to the middle of the metal, and then hammering it through, he'd make a hole right through the middle, making it usable for string or other materials. Once he had done this, he'd take the now shaped up metal and dump it into the water, getting his other tools to sharpen, and make the shuriken usable.

Pulling it back out of the water, he'd look it over, moving to set it on the anvil. Once he had done this, he'd test it to make sure it wasn't still hot. Content that he could handle it with his hands, he'd pick it up with one hand, taking a file in the other. Using the file, he'd first work on the hole in the middle, shaving away any rough edges it may have. Then, skipping where the tool was going to be sharp, he'd move over the entire small tool, making it safe for the user, and more aerodynamic. Nodding once he had done this, he'd move on, taking a special tool at he looked at the edges of the shuriken. Thinking about it, he'd simply shrug, figuring he had to do it.

Looking it over, he'd take the tool to the eight edges of the shuriken, grinding and filing it down to sharp edges. Making it as sharp as he possible could, and making the four points deadly. Doing this, he'd look it over, noting that he had finished a single shuriken. Thinking it over he'd likely go through this long process again, about nine more times, working to create a stack of ten of these, simply to try and sell to the local merchants, nodding at this thought, he'd set them all to the side, thinking about what he wanted to make next, pulling a few more pieces of metal out of the scraps he had, two more weapons in mind for him to make.

Pulling another piece of metal out, he'd look it over, nodding at it, before grabbing yet another one, a small bar of iron. Sticking both into the forge, he'd again wait a good amount of time, thinking over what he wanted to do with everything once he had made them. Shaking this off, he'd check, looking for the metal to be white hot. Acknowledging that it was, he'd pull it out, moving it to the anvil so that he'd be able to work on it. Looking to the two, he'd put the bar portion underneath the other chunk of metal, hammering the two together so that they'd be one piece.

Being that he had attached the two pieces of metal together, he'd now stick them back into the forge, letting them gain more heat. Once he was sure he'd be able to work on them again, he'd pull them out of the forge, again sitting them on the anvil. Taking the hammer to it, he'd start to hammer away to flatten it just a bit, not a lot thought being that he planned to make it into a Kunai. Thus, once he had it to the thickness that he wanted, he'd nod. Though, this process having taken longer than he thought it would have he would of course have to put it back into the forge, again starting to let it heat up.

Once more pulling it out of the force and setting it onto the anvil, he'd grab his wedge tool again, putting it against the metal in front of him, and starting to hammer down onto it, cutting away the excess metal as he had no need for it. Once he had done this, he'd look to the bar that he had attached to it. Grabbing it with a pair of tongs, he'd start to bend it into a circle, forming the loop for explosive tags and such to be attacked. Doing this, the overall shape of the kunai would be formed, and he'd nod, happy with himself. Quickly dropping it into the water, he'd take a slight break.

Drinking some water, he'd take a moment to look to Masa. Shaking his head, he'd remove any thoughts. Grabbing the rough Kunai out of the water, he'd look it over, realizing how rough it actually was. Grabbing his tools again, he'd start to grind away at it. Taking his time to smooth it out, he'd leave the surface to be a shiny black reflective edge. Though, moving to the cutting edge, he'd start to put in his real effort, straining to grind away at them and sharpen them to a killing edge. Taking some time to do this, he'd look it over once done.

Having eyed his new creation for some time, he'd nod, feeling like it was good enough. Grabbing his usual rag and liquid, he'd rub it down, making it shine and gleam as he was sure someone would use this one day, rather a lot, and before he sent it off he wanted it looking nice. Taking a bit of time to do this, he'd go through this long process ten times as well, making sure he'd have a good supply to give to the local merchants to sell off, as they got more business that he himself did. Moving on, he'd grab for his last bits of metal.

Looking it over, he'd again move it to the forge, sticking it in and letting it heat up. Though while he did this, he'd look for some leather, as he was going to need it for a grip, once he found it, he'd nod, grabbing a few studs to hold it in place once he was ready, he'd set it to the side for later use. Going back to the forge, he'd reach in with his tongs, grabbing it out and again moving it to the forge. Grabbing his hammer and starting to hammer it flat, he'd take his time, not wanting to mess up the last bits of scrap metal he had laying around.

Once he had gotten it to the thickness that he wanted, he'd stick it back into the forge, again heating it. Only letting it heat for a small amount of time he'd pull it back out, again using the wedge to cut away excess metal. Though this time, he's grab a specialist tool used to grind away hot metal, using it over the slowly forming blade to put it into the shape that he had in mind for it. Basically shaping it to be a short tanto, he'd flip it over, begging to shape the other side of the blade. Taking his time with this, he'd nod once he was done, quickly dropping it into the water to strengthen it.

Sticking it back into the forge, he'd only let it in there for a small amount of time as he only needed a small portion of the blade to be workable. Pulling out a sharpening stone, he'd move to the cutting edge of the sword, running the rock down the side of the blade, slowly bringing it to a sharp edge. Taking a rather long time on just the one side, he'd flip the blade over, doing the same thing to the other side, ensuring that it would cut almost anything it came in contact with. Nodding a bit he'd again dunk it into the water, feeling that he was done. Though, pulling it back out he'd again use his file and tools to even out and rough spots.

Moving now to the area he had left for a handle, he'd grab the leather and studs he had set aside. Wrapping the leather around the handle multiple times, he'd glue it as he went, just as an extra precaution. Then, using the studs he had set out, he'd begin to hammer them into place, through the leather and a small hole in the blade where he had made room in order to keep the handle in place. Once he was done, the handle would be wrapped brown leather with iron studs holding it in place. Content with this, he'd set it down, looking it over happily.

Now, grabbing the polishing rag and such, he'd run it over the blade, making sure that it would be nice enough looking for sale. Doing such, he'd lift it up looking it over, almost wanting to keep it for himself, but knowing better than to do that as he needed the money. Quickly putting it to the side with all of the other weapons he had made today, he'd shut everything down, no longer needing it all as he was done for the day. Grabbing all of the new weapons he'd move to put them in his pack, sure that he'd be able to sell them the next time he made it to a village. Now looking to Masa he'd say, "I'm done forging for the day, I'm all yours now."* - Fri Oct 30 19:28:38 2015
