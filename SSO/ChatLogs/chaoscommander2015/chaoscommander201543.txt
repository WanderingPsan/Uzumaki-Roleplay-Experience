Pushing her against his member slowly at first, trying to let her get used to it, he'd let out a sigh of pleasure. Though, a few deep breaths later, and he'd be trying to force her to do it as rough as she could take, attempting to scrape the back of her throat with his member, "G-Gah."* - Sun Nov 29 08:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Gulping a small bit he'd say, "You mean this isn't fun?" shaking his head, he'd simply agree with her.* - Sun Nov 29 08:16:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: But I wanna have some fun to. - Sun Nov 29 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: O-Oh. - Sun Nov 29 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Let's then. - Sun Nov 29 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down to the girl, he'd again gulp, he was unsure about how to go about this, being being that she had a rather nice ass, something drew him to that hole first. Linging himself up, being covered in her saliva, he hoped that he'd be able to slide in without much worry.

Pushing himself into her, he'd grab a hold of her midsection, trying to slowly insert himself until she thought that it felt good. Doing such, he'd of course pick up speed and start slamming into her rather hard.* - Sun Nov 29 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing her, he'd simply place his own hands on top of hers, ignoring any sound of pain coming from her. Continuing to thrust into her he'd sigh in pleasure, "Your insides feel soooo good." saying such as he let himself slide in and out of her warm comforting hole. Wanting to do more, he'd bring a hand down, rubbing the folds of her other hole a bit, "Tell me what you want~"* - Sun Nov 29 08:40:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing her, he'd smirk. Pulling out of her ass, he'd slide himself down, starting to line himself up again, "Get ready~ You're going to enjoy this~ But I assume it might hurt first!" saying such, he'd slowly start to insert himself into her, sliding in inch by inch, and likely breaking her Hymen if she still had it. Trying to feel every bit of her, he'd sigh, pleasure written all over his face as he tried to reach to make her lean up some, trying to grab at her nipples, squeezing them and playing with them.* - Sun Nov 29 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) The tight wet space that he now found himself in, he'd shake his head, forcfully picking her up and moving her towards the fridge so she had something to lean on, "I might get addicted to this~" saying such, he's pick up his speed, plowing into her. "I bet you'd like to have this happen all the time wouldn't you? Dirty girl that you are." making an attempt at talking dirty, he'd pull out, turning her around to face him before sticking it back into her, thrusting it all in at once and continuing at the speed he had been at before.

Moving in to kiss her, he'd give her a quick make out session before moving to one of her ears, licking it and biting at it playfully, then moving down to her neck, doing the same, trying to leave a mark to show that she was his. 

His hands would be all over her flat chest, playing with her nipples.* - Sun Nov 29 09:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her jump onto him, he'd move her over to the bed, throwing her down as he moved to be on top over her, again thrusting in as his hands ran over her body. Eventually though wanting to tease, he'd slowly pull out, rubbing his tip around her entrance, and prodding it a small bit but not going back in.

"Oh no, I think I'm too tired~" saying such jokingly, he'd move to lay on the bed beside her, "Guess we might have to stop since I can't keep doing it myself~" looking to her, daring her to make a move with his words, he'd again move in, kissing her, pushing his tongue into her mouth.* - Sun Nov 29 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Whichever feels better for you~ - Sun Nov 29 09:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Watching her get into position, he'd gulp a bit, feeling her slam down onto his cock. Reaching forward as one of his hands went to her clit, he'd tease it and pinch at it playfully. His other hand would rest on her thigh, rubbing it slightly as he starting to match her timing, thrusting into her ass, trying to feel as far into her as he could. "Damn. . .you're too good." saying such, he'd grunt a bit, being his first time, he had already lasted pretty long, and would likely cum soon, though it probably still wouldn't be the end.* - Sun Nov 29 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Having -no- issue with this, he'd put his tongue into her, swirling it around and licking on it. Moving his hands up as well, one would move to continue to play with her clt while the other would alternate with fingering her asshole as he licked it.

All the while he'd feel her licking him, "I-In your mouth." saying such, he'd hold back, hoping that she'd take it into here mouth. Though, regardless if she did or not, he'd eventually cum, spraying everywhere.* - Sun Nov 29 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling her juices drip down onto him, he'd welcome them, trying to get what he could into his mouth. Though watching as she moved to sit on his chest, and seeing the cum dripping from her mouth, he'd almost harden up again right away. "I don't think we're done yet. . " Saying such, he'd attempt to get up and push her down onto the bed.

Turning her on her side, he'd raise one of her legs up, quickly inserting himself into her front folds, and thrusting like a mad animal without any control as it felt too good for him. "Tell me what it feels like~ What you want to do~ Who you belong to~" saying such to tease her, he'd continue to thrust, one hand holding her leg up while the other would be down playing with her clit while he did such.

"Who knows, perhaps I should fill you up."* - Sun Nov 29 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down to her, he'd say, "Yea ma'm." before continuing to thrust into her like it was the only thing he knew. Putting a hand out, he'd suddenly materialize a crystal dildo, nice and bit and ridged. Moving it to her ass, he'd start to shove it in, pulling it in and out as he wanted her to enjoy herself. His other hand went to her mouth as he basically just put his fingers into it, "Quiet, someone might hear.~" saying such, he'd hopefully make her suck on them.

Doing this for some time as her leg was rested on his shoulder he'd say, "I don't think I can last much longer.~"* - Sun Nov 29 09:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Trying to get one last tease in he'd say, "I be you like sucking on my fingers don't you?~ I bet you want to be fucked everyday now, Hm?~" obviously messing with her, he'd continue to do all that he had been. 

Though, quicky shoving the dildo as far up as he could, he'd give it one last thrust, suddenly releasing inside of ger, coating her walls, though being his second time, it was unlikely the amount would be enough, or the force enough to get her pregnant. Though, even after he'd done such, he'd keep himself in her. Letting her leg drop, he'd simply lay and wrap his arms around her, "So, was it good?"* - Sun Nov 29 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd say, "Of course. Though remember, you said you'd leave with me. And mentioned doing this everyday~" chuckling slightly, he'd move to wrap his arms tighter around her and kiss her once more. "Get some sleep, you're going to need the rest~"* - Sun Nov 29 09:57:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: You wish. - Mon Nov 30 00:01:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: ALLAHU ACKBAR - Mon Nov 30 00:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Hm? - Mon Nov 30 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: No. - Mon Nov 30 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Petrova, Kana(Zoey-Lover) says: Leave. - Mon Nov 30 00:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: . . .Quite Rude. - Mon Nov 30 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: To think it was on my list to maybe join them. - Mon Nov 30 00:07:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, his playful personality falling back to a more stern one. "I was considering the posibility of joining you, but if that is how you treat people, I want no part." saying such, he'd form two hand seals, letting his chakra build and go into the ground, he'd change the structure over, allowing ot to form until a large crystal dragon that would rise out of the ground beneath him, allowing him to stand on it and use it as a ride, "I'll be going then."* - Mon Nov 30 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ... - Mon Nov 30 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hmm... I gue- hello? - Mon Nov 30 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Anyway - Mon Nov 30 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Catching sight of an unusual sight, he'd look to the dog more than the girl, not used to seeing them around much anymore. Shaking his head, he'd eventually look up to the girl, looking her over as he took in the fact the book she was reading. Not questioning in, he'd move to lean against the Kage statue, not caring if anyone saw it as disrespectful.* - Thu Dec  3 03:52:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) raising an eyebrow, he'd simply mumble, "I'd thought the child army would have stopped with the death of the pedo." chuckling aloud, he'd still be more interested in the dog. Glancing at it more than the person, only using his words to perhaps cause her to stir.* - Thu Dec  3 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Catching the glare the girl shot him, and noticing how serious she was being, he'd only go to laugh more, "Oh~ So serious. 'That' Mizukage would have liked you~" again laughing he'd move to lean off the statue, making his way towards the girl slightly, "Cute dog."* - Thu Dec  3 04:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, catching the tone of voice, he'd shake his head, "Oh spare me the tone. I had to get you out of that book somehow. Which, I did the way I am best at." chuckling at his own words he'd move on, "What is the dogs name?" asking such he'd move a step forward, holding his hand out for the small dog to sniff his hand, likely smelling a slight hint of food, but most likely smells the dog had never smelled before, being that he traveled a lot.* - Thu Dec  3 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Nodding slightly, he'd smile slightly, old scars being profound on his face, "Nice to meet you Makkuro." Sighing slightly, he'd lean back up, his back and legs popping in the process.

Looking to Sekitsui, he'd simply state with his somewhat shining purple eyes locked on her, "Abraxas."* - Thu Dec  3 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly as it seemed she had already made up her mind about him, he'd look her over, his eyes gleeming like gems, "I assume you already don't like me?" chuckling at it, he'd raise an eyebrow, "Most people don't."* - Thu Dec  3 04:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) finding this to be funny to no end, he'd begin to laugh, a somewhat odd laugh that seemed to be light, yet serious. "I guess it does seem that way doesn't it? I suppose I am a bit of a creep, though I've been surrounded by wolves in children's skin for such a long time, I don't take age and look into consideration when I talk anymore." shaking his head lightly, he'd rub his neck a bit, shaking his head as a bit of hair fell into his eyes.* - Thu Dec  3 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head lightly, he'd see the puppy's tail wag, and hear the yip. Smiling a small bit, his face looking tired from constant travel, he'd gesture to the seat, "May I?" asking such with a bit of a bow from his head, he'd decide to treat the child with respect, being she was the only person he had talked to in months who didn't try to use him, or make the connection to him 'murdering' the Mizu.* - Thu Dec  3 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Moving towards the seat, he'd sigh slightly as his young knees popped as if he'd been on his feet for some time. Looking straight forward as he leaned against the small wall behind it he'd speak up, "I was at one point. Though, I'm noticed all over. I journey from place to place. Though if you want to bring up where I started, I'm originally from Konoha."* - Thu Dec  3 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd shrug, "Perhaps. . .I've yet to decide. The new Mizukage seems to want me back here in the village, but that would mess up my travelers life. . ." chuckling as he closed his eyes a bit, he'd ask, "How'd you get the dog?" simple curiousity in his voice.* - Thu Dec  3 05:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head and chuckling, he'd open his eyes, looking to her, "You make things seem like they are that simple. It must be nice." saying such, he'd glance at the dog a bit more, "Do you like him?" a bit of happiness shown on his face as a few ideas came to mind, none violent, or involving wrong doing.* - Thu Dec  3 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Nodding a small bit, wanting to do something for the child who had been the first to talk to him since he had returned, he'd say, "Bare with me, this is just for art." saying such, he'd sigh slightly, not having used this particular jutsu in some time, he'd preform a quick four hand seals,  Quickly flooding chakra to his arms, he'd regulate it, making one have a bit less concentrated amount of chakra than the other one. Two blue crystal blades forming, one much harder than the other, he'd reach over, grabbin the softer one and simply snapping it off.

Using the remaining blade, he'd slowly begin to work on it, knocking off small pieces of it, and shaping it. After a few mistakes, and a lot of concentration, he'd hold up a -very- ragid looking dog figurine, as if it had been smashed out of rock, but another rock. "Well. I'm not an artist anyway."* - Thu Dec  3 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd set it next to her, "All yours." nodding a small bit, he'd lean back against the wall again. "And, I'm surprised you haven't heard of me or my abilities yet. . .I guess I kept more of a low profile than I thought." shaking his head he'd switch gears back to what she had said, "I'm glad you like it though." looking to the puppy, he'd squint his eyes, "Does he perhaps like fish?"* - Thu Dec  3 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) smiling, a real smile for once, he'd find happiness in the girl's joy, "You're welcome. Anytime. . .Perhaps next time I could copy Makkuro exactly with enough preperation and practice." laughing a small bit, he'd continue to smile lightly.

"I'm not exactly special aside from my abilites. . .I have done some things that have attracted attention to me is all." shaking his head lightly, he'd look to her again, and then to the pup, "Perhaps you want a special tag for his collar? I can't exactly give you a gift, and not him. . .hm. Or maybe I'll buy him a treat of two next time I'm out traveling. Don't want him upset with me~" laughing at his own words, he'd look to the pup happily.* - Thu Dec  3 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd say, "That'd depend. Everything surrounding me is based on opinions. To some I am a friend, a protector, but to others, I am a heathen, a killer." saying such, he'd shrug, "You'll have to judge for yourself."
