Looking them over he'd simply speak out, avoiding the conversation, as he was afraid Ortho and Minimasa were getting along better than he ever had with Masa. This fear, quite obviously shown, "Minimasa. I'm going to start working on something for you later." saying such, he'd simply shrug.

Thinking it over he'd simply find his eyes resting on her before then simply looking back down to the metal, putting it back to where he had it originally. Shrugging a bit he'd simply now rest against a nearby wall, lost in thought.* - Mon Oct 26 00:49:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) His eyes going a bit wide, he was sure that he had only wanted to talk to Masa, "Eh? Me as well?" looking to Masa a bit questionally, he'd sigh, "Alright I guess."* - Mon Oct 26 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to him, he'd find himself a bit uncomfortable. Unsure on how to take his actions. Thus, he'd simply try to ignore them, keeping his calm, even with Masa so far away. Though, listening carefully to what the man had said he'd have somewhat of a stupid look, "Thing? Blacksmithing is me. I've grown up around a forge." saying such he'd move past that, as it was simply a side note.

"And, what I wish to accomplish? Again, as I told you before. I want to be the best at what I do. I want to create things that outshine every other creation." saying such he'd think for a moment, "And. . .I want to be able to provide Masa, and anyone else I deem worthy with what ever they need." saying such, he'd have a hard time thinking of anything other than blacksmithing. "The only things really in my life for a long time now that have been constant are blacksmithing, and Masa."* - Mon Oct 26 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to him a bit weirdly, he'd take a moment. Letting it sink in that her main answers had been about him, he wouldn't take that as anything special, being that she usually said weird things because she was his guardian basically. Shrugging this thought off, he'd listen to the rest of what the man was saying. He'd look up to the man, "Well, I'd be fine with joining. I still feel as if I owe you. And being part of a group could bring more money to me." getting the practical aspects of his answer out of the way.

Hearing his statement about shaking the shinobi world he'd simply shake it off, "I don't know about shaking the system, but being in a group would make my life a lot easier." being that he only really cared about two things, making it big as a smith, and Masa, and this would hopefully help him protect/advance with both.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Blushing with her underneath him, he'd simply say, "I dunno about that. . .Usually my bed isn't so pretty. Plus, I don't have a pillow." shaking his head, he'd try to look away.* - Mon Oct 26 05:06:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having his head pulled in, he'd blush more, "Masa. . .you might want to stop." for obvious reasons this was affecting him. "I am pretty sure I have deep feelings for you. . .and doing something like this. . ." shaking his head, he'd try to pull away from her chest. He didn't want to seem like more of a pervert than he had seemed already. Though, he really didn't want to leave where his head had been. . it was obvious that dirty thoughts were sprouting, and he was trying his best to keep them down.* - Mon Oct 26 05:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having a hard time now he'd say, "I don't think I can. .

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Smiling a bit he'd simply shake his head and say, "And that'd be a punishment how?" saying such, Masa would be able to tell basically how Vessul felt from his face currently, which would be what he had described before, "Though, can you handle be being over top of you looking back all night?"* - Mon Oct 26 05:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Feeling Masa's hands come over his mouth and eyes, he'd simply shake his head, speaking in muffled tones behind her hand, "I don't want to yet. . .I want to enjoy this." saying such, he'd move to flip over in the bed beside her, turned to look at her.* - Mon Oct 26 05:22:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her, a thought would come to say something pervy, but his true feelings would be too strong to say something like that, thus he'd say, "Don't be so cold to me." * - Mon Oct 26 05:27:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Saying such, he honestly wouldn't care what she'd say, as he was too busy being held by Masa to really care what she'd say she wanted to do as he attempted to wrap his own arms around her to hold her just as close back as she was to him.* - Mon Oct 26 05:45:10 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having gotten pulled back into a kiss for a long time, he'd be overwhelmed. Overjoyed by the entire thing, he'd wrap his arms around her quite tightly. "Did you really hate it that much?" saying such he'd simply find himself laying on the pillow looking into her eyes.* - Mon Oct 26 06:02:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing a bit as he attempted to wrap his arms around her, and in turn cradle her. Wanting to watch her fall asleep. If he could, he'd lay his own head down on the pillow beside her, though he'd say something just as she was likely asleep, "I wish you'd just accept what I want some more. ." saying such, he'd watch her face as she slept, in turn making him want to sleep.

He didn't want to leave this bed, and this time, and this moment, ever. He wanted to enjoy it forever.* - Mon Oct 26 06:11:37 2015

"Nothing, I'm fine."* - Mon Oct 26 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Being pulled onto his back he'd grunt a bit through pain, "Hey now. . be easy."

If she'd look him over she'd see a few scraps, bruising, and a lot of dirt where he been tossed around, "I ah, had an accident with some metal. I stacked it too high, and it ah. . .fell on me."* - Mon Oct 26 22:03:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Who hurt you? - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: And where. - Mon Oct 26 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Someone cloaked, and with a mask. . .I haven't seen them before. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: And just out and about. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I was looking for materails. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Idiot. - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: You could've died. - Mon Oct 26 22:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Saying such he'd let his hands rest to his chest and belly, he'd probably never forgive himself if he let her know how sore he actually was. 

It wasn't like he had been beaten bad, he just wasn't very durable, and it'd be likely that he'd be bruised all up under his clothing. But, he'd -never- let Masa find out if he could help it, "Well. . I'm fine. . .and I've learned my lesson. It's painful to be too far from you." meaning that in two ways. Being that he had been beaten without her around, and emotionally. Having said such, if allowed, he'd lean back to rest on her legs, if she was still behind him.* - Mon Oct 26 22:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Getting flicked, he'd cringe a bit more.

"I'll never leave you. Ever. No matter what then. But if that's the case, the same has to go for you." saying such he'd try to stand to his feet. Eyes squinting with the dull pain he felt.* - Mon Oct 26 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: To be honest. . . - Mon Oct 26 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I probably would have been happier staying in the bed. - Mon Oct 26 22:46:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Alright. - Mon Oct 26 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking down to his clothes he'd say, "Mind turning around while I change into cleaner clothing?" just now realizing he hadn't, and he didn't want Masa to see what he looked like at the moment.* - Mon Oct 26 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Fine, I don't wanna see what's under anyways. - Mon Oct 26 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, he'd move to his pack, getting his spare clothing. Going to remove his current ones, he'd let out audible sounds of pain. Though, he hoped Masa wouldn't look, he did't want her to be in a rage already. Though, if she did even glance, she'd likely see large, purple, painful patches of skin.

Once he had gotten his shirt off, he'd slowly put the new one on, again having a hard time. Looking down to his pants he'd simply mumble, "It's not like they got they dirty, he never touched them." saying such to himself, being that his legs hadn't been attacked, he'd leave on the pants he had on, not wanting to go through the paing of changing them.

-If- he'd been allowed throw all of that, he'd turn back around, "Alright."* - Mon Oct 26 22:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to her he'd simply nod, "If you want. Though, can we take it easy this time? Please don't jump up to fight someone right away. . .I'm already purple. ." reffering to how his body looked.* - Mon Oct 26 22:54:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: ...Purple? - Mon Oct 26 22:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: - - Mon Oct 26 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Nothing. - Mon Oct 26 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Don't worry about it. - Mon Oct 26 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Having hoped she wouldn't have caught his slip up, he'd have his clothing removed. Looking to the side he'd simply say, "J-Just more smithing accidents." 

Saying such, his body would be covered in different areas of purple, red, and black bruising down his body, though, his legs were only a bit scratched up, and they weren't really hit hard. 

"Can I have my clothes back?" though, he'd shy away from her touch if she tried to.* - Mon Oct 26 22:58:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Mon Oct 26 22:59:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Cringing, quite noticably he'd put his clothes back on, "M-Masa?"* - Mon Oct 26 23:00:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I-If it makes you feel better. . . - Mon Oct 26 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's all from the same person. . . - Mon Oct 26 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: And he said I was too pathetic to deal with anymore. . . - Mon Oct 26 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) sadly looks down.* - Mon Oct 26 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Following her out, he'd try again, "Masa. . .say something?"* - Mon Oct 26 23:01:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Such a catchy song. - Mon Oct 26 23:02:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Would simply get carried, in a quite painful manor, though he wouldn't say anything, as he saw this all as him being a fuck up, and he deserved it.* - Mon Oct 26 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll just wait for you.0 - Mon Oct 26 23:12:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) couldn't bring himself to speak to her, he felt too ashamed.* - Mon Oct 26 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Simply looking to her, he'd reach for his eyepatch, not realizing he was doing it.* - Mon Oct 26 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Vessul. - Mon Oct 26 23:43:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I just didn't want you upset. - Mon Oct 26 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Good. - Mon Oct 26 23:47:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I didn't upset you. . .did I? - Mon Oct 26 23:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: You did. - Mon Oct 26 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Instantly frowning he'd say, "Throw me."* - Mon Oct 26 23:48:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Why? - Mon Oct 26 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: Do it. - Mon Oct 26 23:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: and It'll make me feel like I repaid you for upsetting you. - Mon Oct 26 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: So do it. - Mon Oct 26 23:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) says: I'll be fine. - Mon Oct 26 23:52:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Getting slammed into the ground he'd hold back the large amount of pain he'd obviously be feeling, even if it was a gentle move. Swallowing whatever liquid had somehow made its way back onto his mouth he'd slowly stand to his feet, wiping it. "You always surprise me with how strong you are."* - Mon Oct 26 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: Hmph. - Mon Oct 26 23:56:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Morth, Vessul(Chaos Commander2015) Going to his bag he'd rummage around. Pulling out what seemed to be a tube of some white substance he'd say, "This is a type of stuff that I use when I accidently hammer myself. . ." pausing rubbing his neck painfully he'd meekly ask, because he felt it was an awkward question, "Could you put it on my back where I can't reach. At least when I'm done putting it on the rest of myself. . ."* - Tue Oct 27 00:18:46 2015
