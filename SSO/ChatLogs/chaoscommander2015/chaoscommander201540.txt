<br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Simply watching the girl, doing his best to stay on his feet, he'd eventually get pulled down by the chains, holding now on his knees. Though, he'd keep his same look, not even a sign of fear.

Glaring the girl down, he'd glance around, unsure of what he could do, so he'd make a simple joke, "Ya know, the last girl to try and chain me down wanted a ring instead." chuckling a bit playfully, his face would eventually fall back to its norm. 

Sighing a bit he'd simply wait her approach, wondering is she was going to add to the many scars he had under his clothing. * - Tue Nov 24 07:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Being that his body was only a bit trained, the kunai would slice into his leg(s) though, even as is caused him very minor pain, he'd keep his face the same, no new sounds or the such, as he wasn't going to give her the satisfaction, if she was stupid enough to play with her prey, he would simply wait her out until she was unable to hold the chains on him anymore, and then just deal the pain back even more.* - Tue Nov 24 07:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: What's she doing..? Is she trying to force him into surrender? - Tue Nov 24 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Just put it to his neck - that'd be enough to call it. - Tue Nov 24 07:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hm? What's that Yumiko? - Tue Nov 24 07:28:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) says: She likes pain. I've seen her drool at someone in pain. - Tue Nov 24 07:28:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Standing to his feet, he'd look to the blood moving down his legs with apathy, "Don't worry about it. It'll add to my collection." saying such, he'd rip his sash off, cutting it in half with the now sharpened blades on his hands. Wrapping it around his legs he'd let the blades fall into dust, "You mind if I go relax now?"

Apathy still on his face as he did all of this, it was obvious he had seen this as another act of pointless violence, and as much as he wanted to react to teach the girl a lesson, he'd simply wait for an answer from Liu, really wanting to just go relax and get something to drink.* - Tue Nov 24 07:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Very well. Go rest. - Tue Nov 24 07:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head a bit he'd say, "Not really going to rest. Gonna go grab a drink, and maybe train, I dunno. I suggest you keep her away from me." Pointing to Nori he'd go on to say, "I won't tolerate pointless pain infliction."* - Tue Nov 24 07:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: That you don't have a trump in your sleeve? - Tue Nov 24 07:49:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Having shown up just in time to catch the end of the evalutation, he'd mumble a bit, "Shows what you know kid. It's not just Earth, and it took more work than you think." though, it would be unsure if he heard him or not as he laid back on the bench, his eyes closed.* - Tue Nov 24 08:15:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Good job. And he fights that way because he spent more time on his jutsu than his skill.. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: He just told you that. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It's simply the only technique I've made up to this point in time. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Right. That's my point. - Tue Nov 24 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He spent more time working on an in-fighter jutsu. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: I have no intention of being an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Instead of making a jutsu that is not in-fighter based. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: It was simply the easiest to make. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then for now you're an in-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Nah. - Tue Nov 24 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Then you purposefully lost to Nori and Yumiko by fighting as an in-fighter and holding back. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: On the field you'd be dead. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Perhaps. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: If you'd prefer I treated you as dead, then I'll do so. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: But that would be my issue. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Not yours. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: No. It'd be the village's. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: The village that has trained you and prepared you to properly complete missions. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: As far as I am concerned, I am not yet part of this village. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: It'd be the issue of the people who hired you. - Tue Nov 24 08:26:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) thinks: The more I hear, the more I want to leave. - Tue Nov 24 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: This is why I detailed he'd be better off branching out of in-fighting and working on other techniques. - Tue Nov 24 08:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: He is an in-fighter due to his inability to in-fight. He does not want to be an in-fighter, but he is one nonetheless. He can best improve by following his wants and working on ways to be an out-fighter. - Tue Nov 24 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd simply state, "I'll be going back to Konoha, for better or for worse. I'm sorry for wasting your time." saying such, he'd basically have ignored his entire outburst. He had enough, being that his tolerence level had been torn down over his short life enough as it was.

"Thank you for letting me stay here for this short period." saying such, he'd move to stand, aiming to walk away, all the way through the village until he got to the gate to pay for a ride back to his abandoned home village.* - Tue Nov 24 08:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: He's..leaving the village..because he's an in-fighter? - Tue Nov 24 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing softly, turning towards the Mizu with his hands in his pockets, any sign of joy or happiness having faded long ago, "Talking isn't my strong point, though, I don't really have any." saying such, he'd shake his head slightly.

"You obviously don't need me here, and I can already tell this village isn't a match for me. Personality clashes and such."* - Tue Nov 24 08:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: More of that personalitty I was mentioning, though. - Tue Nov 24 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Ignoring most of what was said, he'd keep his look, one devoid of happiness or joy, "Even if I stay, I'm not a 'play well with others' sort of person." pausing at this statement, he'd say, "I'm not a match for your village."

Turning around, his back to the kage, he'd rub his eyes slightly, tired of his traveling, and having to deal with people already.

"And for the record guy, I don't plan to enter any of your 'folds'" obviously pointing out the man's awkward choice of words.* - Tue Nov 24 08:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) thinks: I hope he intends on using a genjutsu to confuse him..Not the chains of absolution.. - Tue Nov 24 08:56:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: I hope he wasn't intending on me using a genjutsu to confuse him..Not the chains of absolution.. - Tue Nov 24 08:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Suddenly being restrained by chains yet again, he'd be forced down to his knees right away. Though, strangly his face and look would stay the same as it always had. Though, on the inside, his hate for these shinobi would simply build.

Keeping a level voice he'd say, "Not exactly a good way to convince someone not to leave don't you think?" sighing slightly, he'd close his eyes, reigning his emotions in that were trying to get out. Struggling not to be pulled down anymore, he'd grunt a small bit.

"Quite honestly, at this point, I feel like it was stupid to ever leave Konoha." his thoughts were that this was more pointless violence, and an act of forcing someone to do something they didn't want to do. The temptation to retaliate being there, yet being unable to work on it would cause him to speak once more, "Would you kindly release me?"* - Tue Nov 24 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing the Mizu speak out he'd simply say, "You should have made your case like a normal human being then. Even you are acting out in pointless violence that could have been avoided now." saying such as if it were only common sense.

"Just let me go will you? Put guards on me, what not. I don't have to leave, but I don't plan on being around you lot. Alone in a house works for me." not exactly pleading for his life, simply using logic, he'd move to look to the kage, blank, void purple eyes looked back up to the man.

"Regardless of your choice, at least inform my girlf- Oh. . .yea. . .nevermind." if it were even possible, more sadness would enter his eyes as the chains contricted him to fall completely now, laying there with his eyes closed. <I left her behind didn't I? Or did she leave me? I forget.>* - Tue Nov 24 09:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Still having his blank joyless face, he'd glance up from his position on the bed, looking the Mizukage over. Thinking for a moment he'd shake his head slightly before rolling over in the bed.

"I don't fit in with even one of you. I was looking for a place I belonged, and I deemed this not it. I can't help that."* - Tue Nov 24 17:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Raising an eyebrow, "Who?" though shaking the question out of him mind, "You could, but then you'd just add to the senseless violence I hate."* - Tue Nov 24 17:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Hearing the Mizu's words, he'd shake his head lightly, "If I were to stay, you'd never see me. I'd make sure of that. I've come to dislike you all more and more in the time I've sat here." pausing he'd move on, "I'd be well to a corner of the village, away from you all."

Moving now to sit up and lean again the wall he'd look over the Mizukage, "Regardless of what you think 'we' could do, you should have thought about it before restraining me." stating such, he'd rub his eyes lightly.

"I'll be making use of your pub and inn for a day first, if you'll allow." saying such, he'd stumble a bit.* - Tue Nov 24 21:30:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd have made his way back to Konohagakure. Looking around, he'd note that it was basically still devoid of life. Shaking his head at the hopes that someone would even be here, he'd eventually make his way to the mansion. Once there, he'd look around, still seeing no one. Rubbing his head a bit, and drinking a bit of water, he'd simply walk to a nearby tree and sit under it, enjoying the shade as he had been traveling for some time.

Having sat under the three, and taken his time to rest, he'd eventually come to the conclusion that he needed to train a bit more. Looking about he'd decide that he would go ahead and start to practice. Starting to go through the hand seals he'd make sure he had them all right. Tough, realizing that he had messed it up a few times, he'd of course go back and restart it. Once he had finally gotten it right, he'd simply nod a small bit.

Standing to his feet he'd yawn, suddenly focusing on his chakra. Once he was sure that he had the proper hold on it, he'd start to focus his chakra towards his forearms. Doing such in an attempt to do what he had done rather much now, he'd let the chakra suddenly take form as crystal on his arms, suddenly rising up and forming into blades that could in theory be used for attack, or for defending. Once he had done such, he'd look them over, trying to see the sharpness that the'd had.

Once he had made the blades on his arms, he'd look to the tree behind him, his blank look still on his face. Making his way towards it, he'd suddenly lash out, trying to implant the blade on his right arm into the tree. Being that it would bounce off at first, only leaving a dent, he'd back off, finding himself aggravated by the fact he had been denied so easily. Sighing a small amount, he'd stretch, deciding that he wouldn't give up so easily.

Moving back in once more, he'd again slam the blade into the tree, letting its edge dig into it. Once he had done this, he'd tug his arm back in, starting again with both arms, trying his best to practice his attacking on the tree. Eventually getting to the point where he'd fine himself out of breath, he'd let the blades fall into nothingness, and he'd move to sit against the tree he had been attacking, now devoid of bark on the one side. Looking about, he'd wipe his head and wait, for what? Who knows, but he'd wait untill he saw it.* - Tue Nov 24 22:51:18 2015

"Too many people." saying such, he'd turn, aiming to walk to his right and towards the hospital, he knew of a place that would be quiet enough for him.

Though, not wanting to be but so rude, he'd hold up a hand and wave to him slightly while walking off.* - Wed Nov 25 03:55:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd look Liu over."It's not that I'm -not- willing to cooperate, it's simply that I dislike it. I'm not exactly one to listen, as you've likely seen." pauing a moment, a -very- tired look on his eyes, he'd cough some. It would seem his life thus far was starting to take a toll, and it was unlikely he had eatten a decent meal since the last time he was in Kirigakure.

"If I were to 'work' with others. It's be more like they just happen to be with me, and I wouldn't realize they exsisted." saying such, his legs would shake a bit, exaustion setting in.* - Wed Nov 25 08:40:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly he'd say, "It's who I am." upon saying such, he'd eventually sit where he had been standing, not having the energy. Sighing a small bit he'd say, "It's not that I don't care, it's more that I dislike them. Again, I've yet to find someone I can work beside. . ." 

Pausing at this statement, he'd frown, he was legitimately upset about it.* - Wed Nov 25 08:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) says: Basically. - Wed Nov 25 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd eventually force himself to his feet, and then going on to force himself to make four quick hand seals in case they were needed. Starting to walk forward, he'd be slow about it, his stomach killing him.* - Wed Nov 25 08:54:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Would eventually show up, his legs a bit wobbly, and his body a bit worse for ware, though, he'd make it, forcing himself forward. Unable to bring himself to say anything, he'd just look to the Mizu, unsure of what he wanted.* - Wed Nov 25 08:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd move to get to his feet. Struggling a bit at first, he'd shake, unsure if he'd be able to make it all the way on the energy he had at the moment. Grunting some as he moved, he'd eventually get to his feet, stumbling forward through the gate. Looking around as he did so, he'd do his best to remember which way the kage's office was. Taking his longer than he thought it would to remember, he'd simply follow the path, dragging feet.

Having made it a good portion of the way, he'd be starting to sweat heavily, his body protesting every movement forward that he made. At one point, stepping forward his knees would give out, causing him to fall, and making more pain to himself. Though, ignoring it, he'd stand to his feet, continuing onward, and ignoring anyone that would try to help. "Fucking Bullshit. . .I shoulda stocked up." 

Pushing forward, he'd fall a few more times, his knees bleed at this point as he arrived at the kage office, looking worse for ware. Though, having done so, he'd find himself unable to stand, falling to his knees again, not helping, and that he had likely sweated off more than he could afford. His stomach protesting as the fact it had been empty for some time, he'd look to the kage, silent as he wanted to know what would be said.* - Wed Nov 25 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) watching the kage run by, he'd grunt again, trying to force himself to his feet, though, finding that his body was unwilling to cooperate, he'd lean on the statue, using it to pull himself up. Once he had done so, he'd wobble, blood running down from his knees. Though, his usually dead eyes shown with a bit of aggression and anger, he wasn't going to let the Mizu beat him.

Making his way back down the path slowly, he'd eventually fall again, this time for good as he couldn't bring himself to get to his feet once more. Though, using what strength he had left in his arms and legs, he'd begin to crawl, forcing himself forward, again ignoring any help that would be offered to him. Grunting as he went, it would be likely he was close to being done as his body dry heaved a bit, trying to throw up what he didn't have.

Once he ahd finally gotten to the place the kage had ran off to, he'd simply freeze, not moving on the ground as his body couldn't do what he wanted it to do anymore. Looking up at the entrance, he'd try anyway, likely driving him past an edge he shouldn't have crossed as he again reached forward, sweating heavily, and dragged himself forward, body screaming to stop.* - Wed Nov 25 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) A glare going towards the Mizu, or trying to, as he couldn't exactly muster one up, he'd aim to pull himself over to the chair, and up into her, hod body at the point where anything he ate or drank would likely come back up anyway.* - Wed Nov 25 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You only need to eat chicken broth right now. - Wed Nov 25 09:21:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Trying to speak, he'd cough a bit, simply shifting back anf forth a bit worringly.* - Wed Nov 25 09:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) eventually getting to the point where he leaned back into the chair, and didn't move, his throat would be too dry to order. Put simply, it had been a while since he had food or water, or a good nights sleep for that matter.* - Wed Nov 25 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Pulling a bit of money out, shaking putting it on the table, he'd get out in a horse voice, "O-Order?"* - Wed Nov 25 09:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Being that it seemed the man in front of him seemingly cared nothing for him, weary eyes would scan the room. Catching sight of a drink machine, he'd make the assumption it had water. 

Moving to stand, blood still running down his legs and staining his pants, he'd get about two steps before falling again, and having to forcfully crawl there. Putting some money into the machine, he'd hit the button multiple times, and would do this process a few times.

Getting water, he'd lean back against the wall, struggling to open it. Though, once he had, he'd sip on it slowly, trying his best not to throw it up. Looking to his legs, he'd shake his head, trying to pour a bit of water on them as well. Once he had, he'd try to rups his sash off, wrapping them if possible.* - Wed Nov 25 09:32:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Looking to Trill, and then to the scroll the boy had handed him, he'd smile slightly, he felt accepted into an area for once. Perhaps he'd actually have to ask to join the village? Though, brushing these thoughts off he'd open the scroll, glancing it over and wondering what he could possible learn from the scroll he had been handed. Looking it over once, he'd nod slightly figuring out what the jutsu itself did.

Then, moving to look at specifics of the jutsu, such at the hand seals, he'd give them a once over, reading which ones were needed and what he'd have to do in order to make the seals. Once he had read this over, he'd pocket the scroll, deciding to test to see if he could preform them. Which, he would do quite a few times, testing it to make sure he'd be able to do them when it came time to use the actual jutsu.* - Fri Nov 27 04:53:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, he'd go about four hand seals somewhat slowly, trying his best, but still lacked the speed, even if he did the seals perfectly. Nodding somewhat, he'd force his chakra out. directing it to his arms. Pushing it out, his chakra would suddenly take the form of blue crystal, forming on his arms and spreading out to turn into two blades, extended from his fore arm.

"See? Special right? This is my combination." chuckling a small bit he'd show his arms off a bit, keeping the blades there long enough for everyone to get a sight of them, and ask whatever questions they had before he'd suddenly let them fall away into dust, thinking to himself <Tch, too bad I won't be showing off my bigger jutsu.>* - Fri Nov 27 05:03:21 2015
