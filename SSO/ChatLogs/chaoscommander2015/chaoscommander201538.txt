<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) sighing slightly now that he had made it to suna once more, he'd glance around. Compared to how it usually looked, now it seemed a bit empty. Noting this figuring it was because of the chuunin exams, he'd make his way to a part of the village that rarely recieved any travel. Once there, he'd remove his guitar from his back and bring it around to the front of himself. Looking it over, he'd as usual smile at the sight of it, letting his hands rest on it gently. Shaking his head at this, he'd nod a bit, knowing he had to train.

Nodding a bit he'd do the first step, which was to get his chakra into order. Closing his eyes, and starting to calm himself with his breathing. Once he had done this, he'd start to direct the flow of chakra in his body, sending it to his hands. Once he had done this, he'd then direct it to each individual finger. Then, moving it to the guitar, he'd let his chakra spread up and down the item, coursing through each individual string. Knowing that he had done it right, he'd move on.

Now that he was sure that he was ready, he'd start playing his instrument normally, simply getting the hang of it in case he ever had to trick someone with it. Doing such, he'd eventually reach down and grab at a particular string. Once he had done so, his chakra would rush through it. Plucking the string, he'd let out a sound wave laced with his chakra. If he had been focusing on any particular person, it'd be likely they would have been caught, and restained by his technique.

Eventually letting the jutsu, and chakra die, he'd look everything over, again sighing as he was unsure on what to do now.* - Sat Nov 21 18:50:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Again sighing as he was tired, and sick of all of annoying people he was now forced to deal with. Shaking his head, he'd move back to the northern edge of sunagakure once again. Glancing around, he'd make sure that no one was around to see that watching him to find out his abilities. Once he was sure that no one was around, he'd nod slightly. Again closing his eyes, he'd begin to get his focus straight, followed by his breathing. Knowing that he had done enough to be focused, he'd let a rather large sigh loose.

Again going to control his chakra, he'd imagine that he'd be grasping onto it. Being pulled a bit, he'd eventually break a piece off and force it to spread down to his finger tips. Once he was sure that it would be enough to use for his jutsu, he'd again reach down to his guitar, running his fingers over the strings somewhat happily. Once he was sure that he had done enough, he'd let his chakra flow to it. The instrument now having his chakra running through it would be ready to be played and used for his technique.

Nodding a bit more, he'd start to play, though, being that he wanted to go ahead and get a head start, he'd suddenly reach down and pluck the string, again letting his chakra flow through the sound waves. Though, as he did such, it would suddenly falter and break as his distraction was taken by a nearby person walking by. Noticing his failure, he'd grunt angerly. "Damn it. . ." having said such, he'd set his guitar down. Sighing, he'd wipe his head and drink a bit of water. Once he was sure that he was fully rested, he'd look down again, a rather large look of disappointment on his own face for messing it up.* - Sat Nov 21 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Having made his way around the village, and found absolutely nothing that would be any entertainment to him, being that he assumed the chuunins were distracting everyone. -Very- aggravated by the fact he basically had no one at the time he could rely on, or trust other than Ortho, which was still sketchy because he was never told anything. Thus, moving behind a rock, he'd begin to take his anger out on his jutsu once again. Of course, even with his anger, he'd take the time to get his breathing and mind right before he started.

Much as usual, he'd begin to allow chakra to flow into his hands and eventually his Guitar. Once he  had this chakra flowing, he'd again begin to work on simply playing the instrument, not wanting to deal with any outside forces, or jutsu until he was sure that no one was around, and that he had relaxed some. Once he was sure that he was completely ready to go about his business he would again suddenly reach down in the middle of his song, and pluck a string rather loudly compared to the rest. Once he did this, his chakra would of course be let loose.

The sound waves now carrying his chakra the way he wanted it to be, he'd nod, focusing on keeping it going as long as he could, though, once he was done, he'd simply let it die out, the sound and the chakra as he was really quite sick of all of this.* - Sat Nov 21 19:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Maybe I should get Koji's opinion as well...maybe later. - Sat Nov 21 19:30:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Once again, finding nothing to do, he'd move to an abandoned part of Sunagakure. Looking about he'd of course take note of anyone around that he didn't want to be there. Shaking his head once he was done, he'd of course do what he had so many times now. Closing his eyes, he'd start to get his breathing where he wanted it, and then he would go onto getting his focus towards what he had to do. Nodding once he had done so, he'd flip the guitar around from his back, letting it rest on the front of his body. Once there, he'd look down to it.

Sighing slightly, he'd shake his head, his eyes closing again as he went to focus on controlling his chakra where he needed it to be. Mentally watching the flow of his own chakra, he'd attempt to divert it, sending it to his hands. Once there, he'd let it rush to his fingers. "Well, here we go for the hundredth time now." Upon saying such, he'd reach down, his hands resting on the instrument, "And now we start." Having said such, he'd allow his chakra to flow through the instrument as he began to strum lazily.

Now that he had started to play a song, he'd simply enjoy it for some time, letting his mind go a bit, which would in turn be a bad idea, being that when he did, his chakra flow to the instrument would suddenly cut, he had been too focused on playing and less on the jutsu. Only realizing this some time later, he'd sigh angrily. He was losing focus in his own technique, causing him to fail at it. Shaking his head, he'd sigh, wiping his head a bit from the heat of the area.

Reigning his chakra back in, he'd again let it flow through his hands, and eventually the guitar. Once he was sure that he had it all right once more, he'd split his focus, half on the song, and half on the chakra portion. Doing such, he'd sigh slightly as he went down to pluck the sting needed for the jutsu. Doing such his chakra would of course be carried out with the sound wave, and if he had been focusing on anyone, they would have been caught inside of it, though no one was around to use it one anyway.

Once he had watched to make sure the jutsu would have taken effect on anyone that he would have been focusing on, he'd listen as the sound waves died out, his chakra along with it. Nodding once this had happened, he'd slowly stand back to his feet, feeling as if eventually he'd get the technique completely mastered.* - Sat Nov 21 20:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Once again finding himself stuck alone in part of Sunagakure he'd move to slide his guitar over his shoulder and around to the front of his body. Once there, he'd do the same thing he had been doing all day. Closing his eyes, he'd begin to focus at the task at hand. Getting his mind in the right setting, and then bringing his breathing to focus on with it, he'd mumble, "I'm getting really sick of this." Saying such, he'd reach down to the instrument, glancing it over to make sure it hadn't been damaged in recent use.

Once he was sure that it was perfectly fine, he'd nod a bit to himself and look around the area once more. Sure that no one was watching, he'd do as he usually did, bringing his chakra to listen to him and surge to his fingertips as he was ready to get things started. Then, placing his hands to the instrument, he'd allow the chakra to flow into it, running through it and the strings. Happy at it coming so easily now, he'd run his hands over it, enjoying the progress he had made.

Looking at it, he'd suddenly start to play, his hands running up and down the strings as he brought his music to life in his own mind, allowing the images to take place that he thought would go well with his music. A bit too happy with this, he'd reach down, aiming to pluck the string and start the jutsu. Though, upon doing so, the sounds waves would be released, but would not carry his chakra being that his focus wasn't on actually trying to let it go, he was again enjoying the music too much.* - Sat Nov 21 20:37:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head slightly, feeling that it was about time that he stop and give it up for the day, he'd go about it once more. Going through the processes that he always had up to this point, he'd again run his hands down to the instrument, letting chakra flood it. Once he had done such, he'd then quicly once more reach and pluck the string, letting his chakra run out and flood the area. Anyone he would have been focusing on would have been caught, but being that he wasn't, nothing would happen.* - Sat Nov 21 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Shaking his head, feeling that it still wasn't enough, he'd again go about it. Standing now as he wiped his head of all the sweat that had accumulated. Once he was sure that it was completely gone, he'd shrug. Moving to try one more time, he'd touch his hands to the instrument, going straight for the sring now. Plucking it once again, his chakra would go out, but fizzle into nothing being that he was too busy trying to rush it.

Shaking his head at this, he'd sigh, getting his breathing right before deciding to try again. Nodidng, he'd focus all of his chakra into it as he again plucked the string. Doing such, the sound waves would carry out his chakra properly this time. Allowing whoever he deemed to be caught in his jutsu, which at this time would be no one.* - Sat Nov 21 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Deciding that he needed to take a caravan back to Kumo to talk to Eri, he'd quickly pay for a ticket and be off. * - Sat Nov 21 20:49:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Having been making his way back after discovering the others were no longer in Kumo, he'd come back to what seemed to be a rather rough looking sight. Keeping his calm, he'd scan the area while walking up behind Eri and Ortho, "What. . .?" his eyes taking in everything he saw.* - Sat Nov 21 21:13:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had apparently walked into the who area with probably the worst timing he had ever had on his entire lifespan, he'd catch sight of Ortho and Eri. That is, before a sudden mass would arise up around them. Being that he was one of the slowest people in the world, and literally had no way to protect himself inside of this device, he wouldn't even have time to think, before whatever happened, happened.

Unless whatever it was stopped, he'd find himself literally blown to pieces, likely covering the area around him in blood. A sad wish held in the split-second before his death, "I never got to live a full life."* - Sat Nov 21 21:34:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Being that he had somehow been magically covered and saved by some stray guard, he'd likely still be rather hurt, to the point where if he didn't get medical attention he'd die, being that he literally was the frailest person in the world. Though, even in this state, by sheer will he'd force himself to move, and fight to the best of his abilities. Being that he had always carried his guitar on his back, it was likely that it had dodged some of the damage as well, though, likely beyond playing actual songs.

With the last bit of energy he had left, he'd reach back to it, pulling it to his side. If even one string was still intact, he'd reach to it, chakra flooding his fingers as he plucked it, letting it ring out over the area. Focusing this directly on the one who had grabbed Eri, he'd make sure to try his best to let her get away.

The technique aiming for Edge, should it work, would make it seem to the man that guitar strings were wrapping around him and stopping his movement, while also making his dizzy. Regardless if the technique worked, his body wouldn't be able to move, and would likely have cuts, and multiple other injuries, and would have been fighting to do what he had done, and stay awake. * - Sat Nov 21 21:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Being stomped on but not only Edge, but the rest of his forces as well, his weak body already ravaged, would collapse under the weight. Everything caving in on itself, killing the boy.* - Sat Nov 21 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Uchiha, Hatsujin(Chaos Commander2015) Being that his last sight would be that of Eri falling to the ground unconscious, and Ortho yelling like a mad man, he'd barely register what had been said, though, it wasn't like it mattered as Edge and his men suddenly started started to trample his body underfoot like it was a common rug. 

As the life was literally stompped out of him, he'd slowly try to move his hand to his guitar while trying to look through all of the feet to see if Eri and Ortho were alright. Coughing up more and more blood by the second. Once his hand rested on it, he'd close his eyes a bit. He knew that Eri was alive, and that Ortho was strong enough to survive this. He had thus far, so why not a bit longer?

His life starting to seep out of his body, almost completely gone, he'd mumble through blood soaked coughs, "I-I never got to take her on a date. . .or show Ortho I could be worthy of being his partner. . ." again choking on a bit of blood he'd get out, "I-I guess this is just the end of my score. . .there is no restart symbol at the end waiting for me." chuckling at his own sappy music line, he'd finally find his bones falling in, his organs crushed, and his lungs full of blood.

His life would come to an end one that 'note'.* - Sat Nov 21 22:26:59 2015

Looking around he'd say, "Keep this a scret will you?" asking such, he'd sigh a bit, forcing chakra to build up out of his hand, forming a small flower in his hand out of purple crystal, doing it in such a way that the guards watching him would have to assume he had pulled it out of his clothes.

"I can't do those things now, but I can try to not be an idiot like the rest." saying such, he'd set the flower in front of her to have.* - Sun Nov 22 03:58:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, it was obvious that she was in a bad mood. Leaning against the wall he'd shake his head slightly, "Sorry."* - Sun Nov 22 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Menia(JustCallMeGromp) says: It's fine. - Sun Nov 22 04:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Sighing slightly, he'd nod a small but. Holding one of his arms up, he'd close his eyes, letting chakra flow towards it. Once he had done so, he'd try to shape the chakra out over his hand, letting it take shape. The chakra, in response would begin to crystalize from his arm, slowly moving as a connection to the side of it.

"Can we please all just get along? I'm getting sick of the bullshit, and I haven't even been here a single day."

Having stated such, the blue crystal blades off his arms would seem rather sharp, and ready to use. Though, now speaking back to the Raikage he'd say, "I guess my cat is out of the bag on what I use now, isn't it?"* - Sun Nov 22 04:52:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kurina, Abraxas(Chaos Commander2015) Being that Menia was being rash, he'd tilt his arm up, just enough to hopefully get between the two and stop them, though, if he was too late to stop their movements, at the best, he'd likely lessen whatever blow was going to Menia, his crystal blade shattering if the carrot were to hit it.* - Sun Nov 22 05:05:29 2015
