<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) thinks: I'ma suplex this nigga if he loses.. - Wed Oct  7 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) flashed a broad smirk towards her elder brother as she eyed his injured appendage purposely, insinuating that she -may- potentially have some sort of intentions to either give him a run for his money or just some straight up brutal pain. He didn't set any guidelines for what sort of training it would be either, but as she lacked well. . .skills of every kind she simply raised her hand to grasp onto the hilt of her tanto. "Alright, here I come!" she exclaimed, making an averge paced stride towards him. Her torso leaned forth as she lowered her center of gravity in preparation for something!* - Wed Oct  7 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amon(William O. Wisper) thinks: This girl swingin' swords like it ain't a big deal? - Wed Oct  7 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) had little time to react to his swift movements and thus upon him actually taking offensive action in response to her attempted assault she flinched but it was far too late! He outclassed her in combative ability afterall. The foot making a solid connection on her back, she groaned and stumble forward, almost falling over even before catching herself in a sliding stop whilst flailing her arm about slightly. 

"I'm not cocky, hmph."

Turning sharply on her heels, or attempting to do so, she'd try to close the small gap. However before getting too close to him, she used the weapon in the best way she could actually manage at her 'level' of skill. She flung it at his center mass as to potentially distract him! She'd then aim to kick one of his kneecaps assuming she could get close enough to him, the girl knew she wasn't going to win a straightforward battle.* - Wed Oct  7 19:53:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) curled her lips into a faint grin as she managed to land a strike as intended, thats all she wanted. That was a plus in her manner of improving the way she faced combat as a whole, however that success would come back to bite her. Clenching her teeth as his fist violently smashed against her jaw, her head was knocked back and she fell right over! Perhaps she was a glass canon? "Owch.."* - Wed Oct  7 20:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) let out a strained sigh, she had lost in such a pitiful way that it could have been heart breaking had she not beeing tough! "F-Fine. I submit. You win." she stated, though it seemed he was being assaulted by someone anyway. She sat up and dusted herself off, backing away upon standing up so she could collect her discarded weapon.* - Wed Oct  7 20:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) smirked and nodded her head, she didn't have any intents to get drunk however she could always just take advantage of him once he passed out or got drunk enough, so she took the glass and downed just a small sip of it and set it back down.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(Coolm3) says: Sure. - Wed Oct  7 23:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) curiously glanced at her drunken elder brother, setting herself on the edge of the bed. "Something important again?"* - Thu Oct  8 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) wasn't capable of providing any sort of credible resistance and as such she would only result in possibly hurting herself in the process so as the pressure built upon her shoulders she simply glanced away from him. A sigh escaped her maw as it was revealed there was some truth to the statements earlier, and he even apologized. A secret tradition amongst the family to molest your own family members must have been reaal tragic, but she accepted it. Perhaps it was the slight amount of alcohol she consumed, or maybe because she only wished to help her brother. Who knew. 

As their faces closed in on the other she turned away from his slightly, as he reeked of alcohol and if she recalled correctly, puked recently in the diner. A slight wince was made from the treatment on her neck. 

". . . If it pleases you, brother."* - Thu Oct  8 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) has no resistance to his actions, her elder brother having free reign to do as he pleased and as he placed his hand between her legs he'd indeed minorly bother the region but as expected, he wasn't about to do much with how she was currently clothed. 

"Whatever you say." she remarked, though if she had any want to speak any further she would be stopped from doing so as their lips were connected.Preventing her from stripping as requested, if she even had the intention to do so.* - Thu Oct  8 02:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) frowned a little as he departed from kissing her and seemed to traverse into the lower nether regions after undressing her pants down, she mostly had no responsiveness to him as a testament to the fact that she hadn't done anything like this before in her life. Sure, she knew about such things due to general academy lessons and such in regards to kunoichi but experiencing it was a whole leap compared to that. As such, he'd see that her hymen was still very much intact and as he incited something out of her she gasped, quivering slightly at the warm muscle toying with her very sensitive regions. 

Aside from what he had previously parted, she subconciously parted them a little more as she really had no intentions to fight back against him despite the peculiar situation.* - Thu Oct  8 02:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) shook her head as he offered to stop, they had gotten this far, it would have been far more awkward for them to not go through with the action that he had initiated in whatever state he was in. "N-No. . . its fine..i'm sorry, i'm inexperienced." she admitted blatantly out of the sheer assumption that he had mentioned that because she seemed like a dead fish out of water. She was honestly flustered, unsure on what to do but as he removed his pants to showcase his massive appendage that was standing at attention between his legs. 
Aside from what he had done to prepare for penetrating her, she was actually aroused from the excitement of his enticing actions prior, as such natural lubricants would assist somewhat.
This still, was going to hurt. She braced for what was to come and as his flesh met with hers then further beyond a tearing was felt from said area and she cringed. Of course it hurt, but she'd bear it. She shut her mouth and closed her eyes for the moment as he put as much as he could inside of her, they were connected. She clutched at the sheets, muttering a weak, "K-Kojiro. . ." who knows if she would come to enjoy it, but perhaps after she got over the pain it may get better. Only time would tell.* - Thu Oct  8 02:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) let out varying sounds from subtle moans to sharp cries as he persisted to push as deeply as possible into her. Sadly, her vagina was not a bottomless pit for his massive length to bed in and of course he reached certain limits, though as it seemed he intended on bottoming out in her. . . she would be hurt for real, sure to be sore for awhile after this. She teared up a little, too as a result of this sexual squelches sounding off from the pulling and sucking motion of him spearing her so decently. 

Despite the pain, however her body still responded to the arousal and abrupt stimulation, causing her walls to constrict their maximum upon his length and a hot fluid flowed out coating him as he continued to move. She climaxed from being inexperienced, likely paving way for easier access from him, though she shuddered and panted. As time went by the pain very slowly faded and would be replaced by small additions of pleasure should he have kept it up after that.

Her lips quivered, she couldn't speak but in an attempt to regain some control of the situation she reached her arms out towards him. Trying to grasp onto anything,really. Perhaps his neck.* - Thu Oct  8 03:03:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) nodded her head as he spoke towards her, she parted her lips to actually speak too, albeit weakly so. "I. . . alright. . ." she murmured, having him lay atop her fully now since he closed in, her arms hooked around his neck together for the little bit of support she actually maintained herself in this situation. She closed her eyes as their lips made contact once more, even parting her lips at the tongue at the entrance of her mouth. It was let inside as she submissively permitted it. 

As they parted from the liplock however and he declared his intentions, her eyes widened briefly. Something in her knew that it would be bad should anything come of this but at the moment the overall feelings and hormones prevented such words from coming to pass. His rapid pumping ravaging her insides, causing her only to hold on tighter as several audibly pleasurable moans escaped her maw. 

"G-Go ahead..ahh~" she couldn't resist, yet again and so soon her walls had constricted once more for her to inevitable climax on him yet again, perhaps she was aroused entirely too much by him or the whole act of sex itself.* - Thu Oct  8 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) felt the warmth filling her as the final moments of his ever increasing intensity of throbs came to its climax and she could only shudder at the odd feeling it provided her. She however blurted out something as she looked away, the fluids dripping from within her to cause a tickling sensation upon her skin. 

"D-Did you finish with. . . my sister like this too?" wanting to get a grasp on if they all shared the same risks, considering what he did just do. Her face was burning up as she glanced towards him to lock with his gaze,* - Thu Oct  8 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) left the remaining love juices inside as she reached for her panties and pants, sliding them both on. She looked down away from him as their gaze met a second time, bashful. 

"I.. . love you, Kojiro." she remarked sincerely. For whatever reason their family had such a practice for, perhaps he made a mistake doing it with her. Attachments might not have been good for future relationships!!* - Thu Oct  8 03:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) played it off as he stated it in such a way, she wasn't going to outright confess to him just like that afterall. She nodded. "Y-yeah. .  that's what I meant. Uh. . . we should get going, though. Right?" she picked herself up off the bed, though leaned against it as she awaited a response.* - Thu Oct  8 03:55:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) had barely managed to catch the end of the encounter between Marissa and the apparent beast before her and she had paid it mostly no mind, mostly as a testament of the fact that she didn't know what was going on. As far as she knew, it was just a spar and she'd consider it just that. Her face scrunched up slightly as he approached, the odor causing such unconcious action.

"Urgh. . . no. I didn't watch your fight." she shook her head.* - Thu Oct  8 11:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) backs away as the man came closer, only to make way for his walking path of course since it was such a narrow travelling point to the building behind her. Taking a moment to make sense of the broken sentence Maloth spoke, if it could even be considered that. 

At the questioning, she answered honestly. "You smell."* - Thu Oct  8 11:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) gazed up at the hulking man, the aroma around him was intense at such a range but even then she wasn't quite terrified of him as much as she wanted to be away for the sake of her poor nose. She shook her head at his assurance that he smelled good, something must have been deluding him to the truth, her initial thought was that he perhaps had some sort of mental issue with his manner of speech. 

As he unleashed the funk underneath her arm though, she brought her hand up to cover her nose and mouth partially, a muffled voice speaking out. "G-Geez. . . no, no you don't smell good. You smell foul. . .take a bath, guy."* - Thu Oct  8 11:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) frowned as he dared to even get closer to her position, indeed she was backed up into a corner and this was quite the situation to be in and as a result she didn't move; the only way her face was touching the underside of this man's armpit was if he had intentionally did it. His musk traversed her nose unhindered now, she barely had much to prevent this with just her meagre hand. 

"Hnn...y-yes, very manly. . . its a strong smell." she admitted, though she never said she liked it, perhaps that would sate the beast of a man well enough to spare her precious nose that had been through so much already!* - Thu Oct  8 12:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) was suddenly lifted up by the guy, probably her fault for sticking around as long as she did. Her visage was now turned around upside down and she could only hope that this beast was merciful as the girl lacked much in offensive ability or skill at all. Lacking much to say in such a situation she simply stared back at him with wide eyes, knowing full well that potentially angering him may not have been good considering things.

As the author of this character doesn't know what womanly is to Maloth, his inspection would come up with more or less her height of roughly just about average at 5'6", she had a curvy hour glass-esque shape and seemed to be well endowed as far as her bust was concerned.* - Thu Oct  8 13:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) happened to be wearing someone elses clothes, so perhaps they did look oddly familiar should he have known her brother Kojiro. She had an appearance likened to him clothes aside considering they were related. A sigh escaped her and she simply brought her arms up to cross together as opposed to letting them dangle loosely. 

She didn't know this man, but what she did know was that her life likely hung very literally within his grasp. 

Parting her lips to speak as she was addressed, ". . . I'm womanly, sure. But i'm still a shinobi." she took a moment to listen to him once more, having no other options other than just that. "--I'm not going to just scream and flail around for nothing, that's pathetic. Would make me look like some kinda coward. . .and I have a feeling you wouldn't do anything bad." she subtly nodded as best she could in such a position.* - Thu Oct  8 13:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) sat upright upon being placed down, then she promptly rose to stand up as she dusted herself off having been on the ground. Glancing back up at the massive man she rose a hand and rubbed at her nape, that was a bad situation dodged somehow!

"I'm Kaori Yamanshi, and i'm Kojiro's younger sister by one year. So yeah- I know him. It's nice to meet you, Maloth."* - Thu Oct  8 13:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) shook her head at the question, as he claimed to have beaten her brother with ease-- that made her far lesser in standing compared to him. She casted her eyes away momentarily in thought, but returned her gaze afterwards.

"I'm not good at fighting yet, Kojiro's much better than me. . . and i'm no match for you if that's what you want. No fun." she reiterated, just incase he needed a simple answer instead of a sentence to explain.* - Thu Oct  8 13:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kaori(Coolm3) briefly waved at the massive man as he exited and decided to leave. 

"I will! Seeya around." she then went the opposite direction, into the building and beyond.* - Thu Oct  8 13:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamanshi Kojiro(Dragonfile) says: Aye, Kaori. How are you? - Thu Oct  8 18:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kaori(Coolm3) says: I'm fine. - Thu Oct  8 18:42:33 2015
