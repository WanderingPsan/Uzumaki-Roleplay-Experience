<br><font color=yellow>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) *Rymei strolled up the stoney pathway that lead her to the Mizukage's mansion; a building which seemed to be rather vacant or closed to the public in recent times. With the minimalist strength required to push past through the crowd, Rymei was soon found to be in front of the crowd, desiring, no, needing to watch these executions and by the off chance she was offered to finish the job, she would be ready. Her onyx eyes focused on the children who seemed to hesitate, or were possibly just that slow in performing their tasks. The rowdy crowd failed to phase Rymei's cold stare, her tongue slowly etching its way out of her mouth, grazing her lower lip with desire. The girl seemed to stall, at least in Rymei's eyes, as she crossed both arms in front of her chest; cleavage bandaged down tight to give her the appearance of slightly smaller breasts.*)

The crowed continued to roar, but seeing as how the deed was done, it wouldn't be long for them to disperse back into their daily life. Rymei herself would slowly begin to clap, admiring the work they had done. *)* - Fri Dec 11 05:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) (*Rymei eyed the muts with caution, tilting her head slightly as they approached the young kunoichi. As she walked closer, she began to speak, "Cute dogs you have," came out as a look of slight disgust came over her, gaze still on the dogs. "How old?"*)* - Fri Dec 11 05:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) (*Rymei continued to look at the dogs, her black eyes focused on theirs. "That's cute...I'm more of a....Cat person.." she added, turning now to look at the girl. As she did this, she quickly noticed that Anguo was no longer standing where he was meaning he had left without saying a word. *Why does Anguo dislike me...* she thought for only a second before continuing on with the conversation at hand.

"So, how old are you, you little cutie," she commented, holding back the urge to reach out and pinch her cheeks.*)* - Fri Dec 11 05:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) (*Rymei smiled. "That's adorable...Animal breeding. You must have your work cut out for you, right?" she asked, her knees bending slightly as to allow her vision to be about the same height as the girl. Her hands rested on her knees allowing her upper body to remain at its current position. "You're also a Kunoichi, right? I only assume because you were on this mission."*)* - Fri Dec 11 05:28:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Rymei(X_Jake From State Farm_X) (*Rymei continued to smile, this short session having already caused her cheeks to hurt from the lack of smiling Rymei had done over the years. "You know, you seem pretty strong. Would love to see you in a fight." she stated, realizing the girl would rather be doing anything else but this, but she didn't really care. *)* - Fri Dec 11 05:28:28 2015
