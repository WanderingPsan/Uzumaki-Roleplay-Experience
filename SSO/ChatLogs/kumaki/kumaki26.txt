<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Yes you home. I'm starving as well. - Mon Nov 30 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) was kind of weraing some sort of suite where the children of her would fit in. One was one her tumy and one on her back, one was giggling and chuckling.. The other was sleeping. She pulls her arm back and just walks along with Hanae.. Just wondering what she needed.* - Mon Nov 30 10:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I see kids are well awake hmm. - Mon Nov 30 10:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Well hmm - Mon Nov 30 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises a brow, moving her arm and taking the arm of Hanae of her body. 

''Yes I am glad aswell.''* - Mon Nov 30 10:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand up to catch Hanae her hand so she gets pushed back by her hand.. If the hand were to hit on her chist it would hit on the poor baby. 

She then raises a brow and looks around herself at the dust and then back to Hanae. ''Trip..?'' She asks as she looks at her. She moves the bag from her back where the baby was hanging in and brings it to her chest next to their twin. She holds them tight in her arms.* - Mon Nov 30 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her gaze from a neutral one to a piercing glare. Her hand moves up to bring it to the back of the head of the child on her chest who was giggling and laughing, wiggling in the baby bag it was in. 

''You will not touch my children..'' She says, glaring at her. She rubs the back of the baby. The one on her backwoke up and starts to cry. It was hungry... Which in response the other giggling kid starts to cry aswell. Zenaki keeps her glare at Hanae.* - Mon Nov 30 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Where do you want us to go to..? And what's up with your eyes and skin and such... - Mon Nov 30 11:15:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: It'll all be explained later. - Mon Nov 30 11:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at her side at the Zenaki fish like thing, then back at Hanae. he then walks to tbe back of her room, taking stuff and such for her children. With that she fills a back and gives both of the children a toy to nibble and play with. They shut their mouths as she walks back towards Hanae. * - Mon Nov 30 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Good. - Mon Nov 30 11:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Hmm, I wont be needed the copy makes no since to use it. - Mon Nov 30 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just.. Kinda walks along.. She closes her eyes.. She trusts her sister.. And knows Fujitora will come to search for her.* - Mon Nov 30 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) kinda comes there with Hanae. Who seemingly had fallen asleep. They were brought with the caravan or something instead of a long trip. She holds two children in a babybag. One on her chest one on her back, both sleeping. She looks around and stays completely quiet. 

Hanae jut left her behind.. Wait... Was this Konoha..? She raises a brow and looks around. * - Mon Nov 30 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at the blonde girl, looking to her side at Hanae and then at the bag and her own children. She then looks back at the girl before turning and simply walking off. This was her oppurtunity to just go back once again.Her eyes closed as she walks off.* - Mon Nov 30 11:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just walks on, ignoring the woman completely. She was not dealing with her. And this was her oppurtunity to escape/ Zenaki knows very well the woman was about to call her bitch but she  had switched. Zenaki didn't even seem to fucking care about it. Her eyes wander around herself as she had opened them. Her one hand moves in her pocket as in the other one she holds the bag she was carrying with her. One of the children woke up and starts to play with Zenaki's very long white hair. Zenaki allows this ofcourse.* - Mon Nov 30 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes again and she closes her eyes. Her body moves just to bring the baby of her back forwards. WIth that she places the bag on the ground and holds the two children in her arms. Her eyes opened up again to look up at the slimey beats befor turning to look at the female. Zenaki stays completely calm. But the aura around her and the children made everyone around her feel really uncomfortable. Zenaki was not a person to trust. Not at all. Her soulless eyes set one the female, eventually listening to her but her mouth stayed shut. * - Mon Nov 30 12:05:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head, one of the babies started to cry again. 
''You will not get my children, or touch them..'' She says, her voice dark and cold. he hears the slimey beast very well as she keeps the eyes on the person in front of her. 
''I will come along.. This is my hometown anyways. But you will not touch them. What do you need anyways..''* - Mon Nov 30 12:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Zenaki hears the slimey beast and moves to theside to evade the tentacles the first attampt! But the second attempt the babies get snatched from her. Zenaki opens her eyes wide as she babies start to cry out loud. 
''N-No! G-Give them back!'' She yells out.. She turns to look back at the female but before she could say anything more the head of the beast snaps forwards.. She moves to the side, aiming to evade the beast.. SHe takes a deep breath as she had succeeded to evade the best.. Only to get snapped at once again and simply get swallowed up by the best. Zenaki closes her eyes and just kinda struggles in there. She was seemingly scared. Once again. Zenaki was not a combat person, only a medic. Her eyes glance around, frowning. She then opens her mouth and yells out to her children who are crying loud.* - Mon Nov 30 12:21:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) was just kind of brought to god knows where. Zenaki shuts her mouth and closes her eyes, trying not to make a single emotion.. The aura which lingers around her got only darker by the second. She just waits until she was on the place where she was brough to. She doesn't ay anything and stays completely quiet. * - Mon Nov 30 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) is slammed against the floor after she was spit oout. A look of discust on her face as she pushes herself up slowly. Her eyes wander to the next creature. A Kappa thingie. She raises a brow, coughing a few times before looking over towards the female. She squints her eyes and remains quiet. Nope. Zenaki was not a person to give in quickly. Not at all. Her heart was breaking as sshe hears the crying and screaming from her children from upstairs. Oh she wants to go to them so badly. Yet she couldn't.. * - Mon Nov 30 13:00:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) pushes herself up, in a standing position, staring at the female. even taller than herself. Her eyes closed as she decides to once again stay completely quiet. * - Mon Nov 30 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda stares forwards, staying in place and not opening her mouth at all. She had taken note of everything in her room.. And somehow? It felt like home.

''What do you need from me..'' She simply asks as she stood in place, not allowing herself to get ordered around from someone else than her master.* - Mon Nov 30 13:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda remains in place, not moving an inch. Her eyes though, wander around the room.
''You have a nice room here. What do you do here?''* - Mon Nov 30 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Unfortunate. I like to ask questions. Can you answer my question please? I woould like to know more about my new boss. - Mon Nov 30 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) struggles for not even a second to the hold. Zenaki was calm.. Yet the dark aura lingers more and more around her. 
''Theraputical skills humm?'' She says as she just allows the female to do whatever she wants. Knowing she can't do anything anyways. 
''I see.. You need minions.. For your so called army. But I do not do combat. Why need me? I'm useless for an army..''* - Mon Nov 30 13:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda follows the girl with her eyes aorund the room, observing her.
''I am a high skilled medic indeed. I can clone dna, work with dna, clone eyes, like sharingan or byakugan. I can clone complete people and I'm working to get even more skilled. I can kill and heal people with my medical technique's. I work on poisons and drugs. Antidotes and everything. I might even be the best medical person in the world, if I say it myself.'' She says as she observes the girl, taking not of everything she is doing.

<That bitch, Hanae...> She thought to herself in the meantime.* - Mon Nov 30 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I'm a poison specialist, pharmatist, geneticist and surgeon.  - Mon Nov 30 14:15:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: pharmacist* - Mon Nov 30 14:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises a brow as she listens to the female as she stays completely quiet. The children updtairs still  crying, loud. Zenaki her eyes closed as she listens to her children. Her heart was breaking.. Her eyes opened and pierce at the female as she starts to somesort of chant.. In the corners of her eyes she notices the dark stuff creeping closer to her.. And then onto her body.

Her eyess widened up as it started to emerge together with her body. It did burn.. Like hell.. Zenaki keeps her mouth shut, staying quiet as long as she could before starting to scream out thanks to the burning sensation that is caused to her whole body. As if her soul was being ripped from her form and being burned in the sun! She screams only louder and louder as the ritual goes on and on. 

At the end her voice was like gone from the screaming.. She was panting loud and close to collapsing. She moves her head slightly to look up at th beauty, nodding slowly. 
''I-I am planning to work on g-genjutsu.. Aswell...'' She whispers softly, keeping her gaze on the woman.. She didn't even notice her own skin, or eyes ofcourse.* - Mon Nov 30 16:48:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes, taking a deep breath to try and recist the bruning sensation once again. Ah fuck it hurts!

'' S-Seals... T-Two in total..'' She explains, shaking her head after. ''N-No radio..'' She releases a sigh before taking a deep breath again aswell. ''I-I also have medicines.. F-For an illness I have..'' She explains a sshe oppens her eyes slowly to look over at the girl, panting softly once aagin to try and recist the burning senstaion. * - Mon Nov 30 23:37:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: For both security reasons, and due to the fact that you are a tadbit. . . Unappealing to look at. - Mon Nov 30 23:59:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good. We can do that now, I'd suppose. And later, you'll use your surgical abilities to change your look permanently. - Tue Dec  1 00:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I... Don't know if I can... do surgeries on myself..  - Tue Dec  1 00:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda stares at the female,nodding once as she walks of. As she returns, Zenaki her eyes were set on the female again..

Upstairs the children had stopped crying. 
''Black..'' She says in a simple response, waiting to get untied again. * - Tue Dec  1 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) allows herself to get dragged along.. Almost not moving her body because of pain. She then moves up her hands to wash out the dye as it was ordered. Zenaki carefully washed out the dye, leaving a dark red shade on her hair behind. Not like a very bright red. More like a blood red color. Her red eyes ander of towards the blondine as she drenches her hair and then put everything together.. Tying it in a bun without a tie. Just with only her hair.* - Tue Dec  1 00:49:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stood or sat still or whatever, allowing her new master to do what she wanted. 
After some time she opens her eyes and siply looks on. She then makes a nod slowly, mocing to take off her clothes. She didn't care if anyone was around... As of her body. It was a very good looking posture, a tanned skin, big chest and wide hips.. Unfortunate a -lot- of scars are on her form.. Like everywhere... And a seal is placed on her chest. The other one is not able to be seen. 

She takes the new clothing and starts to dress herself, her mouth shut and lips completely flattened. She wasn't saying a word.. None at all. * - Tue Dec  1 01:11:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. - Tue Dec  1 17:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at her side, staying completely quiet. Her now long red hair fits her bright red eyes perfectly. She looks over at Hanae for a small moment, observing her and such before closing her eyes again, saying now word and giving no response. She did not have her babies wwith her. She doesn't even know where they were at the moment... Mosst likely they died. * - Tue Dec  1 19:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: The quiet type? - Tue Dec  1 19:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm? - Tue Dec  1 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: But I mess the long white hair a little. - Tue Dec  1 19:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I see - Tue Dec  1 19:30:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uhm... A-Alright..  - Tue Dec  1 19:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda follows along. She doesnt say anything though. The village brings back so many memories. * - Tue Dec  1 19:36:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Many memories from this place...  - Tue Dec  1 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Well. - Tue Dec  1 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Anything you need help mastering? - Tue Dec  1 19:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm.. - Tue Dec  1 19:43:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: The chakra transfer one still... Poison fog... And might want to learn some genjutsu from you.  - Tue Dec  1 19:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Okay. - Tue Dec  1 19:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Lets start wit your poison fog. - Tue Dec  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. - Tue Dec  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uh. - Tue Dec  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: A-Alright..  - Tue Dec  1 19:46:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Lets go. - Tue Dec  1 19:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time before just making a few handseals. She kneads the chakra in her body and focusses herself really hard. She closes her eyes for a small moment as she blows out the fog from her mouth, up in the air. It seems to be some sort of gas like stuff, and poisoning. 

Zenaki takes steps back away from the gas as she watches it and observes it. It spreads through the area slowly... Since Zenaki is not skilled yet. It is not highly deadly.. But it surely can paralyze the opponent completely after inhaling the fog, in just a few minutes.* - Tue Dec  1 19:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes another few steps behind, staying out of the poison. She really needs a mask for it one day. She looks at her side at Hanae and watches her closely, obviously noticing the hands and she raises a brow.

''What's that on your hands?'' She asks, not even responding to the fact she breathed in some of the poison. Meanwhile Zenaki was building up more and more chakra to create poison. She smiles softly at Hanae as she takes another deep breath, turning around and releases the breath, once again releasing a lot of the poison fog around the area. She walks calmly more south to make sure she doesn't inhale the fog. * - Tue Dec  1 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side, stepping to the side. Wait wait waaaiiittt... Were they going to spar? Oh hell no! She opens her eyes wide and takes quickly a few paces back to make sure to stay out of range! Eventhough she was not quick at all.. She takes the time to build up her chakra again!

With that done she stood still, moving her hands in her pocket and withdrawing a few shuriken. She throws them straight aiming at Hanae, and with that she blows out the poison fog once again. This time it was slightly more powerfull! So once it is blown out, and she would inhale it? It would paralyze her in a few seconds.. From arms slowly down to the toes. Meanwhile Zenaki moves to take steps backwards again! * - Tue Dec  1 20:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) keeps on moving backwards. Meanwhile she moves up her hands up to make some handseals. Those hand immidiatly started to glow a bright blue. She keeps backing off, making sure to stay out of range of Hanae!* - Tue Dec  1 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at Hanae  as she jumps up in the sky. She moves her hands up in the air to look at her and readying herself. She let the blue fade once again as her sister starts to talk. She purses her lips together and quickly forms a few handseals again. She starts to build the chakra in her chest once again and stood still... She inhales deeply and mixes the oxygen together with her chakra.

For a moment she stays completely quiet, still focussing on Hanae in the air. A slight smirk curls up her face as the wind starts to blow, her long red hair waving in the wind around herself. She can only imagine the girl being paralyzed and... Oh.. Zenaki has the urge to torture Hanae so badly right now... At the moment the girl comes down she blows out the fog and creates more distance between the two! Zenaki obviously stays out of the fog as she keeps her eyes focussed on the girl. * - Tue Dec  1 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns on her heels, taking once again a deep breath and she holds it. Zenaki jumps in the middle of the fog, trying to seek a way out this way! She meanwhile makes even more handseals, her hair flowing around her body and her long cloak weaving as she was running through the fog!

Once out of the large fog.. She breath out again and makes the fog even thicker. She then takes another few steps back, staying out of the thick fog! The place Hanae was in now, was also completely fog! And up in the air it was spreading aswell! * - Tue Dec  1 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) keeps away from the poison, only to focus even more chakra into her chest and blowing it out afterwards into the fog. Just to get it more poisonous! She starts to grin as she takes another step backwards. The are the girl was in now was completely one poison bomb! One inhale, just a little bit. Would completely paralyze her now. * - Tue Dec  1 21:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda looks ahead at the girl, smiling softly. 

''Ah. What do you think of it?'' She asks as she moves her hand in her pocket. She waits for the poison fog to fade away. She was slightly panting from all the chakra she had used. Oh god fucking it drains... * - Tue Dec  1 21:10:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Do you like the jutsu? - Tue Dec  1 21:11:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Nah. - Tue Dec  1 21:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) slowly approaches her as the poison fog seems to fade away. Yet. The poison would stay in Hanae's body for a good amount of time. Zenaki twists the needle in her hand slowly as she approaches her, making sure there is no poison in her way. * - Tue Dec  1 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: . . . - Tue Dec  1 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: humfit.. - Tue Dec  1 21:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Do you like the jutsu though?? - Tue Dec  1 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm?? - Tue Dec  1 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: it's okay. - Tue Dec  1 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I can tell you could do better though. - Tue Dec  1 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time. She walks closer and simply places the needle in the skin of the girl, taking her blood, then another needle is taken and she does the same. 

''Ah.. Aye. I could. But I didn't want to kill you. Oh. Want to have some fun?'' She says as she deattaches the needles, shaking up the seringes a tad and looking at them for a moment before placing them back in her medical bag.* - Tue Dec  1 21:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: ... - Tue Dec  1 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Why did you do that? - Tue Dec  1 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Ah.. Never checked on you. I did check a lot of others. Never checked you on your dna and such.  - Tue Dec  1 21:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: why so? - Tue Dec  1 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Scared? - Tue Dec  1 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Destory those samples. - Tue Dec  1 21:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm? - Tue Dec  1 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shrugs.
''Oh well..'' Shebends over and takes the female her feet before she walks off towards the hospital, dragging Hanae over the ground along. * - Tue Dec  1 21:53:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: .. - Tue Dec  1 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda walks by, dragging Hanae behind her over the ground while holding her ancles. * - Tue Dec  1 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: . . . . - Tue Dec  1 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Should I even ask? - Tue Dec  1 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uh.. No..  - Tue Dec  1 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Mitarashi(Maruka) says: Alright. - Tue Dec  1 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: So.. This room reminds me... - Tue Dec  1 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Heh.... - Tue Dec  1 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: This is the room where I failed to transplant Zetsumo's eye..  - Tue Dec  1 22:02:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: . . . - Tue Dec  1 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: It's not nice to tease now zenaki. - Tue Dec  1 22:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Why so? - Tue Dec  1 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Just get to it zenaki. - Tue Dec  1 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: I don't have all day~ - Tue Dec  1 22:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Oh.. But I do~  - Tue Dec  1 22:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Hmm. - Tue Dec  1 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: We so much make up by the way? - Tue Dec  1 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks adown at the paralyzed body. Zenaki places her hands on her and strokes softly over her body. It's fun to see someone completely paralyzed. 

''Ah.. Which techniques are you planning to teach me?'' She asks as she moves her hand over to Hanae's troath slowly.  She strokes along it softly before moving it over at her hair and she takes a good grip of it. She sits down ans takes her well known knife from her pocket. She had no obvious reason to torture her.. But it was just fun~ And this? Meh. Just preparing. She didn't do anything yet because she knows Hanae is a masochist. And as Zenaki believes. The best torture for a masochist is no torture at all. * - Tue Dec  1 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves the dagger and presses it down at her chest, she then starts to cut away the clthing on her body.. Upper body that is. She inspects her body and smiles softly. 

''I see..'' She says as she observes the body. ''Turned out quite nice huh..?'' She says as she observes the now way more manly body of Hanae. She then places the sagger onto her chest, piercing into her flesh. She starts to carve down a sign onto her chest. The Kenryoku one. Kenryoku will stay in Zenaki's heart forever. * - Tue Dec  1 22:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time, moving the dagger to the side and just let the sign bleed.
''I know. And themost fun is that I will not do anything to you. And you can't do anything.'' Zenaki says with a slight smirk, her hand now moving and pressing into the wound she just caused, forcing her finger inside to make the cuts even deeper and wider.. Just to make sure a scar is left as some sort of tattoo. * - Tue Dec  1 22:47:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: .. - Tue Dec  1 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Such a tease. - Tue Dec  1 22:53:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) chuckles softly as she takes the dagger again, bringing it over to Hanae's pants. She starts to cut it away before placing the fat iron against her panty. 
''But I can also please you... Hm~ '' Zenaki starts to chuckle again as she moves the dagger, pressing the handle softly against her clit. She stares down at Hanae as her other hand was forcing itself to make the wound on her chest more bloody and such. * - Tue Dec  1 22:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: It's no fun when I cant hold onto you... - Tue Dec  1 23:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm~  - Tue Dec  1 23:02:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) chuckles again, twisting the dagger to cut away the panties on her form. She then turns the dagger again, pressing the hilt against her folds while she moves to press her thumb against her clit. She leans in to press a kiss against the lips of her not blood related sister.. Only to distract her a little bit before forcefully pressing the hilt of the dagger inbetween  her walls. * - Tue Dec  1 23:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shizan, Nigen(Un-Holybond) says: Hm? - Tue Dec  1 23:18:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) simply shrugs her shoulders in response as she looks over at her new master. She closes her eyes, only to take a deep breath afterwards. She opens her eyes again and stares towards the ground, staying quiet for a moment longer..

The breeze of the wind flows through her long soft red hair as she stares towards the ground, thinking a bit. She then looks up again towards her master and the nods..
''Brings back a lot of memories.'' She says with her usual cold voice, yet there is some sort of hint of affection in it. Because. Well she's her master after all. * - Wed Dec  2 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide out of the sudden as she brings up her children, she eyes the blondine and frowns softly. She stays quiet as she listens, but meanwhile her thorughts are running to the children! Are they really dead yet? Or perhaps still alive!? 

All Zenaki wants to do right now is run towards where the children are left behind and picke them up, take care of them immidiatly.Even with Zenaki have given birth to a twin.. She was still quite good formed. Her belly was maybe a little bit flabby.. But it was not horribly or something. No it was not perfectly flat. But Zenaki isn't a person of combat either to train it away.

Her eyes closed as the hand is placed on her chin and her head is lifted to meet eye level... As she starts to speak her eyes opened again to look with her own red devious eyes in Asteroth's eyes. She then starts to glare.. Nobody touches her children. Only Zenaki was going to do whatever she wanted with them. 

''You will not touch my children...'' She says with a scowl to her new master, keeping her glare fixated on her. * - Wed Dec  2 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down for a small moment, looking down at her skin for a moment before looking up at the Necromancer, listening to her words.. She then shakes her head.
''I will never li--..'' SHe is stopped at that moment, feeling a burning sensation in her body, she grunts in pain.. With that her mind gets switched and taken over, her eyes closed because of the burning pain. Ah fuck. 

She listens to her words and nods slowly as she opens her eyes, slowly following the female. Zenaki's eyes are fixated on the ground as she follows behind and she says nothing.. Her eyes are slightly glazed over.. Her eyes moved up to look at her master as she follows after her.* - Wed Dec  2 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at her as she starts to speak, her mouth pursed shut as she was demanding the new name for her. Or well, how she would agreee. Her eyes closed.. Deep inside the Zenaki who had been taken over refuses to do so! Her glassy eyes moved to the side, away from her master. She was not going to say that. No way. 

But as she refuses she feels her mind being taken over by the female, her insides burning thanks to the female. She closes her eyes and releases a soft pant from the pain. She then nods slowly. 

''Y-Yes.. M-Mistress...''* - Wed Dec  2 09:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) follows after the female, looking around herself once they had approached the house. The two children were panting in the middle of the room, obviously sick! Zenaki quickly walks towards the two and lifts them up before walking over at the couch and placing them down. She sits down on her knees in front of them.. Their cheeks are flustered red.. They were warm and sweating. Not much time left.

Zenaki looks quite worried at her children, even with her glassy eyes. She takes the bag she always has with her and places it down before removing the clothing fro the children, not completely but just to give them some cooling. She then moves in her bag to retrieve two injection needles.. She takes a foot of each baby and injects the needle in them.. They start to cry out loud, cough and pant even more. But this was some sort of medicine to bring the two back to a healty state as soon as possible!

''I'm sorry..'' She whispers to her children as she was working on them to keep them alive and bring them back in a healty state. She checks the pulses and stuff before giving them what they needed... Food! 

Zenaki sits down on the couch and lifts up both her children.. She places them at the same time on her lap and pulls up her shirt. Even for a mother. She had still her perfectly rounded giant breasts. The children immidiatly seek for comfortance and they start to simply drink the mother milk. Zenaki releases a faint sigh.. As long as the children eat.. It's all fine. A soft smile curls on her face as she pets through the hair of the lovely baby's. 

Her eyes then moved up, to look at her master.. As if seeking some sort of approval of her. Zenaki just did her first medic thing since she'd been back in konoha. * - Wed Dec  2 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at the children who are just ding their thing.

''They can't eat regular food yet.'' She simply says in response. Nope. Zenaki didn't fucking care if someone were to see her body. Not at all.
''If you don't like it. Then just don't look..'' She turns a bit with children in her arms.. After they were simply done she places the chidldren on the couch, moving back her shirt and such. Her eyes are set on her children as she strokes through their hair. * - Wed Dec  2 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: to amsterdam yes :p - Wed Dec  2 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda listens to her as she lifts the children again, holding the children in her arms as she feels the burning sensation in her body again. She closes her eyes and winches as she listens to the female. 

Her eyes opened sloely as she listens to the not human part. She raises a brow for a moment to look up at the blondine as she holds her children, soothing them from their sickness. They need to get healty quickly... She slowly nods in response... As if she was agreeing. She had to after all.. Her eyes moved to look down at her children.. Her children like that female?

''N-Necromancer.. Huh...'' She says softly as she looks down at her children. * - Wed Dec  2 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at her, holding her babies a tad more close against her. She shrugs her shoulders.
''I have met a lot of people who are a tad the same as you. Same sort of power.. Powers not from this world... One of that is my brother's own.'' She explains as she keeps her eyes on her. * - Wed Dec  2 10:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at her children again before closing her eyes. She says nothing and just hoists them up slightly and holds them tighter against herself, letting the children snuggle with her. She stays just quiet. * - Wed Dec  2 10:28:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I already was a time ago. Yes.  - Wed Dec  2 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Good. . Put them to rest, I'd suppose. When will you demonstrate your abilities to me? - Wed Dec  2 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time before placing the children on the couch, she plants a soft kiss on their heads before they fall asleep. She then walks over towards the blondine.

''I can't really show of my ailities if I don't have a toy for experiments or a patient to help.''* - Wed Dec  2 10:42:33 2015
