<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: And why me?  - Thu Oct 29 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: There have been other people that I've asked before you. - Thu Oct 29 17:41:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Really depends on the experiment itself and the jutsu I give you. - Thu Oct 29 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Genjutsu could help you understand the mind and chakra flow system even better . . . As well as how the techniques work. - Thu Oct 29 17:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Elemental jutsu could show properties special to them and you could try and create those properties your own way. - Thu Oct 29 17:45:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Fuuinjutsu, Well Fujitora knows more about it and I'm sure he's already explained a lot to you about it though you could use sealing techniques for your experiments as well as extra storage. - Thu Oct 29 17:46:40 2015

''Don't call me nasty. You're the one who is nasty..'' She says in a cold tone before walking over at Shin. She moves to sit next to him.* - Thu Oct 29 18:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him for a small moment, nodding a time.
''We are all fne hm..'' She says, moving her arms to wrap them around her growing belly softly.* - Thu Oct 29 18:36:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at him, her arms moved from her growing belly into a fold. She doesn't say anything. Meanwhile in her head she was thinking and thinking.
''The best torture for someone like you is no torture at all.'' She says again. This is a common sentence from Zenaki to Shinji.* - Thu Oct 29 18:48:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves to stand up, she walks over at Kilm. Her rleft hand moves up to take the boy in her hand by his hair before slamming him towards the ground forcefully. She then walks on, towards wherever they could practice. All  right before the summon was made.
Her right hand remained rubbing over her lower belly softly, as a small bump was there.
''Come Kilm..''* - Thu Oct 29 18:54:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Coming. - Thu Oct 29 18:55:47 2015

''I'll heal him later. I need him for experiments after all..''* - Thu Oct 29 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Which jutsu have you decided to trade? - Thu Oct 29 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda walks into her house, allowing Kilm to go inside and locking the door behind herself. * - Thu Oct 29 18:58:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Shin as she keeps the door unlocked for a moment longer. 
''Need anything?''* - Thu Oct 29 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Not really, just wondering what's happening - Thu Oct 29 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Nothing special.  - Thu Oct 29 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Kilm, you want him to go along or? - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I can teach both of you. - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Then I have less worries. - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sure. - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Come in, Shin. - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'd rather have a scroll to be honest. - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I could learn at my own pace then. - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: . . . - Thu Oct 29 19:03:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) locks the door after. As always.
''I don't care if you want a scroll or such. You want to learn with me. You'll master it today. I don't care about how many chakra you loose. We'll fix that.'' She moves over towards another door, opening it up and walking towards the basement. She takes one of her very own prisoners, taking his limp body and dragging him upstairs. He was fearing and shaking. But his body was paralyzed so he simply couldn't do a thing. She closes the door after with her foot, letitng it fall locked while she places the prisoner on the ground.
''We'll use this guy.'' She says before moving her hand in her pocket, taking her dagger.
''We'll start of with the most simple, basic healing thing.'' She says as she makes a cut in his leg. Just a simple one. The prisoner stays quiet as he refuses to scream.
Zenaki moves her dagger back in place and moves her both hands up, forming a very simple small set of handseals. ''Insert your chakra's in your palms..'' Her palms started to glow a very light green..'' And place it on the wound. Make sure to insert enough chakra and mould the cells together.'' She explains as she does so.. After a few minutes she moves her hand away and only a very faint small scar is left on the males leg. * - Thu Oct 29 19:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Teaching the others this... Less saving lifes for me.. - Thu Oct 29 19:17:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) watches the boys do their magical skills on healing. Mmmhng.. It was more fun if this guy was going to scream and shout out in pain. But they were to gentle with him.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks down the stairs, gesturing for the both of them to follow.
             Down in Zenaki's basement it is freezing cold. Limbs, bones, blood, organs and corspes everywhere. No wonder why this door aswell is most of the times locked. 
She motions for Shinji to take a seat on one of the ripped chairs, next to a corpse. 
''Take a seat...''* - Fri Oct 30 18:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Shinji, saying nothing. She walks of towards a dressoir and takes a bottle from in. Two even. She looks at them for a small moment, nodding once. She places one of the two bottles back into dressoir, only to walk over towards a table. There she would place the bottle down and take some seringes with needles. WIth that she walks back to the table and takes the bottle with genes, mixed with a liguid. She takes the seringes and fills them for 1/4.. Another bottle was taken to fill it full with another liquid. She taps the seringes to make them ready.
''Hmmm~ I got you some needles.'' She says to Shinji.* - Fri Oct 30 19:17:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks over at the boy, one of the needles with seringe connected in her hand.
What she had done before hand is parting the genes from the blood she had taken from Lera. She had chakra genes and dust release. Intresting. So this would hopefully work out for her own benefit. He was going to be her bodyguard. Along with some others perhaps. One of her lovely dolls. 

The blood from Lera she had parted from the DNA.. The DNA is mixed up with a special liquid which will travel through his vains. This liquid contains special ingredient to make sure the DNA and his own DNA will be mixed together well. It was an ingredient which would fit all of the bloodgroups. Prefect for her experiments. 

The female set her gaze on the boy in front of her, which was now laying face first on the ground. Her leg extends, kicking the boy over to make him rolld through her basement.. Probably through a few organs and limbs.. She didn't care about it. He would end up against a wall which was covered in blood. 

''Mmm~ Shinji Shinji.. Are you ready my dear?'' She says in a seductive tone as she walks over towards him. She crouches down in front of him and grabs his neck with her free hand, squeezing it to choke she shit out of him. Her other hand moves forwards, pressing the needle in his vein in the neck.. She empty's it.. She ofcourse is sure to not kill him with this needle in his neck. As soon as she moved it out of his neck.. Her other thumb moved to press the small wound closed.. So he doesn't lose any blood. By placing the needle in his neckvein it would spread through his body quicker. * - Fri Oct 30 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves away from the boy again, moving up her foot to plant it in his face.. Just as she hears screaming and knocking from upstairs. She sighs a time. 
''Master.. Enjoy yourself a little longer. Someone is here for me again..'' She walks away from Shinji, upstairs and such. Opening the door , only to stare down at the tiny Hanae.* - Fri Oct 30 20:57:23 2015

She turns to look back again at Paine and nods.
''You can join a time.. To just watch...I mean I watched you train aswell. Hm..'' She says to her in response before giving a slight glance back again towards Tetsumi and Izanami. She looks down again at her growing belly. She was thinking.. Should.. Should she approach the both of them? Should she do it and tell them if they don't know it yet? Master would never tell them.. Or.. When the time comes. He never really talks to them aswell.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Izanami and Tetsumi again. She sighs softly before walking over towards the both of them. She moves to sit down in front of them, on the ground. She was quite nervous. She never really.. Had a talk with them. But she didn't want her Master to leave his chiildren alone like this. She might be fucking evil and devilish. But she has a great heart for family. 
She looks up at the both of them, smiling softly.. Before whispering softly to them. * - Sun Nov  1 20:22:24 2015

''If you feel like it.. You can... Just walk in.. I'll leave my house open..'' She says with a soft smile to him before looking down at the small girl.* - Sun Nov  1 20:46:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a slow time. She looks over at Tetsumi in the distance, then down at the little Izanami. She looks back up at her Master again.. A slight stern look on her face.. And this evil aura of her would awaken a slight bit aswell as she stares at him. She starts to whisper in a slight cold voice. But still in her own way towards her Master.* - Sun Nov  1 21:39:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Mm.. I told the both of them.. That I would talk to you about them... It's.. You are at the moment not a good father... You don't..

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I can't chase after kids who always run from me..My kids such as Izanami do not run..They know their father loves them..What everyone outside of out family says are hateful lies. - Sun Nov  1 21:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him, nodding slowly beflore looking down at the ground.
''Family is family. If they run away or not. Sometimes a child who runs away from you.. Needs you.. Eventhough they say they don't need you, hate you and everything.. They need your love. I know Izanami gets enough love from you.. But Tetsumi.. Feels alone without you. I can see it in his eyes. He needs you.. Eventhough I know he might respond short to you... Say he doesn't need you.. And everything. He needs you. I care for him, and for Iza.. As much as I care for you..'' Zenaki's tone was soft and warm.. Hushed aswell so only Fujitora could hear...

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her stare over at Yuudai, staring. She says nothing. But the evil aura alone would probably scare him away. * - Sun Nov  1 21:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: That was a boring rip. - Sun Nov  1 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks back at Fujitora again. She shakes her head.
''If he doesn't want to talk to you... How... C--..'' She stops with her whispers as Regual appeared behind her. Zenaki has a really evil aura around her right now. She turns to look at Reguel, staring at him. ''Get away..''* - Sun Nov  1 21:57:58 2015
