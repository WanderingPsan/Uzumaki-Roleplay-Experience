<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand out to backhand the girl once across her face. Nothing really hard.. But just to let her remember things.. 

She turns to look over at Hanabi and stares at her.. Staying all quiet. * - Mon Sep 14 17:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hands out in a swift motion, piercing a senbon in Amai's leg to paralyze the leg with ease... Was she sure?* - Mon Sep 14 17:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) keeps her gaze on the girl, staring with her deadly eyes. Her hand promptly moves forwards, sending a taser onto Amai's body and she simply let's the electricity flow through her body. Her gaze remains deadly.. The tazer causes the body of Amai to paralyze for a small moment.. Just enough for Zenaki to place four senbon in her body.. one in each hip and one in each shoulder... Paralyzing the girl from her movement. She moves to sit down on her and stares down at Amai.

''You sure you want to disrespect me hm...?''* - Mon Sep 14 17:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: You talk alot. - Mon Sep 14 17:50:17 2015

''Shut up. You did disrespect me, again. Stop doing that. I know plenty of people who would like to have your heart...'' Her voice fades into a seductive and very deadly whisper as she keeps her eyes onto Amai.* - Mon Sep 14 17:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanabi(Iron Zorro) says: -omit- - Mon Sep 14 17:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at the girl next to her, glaring. She then looked back at Amai again.. Then a voice of Beth was able to be heared.. It made her shiver and close her eyes. She turns to look and stares at Beth with deadly eyes. She then averts her gaze onto Yumiko. Her hand moved up and motioned the girl over.* - Mon Sep 14 17:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: Oh, the slave. - Mon Sep 14 17:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) glares down at Amai again. 

''Are you going to listen again? Amai?'' She says as she glares down at her. Her right hand moved down on top of her leg again as Yumiko stood by her side. Still her favourite.* - Mon Sep 14 17:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. - Mon Sep 14 18:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) pushes herself up from Amai's paralyzed body before shifting her deadly gaze on Hanabi for a moment. 

''You also better say no rude words or anything alright?'' She says with her calm but deadly tone. She then looks back at Amai as she simply waits for a response. Her foot is lifted and only just placed down on her stomach.. If she would say anything stupid? Who knows...* - Mon Sep 14 18:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) says: ... - Mon Sep 14 18:15:02 2015

''Good..''

She turns to look at Hanabi. ''What is your name?''* - Mon Sep 14 18:18:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand up, petting on the shoulder of Paine once. Ssshh..

Her hand lowers next to her body again.

''Tell me... Snakes huh?''* - Mon Sep 14 18:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) locks her gaze on Hanabi.. As she explains and permforms. She watches her and nods a few times. ''Very nice.. I -will- talk to you later..'' Her voice demanding.. Just like Zetsumo's usual voice.. Only ofcourse a female version.

She moves to look down at Amai. She stares down and takes the senbon, releasing her slowly from her paralyzed state. 

''Next time you will be dissobeying me...I don't know how it will end for you... Might be really lucky... Might be reallyy.. Unlucky... I can heal you.. But not save you..''

She places the bloodied and well senbon into her pouch, cleaning them later.. Or not? Who knows...She turns and heels off, Yumiko most likely following her. * - Mon Sep 14 18:46:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Suitengu, raising a brow for a small moment as he reguested such a thing. She closes her eyes, thinking for a moment as she keeps on listening. She then nods a time to him.

''Alright... So just cut you open, stab, such things? If.. If you think you can't hold the pain anymore just tell me. I will stop immidiatly and heal you up.. Alright?'' * - Wed Sep 16 13:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time as she takes out four senbon. She shoots them from her fingers and theywould land in his shoulders and legs to paralyze him completely. Heh.

She then would walk over.. Her soft gaze turned out of nowhere in a cold one. A very deadly cold one. The female moved up her right foot and kicks down a heel in her little nephews torso. Then another kick was given onto his stomach. 

She then crouches down and stares down at the child.. Her right hand flicked from her pocket and she holds a dagger in her hand. A dagger she always uses to cut people open.. Surgery, dead bodies, limbs.. Whatever.  The knife is moved and pierced deeply in Suitengu's arm. Luckiy Zenaki was a medic so she knew where she could and where she could not stab someone. She makes sure she isn't making any lethal injury as she cuts open the boy slowly.

In her other hand also had flicked a dagger now.. She stabs it in his leg and cuts it open aswell, slowly on.. Really slowly.. As if she was performing a surgery for something lethal.. But then now she did it without looking.. And staring towards the boy on the ground.

This was just the beginning...* - Wed Sep 16 13:30:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) pulls out both the knifes before plopping down. SHe sighes softly as she hears a voice. She looks up towards the sky towards Hanabi. 

''Go away. I need to help him.'' She told her with a stern voice as she stabd one of the knifes out of nowhere in the boys stomach area, twsiting it around slowly and very painfull. Zenaki knows exactly what she is doing. She turns her head and looks back at Suitengu. She watches him with her very own dull and deadly gaze, waiting for him to scream out in pain.* - Wed Sep 16 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks towards her side as she pulls the knife from the stomach of the poor boy. She then looks back once again at the boy, leaving him to practice a bit. ''Why are you watching.'' She said nonchalantly as she keeps her gaze on the boy in front of her.. Somewhere soon Zenaki was about to push the knife right again! 

And ofcourse that happend. After giving the boy a few seconds of rest she presses the knife against his chest, cutting him open there.. Then she slifes it with a lot of pressure behind it towards the other arm who wasn't stitcihes up yet. Her other hand now moves towards the previous wound on his other arm.. She let's go of the knife and takes the threads in her fingers, pulling on them to forcefully pull them out once again. * - Wed Sep 16 14:01:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at the boy before moving away her hands of the boy. 

''Stitch yourself up. You can go on?'' She would ask before she does anything else. She knows this is his own wish.. She then moved her hand ut of nowhere and stabbing the poor young boy right into his leg once again. Time to play~ 

A bit of distracting is good for his training. Zenaki's free hand moved to pull out the senbons of his paralyzed body. He now.. if he wishes.. Can move again. His legs and arms will still feel pretty numb though.  Her hand twisted and pressed the four senbon at the very same time into his ancles.. All four at the same time. * - Wed Sep 16 14:13:32 2015

This would have been one bloodbath if Suitengu had blood. SHe closes her eyes for a small moment before piercing both the saggers in his stomach area. She leaves them there. Her nowfree hands moved to pierce the senbons back into his shoulders.. Numbing his both arms again. 

''Try to get those out with your threads.'' She says before she looks back at the girl next to her again.

''I just wonder what your body is like with those feather stuff.. And without.. Like DNA and such.''* - Wed Sep 16 14:25:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly as she reached to pull out any remaining senbon. She ofcourse heals those wounds aswell...

''Mhm... '' She places the senbon in her pocket, and her knifes ofcourse aswell. She then moved and picked up the boy to place him back on his feet.* - Wed Sep 16 14:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head slowly.

''You know very well what you've done. Be happy I didn't go to Zetsumo yet or used you for one of my experiments..'' She says, a tad louder since she was kind of getting angry. And Beth walked away from her.* - Wed Sep 16 15:28:38 2015

''I will tell you if something happends.. But you were busy. And.. Some things did happen after the last time I told you about with that stripping. Don't know if she told you already..'' The female closes her eyes as she moves to lean back against the candy machine. * - Thu Sep 17 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns her head slightly to look aroud. 

''Eating is good enough..'' SHe says before closing her eyes.

''I didn't tell anyone.. Only her and me knows... And Misa.. I didn't want to go to you because you were so busy hm..'' A long pause follows as she opens her eyes agan. This was obviously on her mind.

''She.. She kinda made me move my body.. And... Do things to myself.. Again in a local bar.. Misa watched from a distance.. Without me knowing it... And she walked up at the end.'' Zenaki closes her eyes. ''But Misa was there for me at the end... She and Beth talked, normally.. As soon as Beth walked away Misa came to me and helped me.. That was when I was knocked out. I think she brought me to you or something? I don't know..''* - Thu Sep 17 15:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Zetsumo,, curious now. 

''Same thing hm?'' She asks in a curious manner before leading Zetsumo off to a dinner area.* - Thu Sep 17 15:16:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sits down and closes her eyes as she listens and the question was asked. 

''No much hm... Just taught Katsune that uhm bandage stuff with the grass or sand.'' She responds before opening her eyes. She orders some sake. Because sake is sake. * - Thu Sep 17 15:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the sake in her hand and just stares at it all quiet. She then closes her eyes as she takes a sip from it.. It's quiet a little longer.. Before she parted her lips and started to speak.

''I have not all the requirements. Plus you don't handed me some good orders.. And there are no wounded.. Plus my dolls aren't around to test anything on and such.''  She takes another sip, now waiting for her sibling to respond.* - Thu Sep 17 15:34:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) // Her chin is being grasped and turned to the side to face her brother. She closes her eyes to stop the eye contact and just simply listens. She winches a bit form the pain in her chin as it was being hold really tight. She doesn't respond to him. She was way to lazy to do stuff anyways. And she's being forced to do all of this. She doesn't even like it. 

''You said you were going to get me jutsu scrolls.. I didn't see them yet..'' The female responds after some time, her eyes still closed. She was being arrogant. * - Thu Sep 17 15:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) feels herself being lifted a tad, the pain in her chin only grow more. She was going to take that pain away when she did put him down. 

''I-I am the only medic around. And wounding a medic is not a good thing.'' She says kind of arrogant in response. She lifts her hands and aims to take the fingers away from her chin. 

''B-but I will try to change.. For as far as I can...'' She responds after, wicnhing in pain as she talked.* - Thu Sep 17 16:04:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes to look at her brother. She listens to him... After she is pulled closer.. And she nods once.. But then she gave a shrug of her shoulders.

If she even could.* - Thu Sep 17 16:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) is being lifted and pushed against the wall. Her hands remaines on the fingers she tries to pull them away. She then grunts and winches as she is being whipped against the chest by threads. 

''I-I.. I try my best brother.. But I can't promise anything.. And about that sickness. It is not completely gone. But it is m-much less then it was. '' The female says as she moves her hand to grab those threads. Probably not the best move of her.

''I am not ticking you off... And I would like to learn the jutsu. I-I have nothing better to do anyways right now. I-I don't get orders from you.. And I have nobody to heal.. What do you expect me to do then?''* - Thu Sep 17 16:58:40 2015

She listens to his words as she opens her eyes to stare at the ground. She lifts her gaze and looks up against her brother.. Indeed there was a red mark left on her cheek. And ofcourse wromg the whips on her chest aswell. But that was covered by the cloak. 

''Y-Yes.. Brother..'' She says in response as she keeps her gaze upon him. The pain on her body currently was still nothing compared with what had happend after the surgery.. Or the shame she felt with what Beth did to her. She closes her eyes and moves to push herself upwards. 

''Poisons..... Paralyzing.. Poisons... Anything else..?'' She says as she makes her hands ready for handseals.. Just to heal herself up a bit and release herself from the pain.* - Thu Sep 17 17:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would have a scroll throwed at her chest. The female winches lightly as she moves her hands to take the scroll in her hands. She looks at it for a small moment before nodding to her brother.

On her cheek were two big red marks able to be seen and her chin was also a reddish color.

''I am going to heal myself up a bit more and practice, alone.. Brother..'' She responds as she walks off, ignoring anything else around her.* - Thu Sep 17 19:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda leans back with both her arms folded and her eyes closed..
She then opens them up and moves her one hand to take a scroll. She opens it. It was the scroll she had gotten from her brother earlier. She reads the contents inside of it. A B-rank jutsu? Oh goodness. 

Zenaki moves oner of her legs to slightly fold it over the other while reading the scroll.. Chakra onto the hands.. Easy.. Then make blades out of them? Hmm.. She closes her eyes for a moment to think as a slight bit of wind brushes through her long white hair. She then opens her eyes again to read the scroll.. Going all the way down towards the end. She nods for herself a time before she sits down.. She rolls the scroll up and puts it away. 

Her right hand moved upwards torub over her cheek. It was still a bit sore and feeling painfull.. Her right hand moved on her chest, feeling over her chest. Yep. Still sore. She righs and brings both her hands forwards. She weaves through a few seals before her hands start to glow a green hue. She places her hands down on top of her chest as she keeps her eyes closed. * - Fri Sep 18 07:36:44 2015

Her hands lowered from the jutsu she just did and moved inside of her pocket. She waits for a small moment and keeps her eyes on the boy next to her. As soon as he started to scream out and kick the machine.. The medic makes a swift move with her hand and presses a senbon in his spine. It's not fatal at all.. But it just paralyzes the body completely. 

Zenaki closes her eyes again for a moment as she turns.. She now opens them again and stares down at the boy. She says nothing, at all.* - Fri Sep 18 07:48:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time before she moves her hand forwards to pull her senbon out. But she stops. She looks at Kilm for a moment, glaring at him. It was true though. But Zenaki was rather calm. Her hand now takes the senbon and slowly pulls it out.
She stands up and pushes the boy over onto his chest, with force ofcourse. She places her heel down onto his back and pushes against his back with her heel as she leans down to take the senbon from his neck. She then moves to stand again and lean against the wall. The two bloodied senbon are placed back in her pocket. * - Fri Sep 18 08:10:52 2015
