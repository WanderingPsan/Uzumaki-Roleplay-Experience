<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) allows her face to get backhanded. A sly grin curls on her lips.

''What.. You're scared of a medic. who is there to help people..''* - Wed Dec  2 11:35:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) steps back, being pushed against the closet behind her. The door cracks as she is ppushed against it, breaking out of there. She grunts for a moment before looking up at her master.

''W-WHat is a better way to proof myself to you than you just feeling it yourself.. Are you scared that I will kill you?''* - Wed Dec  2 11:38:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to winch and bend over a bit as she feels the burning sensation i nher body again. She grunts and tries to resist herself from the pain. But oohhggoodd... This is so painfull.. 

''I-I'm sorry...'' She says softly, trying not to scream from the pain. Zenaki's durability is like really low.. She is easily pained.* - Wed Dec  2 11:45:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) had her eyes closed, leaning against the broken closet. She was seemingly asleep as she doesn't respond.

The two babies were chuckling and giggling as the play with eachother on the ground.* - Wed Dec  2 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes slowly as she was flicked on the forehead. She looks up at Asteroth before looking at the door. She sighs softly and pushes herself up, walking over to the door and opening it up.. Just to see who might be there.* - Wed Dec  2 22:18:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at her side to Menma before releasing a soft sigh.* - Wed Dec  2 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) kinda stares at the male.. 

''I have to proof myself that I am a worthfull medic. So just a simple gene transplantation..''* - Wed Dec  2 23:04:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Hrm? It doesn't have to be that significant, you know. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But it's your choice, I'd suppose. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: If it will... - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) thinks: I'd be intrigued if she could even changet he natural color of his head. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Menma(The Kuro Neko) says: Help secure Asteroth-sama...Something she needed. - Wed Dec  2 23:05:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda places her bag on the ground and takes out a small computer. She places it to the side and starts it. She then takes a seringe and places it inside of the computer. She clicks on some things and let the seringe be filled with some stuff. She takes it out of the computer and shakes it up a bit. She then looks over at the guy. 

She sighs softly and then looks at Asteroth for a small moment, only to look back at the guy.

''I'm just.. gonna inject this into you..'' She simply explains before walksing over at the boy. She takes his hand and places the needle on his wrist, only to push it inside of the vein. She then pushes the seringe empty. It was filled with a special liquid that would go together with the blood perfectly fine. It was no blood transfusion or something, but this helped to make the genes attach to his dna. 
The genes were speed genes. It would make him faster perhaps! 

But oh no. She did it wrong somehow. Damn. She accediently did a tad to much... Possibly just slowing him down right now. She squints her eyes at her tiny fail, pulling out the needle and placing it to the side. She averts her eyes to the side. She failed.. A soft sigh escapes her lips but she said nothing as she cleans her stuff up again. * - Wed Dec  2 23:26:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) glares up at Asteroth as she is talking about how useless she is in some sort of way. She then looks back at the boy before closing her eyes. She shakes her head abother moment before looking to the side. She places everything back in her bag and sits down on the ground.

''I'm sorry miss whatever. I have studied medical stuff for over 10 years now. Everybody can make a fault. Besides. It's not even my fault. His body just doesn't react like it should. He's fucking weak.'' She says simply.. The evil aura forms around her once again.. Oh.. She was pissed. Why of all the times... Today has to go wrong..

She releases another sigh after everything, thinking.  How was she going to work on this... To make things..Succesfull? She doesn't know.. Maybe she should just focus on her poisons again.. Or maybe her needles.. Her eyes averted to the two children that were playing on the ground.* - Wed Dec  2 23:39:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Might just.... Concentrate on my poisons... And more jutsu's... Mmmhh..  - Wed Dec  2 23:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand up to rub over the back of her head as she was being smacked. She just let out a soft ''tsk'' before she continues to think. Think about how to improve herself. * - Wed Dec  2 23:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Menma? - Wed Dec  2 23:56:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Paine, frowning softly before turning and head off. Paine would most likely be able to recognize her voice. But her appearance was almost impossible to recognize. Maybe her eye color? 

Zenaki just slowly follows after her mistress.. Even if she didn't want to. Where were they going?* - Thu Dec  3 00:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just follows along, no longer paying attention to the taijutsuist. Her eyes closed as she followed.. Wherever they were heading off to. * - Thu Dec  3 00:20:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sits down next to the water, staring in it. Her hand reached forwards, poking the water softly as she was lost in her thoughts.* - Thu Dec  3 00:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at Asteroth as some sort of order is given. Her soulless sad and glazed eyes are set on her before she pushes herself upwards and slowly walks over. She then starts on whatever was demanded. Her thoughts wandering off again on what to do next with her medical life. She had to proof herself.. In a week... Or else...

Zenaki releases a soft sigh as she was working on whatever she had to do. 

(im.. probs going to head off to bed. its almost 2 am) * - Thu Dec  3 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) was currently sleeping with two children in her arms. Two babies. The children were also sleeping on top of her chest. Her eyes are closed.. And she doesn't seem to respond to the poke on her shoulder. 

''mmmh...'' Was the onlysound she made.. While she was alseep. Possibly some sort of response to the poke.* - Thu Dec  3 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes slowly as she found an hand around her neck.. She tries to take a deep breath but it was difficult to breath... Her eyes are blackened. Not because she is punched or something but because she was taken over. Her soul was taken over. Her skin is a slight blue like color. The medic hears her old name and her eyes open up a little bit more, still trying to breath normally.

''Z-Zenaki...''

Her voice is soft, yet cold.. It also seem to whisper. Zenaki was so lost.. Her eyes look at her children before she moves them to the side, slowly observing the figure next to her. Her eyes slowly on wander more upwards.. Her black eyes now met the dulled emerald eyes. Zenaki's eyes seem to be lonely and sad...And all glazed over. There is no shimmer in it at all. 

''Paine..''

She says softly the name of the female as she recognizes her, only to winch out of nowhere as she feels a burning sensation inside of her body. The burning sensation of her soul.. Her eyes closed as she moves her body slightly, softly panting and trying to get her breath. * - Thu Dec  3 14:51:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at Paine with her now black eyes. As for note for Shin. Her eyes are completely black and her skin blueish. Her hair is red.. She was not recognizable as Zenaki. Not at all. Only her voice was recognizable as Zenaki's own..

She nods slowly to paine.

''My.. My name is Claudette...'' She says softly before her eyes wander to the side.

''I do not use... The name Zenaki anymore.. I-I am not allowed...''

Her eyes wander back on the children on her chest. The twin were softly listening to all the sounds around them. * - Thu Dec  3 15:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head slowly in response to Paine before looking up towards Shin. She raises her brow before closing her eyes. She keeps her mouth shut.. Knowing that if she were to tell what had happend her mistress would punish her. Her eyes opened softly, her hand moved to rub over one of the babies hairs. 

''Call me Claud...'' She says softly to the both of them. The aura around her seemed to be more devilous then it normal was. ''I am no longer Zenaki.'' * - Thu Dec  3 15:36:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the both of them before pushing herself up. She holds her children in her arms before she simply walks of southbound if she was allowed. She feels the burning sensation in her body rise again. Her eyes dulled and glazed...

She said nothng as she simply just walked off. She was deep in thought, trying to.. Trying to simply ignore this pain in her body that was slowly on rising. She has to find her mistress... She has to.. She already.... Already said to much. And if only she would find out about it... No good... No good at all! * - Thu Dec  3 15:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Call me Claud... Or Claudette. Zenaki is no longer my name.  - Thu Dec  3 15:51:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stops in place as her shoulder was grabbed and she slightly was moved backwards. Zenaki moves her body, taking a step back. Her eyes form into a glare for a small moment before they turn back dulled again. Her eyes wander off to the side as she completely stays quiet. She was not going to answer. 

Happiness? What was that again? Her eyes moved back to look at Paine, staying quiet. * - Thu Dec  3 16:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes a slightly wider before she winches softly because of again some burning pain in her body. Her eyes closed, not responding to what they were saying. Her.. Her mistress...
Her eyes opened again to look at Paine, sad and full of fear. She then shakes her head. 
''She's.... My friend...'' She says softly. ''Hanae.. Aswell..'' She was not going to tell them the truth. There was no way she was going to do that. Her eyes wander of again after, aiming to get free from the grip of Paine by moving her burning body. Her soul.. It was burning. So badly. Because she was lying. To herself. About her mistres.. To her friends who were helping her. But those were only the thoughts of the real Zenaki. But Zenaki herself was possessed. She was not thinking like Zenaki herself. But like Claudette. * - Thu Dec  3 16:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly in response. She was not going to walk southbound thorugh.. But just turns her body to sit withher back against the fench. She looks over at Shin and stays quiet before looking back at Paine. * - Thu Dec  3 16:24:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Right - Thu Dec  3 17:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just moves to the side, observing Shin his skill..Poison and fire... What will that turn out to be? Explosion or nothing? She places the children behind her next to the entrance on the ground before she walks back. She had pinned them down with a senbon in their clothing on the ground so they would not escape. 

She takes a few steps backwards as she simply starts to make slowly handseals. she was not.. Good in fighting at all. And to be honest she was quite nervous. She takes adeep breath and looks at the ones who were preparing themselves for the fight. Aswell as Zenaki was doing that. She stays a bit in the distance. Nothing much more. She was mixing her oxygen with the chakra inside of her. * - Thu Dec  3 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) //

A sly grin curls on her face as she was watching. She notices one of the shins looking at her obviously.. She notices every single little detail. She breaths in a tad bit more through her nose before she forcefully exhales... Blowing out a thick layer of fog which spread rather quickly over the area. 

What this fog was? It could easily be mistaken for just simple mist... And it was! But Zenaki added a slight tint of her medical reasearch to it.. She had mixed the chakra and oxygen together in poison! The mist.. Was simply just poison... And the ones who would breath it in.. Would be paralyzed completely in two seconds... 

But who was to know it was poison mist? Only Zenaki knew it.. And with that she slowly takes steps back.. Takeing a deep breath before the fog reaches her aswell. It spreads up and all around.. Zenaki just holds her breath for now. * - Thu Dec  3 17:39:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she was suddenly feeling very very dizzy. Oh god. Her eyes wander of to the side and then up towards the sky where Paine would most likely come down on her! Oh god fucking no. She moves her body, aiming to move to the side but her body was not working with her. It was not listening! She was standing quite unstable on her legs as she watches the girl come down on her! She prepares herself with the worst at the moment..

Luckily that all didn't seem to happen!!

 Some sort of flamethrower was send to her aswell! And that with the babies behind her! He was sick! Hell! Zenaki tries to take a step backwards but instead takes a step forth, possibly stepping herself in the middle of the flame thrower.. She grunts as she feels the burning sensation now from the inside, but also from the outside! And with Zenaki being not durable -at all- she was just simply fucked. And with this done. She was out of fighting. Nope. 

She falls down on her knees, fucking dizzy and grunting in pain. * - Thu Dec  3 18:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would also notice now that including this pain and such that she was breathing.. But thanks to it being blown into the air it would not take effect on any of the persons. * - Thu Dec  3 18:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares down at the children as they starts to cry. She then closes her eyes.. She holds the both children up against her gigantic perfectly rounded breasts to sooth them. She hushes them softly before she starts to hum softly, moving a bit from side to side to sooth them. 
''Don't cry.. Don't cry... I'm here.. Momma is here...'' She whispers to the both of them, hopefully soothing them down. * - Thu Dec  3 19:38:52 2015

''Bad bad Akari...'' She says before throwing the baby up in the air, only to catch it again, hopefully to scare him.. And stop his crying. Oh god they're soooo anoying.. * - Thu Dec  3 19:44:51 2015

Her eyes ander to Akari and then Amuki... She starts to undress both of them simply and takes wpes to wipe both their butts at the same time. She then let them crawl around, naked for the time being while she throws away the diapers.

''Were going to take a small bath hm~ ''* - Thu Dec  3 20:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares down at the children as she was washing her hands. She then walks over towards them, giving each a light pat on the head before walking to the bathroom. There she starts to fill the bathtub, placing a laundry basket in it and filling it with toys. This was to prevent the toys to go away from them and to let them sit up straight and not let them fall over. She then walks back, taking each baby in her arms and then walking to the baththub. She places the kids in the bath and softly starts to wetten their hair with her wet hands.* - Thu Dec  3 20:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes some baby shampoo before she starts to rub their hair softly, making sure not to put it in their eyes... Once rubbed in she washes it out with the water from the baththub, using her hands as some sort of cup for the water.* - Thu Dec  3 20:20:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the arm of Akari, lifting the boy up from the baththub and placing it down. She nods a time to Menma.

''Hello Menma.'' She says as she starts to dry the child. * - Thu Dec  3 21:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Places the kid on the ground, placing a diaper around him. She then places him on his hands and knees and pats the small baby bum for a small moment, sending the kid into the livingroom all naked but a diaper. She was going to dress them later. To lazy for that now..

She then takes the girl, lifting her up and starting to dry her aswell. Doing exactly the same process before cleaning the bathroom.

''You can dress them in their pyjama.''* - Thu Dec  3 21:17:00 2015

''Don't... Worry... It'll be.. Fine..'' She whispers in her cold voice. The aura around Zenaki was dark and pure evil. People would feel great discomfort while being around Zenaki.
