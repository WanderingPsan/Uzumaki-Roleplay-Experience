''Sure sure... Thanks for the apology though. I think people just think of me as some sort of creep. They always had done. And even with my new appearance now.. I might look a tad more creepy. I can understand their reaction.'' She bluntly and coldly says, as if it's the most normal thing in the world. And it was for her. She scared people, she always had..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) shakes her head slowly as she walks off towards the trainingsfield. aOn the way as she walked to there she was just thinking on what she would train on... Her chakra transfer.. No.. There was nbody around to practice it on... Poison fog?.. It's an option... Maybe the fire gas explosion thingie... She releases a loud sigh and then shakes her head. Most likely she was just going to practice all of them. Because why not. 

Once arrived at the trainingsfield she would look around if nobody was around, which was the case luckily. She takes a deep breath and sits down, her hands come together in a single seal as she starts to concentrate on her chakra... She had to concentrate on it to get it slightly bigger.. Just so she could use a lot of it without getting to exhausted. 

A hard sigh is released after and then she would push herself up slowly.. Her hands moved into a few handseals, building up the chakra inside of her lungs and then blowing it out! She blows out a fog.. But what was the fog? She chuckles softly as she steps back... She observes it from this distance for now and how fast it would spread over the field... That reminds her. She needs to get a mask.. Maybe ask Marco later for it. 

A soft chuckles is released after again as she moves her hands up, forming another few sets of seal slowly and then blowing out another fog like substance.. The same color as the other one.. But a slight less thick... It mixes with the other fog as Zenaki again slowly takes steps backwards. ''hmm..'' She hums softly as she watches the two gasses mix together... 

With that her hand moved in her pocket. SHe retrieves a lighter and a small stick... She lights the stick as she takes a good distance away from the fog.. Before throwing the stick in the gas like substance! It immidiatly lights up in fire! And then a loud bang.. The poison inside of the fog spreaded even more around the area.. Quickly Claud took steps back to stay out of range! Oh god.. She was about to get paralyzed herself. Yep. She really needed a mask. * - Thu Dec 10 21:41:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) releases a deep sigh as she had made her way back home... That little experiment worked out quite well... And it even expanded the poison a little bit.. She walks over at the child, placing a soft kiss on his forehead before she walks down the basement.. Looked just like ever, bodies, blood and whatever else everywhere. The children most likely are completely used to it. 

She notices the child that wants to be lifted.. She sighs softly, turning back and raising him in her arms.. She then walks down the basement.. 

''Ah.. Mommy gotta do her stretching again.. Are you gonna stretch with me?'' * - Thu Dec 10 23:05:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) walks into one of her chambers, chuckling softly. It was one of the biggest, highest and it was completely empty.. Specially for her own goods... She places the child down and then locks the door. She walks a bit away, and she closes her eyes.. It took only a second before wings pop from her back.. Laaarggee wings... 8 ft or so each. Her hair color got darker.. Almost black.. Her teeth sharpened, completely. Same for the nails on her hands. She even grew fur on her body. She smiles softly, spreading her wings all across the big room..

''Ah.. Always feels good..'' She chuckles before she bends over, touching her toes with her hands.. With ease.. * - Thu Dec 10 23:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at her side as her son walks over to her. She gives him a soft yet cold smile as always. She stands up again, lifting the boy in her arms and then folding her wings again. 

''I love you too baby.. And those? The big things on my back?''* - Thu Dec 10 23:51:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her wing out a little bit so the boy could observe it. 

''Don't tell anyone okay? It's a secret. Can you keep a secret?'' She chuckles.* - Fri Dec 11 00:06:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softy. She then moves away her wings again. Her hair would change back and everything back to what she looked like before. She looks d up at the child and just pokes his nose. ''Not gonna tell ya. Till you're older..'' 

Knows they're just children.. And children got a lot of dreams... Perhaps this was just a dream...She then looks at Amuki..

''Amuki, place that down.. It's not yours..''* - Fri Dec 11 00:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softly. 

''Mm. As long as you keep them downstairs it's okay alright sweety?'' She places the boy down on the ground again aswell. * - Fri Dec 11 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks over at her children, taking a dreep breath before releasing it again in a deep sigh.

''Amuki! Akari! Stop that!'' She growls out at the two children, her voice volume had risen to a certain point that it was also be heard upstairs. Her voice also was really low.. Demonic like.. Most likely scaring the shit out of thw two children..

Meanwhile she walks over.. Her teeth sharp.. * - Fri Dec 11 00:34:33 2015

''Don't slap your lil sis without my permission, got it?'' She asks, sternly.. Her black demonic eyes glaring at him.. But her teeth slowly faded in her normal sharp teeth again.. Not the giant pointy ones she had when she yelled. * - Fri Dec 11 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) turns and walks off, seeking a lone place for herself. No guards or anything around. * - Fri Dec 11 09:25:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles a tad from the position she was... Quiet and nobody around.. She was to lazy to walk.. And to lazy to pay for a caravan.. So flying would do... Her eyes closed as she searched for the black mana inside of her.. Only to groan quietly under her breath when wings pop from her back.. Her hair got darker and her teeth sharper.. Fur grew all over her body.. Her nails a tad sharper and she even got a small tail.

 Once transformed she strecthes her wings and arches her back to stretch herself... She chuckles a bit as she opens her eyes, lookin around before suddenly flying up into the sky. Some people on the ground may see it as some giant bat the flew up into the sky.. But she was to quick into the sky before people could even really recognize it.. She turns in the sky and flew of towards Konoha! Her trained eyes set on the ground below her. * - Fri Dec 11 09:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) arrives at a random place in the middle of Konoha.. Ofcourse again she makes sure to not get caught or anything.. She transforms herself back into her normal self again and takes the scroll from her pouch. She opens it and looks inside of it. ''Rias...'' She whispers to herself before chuckling. It had been quite a long time since she'd been here. Not way to long though. She visits a lots of time here in Konohagakure. She is the head of the hospital after all.

She turns on her heels and walks into Konoha.. On the streets that is.. There aren't much habitants.. But the ones around knew her for her demonic appearance.. They were most of the times quite scared.. And they just wondered and wondered why Claudette was the head of the hospital.

Claudette just walks on through the streets, and most likely visitting some trainignsfields to look around.. Meanwhile she builds up chakra in her chest, blowing a gas like substance out from her lungs at some times... The gas would slowly fade and go up into the air.. Just to make sure it wouldn't explode when fire comes with it! * - Fri Dec 11 09:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) walks up into the trainingsfield.. She was just looking around. It had been some time since she had been around. not way to long because she is here around. Just not very active. She lives in Konoha -and- suna after all. But Suna thinks she only lives in Sunagakure. Besides.. She was head of hospital here in Konohagakure..

Once arrived on the trainingsfield, next to her old house.. She arches a brow and she looks at Shin. Her hand moves upwards, waving at him. 
''Heya, Shin.'' She says with her usual low female and cold tone. Her teeth are sharper than a normal human being, more vampire like. * - Fri Dec 11 09:55:34 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) just stares at him for a moment before she closes her eyes.. Time to tell the truth then.

''Aye.. Uhhm. I had to work on a lotta experiments, one was testing on myself.. ANd it kinda.. Turned out like this..'' she explains. * - Fri Dec 11 10:03:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) was just kinda walking down the roads, of towards the gates. A place where always shinobi are around. A loud sigh is released before she hears a sound.. Her ears perked up and she looks aorund and spots a tiny bat! She chuckles softly and walks towards it. If it doesn't fly away ofcourse! 

''Oh.. Well hello there..'' She says in a hushed tone. The aura around Claudette is very dark and evil, most likely demoralizing the ones around her. But she was quite intrested in the small bat.. Maybe a new pet for her? A batpet. * - Fri Dec 11 11:36:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks down at the Bat as it set down on her shoulder before it crawled into her shirt. She smiles softly at the bat and moves her hand in her shirt, aiming to pat the bat over it's soft head. 

She ofcourse had noticed the broken wing.. And could only imagine how that would feel like! Ouch!! She shakes her head softly, moving her arm around her body to hold the tiny bat close before she walks on into the village. * - Fri Dec 11 11:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nubi(Asami100) says: Kee~ - Fri Dec 11 11:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softly as she walks inside, of to her good old house.* - Fri Dec 11 11:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) finally was inside of her house.. She sits down on the ground and takes the bat carefully. She places it down on the ground and pets it's head softly to calm it down. Just a bit. 

''Poor girl..'' SHe whispers as she moves her hand over to take the broken wing softly.. Trying not to hurt the beasty. * - Fri Dec 11 12:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nubi(Asami100) says: Kee.. - Fri Dec 11 12:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks down at the poor beasty.. Shesighs softly.. The poor knight of the dark. She moves her hands in a set f seals before her hands start to glow an emerald green.. One hand moves to pet the beasty on it's head before the other one went to move the wing.. Just slightly. Just to take the pain away.. Ofcourse it could not fly yet..

The emerald color fades and she would continue to pet the beasty whilst her other hand does the job, taking a stick and a bandage from her pouch and she places the tick on the wing.. She then securesit softly with the bandage.

''How horrible it must be.. To not be able to fly again...'' She whispers as she looks down at the beast. * - Fri Dec 11 12:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks down at the poor beasty before is chuckles softly. She deffinitly wants it as a pet of her own. 

'' Hm.. Is it better this way?'' She asks as she folds both the wings of the beasty to it's sides, only to lift it up. Once lifted she places it down on her head.. And then she walks outside.. ''Don't go flying aye? You will fall down if you do.'' She says, chuckling softly after.* - Fri Dec 11 12:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) would walk out with the bat on her head. She seemed to smile faintly. She was getting used to it.

''Imma call you Nubi. I bet the children will like you. Everybody will.'' She says as she walks, off to the mansion. * - Fri Dec 11 13:05:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) kinda just walks inside, offering a wave to Rias. She has a bat on top of her head.. Bandage was around it's wing. Her hand moves up to take one of the tiny paws, pulling the nails away from digging in her head.

''Rias, you needed me?''* - Fri Dec 11 13:07:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nubi(Asami100) says: Kii! - Fri Dec 11 13:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) walks out, glancing up at the bat. 

''Nubi, we're gonna look around a bit..I need to train aswell a tad bit hm.'' She says to the bat as she walks out, off to the big trainingsfield. * - Fri Dec 11 13:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nubi(Asami100) says: omit - Fri Dec 11 14:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) sighs softly as she walks off to the trainingsfield. ''mmm.. I hope you can fly quickly again, Nubi.. I can't  even think about to be not able to fly... Must be hard.'' She whispers to the bat on her head as she walks up the trainingsfield. She looks up at the bat before looking down at the ground again. She chuckles softly.

''Aye aye.. Let's get to it.'' She says as she brings up her hands in a few seals. Just a few simple seals... With that she inhales deeply and then exhales her oxygen in a gas like substance! She backs away quickly and looks ahead at the gas like substance before chuckling softly again. ''Let's see if it still lights in fire.'' She says as she looks at the gas.

Her hand then moves in her pocket, retrieving a lighter.. She bends down to take a stick from the ground.. As soon as she had stepped away from the gas.. She lights up the stick and throws it inside! The gas would immidiatly explode, forming into a giant hot ball of fire! Claud chuckles at the sight as she backs away a tad more. 

''Now let's..... Add into it!'' She moves her hands in a few handseals again, taking a deep breath of oxygen before exhaling it deeply, adding even more gas to the already light up fire! Claud opens her eyes wide as the ball of fire only grew larger and larger, the more gas she added to it. She chuckles. ''Looks like it works that way aswell.''

She takes another few steps backwards, moving her hand up to pet the beasty on her head. '' Aye. I really hope you can get to flying again soon.''* - Fri Dec 11 14:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her body a bit, winching as it was holding onto her hair! She moves her hand, grabbing the beasty softly in her hands. 

''Don't worry.. I'm here, no need to be scared.''* - Fri Dec 11 14:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her hand to pat the beasty on it's head. ''Hush.. Calm down.. I'll get you out of my hair and place you back again..''

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her both hands up, grabbing the beasty firmly before she walks of to the mansion... The beasty was still stuck in her hair. Maybe someone inside could help her.* - Fri Dec 11 14:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks over at Kai.

''Kai it was, right?'' She asks as she keeps her hands behind her head, the beasty firmly in her grip so it wouldn't move around.

''Can you help me out with the beasty.. She's stuck in my hair.''* - Fri Dec 11 14:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) sighs softly. He was asleep... She then moves her own hand again, trying to remove the bat that's strangled up in her hair. 

''C'mon Nubi, get out of it, don't move.'' She whispers as she attempte to take it's flapping wing.. Then trying to remove it from her hair.* - Fri Dec 11 14:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at her side as soon as Ai walks inside. She opens her eyes wide for a moment before they half lid again. She said nothing and just turned, and walked out. Nope. Not her again. * - Fri Dec 11 14:42:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) finally gets the bat detangled from her hair! She places it in her vest afterwards. 

''Mmm..''

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) walks inside of her good old home again, grabbing the bat and placing the bat down on the table. She then moves around in the different closets.. Trying to find something.. She sighs softly and then moves into her pocket.. She takes out a small computer and a pod.. With that she  opens the mouth of the beasty and takes a bit of it's saliva on a small stick.. She then places the bat down on the gorund again to let it crawl anywhere it wants.

Meanwhile, Zenaki was going to test the beasty on rabies... She places the salive on the computer and turns it on.. It says it's there. She let out a low sigh before she works on the medipod, taking the saliva aswell and some herbs from her pouch.. She mixes it together and together and adds some liguid to it.. She then takes a small seringe and adds the liquid inside of it.. She then places the seringe to the side.

Once done she bends over, grabbing the beasty again and then taking the Seringe.. She holds it in a position that it can't bite before placing the needle inside of the beatsy, only t make it rabies free! Sh then lifts the beasty, rubbing over the place it was injected and giving a small kiss on it's head, still making sure it could not bite.. With that done, she places the beasty down again on the ground, watching it go anywhere it wants to go.* - Fri Dec 11 14:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks around the place, finally finding someone to talk with. A loud sigh released from her lips before she moves up her hand, motioning Paine over.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods a time as she unwraps the towel a tad more, patting the small bat over it's furry belly.

''..mmmhm. I found her when her wing was broken. I fixed it and ever since she'd been with me. I helped her to fly again, and it's still a bit difficult. But it gets better by the day.''

''Yes, but slugs also eat. I think it fits you well, it's as shy and nervous as you are.'' She says as she offers her a smile. Her hand that recently held the leaf, now moves up to pull up the strawhat of Paine a small bit upwards, to look at her calm emerald eyes with her own black demonic eyes.* - Sat Dec 12 11:58:01 2015

''They love every kind of vegatable or fruit. They do not eat meat. So any kind of vegatable or fruit is welcommed by them.'' She explains.. Then her hand moves back inside of her cloak and then taking the small towel. She places it on the table and unfolds it.. Her hand moves over the belly of the small bat and the pets it softly, before stroking her hand softly to the wings of the mini knight of the dark. 

''How is your taijutsu coming along?'' She asks, her lips flattened and her demonic eyes set on the bat.* - Sat Dec 12 13:35:18 2015

''Looks amazing Paine.'' She says.

Her eyes wander of to her baby who seemed to hve waken up aswell! She gives him a soft smile.

''Hello Akari. Did you sleep well? I just came back from my missions and I found Nubi on the way..'' She says to the 5 year old child as she points over at the beasty that layed down on the table, on a towel.* - Sat Dec 12 14:01:45 2015

Once grabbed she drags him along to the lovely lovely basement of hers.  She drags him down over the stairs, letting him bang on it everytime... Then she would grab him by his arm, and throw him against one of the tables downstairs, letting him land in a pile of organs.

''So, how long are we going to play this little game?''* - Sat Dec 12 14:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) starts to chuckles a tad more as she closes her eyes... She concentrates on the dark mana inside of herself before suddenly wings pop out of her back! Fur starts to cover her skin and her teeth grew waayyy sharper. Even her hair color changed shades darker... Now almost black. 

''Ah.. My dear... You know that I love you so, so much... Why do you hate me?'' She asks as she approaches him. * - Sat Dec 12 14:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) releases a loud sigh... Before suddenly flapping out her giant wing, slamming Paine away with it. 

''I don't need your help..'' She says before flapping them again, sending a giant gust of wind at the child, tools from the room infront of her, being send his way! They would not hit him but scare the shit out of him. 

''Akari, get up and apologize! You do not -fucking- disrespect me. Understood?''* - Sat Dec 12 15:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) would open her eyes wide as she feels her wing break... She stays silent for a moment before she suddenly starts to scream out loud. With the wind blowing though the basement, the iron door upstairs would lock.. Nobody was getting in or out right now. Claud was the only one who knows how to get out of this. She falls down on her knees, screaming and roaring in pain. Once Paine got close to her wing and attempts to fix it.. She would move her wing to the side, again aiming to slam her away to god know where in her basement. But most likely. it would break again!* - Sat Dec 12 15:21:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) groans out as her wing was hold in place.

''R-Reales it Paine!'' She demands with her way lower voice. Her wing.. Her precious.. Wing... Broken...* - Sat Dec 12 15:35:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) groans in pain as she slowly sat more up straight.. She tries to fold her wing back on her back, groaning. Ah fuck this hurts. Even more than when she would've been in her human form. 

''F-Fuck...'' She whispers to herself before she slowly looks up at Akari... So that's what it feels like to have your wing broken... Her eyes slowly wander around the room to look around... * - Sat Dec 12 15:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nubi(Asami100) says: that* - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) closes her eyes, trying to move her wing but it hurts.. So much..

''Akari... Is just like that....Probably... Because he thinks he did nothing wrong... But he did... H-he deserves punishment... T-Thank you Paine..'' She says as she looks down at the child before slowly pushing herself up. 

''Oh.. Please don't tell.. Anyone about this.. Look..'' She whispers to her a sshe offers her a soft forced smile. Her wing hang down low to the ground. It just hurts like hell. * - Sat Dec 12 16:22:33 2015
