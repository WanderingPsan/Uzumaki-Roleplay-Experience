<br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) screams out as she feels her palms being cut through by Hanae... Her chakra fading away from her palms and her body shaking. She tries to keep her posture as she was panting.. Her eyes still locked on Hanae in front of her. * - Fri Nov 13 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to shake only more as she tries to bring her hands up again to keep Hanae away from her body.. But she fails... Her legs are shaking and she was about to collapse on the ground any moment. But she tries to keep her posture.. * - Fri Nov 13 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes as she feels Hanae wrap her ar around her, while the other rubs her folds.. Only to let her body shake more and indeed causing her to fall down. 
''F-Fuck you and -g-get away from me!'' She yelled out at her as a soft moan escapes her lips.. He refuses to lay herself down on her back, eventhough she was struggling to keep her posture. * - Fri Nov 13 02:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) is back handed. Dammit. She then is pushed down against the ground, forcing her back on the sticky floor. She moves both her arms, painfully to push Hanae away from her body.. But she moves away already. She looks at what Hanae we trying to do an she reaises a brow before opening her eyes wide.

''N-No no! G-Get that awya! That's not a good idea for the babies!'' She yells out at her as she tries to move her body.. As Hanae placed herself inbetween herself she moves her arms to try and push Hanae away from herself. 
''A-After something else... W-Where the fuck are you after just,, G-Get the fuck out of my house..'' * - Fri Nov 13 02:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath as she is forced even more onto the ground. She closes her eyes after for a small moment as the tip of the toy was places against her folds. 

Her body was quite bleeidng from all the wounds onher body, her hands simply almost paralyzed from the pain in her palms. But.. She will get over that later.. 

''No! I would love for you to leave my fucking house!'' She yells out at her before a gasp is released from her mouth as he nipple is teasingly licked. * - Fri Nov 13 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moans softly as sh feels rubbing down over her private area.. And that at the same time with her nipples being pleased and teased by suckling and licking.. Her breasts are really sensitive, large and hard thanks to the mother mild she was producing for her children. And dueto the suckling of Hanae on her nipple, some of the milk comes out from it. 
''S-Stop it! I-I am going to have Master... P-Punish the shit out of you...'' * - Fri Nov 13 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would ofcourse move her arm, trying to his Hane on her head. But as she almost was there.. Her wrist was grabbed and pushed back again. She grunts in displeasure as this toy was shoved inside of her, quite all the way. 
She was used to more. But this hurts. Just so bad. * - Fri Nov 13 03:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) grunts even louder as she is being bitten down on her nipple.. Only to have her body moved by the thrusting. The grunt forms into a loud scream as she feels her nipple only be bitten harder and harder! Zenaki starts to twist and twirl her already fucking painfull body. Was causing so much wounds on her body not enough for the poor pregnant girl? * - Fri Nov 13 03:32:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath as the biting stopped.. But instead hard sucking came from it.. And quite hard squeezes. Ofcourse only causing to get more milk forced from her nipples. As she thrusts her way in.. Well not really much was going on,.. Just more pain and such for the poor pregnant female.* - Fri Nov 13 03:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes as she looks over at Hanae.. Who just let go of her wrist.. Her hand moves forwards, only to placeher bloody hand on Hanae's cheek. Her back arches as this toy was slid into her second entrance, causing a moan to escape her lips. 

''I-It fucking.. Hurts.... M-Master will get... you punished...For this... And if he doesn't... I-I will...'' Her hand, if it was placed on her cheek... Suddenly snaps forwards, aiming to prod two gingers into her eye!* - Fri Nov 13 03:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand up, to take the girl by her hair,pulling her off to the side as she moans out once as this toy was slid deep inside of her. Zenaki couldn't.. Really hurt her right now. Due to all the wounds on her body. * - Fri Nov 13 03:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares up at Hanae, squinting her eyes. She tries to move her body, only to cause herself more pain in return. She grunts and closes her eyes, not even going to pay anymore attention to her. This all? Zenaki was already used to it by now. * - Fri Nov 13 04:04:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) allows Hanae to do what she wants. She likes pain anyways So why get angry?

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) chuckles softly. 
''Finally got her good. Heh..'' She whispers to herself before chuckling again. Her hand then wraps around her tummy as she feels one of the kids kick again. ''Hnngg..'' * - Sat Nov 14 02:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up as Hanae seemed to be walking out of her house. She pushes herself up, grabbing Hanae by her hand before she walks any further. 
''Oi oi.. Just because this was something new.. That doesn't mean you are allowed to leave and break everything in my house. I thought you fucking enjoyed pain?''* - Sat Nov 14 02:10:33 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes it in her hand and with no hessitation she slashes it out over her chest.  
''You know you gotta pay for the kitchen, be it in money or in pain.'' She says before she moves the kunai to stab it in Hanae's arm. ''Don't pull it out and stay in the house. Aye?''* - Sat Nov 14 02:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Takes Hanae by her arm and throws her on the bench.. Only to sit with Tetsumi again. 

''Aye... Sorry for that..''* - Sat Nov 14 02:22:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Oh... - Sat Nov 14 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) was about to sit down. But then she dashes off, hugging her Master tightly around his neck. She grins wide and holds him tight as her 7 months old pregnant belly pressed against him. * - Sat Nov 14 02:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Didn't know you were coming -omit- - Sat Nov 14 02:24:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) notes that the kitchen is like completely ruined. Every drwer pulled of, aswell as the fridge and whatever. Zenaki had several -new- scars on her body.. Who just got healed up.. And not even everything was healed up. She simply snuggles up against him in a tight hug.* - Sat Nov 14 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Y-yea..  - Sat Nov 14 02:30:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hanae uh.. got mad after I slammed a plate on her head. That's why she raged and pulled the kitchen apart. - Sat Nov 14 02:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Uhuh... - Sat Nov 14 02:32:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks towards Hanae as she walks out. Her hand moves to grab Hanae by her chest, digging her fingers into the wound as she releases Fujitora. No way she was going away. * - Sat Nov 14 02:36:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Are you mad and no longer into it anymore now Master is here?  - Sat Nov 14 02:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You're no fun Hanae~ - Sat Nov 14 02:38:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Your lead..*chuckles* - Sat Nov 14 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at the kunai, before moving her hand in her pocket, simply taking her dagger. She pierces it back in the same wound again, only cutting it open more. She twists it a bit to lock it in place. ''I didn't tell you to pull that thing out of your body yet.. Did I?'' She says with a grin before she moveds the dagger to force Hanae to come along with her. Looks like Zenaki was at the moment completely focussed on this. She had to throw some pregnancy frustrations out.* - Sat Nov 14 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) chuckles softly as she walks over towards the basement door, though. That is not where she was heading. Zenaki stops out of the sudden and pulls the dagger bag, turning a tad to deliver Hanae enother slash over her chest. Now she had a cross. 
'' Aye.. Forgive me... Haven't done such things in months..'' She says with a slight grin on her face. ''Besides. You owe me kitchen, be it in pain or be it in money... Or perhaps both...'' * - Sat Nov 14 02:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to grin even wider, staring at Hanae. They were not even in the basement.. And Zenaki wasn't planning on going there really aswell. Not today atleast. She was going to have a little fun upstairs.

She snaps her dagger forwards and pierces it once again in her arm, just a little lower this time. ''You sure you still wanna use your arms? To bad...'' She says before pulling back her dagger, only to stab the female into her stomach. ''You better beg for me to hurt you more.. Or scream for me as loud as you can.''* - Sat Nov 14 02:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at her, chuckling softly. Her free hand snaps forwards, grabbing the girl by her troath and pushin her up against the wall. ''Hmm.. Carefull? There is no such a thing as carefull..'' She says with a grin as she squeezes the troath of Hanae closed. Meanwhile she pulls out her dagger again and places it against her leg. On the inside of her thigh. She doesn't do anything. * - Sat Nov 14 03:05:10 2015
