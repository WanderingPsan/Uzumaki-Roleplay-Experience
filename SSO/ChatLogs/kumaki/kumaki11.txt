''You can watch. If you want. '' She says before she places her hands on her shirt, as if ready to take it off.* - Sun Oct  4 16:38:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Katsune and turns around She'd take of her shirt. Around her chest self was bandage. On her shoulder would be more blood strains. No seals again, though.* - Sun Oct  4 16:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks inside of the hospital with Kirie.. She walks down to where she had placed the eyes and walks back again. ''One eye right?'' She says as she looks at the eyes in both jars. She motions for Kiri to come over with her into one of the room.s Once there she places both jars down and looks at Kirie. ''Lay down.'' She points over at the clean bed. Meanwhile she walks over to some machines to make them work properly. * - Sun Oct  4 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response as she starts to place themedicines onto Kirie. Just to check heartbeat and breathing and such. Nothing special. An IV is inserted in her hand and a white liquid is being put in the IV. ''This makes you go sleepy. You sleep.. Now.'' And with that. Yes in a few seconds.. Kirie should fall asleep.

Zenaki walks over towards the drawer and takes all different kind of tools she might need for her surgery. She'd done this now three times before.. Which one of worked. Zenaki was not really nervous. She was dead serious. She has to do it right. Just to get more experimental objects. She closes her eyes and then walks over at Kirie with a plate with the medical tools on ot. She places to down before turning again.

She takes a tool to spread her left eye. She then takes another tool to carefully take her eye out without spilling to much blood. She was alone and had no assistant. It was difficult.. 

She was sure not to shake to much with her hand as she takes a small knife, carefully cutting around the nerves..  But making sure she would not kill them. Hopefully. She'd turn her body slightly to place the pulled out eye away and take the one from the jar, carefully. Her hand moved towards the empty eye socket, using different tools to place everything down carefully before she starts to stitch it up, all carefull. After that she moves her hands in a few handseals, healing up the remaining wound. 

After that she'd place the eye back in the socket, all carefull as she works.. After she was done she cleans up everything and let's the girl sleep out. She sits down on a chair as she waits for the female to wake up.  Meanwhile she takes a book and starts to read. * - Sun Oct  4 18:10:08 2015

She says before she closes her book about herbs and poisons. She places it away and walks back at the female. ''How are you feeling?'' Her dull tone would ask as she starts to close off the machines and remove them rom her body.* - Sun Oct  4 18:45:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves up her hand, rubbing it over her cheek. 
''Nothing.. Special..'' She says in response. On her cheek was a burning wound, healing. Her both sides over her lips are having a glasgow smile. Until the midst of her cheek. In her neck is a scar to be seen.. And on top of that blood strains and cuts from a chain it seemed like. As if a chain had choked her. 

She pushes herself up again and moves her hand over at Kirie to pull her upwards. She tries to get away from the subject.* - Sun Oct  4 19:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head in response. '' No worries about it. With the healing technique's I can do. I can't even make it go away. It's fine.'' She says with her robot like voice as she pulls the girl upwards.* - Sun Oct  4 19:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would have both her hands grabbed by... Hair?
Zenaki just casually watched with her dull eyes and then nods. '' Sure.. It might work out well.''* - Sun Oct  4 19:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at kirie for a small moment before closing her eyes. She starts to concentrate on her chakra and let it flow towards her hair. She let's the chakra flow inside of her hair and tries to simply manipluate it? She has her eyes closed and focusses more.. But nothing happends to her hair.. Oh well.. It moved a slight bit. She concentrates on her hair and tries it again. Trying to move the hair around with her chakra. Was this even possible. It did sue look like it the way Kirie showed her. 

Zenaki sighs a time before she plops down on the bed next to Kirie. Shereleases her chakra for a moment as she looks to the side before closing her eyes again. SHe once again concentrates on her chakra and sending it towards her head, into her hair. She concentrates and the hair starts to move around freely. Not perfectly yet. But good enough for now. The hair would move and wrap around her own wrist for a moment. She tests how strong it was.. For now. She then nods a time and releases the hair again. ''Easy..Thanks..''* - Sun Oct  4 20:28:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks off, leading them all to her house. * - Mon Oct  5 15:58:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks towards her house, and inside of it. She looks around and then let everyone inside. Nothing special was here. Mostly just medical books. She walks on after she closed the door and opens the door towards the basement. She let's all of them go in front of her before she closes the door behind her. She locks it even. 

She turns and follows the others. Once they would be and end up in the basement.. It was freaking cold. There were tree corpses hanging on their neck next to eachother. 
Around were all kind of tables. Lots of blood and torture stuff. Zenaki casually walks over towards the table and some chairs. Obviously dried blood on it. She replaces them a bit and turns towards the others with her lifeless and dull gaze. '' If you guys wanna sit.. Here.. Anyone want something to eat? Or drink?'' She asks as she looks at the trio. * - Mon Oct  5 16:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Oct  5 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: three* - Mon Oct  5 16:05:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at them before glancing away. She nods a time in response before she herself walks towards the kitchen part. The only clean part in the basement. She opens a drawer en takes some sake fromthere. She opens the bottle and simply starts to drink from bottle on. Her deadly, lifeles eyes set on the trio as she drinks before she places it down again. She walks over at Kilm. ''Just some weapon things and such to protect myself.. Feel free to use the corpse dummies.'' She says to them all. ''If they break? I have others.'' 

She then moves over to look at one of the corpses. She stares at it from close with her lifeless eyes before she moves up her hands, weaving through a few handseals. A blue hue forms around her palms as she seperates them. It was not a simple hue.. But a sharp on. As if they were knifes. Her right hand moved over in top of the corpses arm with a quick motion, just kind of softly slapping it. The arm started to spasm for a small moment. ''Mmm..'' 

She observes the body again to look around on it. Sadly it was only a body.. She turns to look at the others. '' Anyone where I can try this jutsu on? TIll now I could only kind of.. test it on bodies.'' She says in a robot like voice as she glances around, keeping her hands up next to herself. * - Mon Oct  5 16:25:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: What jutsu? - Mon Oct  5 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Chakra scalpels. Zetsumo wanted me to learn this a while back. But I am still testing it. No worries. I can heel you if you get hurt.  - Mon Oct  5 16:30:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the guy, raising a brow. She looks over at Kilm after, starting to grin softly. ''Are you afraid? Kilm?'' She says as she walks over towards Kilm. * - Mon Oct  5 16:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We should really get to know you, Learius. - Mon Oct  5 16:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would now stand right across Kilm, smiling at him in her own creepy way. She then moves her arm out in a swift motion, slamming it against the arm of the new boy, tearing through his muscles completely with her new justu. On the outside? Nothing is able to be seen. But. He probably can't move his arm anymore, plus it would hurt like a madman.* - Mon Oct  5 16:51:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) let's the chakra flow away from her hands before she moves them up again. She starts to weave through a few handseals and simply places both her palms down on the arm of the poor boy.. The poor poor boy...
''Did it hurt that much? Why didn't you yell that hard then? I expected more.'' She says in a cold robotic like tone as she heals the arm of the boy. * - Mon Oct  5 17:05:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns her head quickly to look at Beth. She completely ignored Shins question. She walks over and stands behind her. Her arms folded. 
''Curious? Beth?''* - Mon Oct  5 20:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) thinks: As I suspected. If she was sealed, surely Beth would know. Suitengu is safe and she seems to be relatively normal. But something has changed . . . whatever reason she had for this was her own choice. She wanted this. - Mon Oct  5 20:04:03 2015

If Beth would walk downstairs she will come in a murdurous looking basement. Blood everywhere. Three corpses hanging down on a rope. Some simple piece of bodies and that kind of shit. Litteraly a horror movie. It aswell was freezing cold down there. 
At the wall is a single picture.. A drawing. A few names are written under it as well as Zetsumo's and a ''me''. On the drawing were all happy faces. But there was a lot of blood spilled on it. In the corners of the basement? Just more gurel stuff around, People's insides and such. * - Mon Oct  5 20:15:08 2015
