<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens up her house, lettin them all inside. It was just a simple normal house.. With a statue made of her nephews body to the right. It was a real body where it was made of. The body of Suitengu.. And he was missing his eyes.
''Come in.''* - Mon Oct 12 08:57:10 2015

She explained as she follows Fujitora down the basement. Inside of the basement... Well... It simply was one horror story.. There were three body's hanging by their neck, as targets for weapons.. A lot of senbon were in them.. Everywhere.. Litteraly.. Was blood.. There were a lot of limbs and insides of humans spread around the rom, aswell as ripped open body's to test things on and to do some research.
She looks at the giant living snake that was placed down. A small smirk curls on her face as it was simply laying there, alive.. And in his eyes it was struggling to break free and reaallyy angry.. But it couldn't do anything.* - Mon Oct 12 09:09:07 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) observes them and listens to them as she studies the snake. She turns around and leans against the table where the snake was bound down to. Her hand rested on the snake.
She observes the both also now on their figure and noticable features. ''Reg was from Kumo right? And came here to study or something... A combat medic sounds intresting.'' She says, nodding. '' I might know something for you once I have mastered it.'' She says to him before observing the shy girl, a faint smile curls on her face. ''Konoha huh And just healing and pharmacy stuff...'' She nods a time. Easy.

For the good ones around..They would notice Zenaki has a quite evil aura around her.. And it would most likely brings shivers up their spine. 

''What do you both know so far?''* - Mon Oct 12 09:27:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks over at a door and opens it up. Behind it there was aa long hallway, light up with candles. She opens one of the doors behind them and grabs two bandits by their hair. A female and a male. She pulls them towards the bloody room they were in. They were screaming, muffled as their mouth was tied up. The rest of the body was paralyzed, completely.

She throws the female to the side as she lifts the male and place him down on an empty table. She then bends to take the female and place it on a table aswell. She brings them next to eachother.. They were screaming out in agony and fear. Zenaki stares at them and lifts up her hand in front of her mouth. She seemingly had no compassion for them. She didn't care about them... Or others.. She flicks her wrists and takes out two saggers.. Before slowly but forcefully place them in their abdomen, cutting them open completely from up to down. Then both once again, horixontal rihght over their ribs and hips... To make an captipal i on their body. Zenaki then places the daggers down and opens up their body's while they scream out and shake their heads of pain. But their body didn't move thanks to the poison.

''Good luck to you two. Do research on this.. And after this I will asl questions..''* - Mon Oct 12 10:31:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) observes the both, shaking her head at Zephira. She takes a deep breath and walks over at Zephira. the 6'0 tall medic places her arms around her and grabs her hands firmly. ''Don't hasitate..'' She says before she forcefully pushes Zephira's hands forcefully inside of the female body. ''Do you feel the warm organs? Still doing their hard work?'' 
Meanwhile the female screams muffled out in agony and fear.
''She moves the hands of the female, under the ribcage on top of the lungs. They were breathing quickly. She moves her other hand over towards where the heart is located. ''Can you feel it beat? Doesn't it feel good?'' A sly smirk on her face. 
Her hand moved on top of her hand, making it squeeze the hand. A big grin curls on her face as she hears the female yell out in pain once again. The hands of both females were now covered in blood.. All dirty, sticky and slimey.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) leans down, only to whisper in her ear. 
''You sure you want to become a medic? If you see your friends, wounded up like this.. And you need to help them.. Are you also going to scream out that it's grose?'' Zenaki asks in her cold and robotic like voice. Her eyes looking down at the body in front of her while moving her hand even more tight around the heart while holding the red-heads hand. She suddenly squeezes, causing the heart to litteraly eplode inside of the body. The female screams out in pain,her eyes rolling back into her head and drool rolling down from her mouth.. Now it's being mixed up with blood before the hearta explodes. In the hands of Zephira it feels like something really just exploded, blood gushing to all sides while other organs kept on moving for a few seconds.

After that done she moves backwards, releasing the hands of Zephira and removing her hands from the body. They were all bloody, blood dripping down from her hands. she lifts her one hand, patitng a few times on Zephira's cheek. ''Keep up the work..'' She says sternly as she hears the knock on the door.

She walks over at Regual, listening to him and watching him working on the body for a moment before she walks upstairs, opening the door, staring at her Master. ''Welcome back, Master..''* - Mon Oct 12 11:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens the door a bit more.. Both her arms are simply completely covered in blood, along with some on her clothing and such. She turns her head, looking down at Nina. ''Hello Nina..'' She says with her robotic like cold tone. ''Welcome in Sunagakure..'' She looks back at her Master again. 
''Mm.. Almost done with what I had to do. The red-head was afraid of cutting and touchin organs.. I teached her a lesson.'' 
She looks down the stairs, seeing the girl down on the ground. 
'' She's most likely scared right now.. But she will be fine.. As for the guy..'' 
She turns back. ''He is doing pretty well..''* - Mon Oct 12 12:11:44 2015

And prossible dead male right now aswell. She places them to the side before crouching down to pic up the girl and bring her outside. 
''Come Reg. I'll clean stuff up later.''* - Mon Oct 12 12:34:46 2015

''There was this girl who simply hated.. Blood.. And she wanted to become a medic.. Like.. How can you not love blood.. I did cut open a living human only for her to fondle and look around in and such... And she though it was sooo grose.. So I moved to stand behind her, grabbed her hands and froced them inside of the still living human.. Her hand was moved towards the heart and wrapped around while the other hand moved over organs. She screamed and yelled because it was so grose... And yea.. Then you don't have to become a medic.. Hm.. So I simply grabbed that heart with her hand, and crushed it. It litteraly exploded.. It was quite funny.'' 
She explains before a soft giggle was released after. She opens up the door of the hospital and walks over towards a room with a bed and such inside of it. * - Mon Oct 12 22:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Oh.. The one on the table.. Surely felt pain.. The bandit yelled and screamed out in pain. A delicious sound..  - Mon Oct 12 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: And the girl? She is feared for her life, traumatized. - Mon Oct 12 22:29:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) whispers: Well thats intresting. - Mon Oct 12 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time, chuckling. 

She then closes the door of the room they were in behind her, locking it even. 
''Mm.. I need you to undress, place your clothes in the empty closet over there. '' Her hands moved to point over at a closet. ''Then lay down on the bed. I'll get some stuff.. To actually do this. What was it again? You wanted to look like a boy and.. Keep the female part right?''
Meanwhile Zenaki takes her doctors cloak and gloves and all and puts them on... Afterwards a braid is made from her hair. * - Tue Oct 13 13:42:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at her, nodding a time. She takes a notebook, writing the things down. 
''Facial more manly.. No breasts... More muscle I guess and voice..'' She writes it down and then taps the pencil against her chin. ''I think, actually. We can do the muscle growth and you voice with pills. If I add testesteron in it.. It should change your voice and muscle growth.'' She says as a soft smile curls on her face. She lifts her gae, looking at Beth's body. She nods a time. ''As for your face... Might indeed just make the nose a bit bigger. If you want facial hair.. These pills will help.'' She then looks down at her chest. '' And that will be all fine.. I don't want to risk to much you know.'' She says with a smile as she looks up again. ''But I will make sure we'll get it done. You just need patience... It can't be done in one day hm..''* - Tue Oct 13 14:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Could you do it in one day? - Tue Oct 13 14:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I can try. The surgery can. The pills I can make. But. I do not know. If everything will change in one day. - Tue Oct 13 14:26:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Besides you probably need two or three days rest up. Even with my healing technique's. - Tue Oct 13 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: That's fine. - Tue Oct 13 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: spelt - Tue Oct 13 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Looks down at Beth before she moves through the room, taking all dfferent kind machines. She walks over at Beth and takes her hand, placing a sort clip on her finger to keep controle of her heartbeat. A needle was taken and placed in her other hand. An IV. ''I hope it will be fine.. Fine enough atleast.. Hm..'' Her hand moved on top of Beth's face, stroking once through her hair. ''Don't be nervous okay?'' She says with a soft smile while her scars extend it. She then walks over at the medicines, taking two out. She takes the thread that leads to the IV. ''I will put you asleep. After you wake up..You'll see what I did.. But it will sure make it look well.. After that, I'll make you the pills.'' She explains while she places the two seringes with medicines on the IV, placing it inside so it flows through her blood. A smile on her face as she does so.. Beth would probably be asleep in within 10 seconds. The other seringe with medicines was just a painkiller for once she wakes up. 

Zenaki takes a deep breath as she watches Beth fall asleep. Her eyes close for a small moment. She had just such big idea's to do things on her.. Maybe she should.. Maybe she just should try something out, besides the nose and chest.. Her eyes close as she thinks, starting to walk through the room. Hm.. She then shakes her head. Nah.. She wasn't going to do that.. She'd been taken care of already. 
A faint smirk curls on her face before she opens her eyes again. She walks over to take all different kind of tools. This was going to be a new experience for Zenaki aswell. She'd done so many surgeries.. And this sure was less scary to do so then all the eyes surgery's.

Zenaki takes a small knife in her hands and rag with alcohol on it. She looks down at Beth and simply places the rag and alcohol ontop of her breasts, cleaning them up. Oh god. Luckily they were tiny.. Easier to remove then the giant breasts like Zenaki herself. She places the rag to the side and extending her small knife and piecing it down onto Beth's flesh. She cuts carefully just around the nipple, and downwards.. On both sides. She takes a clean rag and cleans a tiny bit of blood from there. She then takes a tool to spread up the wound.. Just so  Zenaki can carefully remove the inside of the breast. She uses the rag to carefully move the blood away.. She takes the mammary gland from the breast and places it to the side. As she does all this she is very careful. Thanks to her amazing sight this was easy to do. She moves the fat in the breast to the side and this way shapes a more ''manly'' chest. She does this exact same thing to the other one.. Very careful. Of course. She was a surgeon after all.

After she was done with that she stitches it up again and places the knife to the side She performs a few hand seals before a green chakra emits form her palms. She places her hands down on top of Beth her now really flat chest and starts to heal the wounds up. Not completely.. But just good enough so they would be healed in a few days. Her eyes wander over, just to look if it look manly enough. She nods a time. It will do. Besides she needs to train to make those muscles after all. 

Her eyes wander of towards Beth sleeping face.. She looks at her and closes her eyes for a small moment. Why a surgery on such a pretty face. She takes the knife again and cuts open the nose.. Just a small bit between the brows. It would be gone again after Zenaki healed it. A cloth is placed on it as she moves over at Beth her leg. Making a small gash and taking some fat from it. This will be placed in the nose to lift it and make it bigger. She takes it and closes the small cut after before walking back at the head of Beth. She takes the fat and inserts it in the small slit. Making it appearance of a bigger and more manly nose. She uses this fat as well to widen up the nostrils a bit. Cutting it open and filling them up before closing them again with her jutsu. 

A deep breath his taken. Almost done. She moves her hands over to make small slits in the jaws.. Inserting there fat as well to make the face look more square like instead of pointy.. She heals the cuts up afterwards. She looks over the new face of Beth. It did change into a more manlier shape.. A soft smile curls on her face as she thinks of something.. What about a mustache? Nah.. If she wants it. She'll grow it later on.
Zenaki moves and starts to clean up everything while she simply waits for Beth to wake up. If she would wake up.. Ofcourse she would feel the pain in her chest.. But.. It wasn't that much.. As for her face? She wouldn't feel much difference.. Only see. As Zenaki had cleaned up everything she sits down on the chair, taking her notebook and writing in it while she waits for Beth to wake up.  * - Tue Oct 13 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up from her medical book he was reading.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves to stand up. ''Sit up.'' She says as she takes a glass and fills it with water before bringing it over. She waits for Betht to sit up before handing the glass with water.* - Tue Oct 13 17:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm..  - Tue Oct 13 18:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks away from her again, taking a mirror. She moves it and holds it in front of her so she could see her chest and head.
Her chest was way more manly right now.. And her face also more manly thanks to the wider nose and squary face. ''Like this?''* - Tue Oct 13 18:08:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at her Master for a small moment. '' I've been Uhm.. Working? I gues.. Kind of.. '' She says in response before she looses her function for a moment in her arms. Her eyes widened up and she looks down at them . ''H-Huh... '' She says as she stares at her arms.. Not soon after she could move her arms again slowly on.. That.. Was weird... She looks up at her Master once again waiting for a response.* - Tue Oct 13 20:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: D-Did I leave without permission, Master? - Tue Oct 13 20:30:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her head to the side, following Beth with her eyes. What was she going to do in her basement?  She turns her gaze again onto Fujitora and walks over. She places her hands on his shoulder and then simply leans in, pressing her lips once against his. Just a simply small loving kiss.* - Tue Oct 13 20:36:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at Fujitora as she was pushed away softly. She looks a bit worried, frowning even. ''What's wrong.. Master.. I.. I just love you..'' She says. She was obvious really jealous still about the other day between the three. She moves her arms, suddenly wrapping them around Fujitora for a close hug.

//As for Beth?
She would litteraly walk inside of some horror movie. Everywhere are corspes.. It was freezing cold.. A froge, bones, libs, organs, blood -everywhere- ..
And somehow a fridge with a neat kitchen.. Clean and sorted.. Compared to the rest of the basement.. This was really a showroom. Inside of the fridge? It was locked. If she could manage to break it somehow.. She would find bottles with meat in it. Small pieces of meat. Slices of meat.. And that stuff. 
Also a few bottles of alcoholic drinks.* - Tue Oct 13 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly in respose. She turns head head a bit and places her head down on his chest for a small moment before turning and looking at Beth. She releases her Master as she walks over, plopping down next to her. 
''How is your chest..?''* - Tue Oct 13 20:56:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Feeling fine. - Tue Oct 13 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves up her arm, wrapping it around Beth. But not holding her. Just behind her over the couch.
''Mm.. Alrighty then..''* - Tue Oct 13 21:12:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: What are you doing? - Tue Oct 13 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: sitting? - Tue Oct 13 21:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Your arm. - Tue Oct 13 21:14:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: ... - Tue Oct 13 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks a bit curious down at the small notebook of Beth before closing her eyes. She moves her head simply forwards again and let her head hang backwards against the couch.  ''Mmmm.."* - Tue Oct 13 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her free hand down, taking the hand of Beth who was reaching down between her thighs. A small blush creeps on her face before she simply takes it away from there. ''Don't do that...'' She says in a robotic like voice as she looks over at Beth next to her.* - Tue Oct 13 21:25:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) winches lightly as her thigh was kind of being squeezed hard once again. Her eyes closed as she winched.. And before she even knew a kiss was placed on her bottom lip. She opens her eyes to look at Beth again, listening to her whispering words. Her eyes narrow a bit. Her hand moved and she placed it down on her now completely flat chest, pushing her a bit away from her.. Which most likely might hurt. She doesn't say anything in response and just keeps her dull eyes focussed on her.* - Tue Oct 13 21:31:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand, pressing even harder back.. Causing Beth to push her body in even more. She winches softly again as her thigh was being squeezed again. She moves her body a bit backwards, squeezing her legs together so Beth can't move her hand closer more. Her other hand also moved down, placing it down against the other side of her chest to push her away. 
''You are the little one here.. And looks like you are the hornyu slutty one hm'' She plainly responds.* - Tue Oct 13 21:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her legs slightly apart to allow Beth move her hand away. But her own hand moved to grab her hand, to make sure she couldn't make any handseals.
''You are -not- going to do that again,Beth.'' She says, staring at her.* - Tue Oct 13 21:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: . .  - Tue Oct 13 21:47:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand, holding her hand even tighter. Squeezing it roughly even to press the bones together. 
''No.''* - Tue Oct 13 21:49:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: But, Beth. If I do. I know you are going to catch me again in some sort of mind thing.  - Tue Oct 13 21:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: And what if it happends? How will Master think about it if I till it to him?  - Tue Oct 13 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) releases her hand slowly. If she used force she could pull it away.* - Tue Oct 13 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at Beth as she snuggles up against her. She doesn't seem to struggle against it. She was her sister now after all. And hugging was what sisters did right?  Her eyes closed, an arm moving up only to wrap it around Beth. Because. Why not.* - Tue Oct 13 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You know you enjoy it more then ever. - Tue Oct 13 22:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Enjoy what? - Tue Oct 13 22:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares down as Beth as she was moving her hands. Zenaki's hand would movforwards, placing it inbetween the hands and grasping onto Beths hand. She keeps a deadly lock on the girl who lays down against her. 
''I wonder.. Aren't you every getting tired of that?''* - Tue Oct 13 22:24:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) allows her to do so, releasing her hand again. Her hand moves over to simply stroke through her short hair. ''You should rest up.''* - Tue Oct 13 22:29:58 2015
