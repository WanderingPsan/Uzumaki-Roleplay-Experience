''Zenaki.'' She responds blankly, her dull but deadly eyes focussing on him.* - Mon Sep 21 13:06:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at Suitengu again. She sees and notices his eyes. Did they change? One of her hands moved up to rub over his hair. She will look at those later. Her gaze turns back on the ones in front of her. She doesn't pay much attention to the evil dark aura. It was usual for her to feel that such of aura around her. She was Zetsumo's sister after all. And had experienced a  -lot- with him. * - Mon Sep 21 13:12:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) places her feet down on the ground. Sheuses her hands to replace her clothing. It was wrinkled.. Ugh.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sits down across of him. She closes her eyes for a moment and opens them after. She takes the other pair of chopsticks and rubs them inbetween her fingers for a moment. She then carefully places them down between her fingers, reaching down to take one inbetween her chopsticks. She waits, though. * - Tue Sep 22 16:18:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks forwards as she also places one sushi in her mouth. She casually munches it down before opening her mouth to talk again. 
''Who knows.'' She responds again. * - Tue Sep 22 16:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand up to just place his hand down again. To close. She closes her eyes as she remembers some things in restaurants. Gosh.. She hates it.
She opens her eyes again as he whispers to her ear. Her hand now moved to push him away again. 
''To close..''* - Tue Sep 22 16:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes again. She releases a sigh before she places another sushi in her mouth. She ignores him and refuses to make a comment to it.* - Tue Sep 22 16:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes again as he starts to speak. She listens to him and shakes her head in response to the first question. Then she locks her gaze at the offered sushi.. Oh god.. She closes her eyes for a moment before leaning in. She takes the sushi in her mouth and munches it down. Zenaki loved sushi way to much. She can't deny it.* - Tue Sep 22 16:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes as she gets the wine offered. She tkes it in her hands but doesn't drink it yet. Who knows what could be inside of it? 

''I doubt it.'' She blankly responds to him. * - Tue Sep 22 16:49:42 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she suddenly was being grapsed. She looks Fujitora steight into his eyes. And welp. Yep. She was being caught in a genjutsu.
''Eh.. Well... I once.. Was raped.. Well twice..I don't like people touching me..'' She responds to him in a rather calm tone. Her hand moved and aimed to pull it back, if she even could.* - Tue Sep 22 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I'll protect you..Just as your brother would have. - Tue Sep 22 17:18:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) lowers her gaze slightly as he moves his hands on her cheeks. Her eyes widened up again and a blush creeps upon her face as he plants a kiss on her lips. Her hand moved up to push him slightly away from herself. She says nothing in response. She doesn't even want to say anything. 

''Your hushing words will not affect me.'' She says in response. Her hands now placed behind herself to not get placed won on her back. Her legs closed together to refuse him. She says nothing else in response to his hushing whispering words.* - Tue Sep 22 17:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: This is our, personal..Experiment. - Tue Sep 22 17:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hands again to push him away. But somehow. She feels herself being weaker then before. Gosh. She closes her eyes and pushes him a bit harder away from herself as a small bite in her neck was given. ''I-I.. I believe you will protect... Me.. And I.. Like experimenting. but I don't know if I like it in this way.'' The responds in all honestly. She still refuses to open her les up for him, using her might to keep them closed. 
A hand is wrapped around her back and she is pulled closer to him. She moves her body and tries to push herself away again. She closes her eyes as she listens to the other words, though. She doesn't seem to respond to it.* - Tue Sep 22 17:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Oh? Is this the the first experiment you may not like?..Well, that means we'll have to test our hypothesis now wont we? - Tue Sep 22 17:43:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she feels a burning sensation in her neck. She grits and her teeth and grunts softly as she feels that burning sensation on her neck.. Leaving a scar behind she doesn't know of yet. 
The words of Fujitora now started to boom and repeat themselves in her head. She feels force used on her legs to opens them up as he was yelling at her in a whispering tone though. She tries to refuse it and close her eyes even more with her own strength.. But yea.. As everyone. He is stronger then Zenaki. She feels him pushing down against her body and she averts her gaze slightly to him. The skin in her neck still hurting.. That.. What was that..
She nods slowly in response as his words keep on repeating themselves in her head.* - Tue Sep 22 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as he moved his hand over into her shirt. She feels an aggressive grasp onto her bandaged breast. She gasped softly, moving her legs to perhaps push him away? She chooses not to respond again but simply yelped out softly as she feels her nipple slightly being pinched. Thanks to the bandage it wasn't that hard. * - Tue Sep 22 17:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: I get it..You must want me to fight for it. - Tue Sep 22 18:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side, a dull glance in Ushinawa as he starts to talk to her. Looks like she was kind of pulled of this world. She then moves her gaze forwards again and closes her eyes as she leans back against the wall. Her arms folded.* - Wed Sep 23 13:02:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: Forget... It... Mmm... - Wed Sep 23 13:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes for a moment before moving to lift Suitengu in her arms. She walks off.* - Wed Sep 23 13:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: The target is moving! - Wed Sep 23 13:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) doesn't lift him. She simply walks off without him. She finds him later again.* - Wed Sep 23 13:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) thinks: Abort mission! - Wed Sep 23 13:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks closer towards Fujitora and Suitengu. A soft smile is on her lips. Her eyes dulled and kinda lifeless. ''Mmm.. Hey hey..'' She says in a dull tone of her voice, hushing but dull. Nothing like Zenaki used to be. She closes her eyes as she walks on. * - Wed Sep 23 16:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda walks over. She sits down next to Fujirtora and looks over at Suitengu. ''I will talk with you later hm.. Need to check on you still..''* - Wed Sep 23 16:33:04 2015
