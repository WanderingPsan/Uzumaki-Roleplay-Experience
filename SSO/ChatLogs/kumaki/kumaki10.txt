<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side, chuckling. ''I will promise not to kill you.. Master...'' She says before she leans forwards. She presses a soft kiss on his cheek before lifting him up in her arms. She walks out of the house towards another house... One Zenaki recently made in her own torture room. Litteraly everything was there. She places Fujitora carefully downon top of a chair which you can fold out towards a bed. She binds his hands with belts.. Inside of the belts are spikes.. Which pierce into his skin forcefully.. Making his hands and feet immobile. Thanks to the ain pill he would not wake up from it.. But.. After he will wake up after a time. That pain will obvious return.

Zenaki now takes some machines and connects his body with it, the chair aswell. Then she moves over to some other torture tools and places everything down nicely.. And ofcourse.. She takes some bandage, wrapping it around his eyes so he can't see anything. She opens his mouth to wrap the bandage there aswell. Then chains are taken and wrapped around hie upper body and his upper legs, tying him down on the chair/bed. 
Now.. She just sits down.. And waits for him to wake. The time to wake his eye had come.. Time to torture her Master... To show him her true self.. The evil bitch. Maybe she can even experiment on him? * - Sat Oct  3 15:20:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) chuckles lightly under her breath before motioning for Kirie and Lera to follow. Once in the hospital she motions them to sit down. ''Stretch your arm. and relax it. you aswell.'' She looks over at Lera. She then crouches down  Her arm moved in her bag to take the medical supplies. Two needles. Two small bottles. She waits for them to do as instructed.* - Sat Oct  3 17:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the girl with black hair, smiling softly. ''I mainly make pizza with pork, chees, tomatosauce and some vegatables. It's my speciality.'' She responds to her. as she starts to do her work. ''The pork I hunt down in a farm near. Yes. There is a farm near to be honest. Even if it doesn't look like it. The younger the pigs, the more delicious they are.'' She explains as she starts to tie off both the arms of Kirie and Lera. She takes the needles and and plants them inside of the vein of both the girls. She starts with Lera, taking the blood from her arm, filling one bottle with it. After that she places the bottle away and closes it, shaking it up a bit before placing it to the side. Then he moves back to take the needle from her arm, pressing down a gause on the remaining spot. She cleans it up just a little bit before placing aplaster on it. Awwwhhh.

This exact same process she does to Kirie. Taking blood from her, placing it in the bottle. The bottle is closed and shaken up before being placed to the side. She aswell cleans up that little wound with the gause after the needle was removed.. Then a plaster was placed on top of it. 

After that she hands both of the girls a glass with lemonade so they will not pass out from loosing some sugar from their blood. Zenaki turns and write things down on the bottles, names, age, blablabla. She'll inspect it later.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response before she walks off. ''Stay here. I will be back soon.''

She now walks towards the basement. Inside there she takes four jars. A grin curls on her face and she starts to hum as she was going to make the pizza's. A normal one and a biiiiiggg one. She starts with kneading the dough and spread it all over the plates. After that she adds the tomato sauce on it, the cheese.. veggies... The meat.. And cheese again. She places them in the giant forge... The place where corpses will be burned when they are no longer needed. But ofcourse they will never notice.

She hums as she now waits for the pizza's to be ready. The smell of the pizza's slowly start to spread acros the hospital. ''Mmmm~'' After about ten minutes a ping was heard in her lab. She walks over at the pizzas and takes them out of the forge before she walks with the pizza's over at the knifes. She cuts them down in either eight slices before walking up towards the two girls patiently waiting for their pizza. ''Mmm~ Here here~'' She says with a smile on her face as she hands them either their pizza. It was still steaming hot and the smell was more then delicious. The big pizza was three times as big as the smaller one.* - Sat Oct  3 17:57:45 2015

Once in the basement she looks around. It was.. quite bloody.. Five dead bodies around. A giant cool cell.. A neatly stocked drawer with glass, a forge.. And whatever else. Even a small kitchen with the pizza stuff if she needed to make pizza. But that was mostly hidden from sigh. She moves up her hand and points it over at the one free table. ''There we have some space.. Don't look at the mess.. Still need to clean it up.'' She'd say with her robot like voice.

One of the corpses was laying all and about on the table. Being cut up completely and all insides out. Another one was in the corner, slit through the troath. Another one on a chair. Also slit through the troath and bounded down. The two remaining? Welll.. There was not much remaining. Those were more like body parts left. Two heads.. Three arms.. And one leg.* - Sun Oct  4 00:59:18 2015

''Looks like you are awake.. Master...''

On every spot he has something like iron on his body.. It would burn into his skin. 

Zenaki didn't keep up the electricity for to long since she didn't want him to die, after all. Her foot moved to he side again after a several seconds. '' How much do you love me, Master~?'' Zenaki asks with her robot like voice before she pushes herself up and walks over at him. * - Sun Oct  4 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to grin wide as soon as he screamed out in pain. Ah.. This scream was even more pleasurable then all the others. Her Masters scream~ 
Zenaki cuckles not soon after and walks closer to him. She places her hand underneath his chin and lifts it slightly.Her lips flattened as her deadly gaze pierce at his. ''Do you truly love me?'' She asks with her robot like voice. '' What about your ''wife''? Don't you love her?'' 

Zenaki's hand moved away from his chin again and she takes a step backwards, lifting her leg and curshing down her heel in his privates. ''Hmm~?! You love her more than you love me hm!?'' Zenaki crouches down to look at him, her gaze was really cold at the moment. As if she didn't care about Fujitora's safety right now. Yet. She did ofcourse.* - Sun Oct  4 06:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to laugh as he screamed out in pain. ''You don't love me enough! I can see you are thinking of her! Love me more! Love me truly!'' She yells out at him as she moves her foot over, pressing down on the one button again. As soon as he moves his rist or ancle.. The spikes would most likely pierce in his ancles or wrists. Another sudden shock of electricity was send right through his body. 

After that she walks away and takes another device. A perfect device. And a random arm. It was grose and smelling, rotting already even. She still kind of needs to clean the room.. She walks back at him and places the arm in front of his face. ''Bite it... You will need it...'' She says with a stern voice. Her deadly eyes gazing back again in his very own.* - Sun Oct  4 07:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) grins even wider before she takes the device forwards. It was a whip. But not a normal whip.. No no. There were 9 threads along it with every few inch a ball with spikes. 
''You say you love me... But yet.. I know you don't... You love her to much.. Way to much...'' She says before spanking him on top of his lap, piercing with the small spikes into his lap. ''Stop loving her and forget about her completely, Master~'' She says before she spanks him once again on his lap! Then it was lifted up, spanking it on to his chest area!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) grins wide as he screams out in pain and agony. She moves her whip and slams it once again against him.. This time his arm. She let the spikes pierce and then get pulled out by the force behind it, leaving deep gashes and scratches. 

''Ah~ You also said something about being my test subject. I know something perfect.. That fits perfectly with you~'' She says before she walks over at the cooling cell. She takes a jar from there and then a jar from a closet. Another jar was taken aswell. She places down everything and starts to laugh as she was starting to mix up the different mixtures in the jars. One bowl was made from the different mixtures. She walks off and takes a giant injection needle. She opens it up and fills it with the newly crated mixture of blood, water and some meat. Enough DNA~ To say atleast!

She turns to look at Fujitora and smiles at him, waiting for a response of him while she slowly on walks closer with the giant injection needle in her hands.* - Sun Oct  4 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) grins wide as she walks closer towards him. She places the injection needle on his arm and pushes the needle inside with rough force, right into his muscle. ''I do not know what actually is inside of it~ But we will fnd out soon enough~'' She says with a grin as she injects some of the liquid inside of his arm. Then it was taken out and placed on his neck, injecting some in his muscles there aswell.. Meanwhile he might beg or whatever else.. But she would just keep on going injecting him in his legs, abdomen and other places. Until the seringe was completely empty. 
''Oh.. Now I think about it. This way you will always be with your ''wife..' '' Zenaki says with a grin on her face, waiting for a slight response of him. Hopefully going to drive him crazy this way. She hates to say it. But it might help him to awake his eye aswell~ * - Sun Oct  4 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to laugh as she places the needle to the side. ''Ofcourse I know where she is~ She is inside you... You ate her. I ate her.. Kirie ate her... Seisuke ate her..'' Zenaki laughs even more out now.
''I killed her! She was way to annoying! I just inserted her DNA! Her blood inside of you! Ahahahahaha!'' A loud laugh escapes from her lips before a grin curls on her face,her eyes are widened but seem still lifeless. Zenaki was pulled away from this world. 

''I know you would like that~ Oh. What I loved her face at the moment her adams apple got cut out. Her blood splashed everywhere!'' At the moment she doesn't care if Fujitora was going to scream or such. She just kept on talking and laughing. 
''Don't you think she tasted delicious~ Her lovely meat in your stomach now! It was on my pizza! My pizza! The small pigs~ Ahahahaha! You ate your own wife! I killed her! Ahahaahha!''* - Sun Oct  4 08:56:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You are such a bad husband~ Such a horrible husband! - Sun Oct  4 08:57:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to laugh even harder at the sudden sight of his rage. Zenaki walks backwards and moves her foot to stand on top of the button.. Sending yet another powerfull rage of electricity trough his whole body. Zenaki laughed even louder and louder as she send electricity trough him. After a second of five she moved backwards from the heat, laughing and laughing. She backs up against the door while laughing, moving up her hand on top of the door handle. She was ready to escape any time soon!

The belts around Fujitora would most likely melt and scorch away.. Same for the chains around him. * - Sun Oct  4 09:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes even more wide as she starts to pant from her laughter.. She stops in midst laughter before moving top open up the door. But looks like Fujitora was quicker. She ran away but not soon after she was found pinned down on the ground and turned to face him. Zenaki kept the grin on her face as she feels the fire burn down against her skin. ''I.. Killed... Her...'' Zenaki says in a teasing and insane tone before she starts to laugh again. Zenaki looks like she is somehow half corrupted or something. In this state ofcourse she feels a giant pain. But it looks like right now she laughed it off.* - Sun Oct  4 09:23:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) is being hit on the face by the flames around his body, aswell as his fist connecting her cheek. The laughter of Zenaki became harder and harder.. A giant burn on her cheek right now.
But before long, she was silent. Her eyes widened up at the sudden burst into her stomach. Then another one! And another one! ''I-I.. I-I can't g-g-ive her back! S-She is gone! F-Forever!'' She says as she gasps out for air. On her stomach now also quite some good burning wounds, right through her clothing!
''Now you will always love e! Y-You can never love her again! S-She is dead because you are so sick! So horrible! So fucking h-!!'' At that moment the chain was wrapped around her neck. Her breath became short and heavy as she was being choked. At some moment she couldn't even breath anymore! Her hands moved up to remove the chain from her neck.. And she was about to pass out from having no breath! But before she even could pass out.. The chain was removed, leaving a giant bloody strain behind in her neck. All red choking marks are left behind. She gasps for air.. 
But again before long she was whipped by the chain, it being slammed against her body. ''K-Kyaa!!'' The female screams out in pain, gasping for air in the meantime.* - Sun Oct  4 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: Weirdest comedy I've ever seen. - Sun Oct  4 10:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) screams out in pain as she was being hit over her whole body wit the chains, leaving giant bruises and under the skin bloody places behind. They would stay for a good while! 
Zenaki opens her eyes wide as soon as she feels a blow right next to her ear, onto th ground. That hurted her ear! She looks directly at Fujitora. Now seemingly scared and back into the normal world again. Her both hands moved up again as he grabbed her. She wraps both hands around her wrist.. To stop him! But she was thrown in the wall. She slides down along the wall and blood sipd down from her parted lips. 

''Nnngh..'' Her now dull and lifeless eyes were set back on him again as he moved to take her neck and pin her down once again. She opens her eyes as she feels him choking her again.. A feeling of fear and agony runs down her spine.. Yet.. He let go of her and stared her right in the eyes. She stares back with her dull and lifeless eyes.
Her lips parted to speak: ''I-I.. Am.. Sorry.. M-Master..'' She'd say before she simply passes out from the violence used on her fragile body. Zenaki wasn't durable at all.. And.. She didn't hear his words in person.. But somehwere in her subcncious she would hear the words.
Zenaki was KO.* - Sun Oct  4 10:07:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) after some time he would find a lock behind a bloodied painting. On the painting itself was a drawing.. A childs drawing. Underneath it were written some names, on the drawing itself. 
-mom, dad, Zetsumo, me, Zetu, Siara, Kumon.-  All happy faces.
But now the paitning was all bloodied, though the names would be visible. * - Sun Oct  4 10:46:24 2015

If they would walk inside they would see  a drak hallways, lit up by only a few candles. A few doors are there aswell. All not really locked. If they would look inside. There were medical supplies everywhere. Some thinga needed to be cleaned up. In one of the room there were a lot of jars with formaldehyde. Inside of that liquid there were different body parts to be studied on. 
At the end of the hallways would be the door towards the lab. A sign with danger on it. The door was slightly bloodied aswell. There were no traps around. Zenaki was not skilled enough to place them..

As for Zenaki herself? She just kinda lays there, KO. Her eyes closed and such. Standard stuff.* - Sun Oct  4 10:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes slowly from the KO'ed state. Her eyes blurry and lifeless as she just kinda lays down. Her eyes shift towards the figures in the room.. The seemed all blurry. Her mouth opened to speak, but instead she coughs and grunts right after. Her eyes closed again after, panting softly from the pain in her body still. Eventhough it was being healed up on the burned places.* - Sun Oct  4 11:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Sun Oct  4 11:44:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . . If I may ask, Zenaki. What's this place? - Sun Oct  4 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Bandage.. - Sun Oct  4 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) thinks: If Kilm won't ask then I will. - Sun Oct  4 11:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shifts her gaze towards Taiga. She pushes herself slowly upwards, taking a deep breath to move the pain away from her body. ''Why do you want to know..'' She asks coldly. With her same robot like tone.* - Sun Oct  4 11:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Then.. Don't come here.. - Sun Oct  4 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: . . Touch. - Sun Oct  4 11:48:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I already know what this place is just from seeing it. - Sun Oct  4 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) thinks: So.. They've seen everything.. Huh... - Sun Oct  4 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: What is this place Kilm? - Sun Oct  4 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: A lab. - Sun Oct  4 11:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I can bet all these corpses were once 'dolls'. - Sun Oct  4 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... - Sun Oct  4 11:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Harada, Taiga(Dopespruit) says: Then may I ask why you have this lab? - Sun Oct  4 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And that's a question you don't need answered Taiga. - Sun Oct  4 11:51:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Because... I have it.. - Sun Oct  4 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Can....We just go? - Sun Oct  4 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright, We're going outside. - Sun Oct  4 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We'll see you later. - Sun Oct  4 11:52:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... - Sun Oct  4 11:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him and then nods slowly. She moves up both her hands, performing some seals before placing her palms on his arm. A green hue emits from it and she starts to heal the poor guy. She looks down while she does so.
''What.. Exactly happend...'' She says to him as she keeps her gaze down. Zenaki seems to remind not much from it.* - Sun Oct  4 11:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. I.. - Sun Oct  4 12:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... - Sun Oct  4 12:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at him as she moves her hands away. Her hand moved on top of his head and strokes through his hair.* - Sun Oct  4 12:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Ye - Sun Oct  4 12:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda walks up the square. Nothingmuch. She raises a brow as she sees someone familiar. She walks over at katsune, tapping on her shoulder.. If she would turn she would start to whisper. * - Sun Oct  4 15:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Kat before a small mile curls on her face. She moves to stand next  to her. On Zenaki's cheek was a burn wound.. It was healing. Around her neck were blood strains and cuts. She starts to whisper.* - Sun Oct  4 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Heya.. Didn't see you in quite a time. - Sun Oct  4 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: How are you? - Sun Oct  4 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Hm. Good. - Sun Oct  4 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: You? - Sun Oct  4 16:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Mhm.. Kinda aye. Why are you here? Same reason as Kilm? - Sun Oct  4 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Whatever Kilm told you it was probably not the truth. - Sun Oct  4 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: Well, the environment here is... different. - Sun Oct  4 16:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I told him to be subtle and lie. He's not good at it. - Sun Oct  4 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I was being hunted by Erebus. He went mad. Thought I was manipulating to him and lying. - Sun Oct  4 16:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: -- I wasn't. - Sun Oct  4 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: He said something about running away from Erebus. - Sun Oct  4 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Heard reports about you apparently being possessed in some way. Enslaved. - Sun Oct  4 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Hm.. Oh? - Sun Oct  4 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) thinks: Doesn't seem too lively compared to Kirigakure... - Sun Oct  4 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Sent Erebus after you. Hoped he could get you and we could find out if you really were in trouble. - Sun Oct  4 16:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: But, I ended up having to watch my own back before I could ever do anything about it. - Sun Oct  4 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: I assume Fujitora told you all of this. - Sun Oct  4 16:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: I.. I do not remember him telling anything. Erebus came to get me. And I got in Konoha.. Then that fight with eh.. Hanabi. And I went away again because my Master needed me.  - Sun Oct  4 16:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Needed Hanabi. Too bad she died. - Sun Oct  4 16:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) whispers: Erebus was an idiot. Never met someone so stupid in my life. - Sun Oct  4 16:06:24 2015
