''Wake up. I need you. Right now. Emergency.'' 
She then throws the pillow back on her.* - Sat Nov  7 23:54:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the vial from the table before she walks to the basement. She opens the door and walks down. The other two have to follow her. It is freezing cold down in her basement. As usual, blood everywhere, limbs, organs, bodies, bones.. Whatever else. She walks up to another door and opens it.. Simply walking and stepping through the blood on the ground. Her basement was litteraly a horror movie. * - Sun Nov  8 00:11:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks throught the hallway hidden behind the other door. All the way towards the back. The hallways was long and dark, only lightened up by some candles here and there.. A lot of doors are there aswell, all closed. On some is blood spilled. Some are old, some new and very clean... Zenaki walks into one of the rooms with clean doors, opening up a -perfect- clean operation room.
''Come inside..Take of your clothes and place them in the bin in the right drawer.'' She says as she takes two doctors coats. She hands one to Erin.. Then aswell surgical gloves and a facemask thing. 
''First time for you being with a surgery, right Erin?'' She asks her as she puts on the clothing and then taking some sort of pyjama's for the guy. She hands it t him. ''Put these on. for safety stuff.''* - Sun Nov  8 00:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the guys, nodding once to him as he layed down. She made sure he would lay on his stomach so she could actually see his head better. To be honest? She might have to shave his hair off. So he will be bald for a while. Her eyes avert to Erin '' Get yourself ready. and Rikune. This will cost you some good money. So you know. Even if you die.'' 

She then walks over to the IV stand, connecting it to the guy by placing an IV in his arm. She connects his body to another machine to check his heartbeat. This was going to be a fucking hard surgery. If it will fail. She has more pizza. If it will work? Well, no pizza for Zenaki. She takes a white like liquid. No, no sperm.. She places it in the IV and she starts to count till sixty, slowly on...''One.. two... three... four...'' He would probably fall asleep by count 6 or 7, meanwhile she continue's counthing while she takes all the stuff she needs tfor the surgery. A lot of resources.. A -lot-.... She just hopes he has the money for it.* - Sun Nov  8 00:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods towards Erin as she takes a scissor. As he had fallen asleep, and Zenaki had counted all the sixty seconds.. She starts to cut  away his hair gently. For the surgery ofcourse. She doesn't want any hair to get in there! So she takesthe hair away from him and then cuts it  down until there is barely hair left. Sorry guy. You have to regrow it. 
Zenaki's eyes ander of for a small moment before looking back at the guy. She places the scissors away and throws the hair away aswell. ''Start now, Erin. This has to be done quickly. No blood may be wasted. Don't heal to fast because it will only be in the way if I do the surgery. But make sure there is no blood spilled.'' Zenaki explains as she takes a small knife and a pincet. She starts to cut open the wound very carefully. Just a little bit more so she can actually see the fractured bone. Now she will wait for Erin to do her magical hand stuff before she starts the actual surgery. * - Sun Nov  8 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time to Erin as if saying thanks in her own kind of way before she starts to move her hand, gently taking the splints from the skull away from the brains.. After a while doing so she looked if everything was okay. Her extremely good eyes saw nothing anymore and with that she starts to do her surgery. Her hands in a few handseals for chakra scalpels.. They formed around her hands and she placed it on his head gently, exactly making a small cut there where she needs it. with that she didn't let it bleed or such.. Since she was very gentle in doing such things. She then would start her work. Since this was all new for Zenaki it was quite nerve taking. But she had read enough books to know almost everything for as far her brains could absorb information. Even she didn't understand everything just yet. 
After being busy for about an hour.. She looks up at Erin, watching if she could still keep it up. She must be really exhausted after this. 
Zenaki now takes a new some kind of bone, placing it on the place where the bone was missing. She would stitch it in some sort of way. Yes. Stitch bones. Just to keep it in place. With that done she takes the skin and folds it back in place, making sure everything was cleaned up. With that she starts to close it with the use of stitching and ofcourse the great healing of Erin. She had to keep it up anyways. Zenaki would transfer chakra to her after this. Since it simply takes a great amount of chakra. Zenaki moves her hands away from the boys head as she was done, allowing Erin to heal up his wound a bit more. ''wrap up his head with bandage. Behind you in the drawer..'' She explains as she starts to clean up her own stuff. She looks at the machine if everythign was still alright and she nods. She just.. hopes this turns out all well.. And if not? Oh well. He has to keep up the writing on notes. Atleast he didn't die. Which is a good sign. * - Sun Nov  8 01:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at Erin after all the cleaning, smiling softly. She nods a time. ''Thanks. You did well. I only wonder how this is going to pack out... But atleast... We tried.'' She says as she starts to undo him from the IV and the machines.. Only to lift him in her arms and then walking back, motioning to Erin to follow. ''You deserved to rest for now.'' She says as she takes the guy updtair again, placing him on the couch. He could rest there. She was way to lazy to keep him on a better place. She moves her hand in her doctors cloak she was still wearing, pricking a needle in his arm and taking the blood from him. Simply to take some of his precious genes. She doesn't know what will be inside of it.. But it will do. She takes two needles even. Because why not... After that done she walks back to the basement, letting the computer register her stuff. * - Sun Nov  8 01:31:18 2015

And his mind on him crawling away, slowly... * - Sun Nov  8 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) motions for Fujitora to prossibluy hurt the living shit out of him before he gets out of the basement.. It was obviously Zenaki was pissed on him. For whatsoever reason. And having Zenaki pissed? Was not a good idea.* - Sun Nov  8 04:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) slowly walks closer to the man, moving her hands from her back, having visible bright blue hue around her palms.
''Afterlife subject? Where would I use you for?'' She asks as she simply walks forwards, staring at him. The evil aura of Zenaki suddenly burst out around her, her eyes narrowing.* - Sun Nov  8 04:27:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at the guy in front of her. Not saying anything. She let her blue chakra scalpels fade.
''I promise. You won't die. Are you scared or something?''* - Sun Nov  8 04:44:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at the note book before crouching down again in front of him. ''I let you go if you spit out the balls in your mouth.'' Zenaki seemed to have calmed down. * - Sun Nov  8 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time. ''Keep them in your mouth. I will bring you outside.'' She says, sternly. She then moves over to left the boy.. And if allowed to she unlocks the door, walks with him towards the maindoor and unlocks that one aswell. She doesnt open it just yet and places him down. '' Spit them out.'' * - Sun Nov  8 04:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him, staring. She had noticed how many he did put in his mouth.'' All..''* - Sun Nov  8 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head, she walks a bit closer. A smile on her face. ''I first want a hug. I want you to stay safe..'' She says with a smile as she moves her arms open for a hug. * - Sun Nov  8 04:58:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) lowers her hands again, shrugging. She simply stood there. ''Master.. Can you come here..Please~''* - Sun Nov  8 05:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) notes that the door wasn't open. It was unlocked. Not opened up. * - Sun Nov  8 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) as he moves his attention away from her her hair snaps forwards as he opened up the door, wrapping her hair around his troath. The girl would immidiatly notice the poison and hold her breath.* - Sun Nov  8 05:05:29 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at the guy.. With his kind of paralyzed body. Her hand moved under her overzised shirt, taking a knife from her pantie and place it on the neck of the boy as he was frozen in place. ''You shouldn't pee... And mark.... My bed....'' She says before piercing her dagger in his troath, making a twisting motion and cutting out his adams apple thing. In exacly the wame way.. She had killed... Berith... She had explained it to Fujitora how she did that earlier. 
''Sadly I can't wat you with the poison.. But we'll fix that.'' She says before pupping out the adams apple and letting it land on her free hand. 

This all if everything went accoordingly, ofcourse. * - Sun Nov  8 05:18:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares as Fujitora wraps in the body. Obviously. She would look at it later when it was no longer dangerous. But she obviously cant take his stuff no more because admins killed him before she could get her rp done :( * - Sun Nov  8 05:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would also motion to fujitora to open up the door. She needs a deep breath! And ofcourse open up everything to let the poison gass from her house.* - Sun Nov  8 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks out, out there, taking a deep breath. * - Sun Nov  8 05:32:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks inside of her house again, keeping the door open and opening all windows. There needs to be fresh air here. * - Sun Nov  8 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: I'm gonna um... work on getting you a.. fresh bed.. somehow.. - Sun Nov  8 05:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Hiya. - Sun Nov  8 16:04:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) glances up as she hears paine. She pushes herself up from the bench and walks over.* - Sun Nov  8 16:08:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) smiles softly to the girl, nodding once. ''Good to see you, Paine.'' 
Zenaki herself was dressed in only an oversized shirt.. And once again blood on it and her arms and legs covered with blood. Looks like she had a lot going on at home with the attire she wears normally by now. Her growing belly poking visibly under her shirt. Fuji and her were now five and a half months pregnant.. Zenaki had a pale skin aswell.. Paler than she walready was, and big bags under her eyes. Looks like she didn't sleep that well. * - Sun Nov  8 16:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Damn, hocus pocus XD - Sun Nov  8 16:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) allows the female to place her hand on her belly. It looks like Zenaki didn't even have a normal belly for someone being five and half months pregnant. It was bigger than that. A sot smile on her face, nodding slowly. 

''Just.. Really really tired. Have a lot to do and then having this aswell and not able to sleep makes me exhausted.'' She explains as she looks over at her old friend. * - Sun Nov  8 16:26:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dissida, Paine(TheSecretary) says: u-umm...does it d-disturb you when you t-try? - Sun Nov  8 16:29:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Oh yea... Kinda. I can't really lay down on my belly like I want to. Plus it's.. Just in the way.. Plus some other events around like surgery's I have to do and such. Makes me exhausted. - Sun Nov  8 16:34:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head in response. '' It's not needed.. I'll be completely fine.'' 
Another smile was given to the girl before her eyes wander off to glance at the once present. Her right bloodied hand moves up to rub through her hair and scratch the back of her head. Zenaki really did look like a mess.
Her eyes wander back to her friend, offering her another soft smile. ''Don't worry alright? Master takes great care of me..''* - Sun Nov  8 16:48:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Paine, shaking her head slowly. ''Not yet.. But he  will be around soon..'' She says before she sits down on the ground, crossing her legs and placing her hands on her ancles after. Her eyes closed. ''Perhaps I should.. Yet a in the life of a medic, there is almost no rest.''* - Sun Nov  8 17:11:40 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Just.. Get the fuck out..  - Fri Nov 13 00:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) gets pulled along, walking along on her knees and hands. ''Hnnngg...'' 

The hair of Zenaki wrap up around Hanae's arm, towards her neck. '' L-Let go of me already!''* - Fri Nov 13 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) releases her jutsu immidiatly. She doesn't want her hair to be cut. Hell no. She squints at Hanae before moving her hands in a quick amount of handseals..

If she was able to perform them she would form a blue hue around her hands, like sharp blades. * - Fri Nov 13 00:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: J-Just get the fuck out.  - Fri Nov 13 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) finishes the last handseals just in time before she hits the hard ground in the shower. She grunts as now the blue froms around her hands. 
She pushes herself up slowly, winching in pain as she feels the kids being awake again and starting to kick her. * - Fri Nov 13 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: So. - Fri Nov 13 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her leg to the side, the kunai scratching along her skin. It made her winch. 
''O-Oi watch out with that!'' She yells out at her right beforethe syrup was send her way. It made Zenaki move her body to the side, not to get copletely trapped in the syrup. But one of her feet was. * - Fri Nov 13 00:34:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) keeps her glare on Hanae. She shakes her head. 
''Hell no. Are you to scared to come closer right now?'' She asks as she keeps the chakra around her hands. She tries to pull her leg back from the syrup in the meantime. * - Fri Nov 13 00:45:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Don't bother - Fri Nov 13 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) movs her other leg upwards, not getting cought in the syrup. Hell now. She keeps her glare on Hanae.. She.. Wasn't going to give up. Her both hands moved forwards with the chakra surrounding it. No. She wasn't going to give up at all. Even in this akward position and this giant pain in her tummy. Hell.. It hurts like hell.. * - Fri Nov 13 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Tisk. - Fri Nov 13 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Just give in. - Fri Nov 13 01:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as more shurken are thrown her way! And since she couldn't move.. She was hit in her legs.. Her other leg moved and was placed down in the sryup, lowering her body slightly in pain. 
''B-Bitch...'' She says as she keeps her eyes locked on her. * - Fri Nov 13 01:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: _laughs- - Fri Nov 13 01:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes even more wide, moving her both hands forwards and benc=ding through her knees. The shuriken hititng in her palms.. and in her arms and chest area. She yells out in pain as she feels the shuriken pierce into her skin. * - Fri Nov 13 01:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Tisk. - Fri Nov 13 01:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: You still focus on that jutsu of yours. - Fri Nov 13 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Must be rather taxing on your chakra. - Fri Nov 13 01:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mmmhh...  - Fri Nov 13 01:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: So how much longer can you keep it going before you are all out of energy? - Fri Nov 13 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Prehaps I should just wait untill that time. - Fri Nov 13 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: *laughs* - Fri Nov 13 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: YOU MAKE IT ALL TO EASY ZENAKI! - Fri Nov 13 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Y-You're horrible.. J-Just get away from me already..  - Fri Nov 13 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as more shuriken are coming her way, only to dig into her arms. 

''S-Stop! Beth!''* - Fri Nov 13 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Then allow me to have my fun wtih your bodies fruit. - Fri Nov 13 01:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Oh please. - Fri Nov 13 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: Those wounds are nothing to you. - Fri Nov 13 01:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stretches her arms forwards, slightly... But the chakra was slowly fading from her hands, a soft pant escapes her lips. She was starting to get low on chakra. 

''I'm... Pregnant... Isn't that enough reason?'' Her eyes set on her as she keeps her arms up.. It was hard.. Thanks to the blood runing from the wounds.. And her chakra getting low. And then at the same time being fucking exhausted of the pregnancy. * - Fri Nov 13 02:04:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: It's kind of hot to be honest. - Fri Nov 13 02:05:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) says: It's not really my style but..yeah. - Fri Nov 13 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) slowly lowers her hands.. As she was getting really exhausted. She was panting softly as she keeps her eyes locked on Hanae. Litteraly another sister of the devil.. Just like Zenaki herself was. * - Fri Nov 13 02:10:08 2015
