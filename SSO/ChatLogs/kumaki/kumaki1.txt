<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) follows the boy with her eyes for a moment before looking at Kilm and Zetsumo again. Zenaki indeed wasn't feeling like the best. But that was alright, for now.* - Mon Aug 31 10:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a notepad, writing things down. She was going to keep up the points.* - Mon Aug 31 12:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves up her hand, ordering a bottle of sake and a small glass for herself. As soon as it is brought she takes the sake thats poured into the glass already and brings it to her lips, taking a sip from it while the big guys and girl were doing a contest. Zenaki remains strangely calm.* - Mon Aug 31 12:37:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the states of their well beings. Yep, they were getting into it. She smiles softly as she takes a simple other si p of her sake. For now she only hopes they aren't way to perverted when drunk.* - Mon Aug 31 13:01:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes another sip from her sake. By now. The sake bottle was aswell emptying in front of her. She liked sake more then beer after all. She calmly looks over at everyone with her red eyes. * - Mon Aug 31 13:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes her glass again after it's filled befoe drinking the sake from it. She still stays really calm while looking at the others. * - Mon Aug 31 13:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) laughs softly. As she scribbles down. She was going to note down things what might be funny later on. I mean. It would be stupid to not note those embarassing things down, right?* - Mon Aug 31 13:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves over her bottle. Not that there was much left in here. * - Mon Aug 31 13:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Kilm, noticing the change in his eye for now. She was already facing him because he needed to hand Zetsumo the money.. She moves to stand up and squints her eyes as she looks at him. She moves to stand down next to him. She takes his hands and pulls him upwards, walking towards the other side of the room to whisper with him if she even was allowed. Zenaki herself was also a little bit tipsy. Because of the Sake. But. She could still clearly think and such. * - Mon Aug 31 13:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: What's that with your eye?  - Mon Aug 31 13:39:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: I see... He will be you? Uhm. Can you still talk like the real you still. Like. What does this 'person' want? - Mon Aug 31 13:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: He talk for me. He think for me. He is me. He more rational,serious. - Mon Aug 31 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: If he is bad. You know it can end bad right? - Mon Aug 31 13:44:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: He knows his place though. I am getting less drunk but it won't change the fact that he is going to take my personality and shove it deep inside my mind. He will most likely stay under Zetsumo's rule since he knows he'll die if he doesn't listen to him. - Mon Aug 31 13:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time, whispering once more. Meanwhile she was thinking hard of what to do.* - Mon Aug 31 13:47:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: You are already getting less drunk. Hm. I will find a way to get it away okay? Somehow it must be possible.  - Mon Aug 31 13:47:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises a brow and simply takes a small step back as he's puking. She sighs a time as he had simply changed now. How was she going to tell Zetsumo about this. She nods a time in his question. ''I'll go with you, if you don't mind.'' She responds to him, smiling softly. She needs to know more about this person. It looked like Kilm. But he was different. She looks back at the drunk couple at the table, sighing softly. She can leave those alone for now. 

''Don't kill eachother.''* - Mon Aug 31 13:55:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time to Katsune. She moves to sit over at the side of Kilm. 

''Zetsu, don't let her hang upside to down to long. Her blood will flow towards her head and it can explode that way.'' She says clamly before taking the bottle of Sake in her hands, drinking the last bit of it straight out of the bottle.* - Mon Aug 31 14:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves over to gather all the ugs of beer. Empty mugs. There were like 25 in total. A little less perhaps. She moves it all over on a plate as a waiter comes to pick up everything. She moves her hand over with the empty sake bottle aswell. 

As the waitier walks away she moveks her eyes over to look at Kitora. She moves her hand up and wave once at her before glancing back at the drunk duo.444
''You both should now drink a glass of water. That will help.''* - Mon Aug 31 14:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) is -not- drunk.* - Mon Aug 31 14:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Katsune for a moment before looking at Kilm. ''This new you. Do you still have the same name and all?'' She asks as she simply raises a brow before looking at Katsune. She moves her hand up for some water and as she gets it she walks over at Katsune. She hands her some water. ''Drink it. It will be good for your body. Go take a rest afterwards. After that come to me for your headache.'' She calmly says as she hands over the water.* - Mon Aug 31 14:47:40 2015

Kilm says: Of course, I'm still named Kilm.* - Mon Aug 31 14:48:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time to him in response before moving out of the way for Katsune. ''Don't fall. I don't wanna heal.'' She simply says as Kasune moved out of exit. She then moves to lean over with her rear against the table, twisting her body over at the new Kilm. 

''Then what is the difference?''* - Mon Aug 31 14:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time to him before walking over to sit next to Kitora if she was allowed. She moves her right elbow n the table, leaning with her head against her right hand afterwards.

''And.. How are you feeling Kitora?''* - Mon Aug 31 14:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) smiles softly at her, simply waiting for a response. Zenaki was not really drunk at all. She only was slightly tipsy. But still all herself. Nothing more, nothing less. All calm as usual. ''Mmm?''* - Mon Aug 31 14:59:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) frowns a bit at this response. She looks over at Kilm for a moment. ''Hm?''* - Mon Aug 31 15:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) simply stares back. Because he wants to apparently. Her deep red eyes were simply calm. She had nothing to hide if he was trying to search for that. After a moment she moves her gaze down at her notepad and brigning it down into her bag. Her large back rather everything in it what a medic needed.* - Mon Aug 31 15:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves up her head, scratching the back of her head a bit. 

''Mmm. Yea. I am just a medic because I can't do much else. I hate it. To be it. Everyone knows it. But I am the most skilled one around. I can't really fight and such because of my sickness. But it is all fine now. It is only rare now that I'm sick. It used to be much worse.''* - Mon Aug 31 15:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Kilm says: Have you found permament ways to strength people?
Zenaki says: Not yet. 
Zenaki says: But I need to have people later on when I start with those kind of experiments. Those most likely will be operations. And they might end up with the dead.* - Mon Aug 31 15:53:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinds sits down.* - Mon Aug 31 17:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time.

''Alright.''* - Mon Aug 31 17:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises a brow for a moment to look at the confused girl. She observes her from the distance calmly before she sets her lifeless and boring gaze. SHe observes her hands on the katana's for a small moment before moving her crimson red eyes back onto the girl her eyes. She stays calm and doesn't really do anything.

''Who are you? I've neverseen you before?'' Her left hand moves into her pocket as she waits for a response.* - Thu Sep 03 12:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks off... In search for others. She needs to gain her trust to get her listening. Fighting was useless.* - Thu Sep 03 13:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks over to Kilm, whispering.* - Thu Sep 03 13:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Found this girl. She is not from here. - Thu Sep 03 13:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Her name is Violet.  - Thu Sep 03 13:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: What about her? Hope you're not planning to make her into another doll. - Thu Sep 03 13:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: No no. But. She is not from here, intruder, spy, whatever. Since I can't fight eventually.... We need to find Zetsu. Prison her or something. No idea.  - Thu Sep 03 13:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: You sure she's a spy? Maybe I can talk to her. - Thu Sep 03 13:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Why would she be here? - Thu Sep 03 13:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Not sure. I've got interrogation jutsu so I can interrogate her if she's willing or captured. - Thu Sep 03 13:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Aye. She must get captured anyways. So Zetsu can decide what to do. - Thu Sep 03 13:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: Thanks. And good luck. - Thu Sep 03 13:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) whispers: Mhm. - Thu Sep 03 13:33:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) yawns.

"Wonder where brother is. . " Calmly, she moves up ahead.* - Fri Sep 04 08:10:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) had arrived. 

She takes a seat on the ground, not at all seeming to mind the mud spilled out. Zenaki's gaze is glued onto her scroll. In all this time, she's yet to achieve mastery of her medical ninjutsu. Observantly, her eyes pick up the useful bits of information the pamphlets had to offer. It was information regarding the basic healing technique -- and how to improve on the art.

Calmly, the studious female moved on. Reading each of the letters.

''Healing.' Often, in effort to better save a patient, a medical staff member will employ the usage of ninjutsu. Of course, due to the spiritual nature, one can do various tasks that would otherwise be deemed impossible -- such as accelerating the rate in which one's body can heal. To do so. . . rightfully falls under the broad category of chakra referred to as 'Yang Release.' Which is, in essence physical energy, or the body's vitality. With increased bodily energy, your natural bodily functions can be done at a much quicker pace.'

The scroll begins, giving loads of juicy information to assist in the endeavor. Her eyes are opened widely in shock!. . .  Of just how boring this shit is. After minutes of reading, Zenaki wore a scowl, while looking back to the book and towards her eldest brother-- who had made it so she was required to religiously live by the booklet. After all, with no actual medic to teach her, how was the girl to progress besides reading? 

Eventually, the reading goes further, much to the medic's dismay. 'In essence, what you're doing is simply. You're guiding your own physical energy or - Yang Energy -- and siphoning it into the body's cell. The added motivation and power will enable your patient's cell to stitch back together overtime. Due to the suddenly superhuman healing, it can save someone's life. Of course. . . This all depends on a person's skill. Now I bet  youy --the reader -- wonder how one can increase skill. Y'see, unlike conventional ninjutsu, mindlessly using the technique over and over again won't heed special results. Nay, to the contrary. Instead, one must focus and accurately gain control of their chakra.'

A diagram shows briefly, the act. You see, in this depiction, it shows various medics of differing levels aiming to hone their skills. In this, the lower level medics often held issue in getting all of their chakra packed into the cells. Likewise, the energy ingrained often was short-lived. Unlike a veteran healer who could masterfully control their energy, and thus gain more bang for their buck. In addition to this, their range would greatly improve due to the experience.

This aside, Zenaki ceases her reading. 

Two seals are done, and chakra swells to her finger tips. A warm sensation comes over the immediate area, and her eyes are closed shut to help adjust and grow in tune with her flow of chakra directly. It pulsates for several minutes before at last coming to rest. 

"Hng. . "* - Fri Sep 04 09:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) continued to grimace admist reading this mind-numbingly boring pamphlet. "I. Hate. This!" Zenaki declared angrily. Instead of reading more like a mindless drone, her eyes shift on over to the exciting fight towards the south. Indeed, it was one that invoked a great deal of interest and refreshed her mind -- which to this point, had spent the entire morning accumilating more knowledge. And for what? Just to appease her asshole of a brother. With a grunt, the last pieces of information are read, and soonm after, the scroll is discarded.

Still observing, she simultaneously built up chakra, and seeped it upward along her forearm. It followed the sternum, and eventually flows out. Elegantly, her energy is again pulsating and giving a soothing, vibing sensation. It was a sensation that would set even the most cold-hearted soul at ease. . . .Yet for Zenaki, feeling this simply left her repulsed. How dare sadist be forced to essentially continue working with the antithesis of their very being? She wasn't one that was meant to heal. . . But one meant to harm!

Her brow fidgets, and eventually, Zenaki looks back to the action. Due to excitement, the chakra fades, disappearing into nothingess. ". . .This is more fun to watch. C'mon you two, beat each other to bloody pulps!" Declared the curvaceous medical shinobi. THere's a cute, yet sick grin being released shortly after. 

. . .If you thought Zetsumo was disturbing, well then you can see where all of the oddness is inherited from. It comes from the family.* - Fri Sep 04 11:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks inside, walking to the bookcase in the back and leaning against it, carefull not to push out anything.* - Sun Sep 06 15:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Maya and then at Zetsumo. She nods at them and takes a simple seat next to them. She stays completely quiet, though.* - Sun Sep 06 15:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves to stand up. 

''There is nothing.'' She says before following after Kitora. She'd ignore her brother if he'd say anything else to stop her.* - Sun Sep 06 16:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) kinda sits down and shakes her head. 

''Nothing special.'' She says with a soft forced smile. She was just thinking a lot lately.* - Sun Sep 06 16:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sighs softly to her own thought.* - Sun Sep 06 16:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) places her head down on the table, letting her white hair fall down along her sides on the table to cover up her face.* - Sun Sep 06 16:30:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just stays in this position. The only thing that moved were her arms who wrapped around her head on the table.* - Sun Sep 06 16:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes. She was obviously grumpy about something. And thinking about things. To many things.* - Sun Sep 06 16:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) is being caught in the jutsu fo sure. She doesn't really... feel anything from it. But. Knows something was wrong. She moves her gaze a slight bit upwards if she even could but kinda stays in the same position.* - Sun Sep 06 16:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would move to sit up and smile. Her hands placed on her lap. Though, her eyes glare at Beth. A deadly glare. 

''Nothing is wrong..'' She says through her mind. * - Sun Sep 06 16:59:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) pierces her deadly glare more upon Beth's eyes. As she stood on top of the table and moved to take her shirt she starts to blush and her eyes widden fr a small moment before glaring at Beth again. 

''I told you there is nothing fucking wrong.. I'll tell Zetsu about this..'' She thinks back into Beth's mind. She tries to struggle against her own body. * - Sun Sep 06 17:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) tries to push her arms back, but it was helpless. Zenaki wasn't a fighter so she couldn't struggle at all. Her arms moved to pull up her shirt.. And what was underneath it? Just bandages around her chest and her flat  tummy. Her back is covered with scars. SHe blushes even more. 

''Goddammit Beth. There is freaking nothing wrong! N-Now let me get out of this jutsu or whatever it is already!'' She thought back in Beth's mind.* - Sun Sep 06 17:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) tries to reisst herself from throwing the shirt away.. But it wouldn't take long before she was forced to remove it.

The employees are watching carefully.. More and more gather behind the desk. 
Zenaki now blushes just even more. She doesn't say anything out loud. But instead she thinks.

''If you even are a girl you know what is underneath it. Stop it already I'm ordering you!'' The girl yells out in her mind to Beth. SHe tries to fore her own hands away from the bandages. ''There is nothing wrong! Nothing!''* - Sun Sep 06 17:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes for a moment as she feels her hands being forced to her bandages. She fights back and tries to keep them away from them.. Which causes her to pull them, but not rip it off. 

''Stop it, gosh. I said there is nothing wrong!''* - Sun Sep 06 17:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would try to force her body against what Beth was going to do.. But she feels her hips starting to swing and her bandage being pulled down. SHe tries to keep her mouth closed as soon as Beth forces to open it up. But unfortunately it made her say those words.. Eventhough it was forced and half audiable. 

She glares again back towards Beth. ''Stop it already. I am who I am.. Just let me go already and stop this noncense!''

Behind the desk one guy started to throw money.. His boss slaps him on his head. It was like spongebob abd mister crabs. His money! The crab person walks over to take his money back and yells at the others to go ack to work before he sits down and starts enjoying the show.* - Sun Sep 06 17:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves to jump of the table. She walks over towards the shop ownder and makes a quick turn, simply kicking the male in the face. 

She then turns to look at Beth before picking up her stuff and pulling everything on again. 

''You bitch.. Gosh. You're even worse then Misa.''* - Sun Sep 06 18:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) fixes her bandages carefully. This needed to be done because her size is just to big that it doesn't fit in her shirt normally.
The female then takes her shirt and pulls it on again before pulling on her robe. She'd sit down again, glaring at Beth. 

''Why did you even do that.. Just to have some fun?''* - Sun Sep 06 18:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) places her head down on the table again. ''I have no crush. Do I need one?''* - Sun Sep 06 18:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response before turning her head slightly. She peers through her long white hair over at Beth. ''That's why.''* - Sun Sep 06 18:20:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares back at Beth, shruging. 

''Nothing much.. Why?''* - Sun Sep 06 18:37:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her gaze up for the moment being, shaking her head. She then places her head down on her arms. ''Only Yumiko. Said it. But you know Yumiko.''* - Sun Sep 06 18:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks curious at the white note book before pushing herself up again. She moves her arms up and stretches herself, cracking her back this way. ''Mmmm.. That's fine. What's in that note book if I may ask?'' She asks, kinda curiously. Eventhough she keeps her boring and dull gaze upon Beth. She tries not to show she's curious.* - Sun Sep 06 18:56:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks out.* - Sun Sep 06 19:05:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods in response to Zetsumo.* - Mon Sep 07 12:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks forwards, looking at Zetsumo. ''You sure you want to kill her? I might be able to use her.'' She says quickly before he does anything. It's his decision though. If he refuses. It's just a great show to watch for now. * - Mon Sep 07 12:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises from her place after she'd gotten Zetsumo's permission to take the girl. As soon as she was released Zenaki stares down at the female, grinning softly. She moves over to grab her hair and pull her up. Then, she walks to the other side of the room to simply talk with her. The female's red eyes pierce in Amai's eyes. The same kind of dark hue is emitting around Zenaki. She places the girl forcefully down on the ground before crouching down on her knees and whispering to her while her eyes pierce into Amai's own.* - Mon Sep 07 14:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: (gib me ur luv - Mon Sep 07 14:11:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) she stays quiet for the first few moments, staring. Hopefully just to only scare her with her piercing and deadly eyes. She stays quiet just a moment longer. * - Mon Sep 07 14:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: What did you do to get Zetsumo this angry? I want you to be completely.. Honest.. - Mon Sep 07 14:13:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I was with the kumogakure army, he shot me down and all I remember is him grabbing me. - Mon Sep 07 14:14:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand in her pocket, retrieving a few senbon.. But she keeps it in her hands. She stays quiet.. While she stares at her.* - Mon Sep 07 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: What purpose do I have to lie? - Mon Sep 07 14:16:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Amai(JustCallMeGromp) whispers: I'm being honest. - Mon Sep 07 14:17:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves two senbon, pinning the girl down in her hips. It was pierced in the right spot so her both legs completely paralyze. Zenaki pushes both the senbon in in a slow manner. Zenaki.. Was Zenaki after all. Then she stand up and walks over at Kilm. 

''No worries.''* - Mon Sep 07 14:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him, taking notice of his eyes. She raises a brow for a small moment... But doesn't say anything further. She stays quiet about it. She can ask later.. Or ask Zetsumo, even. 

''How are you feeling?''* - Mon Sep 07 14:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him, sghing softly. She moves her arms out, open for him to walk into a hug. She doesn;t know what had happend yet.. But she knows something is bothering the poor boy.* - Mon Sep 07 14:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) lowers her arms, looking at him. She raises her brow and stays quiet for a small moment. She then parts her lips to speak.

''What happend..?''* - Mon Sep 07 14:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath in order to keep herself calm. She then walks over at the boy and if allowed she picks him up and pulls him in a tight hug. She closes her eyes. She was not going to ask how it happend... Especially not to him. She might ask Zetsumo later on. She stays quiet and moves her left hand up to ruffle through thw boys hair. * - Mon Sep 07 15:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her head to the side, planting a soft kiss on his cheek. She wants him to calm down.. And kind of be happy. This was the only soft spot of Zenaki. Her family. She never shows it.. But Suitengu needs it right now. She moves her body slightly and starts to hum as she keeps him in a hug. She knows how hard it is to loose anyone. And now Kitora. One of her best friends. 

Zenaki closes her eyes and remains in this position for a small moment longer before couching down to place the boy on the ground. She smiles at him in a warm mother like manner. Her hand ruffled his hair once more before moving to stand up to her full height.* - Mon Sep 07 15:13:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks over at amai, piercing another two senbons in her. This time her shoulders. Now she can't use her hands to pull the senbons out of her hips. She then turns and walks out.

''Kilm...Make sure she doesn't escape.. Somehow. I am going to take a breath..'' She says as she closes her eyes and walks outside. She was serious.* - Mon Sep 07 15:22:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: I will allow you to decide her punishment. Get back to me when you've decided. - Thu Sep 10 14:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: I think, breaking all her fingers bone for bone. So she can't make handseals anymore. To do this. That will work.. - Thu Sep 10 14:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zetsumo(Meme01) whispers: Foolish. I need her to be able to use ninjutsu. - Thu Sep 10 14:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: But it would fit her punishment... Awww.... It would have been fun to hear her scream in pain... Uhm...  - Thu Sep 10 14:57:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at Beth. ''Hands up the table Beth. It's rude to have them under the table.'' She says as she keeps her gaze fixated on the girl. She was now well aware. Not that she could do much if anything was going to happen.* - Sat Sep 12 15:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Hmm? - Sat Sep 12 15:33:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm.. - Sat Sep 12 15:48:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her gaze down at the moment before moving her gaze up again.. Zenaki was somehow terrified that Beth would do anything again.. But she simply tried no to show it. * - Sat Sep 12 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: You know. - Sat Sep 12 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: This is pretty big table. - Sat Sep 12 15:50:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shifts her gaze down as she notices movements in the hands. Zenaki moves a bit to the side. But.. Yea knowing Zenaki. She isn't a combat person. She's been caught. She moves her gaze up to look at Beth, returning the same cold stare. A deadly one. * - Sat Sep 12 15:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) tries to struggle against the grip on her very own body.. But it was useless. Her deadly eyes now even more deadly shown towards Beth. She was going to kill her for sure... Or make her get punished.. Realllyy.. Badly.

''Stop it.'' She says in her mind in a firce tone as her hands slide up along her tummy towards her chest.* - Sat Sep 12 16:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath as she places her hands down again. 

''Just stop doing it... I mean... I don't like it at all..'' She says as she closes her eyes. * - Sat Sep 12 16:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as once again was taken of control of her body. She feels her hand slip down at her thigh... A giant blush creeps up her face. 

''N-No stop it already!'' The female yelled out in fierce in her mind while she laughs.. Fucking Beth.* - Sat Sep 12 16:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) squints her eyes even more at Beth now as she feels her hand move. Ofcourse she would struggle! But it was useless. 

''Stop it. Beth!'' She yelled firce out again towards Beth in her mind. She feels her finger rub softly around and the blush on her face grows even a deeper shade of red. Her head tilts a little back aswell.. Trying to struggle which was really hard for Zenaki. Why... Why did she fall for this trap.. -again..-* - Sat Sep 12 16:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would unbutton her pants... But... Really slowly.. Because Zenaki was struggling. She closes her eyes as she forces her head back again and her arm to stop moving. But after a second her hand starts moving again and slides inside of her pants. Her fingers would rub against her very own.. Her mouth opened slightly as she opens her eyes and fixes them on Beth in front of her. Her deadly eyes piercing like senbon in Beth's own. 

''Stop... Fucking... Play with.. Me..'' She thinks back towards Beth's mind. * - Sat Sep 12 16:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) gasps softly as she feels her own finger poke against her private part.. Then rub it counter clockways. Her eyes closed for a small moment before opening them again and staring towards Beth. She purses her lips together as she tries not to move her other arm.. She struggles against... But yet ofcourse.. Her hand would slip into her shirt and it would starts to rub over her breasts. The blush on her face was now like a giant one, covering her nose area aswell. 

'' S-Stop it Beth... Gosh.. Stop it already!''* - Sat Sep 12 16:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes again as her legs are forced to spread up a little bit. 

''Stop it Beth!'' She yelled out in her mind before she releases a loud gasp.. Her finger starts to rub her slit as her panties are slid to the side. 

''I am not imagining anything! I.. Just stop it already! J-Just st--.. Hnngg. S-Stop!''* - Sat Sep 12 16:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes again to pierce her eyes at Beth again. Her hand would squeeze her own breast for a moment as she feels her body move. Her fingers slowly on slides inside of her slit. It made Zenaki moan softly and move herself back. Out of own body response her lega moved a bit more open.

''B-Beth just.. Hnngg...... Please make it stop already.... J-Just stop..'' 

Beth was right, Zenaki was still a virgin.. And it was very clear to see on the responses to what she was doing to herself. * - Sat Sep 12 17:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to pant and moan softly as she feels her finger bieng rubbed around inside of herself with force. 

Then, out of nowhere.. Her finger is bieng pulled out. This made Zenaki moan once again and then pant softly. Her other hand was brough to her side while her evil hand was forced towards her mouth. Zenaki doesn't seem to struggle since her body was weakened some how. She closes her eyes once again as she is forced to suckle on her own finger... As soon as that deed was done she slowly feels the control of her own body back. She lowers her hand and places it on the table, panting . Her eyes opened up and glared at Beth as the blush was still on her face. She doesn't say anything and stays completly out of words.* - Sat Sep 12 17:21:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) glares over at Misa as she still was softly panting and a giant blush on her face. She then glares over at Beth as she moves to push herself up.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Misa and starts to blush again.. Her deadly eyes piercing towards her before turning to look at the wall. 

''Screw you both..'' She whispered as she took a deep breath to regain her breath.* - Sat Sep 12 17:32:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks away from the wall toward Beth. Yes, her face was still as red as before.. But the color was slowly on fading away. She wasn't used to all of this stuff at all.. And didn't even liked to talk about it.. She closes her eyes for a moment before take the tea in a cup in her hands. She sniffles it a time and blows on it slowly before placing it on the table wit hher hands wrapped around it. She wasn't taking a nip just yet. She first needed to calm down and think of a good punishment..* - Sat Sep 12 17:40:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her cup of tea and throws it straight at the girl in front of her. She dead glares her. * - Sat Sep 12 17:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves to sit a little bit otherwise. Her arms moved and tucked her clothing in the right place, normally dressing herself again. She closes her eyes as another blush creeps on her face again as Misa makes that comment. She doesn't respond to it, though. * - Sat Sep 12 17:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: So.. Uhm.. Why did you go with Beth anyway..? - Sat Sep 12 17:52:00 2015

''In.. Trested.. Huh...Why so..?''* - Sat Sep 12 17:58:49 2015

''Mmm..'' She says as she moves to fold her arms again. * - Sat Sep 12 18:06:30 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at her as she once again starts to blush. She looks away. 

''Well... You was the one who was.. Intrested...'' 
Yep, Zenaki was shy. She never shows this to anyone and is always hard in her words. Yet, with this stuff she was the most shy person your could probably ever find..* - Sat Sep 12 18:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I-I.. I see... - Sat Sep 12 18:19:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath and looks away again. She then places her hands on the table and her head down on top of it.* - Sat Sep 12 18:30:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: So, you didn't feel pleasure..? - Sat Sep 12 18:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shrugs. 

''I don't know okay... Never did such a thing before.''* - Sat Sep 12 18:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: So if you uh, did it again would you know? - Sat Sep 12 18:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... As if I know... - Sat Sep 12 18:36:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) hides her face inbetween her arms.. Her blush now even bigger then before. Her hair falls down on top of the table to cover any parts of he face. She clenches her fist.. But says nothing in response.* - Sat Sep 12 18:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her face slightly to look at the girl. Only her bright red eyes seem to flash through her white hair.. A small opening. She then closes her eyes again as she feels the hand connecting her shoulder.  She still, stays quiet.* - Sat Sep 12 18:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kush, Misa(Zoey-Lover) says: I shouldn't have asked... - Sat Sep 12 18:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes again to look at Misa.* - Sat Sep 12 18:45:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes again for a small moment before pushing herself up, only sligthly. She nods places her arm in abit of different position and places her head down again. She opens her eyes and looks at Misa.. Again only her eyes are revealed from behind her hair. 

''Mmm..''* - Sat Sep 12 18:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ... - Sat Sep 12 18:55:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would starts to smile softly, hidden under her white hair.

''Thank you... For caring..'' She whispers as she keeps her gaze on Misa.* - Sat Sep 12 18:57:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her right hand softly to wipe her hair from her face. Reavealing a soft smile on her features and a light blush. * - Sat Sep 12 19:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) curls the smile a bit more up before closing her eyes. Zenaki never shows her soft side.. Because she's simply not used to it. But every badass has a soft side, right?

''Really.. Thank you..''* - Sat Sep 12 19:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) pushes herself softly, swinging her head to get her hair back in place. Her hand moved upwards to fix her hair a bit more before she reaches out with her hand, pulling Misa simply into a hug.. If she was allowed to. She closes her eyes as she does so and places her head on her shoulder.* - Sat Sep 12 19:11:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) keeps the girl in a close hug. Yep.. Zenaki wasn't herself.. Or was she herself? Maybe she was just confused after all this. She doesn't know what to do.
She doesn't response in that question and just hugs her and stays quiet.. After a moment she opens her mouth to speak:

''Thank.. You..'' 
After that.. She somehow simply falls unconcious.. In the arms of Misa. Nothing was really wrong with her.. It was just that a lot had happend.. And this was just to much for her emotionally.* - Sat Sep 12 19:21:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) look at Kat, nodding once. Then her eyes foxed on Kilm for a moment before closing her eyes. Zenaki's aura around her was not the one she usually had.. It was way darker now. 

''Any of you both Seen Zetsumo.. Or Beth..'' She says in a slight angered voice. Inside her head were different things raging, mostly about some punishment. * - Mon Sep 14 10:16:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You okay now? - Mon Sep 14 10:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah. These gauntlets are a 'lot' stronger than I thought. She hit me so hard it rang throughout half the village. - Mon Sep 14 10:33:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. Honestly, I'd ask for lessons again but I doubt I'd have the energy. - Mon Sep 14 11:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Lessons hm..?  - Mon Sep 14 11:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 14 11:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: My chakra control wasn't good enough before to learn how to heal. - Mon Sep 14 11:15:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. I see.  - Mon Sep 14 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Maybe a waste of time though. Truth is, I probably wouldn't be dedicated enough to get that good at healing. - Mon Sep 14 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm, always helpfull to have sorts of knowledge hm. - Mon Sep 14 11:16:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: True, yeah. - Mon Sep 14 11:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I can teach you how to make bandages from your surroundings? Like grass and sand.. Just to temporarily stop the bleeding.  - Mon Sep 14 11:16:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: That could be useful.... - Mon Sep 14 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It sure is. - Mon Sep 14 11:17:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ushinawa(Dragonfile) thinks: . . . . Women..... - Mon Sep 14 11:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It doesn't last to long. And the one with the bandage needs to come to you ever so and so many minutes. To get your chakra in it again so it lasts again some time longer. Hm~ - Mon Sep 14 11:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: But honestly. I didn't really used it much. Just healed people.  - Mon Sep 14 11:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. I have time for lessons, if you do. - Mon Sep 14 11:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uh yea sure why not hm.. Need to wait for Zetsumo anyways. - Mon Sep 14 11:20:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks off, just towards the grassy area south of them. She moves to sit down and starts to pluck some grass from the ground.. She does this in a quick manner with her hands. 

''Ofcourse you first need some materials to use the jutsu.. Stretch our arm..'' She says calmly.. Still the dark like aura is lingering around Zenaki but she simply tries to stay calm. * - Mon Sep 14 11:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the grass in her hands before placing it around the arm of Katsune. Zenaki inserts her chakra inside of the grass as it seemingly started to stick to eachother. After she was done she moved her hand away and there was a bandage of grass.

''It's an easy one. You don't need handseals and you insert your chakra inside the grass, sand, water.. Whatever works. You then plac it around the wound and it kinda melts together with your chakra.. This way it stick together. 
This jutsu can be a matter of life and death.. And is actually one of the first things a medical shinobi is being thaught.'' She explains as she moves her hands back again. She takes some sand from the ground and holds it in her hands. She then moves her hands around the arm of Katsuna, inclusing the sand. ''I place it on your arm, insert the chakra..'' The female explains as she does so:inserting her chakra in the sand.. After a bit she moves her hand away and the sand sticks magically together and onto the skin. 

''Ofcourse.. You can imagine the wound gets dirty this way. But. You can clean it eventually after. It just stops the bleeding.'' She explains as she places her hands on her lap. * - Mon Sep 14 11:29:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) // The temporarily bandage seemd to be actual bandage.. It was pretty sturdy.

After five minutes she would see the bandage comes loose again and slowly starts to fall off.* - Mon Sep 14 11:34:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: This..... - Mon Sep 14 11:35:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. Who knows. Probably make something like clotihng or armor aswell. If you have enough chakra for it.. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Exactly. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Dunno how practical it is. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Buuut maybe I'll take the time to find out. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm.. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: After all, my gauntlet didn't come out without a scratch the other day. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You are lucky, still. - Mon Sep 14 11:39:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Very' lucky. - Mon Sep 14 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: It's a good thing she was as arrogant as I was. - Mon Sep 14 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: 'Last' time I make that mistake. - Mon Sep 14 11:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. - Mon Sep 14 11:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .. Mmm... Think about it if you want to learn it or not. - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm? - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Yeah, I'd like to learn this. - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhhmm.. - Mon Sep 14 11:44:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Righty. You need my arm to practice? - Mon Sep 14 11:45:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) thinks: Not....what I had planned when I sat down. - Mon Sep 14 11:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stretches out her arm, placing it calm on the lap of Katsune. 

''Just practice as much as you need... If you need an arm or leg or such to practice on. Will be fine aswell..'' 

<ugh.. I hate to have my body used for practice.. But I have nothing better right now..>She thinks to herself as she keeps her eyes on Katsune next to herself.* - Mon Sep 14 11:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: . . . - Mon Sep 14 12:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I think. . . - Mon Sep 14 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: I may be struggling with this as much as I was Earthen Corridor. - Mon Sep 14 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: And that took me ages. - Mon Sep 14 12:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hmm.. You are doing well already. It's a bit  tricky at first... But just keep on trying.. If you can... - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You can try it on your own leg.. Or on a tree or anything..  - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Practice if you feel like iit. - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Alright. - Mon Sep 14 12:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks towards her arm and leg. She closes her eyes for a moment before placing her free hand on top of her arm.. She slowly swipes the muddy substance of some sort from her arm. * - Mon Sep 14 12:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time. She moves her dirty hand now along the grass to wipe off everything Sh then moves both her hands up and place them behind her head. She moves to lay down and close her eyes.* - Mon Sep 14 12:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You both done? - Mon Sep 14 12:20:54 2015
