<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him, taking his hand and placing it down on her own lap. She pushes herself up, walking to the bedroom. ''If I was you Erin.. I would study the anatomy book. Very well... You are going to have a test... When I see you again..'' She says sternly before she opens the door. Nope all of this had made her feel sick as hell. Not because she didn't like it... No... She was still pregnant. * - Wed Nov  4 02:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Or detect the chakra of others? - Wed Nov  4 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Fujitora and Hanae can. - Wed Nov  4 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hanae aka Beth.  - Wed Nov  4 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Perhaps you can give this to them, see if they recognize the chakra pattern.  - Wed Nov  4 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes it in her hands, looking at it. 
''Mmm.. Intresting.'' She inspects it, looking at it. She can't sense the chakra's.. But she sure can give it to Fujitora. He must be able to do so. * - Wed Nov  4 19:56:22 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up from reading her book as she hears a loud knock. She sighs a time and pushes herself up. She closes the book an places it back on the shelf where it belongs. Her eyes wander around the house for a moment. Simply a fucking big mess. All kind of things were laying around. Around the house of Zenaki was an aura of pure evil. Something was wrong. Or perhaps good. Zenaki walks towards the door and unlocks it, opening it slightly to peek through it. She spots the tiny hanae.. 

''what do you need...?''* - Thu Nov  5 17:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Zenaki keeps her eyes locked on the tiny girl, keeping the door half closed. Why does she needs to be inside so badly.. ''I'm fine. Why do you wanna come inside. You're not needed here.'' Zenaki would of course observe the girl and notice her wedding band. Ugh. Love...* - Thu Nov  5 17:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Zenaki stares down, keeping the door slightly closed. ''you're not needed here.. ''Zenaki closes the door shut in the face of hanae after. She locks it again and moves to sit back on the couch.* - Thu Nov  5 17:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Zenaki ignores the knocking. She takes a book and starts to read again. Hanae most likely has the key herself since Zenaki didn't ask it back yet. If she wanted to come inside so badly. She could open the door herself.* - Thu Nov  5 17:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up for a small moment before looking back at her book again, reading. 
''what do you need. Get out of my house already, I'm busy enough and I don't need to see your ugly face. '' 
Zenaki her eyes move along with the sentences she was reading.. She flips the page and continues reading.* - Thu Nov  5 17:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shrugs a time as she keeps her eyes on her book.. it was about how to get rid of pregnancy.. But from this distance it was most likely not readable. 
''none of your business..''  
Zenaki responds with a cold voice. She really needs to be alone right now. Fujitora was not home so she has to do this before he comes into her home. She stands up and closes her book. She places it down in the shelf again before she slides her finger along all her books, in search for another one.* - Thu Nov  5 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shrugs her shoulders. 
''you are not needed here. There are no problems anymore between me and Fujitora. He learned his lesson and I'm done with him. He is just another fucking doll and nothing more.'' she coldly responds before turning to look at hanae as she grabs a drink.* - Thu Nov  5 17:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) |||

''I already said its none of your business.'' 
Zenaki her eyes wander off towards the door for a moment before looking back ata Hanae again. She folds her arms as she keeps her eyes locked on her. 
''does it taste okay? You're going to empty my fridge again?''* - Thu Nov  5 17:22:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time. yea yea good for you. ''Now get out of the house.. I'm busy. ''Zenaki her chakra was nothing really wrong with.'' he removed his chakra what?''* - Thu Nov  5 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sighs loudly before turning to find a book again. She takes one and saddles towards her bedroom. Once in there she would lay down on the bed on her back and start reading again.* - Thu Nov  5 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) ignores Hanae comepletely as she was reading her book. Nope. She wasn't even going to respond to the question.* - Thu Nov  5 17:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Zenaki shrugs. ''Why do you care?''  Zenaki keeps on reading her book. On the cover of the book it is something about pregnancy. Just because she was pregnant. But what was she actually reading?* - Thu Nov  5 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her book, only to look at her side at Hanae. She raises her brow for a moment as she looks over at her. She turns on her bed, placing the book to the side. She then wraps herself in the blankets like a taco.

''Just leave me be.''* - Thu Nov  5 17:24:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head. no.. ''It's none of your business. Go bother someone else.'' Zenaki closes her eyes and turns on her belly. On her pregnant belly. This kid has to die.. Somehow... She wasn't going to have children from one of her dolls. Hell no.* - Thu Nov  5 17:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Zenaki turns to look at Hanae, staring at her. She pushes herself up. ''I know the truth about what Fujitora did to me. Hnnng.. Before I got sealed. '' she looks at her and then down. ''He is now just one of my dolls. Nothing more. I have to get rid of this child.. Or children.'' Zenaki pushes herself up from the bed and walks over towards the drawer. Her hand moves in it to take a knife, staring at it for a while. ''Yet. I can't hurt myself to kill these fucking children.''* - Thu Nov  5 17:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head. ''I-I don't need his fucking children inside of my whomb.'' she lifts the knife up and stares down the ground. ''I don't need his fucking children!'' She yells out at her before bringing the knife down with fulls speed. Aiming towards her belly. Yet.. Just at the end she moves the knife to the side... Cutting deep through her sideand landing in the drawing behind her. She groans out in pain as her hand moves over on her side. ''G-God fucking dammit...''* - Thu Nov  5 17:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at Hanae, pushing herself up with the help of Hanae. She then moves her hand to push Hanae away from her. ''I fucking hate children. I have experimented on them in the past. They should fucking die and erase from this world.'' Zenaki zloses her eyes again, grunting in pain. Her hands move up to form a few hanseals before she places it on her bleeding side, healing it slowly.* - Thu Nov  5 17:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head. ''I-I don't want to be a mother of fucking children of FUjitora. The guy that raped the shit out of me before I became his fucking slave.'' Her eyes closed for the moment before she moves her hands away. She had healed herself completely now.* - Thu Nov  5 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) froms a quick few seals as blue hues form around her palms. She moves it forwards towards Hanae before she can even touch her. Hell no. 
''Just get fucking out of my house or do something more usefull instead of bothering me.''* - Thu Nov  5 17:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she stares at her. She shakes her head. ''If someone is going to murder these kids. It's me or Fujitora himself.'' She says in a cold voice as her eyes hlaflidden, a cold stare is given back to her as she keeps her hands up with the blue chakra around it.* - Thu Nov  5 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a step back, shaking her head. ''N-No.. You don't need to help me.. Just get the fuck out of my house already..'' Her hands moved a bit more infront of herself as she locks her eyes on her.* - Thu Nov  5 17:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) lowers her hands infront of her whomb ''J-Just get the fuck out of my house, Hanae... ''Zenaki shakes lightly, staring down at the female. She still felt her side.. It did hurt still... And this was just stressing the shit out of her.* - Thu Nov  5 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head again, keeping her gaze on the evil little kid. ''S-Stop this already! Just get the fuck out of my house! I'll get rid of them myself!'' She yells out to her sister.. Or whatever she was now.* - Thu Nov  5 17:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) squints her eyes at Beth, taking another step backwards as she keeps her hands up as some form of protection. 
''I don't need your help. Just get out.''* - Thu Nov  5 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head. 
''I am not going to promise you anything. Just get the fuck out of my house. You don't even fucking belong here!''* - Thu Nov  5 17:30:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes another quick step backwards as Hanae send the shuriken towards her body. She moved to the side and one sdid hit on her torso. One in her leg and one scratched along her arm. The two others just gone along her body. She grunts out in pain as she stakes another step backwards. But only to be send backwards and toppled over on the ground as a stream of water was send over into her chest. Oh holy fuck. 
''G-God.. Fuck... B-Beth stop it! I-I will take care of it m-myself!'' She yells out at her as she keeps her hands up, which simply plitted a part of the water to the side aswe.. * - Thu Nov  5 17:36:51 2015

She then opens her mouth to mouth a little before inhaling deeply and then exhaling out. she cracks her nuckles a little before stuffing her hands into her holster pulling out a stack of shuriken for eachhand. Each hand held five and with little to no thought to it beth tosses them out at zenaki.

"To alte now! ZENAKI I'll fucking show you wher eI belong!"She shouted.*)
(*Shinji rolled around in the basement, opening both of his eyes to the annoying noise provided by the two sisters, Shinji let out a loud yawn, at this point, he had gotten used to the disgusting smell of the basement due to the dead things that lay there along with his penis.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she sees random figures with red eyes and a creepy smile walk up to her out of nowhere. Her eyes half lidded soon after though.. Her body shaking from the pain and because she simply was fucking cold.
''Beth goddammit get out of here already!'' She yells out as the figures approach her. * - Thu Nov  5 20:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks around herself as she sees the shadows creeping closer to her. More and more are comming over towards her. She closes her eyes to keep the figures from her sight. 
''I don't need children from a rapist. It is like getting children from you.'' She opens her eyes again, staring at one of the figures that was Hanae before.* - Thu Nov  5 21:45:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would obviously feel like her body was in some sort of bind. She tries to struggle but these figures wouldn't let her. 
''I can always turn you into a real male sso you can actually rape other persons and make them pregnant. Or I can perhaps just rape you and make you pregnant. Let's see if you would like to keep those children.''

She pauses for a moment before her mouth opens to speak again. ''But you're right. Perhaps I should raise them. To become like you or me. Would you like that?'' Zenaki closes her eyes, thinking about the things she said while she was still the slave of Fujitora. Her eyes opened again, wandering off softly. She was just.. Desperate? She didn't know anymore what to do to be honest.* - Thu Nov  5 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) keeps her gaze locked on the genjutsu Hanae. 
''You know I can't promise anything.'' She says in a simply responds as she tries to move her body once again. But it was simply useless. ''But I can try.''* - Thu Nov  5 22:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would move her body again as the figures seemingly to fade away from her sight, now staring at Beth. She was rather calm somehow. But in her mind she really wanted to kill her right now.* - Thu Nov  5 22:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Hell--...ugh, HELLO. - Thu Nov  5 22:48:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) kinda pushes herself up from the couch. Only to walk over towards her basement door. She opens it up and walks down lazily. 
''Shinjiii~'' She says in a teasing voice. Knowing he would probably half rush over towards her to get his daily torture. 

''I'm going to put some needles in you again today..'' Her eyes wander over drawer, opening them and looking through the contains she has. ''Huumm...'' She takes the foxes DNA and places it down on a table. Then she takes some sort of special liquid, placing it down there aswell. She takes another empty bottle and opens it up. She takes a bit of the dessert foxes it's genes and then the liguid. She pours it together. She then closes the bottle and shakes it up a bit. 

Her eyes wander to place the other two bottles back in place. 
She then takes needles with seringes.. Three in total. For now that will do. Perhaps later she can make more. For now she takes the seringes and fills them.. Only to walk over towards him after. 
''Are you ready~?''* - Thu Nov  5 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at him for a moment. She holds the three seringes in one of her hands. Her other hand snaps out to grab his throat. She squeezes it closed as she lifts her other hand. Her thumb moved slightly to make his vein bulge up before she pushes one of the needles down in the vein. She pushes it empty in his neck.. Waiting for something perhaps to happen? 

(1 is succes 2-5 nothing 6 dead)* - Thu Nov  5 23:24:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) pulles the sering out, throwing it to the side before pushing the next inside. She watches the boy  closely as she waits for any response of the body. Her half lidded gaze set on him as he had his tongue out of his mouth.. She suddenly snaps forwards to bite on his tongue. With some rough force, causing the pink muscle to bleed!
Meanwhile she pushes the seringe epty in his neck.. She then back away again, pulling out the seringe and placin her thumb on his bleeding spot.* - Thu Nov  5 23:31:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at the boy she was holding up by his troath. His tongue was bleeding. Looks like Zenaki bit him. She presses the last sering in his neck, letting the DNA mix up with his blood. (admins not here yet. if they come here roll 3 times) . Her eyes wander of as she hears Fujitora behind her. ''Well hello my precious little doll... How are you feeling today?'' She turns to look at him while she easily just throws Shinji towards the corner of the room as if he was nothing more then a ragdoll. Which he actually was to Zenaki.* - Thu Nov  5 23:54:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: It's for the best..As this is my..Responsibility... - Fri Nov  6 00:10:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she feels the scroll wrap around her body. Her eyes wander towards Fujitora before squinting at him. With her eyes. She isn't even going to listen to him. ''What the fuck do you want from me huh. Get your scorll down before I push two of those bones in your asshole you fucking rapist.'' SHe growls out at him as his red eyes are locked on her very own red eyes. At this moment. She was already like four and a half months pregnant. She had quite a belly already. ''I dont even need your fucking kids. Beth stopped me, otherwise I would've killed them already..'' She says while he as talking. Simply inbetween it! The evil aura around Zenaki spreads open once again, staring at him. He might be able to sense that the children in her belly are kind of stressed because of Zenaki being so ruthless all the times. Plus she had something strange with her in one of her pockets. But he'll find out about that later. Her hair moves out in a swift motion, aiming to take Fujitora in a grasp before the cloth bind would wrap more up, around her neck and uptowards her face. She closes her eyes as it wraps around her body, moving her body only more to try and break free now. * - Fri Nov  6 00:17:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Inoue, Erin(Such a Yandere-chan) says: This lever system isn't exactly nice... It'd be nice if I could do rapid fire with this.. - Fri Nov  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes as she is being wrapped up in the seal.. ''Do it..Stitch up my fucking mouth..'' She says with a muffled voice and with that she let her hair fall down again.. He ofcourse touches some of her long white hair locks.. The hair falling down on the ground. Her body was shaking at this very moment as he had his hand placed on her chest area. Her clothing was wet from something that had happend before. Meanwhile the evil aura around Zenaki spreads only more before it slowly fades away. She listens to his words.. Her body no longer shaking and standing perfectly in place. He could litteraly do whatever he wants right now to her.* - Fri Nov  6 00:38:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes slowly as she hears him talk while the cloth slowly wrap away from her face.. And the rest of her body. She completely stood still in her place, saying nothing and her lips flattened. She simply stares down towards the ground, waiting for some sort of order from him. * - Fri Nov  6 00:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: ZENAKAI! I'M AWAKE. - Fri Nov  6 17:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: ZEENAKi. - Fri Nov  6 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up after she heard the boy calling out her name. She was reading a book in the farest corner in her house.. In the basement. There she had a chair made of limbs and bones.. And as feet pillow there was a torso of a person on the ground. No legs, no arms and no head. Just the torso. Zenaki her feet are bare and are resting on it. She nods a time to Shinji before going back into her study. 

At the moment she was wearing an oversized bloodied shirt. And nothing really more. Her panties ofcourse. Her arms and legs are bloodied like hell. Looks like she just murdered someone. But when doesn't she murder someone? Her eyes wander of towards the side, towards a few DNA stuff in the drawer who was standing open. She closes the book and places it to the side. She pushes herself up and walks over to the drawers. She closes them after.

Zenaki walks over towards other drawers and opens them up, bending over to look inside of it. ''Mmm...'' She takes a few bottles and places everything down on the table.. She then takes a needle with a rather large empty seringe. She waddles over towards the poor boy wherever he was. She takes his arm and pulls him around, flipping over her leg to push the guy on the ground. She keeps him in place with her feet before bending over. He most likely can now watch under Zenaki her oversized shirt. Yet she didn't care at all.

Zenaki takes a hold of this guy his balls.. Since there is no dick anymore she doesn't need to push this thing to the side. She looks at the seringe with needle, then to his balls. Better idea. She throws the seringe and needle to the side before she moves her hand to the side of her panty, withdrawing a dagger. Yes. She has a dagger. The evil aura of Zenaki surrounds out of nowhere and spreads through the house. Her eyes set on his balls.

Her knife slowly made it's way over towards his balls. Sh then snaps it forwards, cutting right through them on the side. She starts to pull the sack so Zenaki was going to simply saw of his ballsack including the balls. She needs those for Hanae after all. Her eyes set on the blood as it litteraly splashed everywhere. He liked pain? He gets pain. As the balls are being chopped Zenaki places them to the side on a small table. Ofcourse he must be bleeding like hell. 

Zenaki places the dagger in his arm. ''Hold it.'' She says before moving her hands in a few quick handseals, placing them on his place where his private used to be. The bleeding stops immidiatly.. Her eyes set on it as she starts to heal the place. Just to stop him from bleeding. We don't want him to die right? ''Enjoy yourself with the knife.'' She says as she removes her hands away after some time. She then takes the used to be Shinji's balls and walks back towards the table. She places it down on there and looks around to the other stuff she had gathered.* - Fri Nov  6 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) laughs softly as she hears him scream and yell out to her. This made her work even more. His screaming and yelling filled her soul as if it was food. The five months pregnant female sits down at the table and takes the stuff she needs. Sheplaces evrything down firmly and in place before she starts her work. She takes the balls she just cut them apart from the other part she needs; the testicles. In there the most testesteron was produced. She rips it open and takes all the juices of it, blood and other stuff. In there was the dna. 

With that she walks over towards another room, placing it in a special machine to split the dna from the blood and juices. She closes her eyes for a small moment, her hand moving down to rub over her belly. She smiles softly before hearing a sort of ping. She then takes the both bottles and walks back again. Humm...

Her eyes are set on the stuff in front of her. She takes a bowl and places it on the table aong with her new bottle. She then takes a seringe, without needle this time. She places them in a bottle and sucks some of the juice from there. She places it in the bowl. She cleans the sering and then does the same thing to another bottle. This ways she measures perfectly what she needs and she places it all down in the bowl, one by one, cleaning and over again. She then takes the hormones testesteron from the last bottle and places it in the mixture aswell. 

Zenaki takes a spoon and mixes it up gently before cleaning the spoon again. With the spoon cleaned she stands up and walks over towards the drawer. She searched in it for a small moment before taking out some sort of blue greyish powder. She walks back and sits down. Her eyes set on the powder.. She scoops up some and places it in the bowl, a total of three times before she starts to mix it up again. With that done she takes the bowl in hands and walks over towards the giant freezer. She opens it up and places the bowl inside of it. 

Zenaki walks back and takes the bottles, knifes, seringes and spoons she used and starts to clean up everything, placing everything back in place again. She then simply walks over towards Shinji, staring down at him as he sits in the corner. ''You scared? You are to be released soon..''* - Fri Nov  6 21:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Fuck you. - Fri Nov  6 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You want to die? - Fri Nov  6 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: You bitch, you took away my manhood. - Fri Nov  6 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: So? - Fri Nov  6 21:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Fuck you. - Fri Nov  6 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her feet up, kicking tohe boy straight in his face before she turns around and walks up the stairs. She slams the door shut of her basement and walks towards the door where she hears knocking. 
She places her hand on the door, unlocking and opening it after she stares forwards.

Zenaki was wearing only a giant oversized shirt and panty's. Her 5 month old pregnant belly was visible ofcourse. Her legs and arms covered in blood, aswell as her clothing. The drip blood was still dripping of her hands to be honest. And from the basement towards the door were footrpints left behind from her bloody feet.

''Hm?''* - Fri Nov  6 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at the guy.. Just quietly listening to him. Zenaki had an aura around her of puer evil. Nothing peacefull.. People who were around her would litteraly feel like they could shit their pants any moment soon. She moves to step to the side, allowing this guy inside of her house. If he would come inside she closes the door and locks it again. 
''What is it you need?''* - Fri Nov  6 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises a brow as she stares down at his stomach. She then nods a time. ''Don't get scared.'' She simply says before she walks off towards the basement door. She opens it up... It was freezing cold down there.. limbs, bodies, organs, blood, bones and whatever else spread across the room.. She walks over towards another door and opens it up, walking through it so she leads him into a long undergroand hall way with a lot of doors. She closes the door behind her before she walks over towards one of the rooms, opening it. It was a perfect clean operation room. * - Fri Nov  6 22:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: A9lmost done - Fri Nov  6 22:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) let this guy lay down on the bed. Zenaki closes her eyes for a moment, focussing herself on the surgery. She just chopped of someone's balls and now she has to do a surgery. Her eyes opened and wandered of for a moment. She takes a long white coat, wrapping it around herself. She then takes a facemask and surgical gloves. She puts those on as well. Then she walks over, taking his hand and retrieving a needle from one of the drawers. She places the needle inside of it and connects it with the IV stand. She then connects him to different machines. 

She walks towards the drawer, taking out a white kind of liquid and she walks back again. With that she places it in the iv and let the guy got to sleep. '' One two three four…'' She starts to count. He would most likely pass out at the number six or seven. Miya continues to count until sixty while she prepares the surgery stuff. Taking a needle, a knife, thread and a clamp. With that she walks back again as she finally had the sixty. 

Her hands placed the tools to the side before she takes his shirt, lifting it up so she can actually have better access to the wound. She takes the clamp and places it on the wound.. It was not a normal clamp.. A normal one would close the wound. This one would hold it open so Zenaki can actually get access to the stomach area. She takes a disinfectant and starts to disinfect the area.. With that done she checks more if any other injuries were there.. She smiles softly as she was working. She was used to stuff. 

Her hands moved over to take the needle and dread before she starts to stitch up the massive large stab wound. Of course Zenaki is very careful as she does so. With surgery's she's always careful… With that part done she places the needle and dread to the side, lifting up her hands for a few seals.. She heals the stitched up wound a slight bit.. She speeds up the healing progression this way. And it's now simply closed for ripping out again. The stitches are special stitches who will be broken down by the body itself.

Zenaki then takes the needle and dread again, starting to sew up the next wound on his stomach.. Seven stitches are used in a total. Zenaki places the needle and dread to the side to make once again those hand signs.. With that she focusses on her chakra, healing up the guy again at the stomach area. Zenaki was careful all the time, making sure she didn't miss anything or mess it up. 

After that done she walks over to clean up everything while she waits for the guy to wake up. She undresses herself from the surgical clothing and then cleans up everything.. So that everything is neatly left behind. She takes away his IV and disconnects him from the machines. She cleans it so it is neatly left behind. .With that she walks over to the male, placing his shirt back in place. He doesn't need bandage. Just be carefull. He most likely was with a broken leg after all. She moves to lift him up in her arms before walking back towards the living room. There she places him down on the couch so he can rest. Meanwhile she sits down on a chair, waiting for him to wake up. * - Fri Nov  6 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) doesn't seem to care about his leg. She thought it was broken and he didn't mention it. If he wanted it to be healed. He should ask for it.

-If- Beth were to walk inside. She would find them. And Zenaki wearing only a giant oversized shirt and her pantyes. These covered in blood. Her legs and arms also covered in blood. And on the ground are several footsteps with blood. Zenaki's own footsteps. 

''Slept well?'' She says as she looks over at the guy, waiting for some sort of response.* - Fri Nov  6 23:03:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response before she pushes herself up. She walks over towards the drawer as she hears Hanae walk inside. 
''Hey.. Hanae..'' She says softly as she takes some sort of saw. With that she walks back to the guy and simply start to saw away the cast. She takes it away and throws it in the corner, saw aswell. 
''Stay in the position.'' She says as she moves her hands up in a few seals, a green aura around her palms. She places it forth as his leg starts to heal softly. If he wants to he can lean against her so he doesn't fall over as she heals him up. 
After some time she finally healed up his leg. And it should be almost as good as new. ''Be carefull with training and such. I don't want to see you back with ripped open shit which I just healed.''* - Fri Nov  6 23:22:01 2015

Her arms and legs, aswell as her shirt was covered in blood. As normal for some people. Her eyes are set on a book which she was readin. It lays down on her crossed legs. * - Sat Nov  7 11:40:09 2015

''But I already read all of my books over ten times. And I have over fivehundred books.'' She sighs softly before looking down at her bloodied legs.
