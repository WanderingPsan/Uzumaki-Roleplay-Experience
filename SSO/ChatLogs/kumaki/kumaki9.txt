<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at her master as she was baing brought down the basement. She glances around for a small moment before loking back again at her master. She listens to him and never let her eyes fade off him. She takes obvious notice of the whip and takes a small step backwards. ''I-I.. I am sorry.. Master..'' She says in her dull and robot like voice.* - Sun Sep 27 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) grunts as she feels the whip clench against her back. 
'' I-I am Sss---H-Hnnngg..'' Once again the whip slaps against her back.  She leans back against the table, looking at her master. 
At that moment a surging series of seals was send through her body. She clenche her fist onto the table but her body moves thanks to the electricity.
''N-NNnng!!'' She tries not to scream out in pain as her body starts to make random movements. With that being done she parts her lips and pants slightly through it.
''I-I... I will not leave you M-Master...'' She responds to him before he starts to talk again. She nods in a response to him. ''H-Help you..'' 
Zenaki opens her eyes as she is being pulled closer towards her master. Her dull lifeless gaze staring into his own. She nods slowly in response of understanding before she is being tossed to the side, slamming against the wall and sliging down along it. She grunts in pain  before another whip was delivered against her back. She yelps out in pain, curling into a small ball. ''I-I am sorry, Master..'' She whispers in pain.* - Sun Sep 27 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) was being helped up again, nodding slowly in response to him.. ''C-Can I please.. Come along.. Master..'' She asks with a slight shaky, yet robotic tone.* - Sun Sep 27 21:45:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time as she leads the way off. Towards the waterfall. That place will work.* - Mon Sep 28 08:43:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) ods a time in response to her master before she takes a dagger and makes a cut in her own leg. She winches as she did so.. But this was the only way to explain it to him. She moves both her hands upwards. She starts to weave through a few handseals, carefully so her master could keep up with the handseals performed. 
''You make the handsigns needed and and then send your chakra on the top of your palms. Your palms you will place on top of the wound. With that you focus on the chakra and you place your chakra on said wound. You send the chakra into the wound and this will place all the cells of the skin back together. You need to focus on your chakra to make sure you do not spill to much chakra in the wound.. Or to less.'' 
She explains as she places the hands on the wound she just made on her leg. It did hurt.. She focusses her chakra and the wound starts to heal under her palms. She keeps a tiny space inbetween it so her master can see the healing process of the wound.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly. She takes her Kenryoku cloak off and her shirt. She reveals her back at him, with bandage wrapped around her chest area. For more comfort of her breasts. On her back the most wounds were healed. There were a lot of scars. That had been healed. All over her back. The scars seemed to be fresh still, yet they were not made by Fujitora. Zenaki closes her eyes. She doesn't know if there was a cut or something left. It didn't look like it though. Some red spots with blood underneath the skin.. From the whips. But nothing more really.* - Mon Sep 28 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Closes her eyes as he was starting to practice on her back. Eventhough there was not much of wounds there. I most likely had to create them himself. She ofcourse allows to do such if he wishes to.
''Brother.. I ruined up a surgery.. Where I took out his eye to replace it but I ruined it… I got.. Punishment thanks to that.. But I deserved it.'' She says as she keeps her eyes closed, readying herself for anything that had to come. 
* - Mon Sep 28 10:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Opens her eyes as soon as she is hugged from behind. Her dull lifeless gaze moves to the side and was set on her master. She nods a time in response. ''I really did.. I wasn't carefull enough, did cut a nerve. He could never see again with that eye, blinded.'' She says as she closes her eyes aain and allows him to heal her up. After that was done she hears him saying sorry. She opens her eye slightly. ''Sorry…?'' She asks in her robot like voice before shaking her head. ''Not eaten yet.''* - Mon Sep 28 10:23:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sighs softly befoes she sits down. Her hand moved inside of her pockets, taking out a random arm. Yes. A human arm.  It was slightly bloodied still.. All dried though. Zenaki moves through a few handseals and forms chakra around her hands. Blue chakra. She closes her eyes as she concentrates on it and tries to make some sort of blades of the chakra on her hands. She takes a deep breath as she places her hands down on the arm. She aims to cut it. But.. Nothing happend.

She takes another deep breath as she releases the jutsu before tryin again. Her hands moved through a few handseals before a blue chakra forms around it. She once again tries to from the blue chakra in some sort of blades. Which worked this time. She aims to cut through the arm with the jutsu. A finger of the arm moved. She did probably cut something. Something like a tiny muscle? Who knows. She groans as she releases the jutsu once again, inspecting the arm after. ''Mmm..''* - Thu Oct  1 20:57:48 2015

She has to work.With this man? he sounded so... Stupid. Her gaze moves back at Fujitora for a moment, Why... Why did she had to pair up with him. Her gaze returns back on Bryson. Her lips parted to respond. 
''You sound stupid.. To be honest. Saved from what and what Sins?'' She says in her robot like voice as she raises a brow.* - Fri Oct  2 07:30:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at the hand for a moment for the shake before she sets her gaze back on the christian in front of herself. She doesn't shake his hand. But does respond.
''The name is Zenaki, medic.. Sister of Zetsumo...'' She responds to him before moving up her hands and folding them over eachother. Her gaze was deadly, as always. Her gaze moved back onto her master again before moving it back in front of herself, at the medic. * - Fri Oct  2 07:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to laugh softly. The Lord had him? Heh.
She turns her gaze at the ground. ''Yea yea. I bet he would have been pulled down t hell.'' She responds to him, a small smirk curls on her face. ''And so will I be hm. I wonder. Where do you specialize in with the medical stuff. Healing people up?'' She asks with her robot like voice. She was still behaving herself slightly. She didn't want her master to be angry at her..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda plops down on the ground. She takes a deep breath and then sighs again. Her eyes closed as she starts to rhink of different things. Different things that were happening. And about her past. She had nothing better to do anyways. Her hands moved inside of her bag to take out a human arm. Yes. A human arm. She places it down on her lap and takes a dagger. All blindly. She cuts open the arm to make a deep gash inside of it.

After that she places the knife away, next to her on the ground to be more exact. Her eyes opened up to look at the bleeding arm. Her both hands moved up as she moves through a few handseals. After that, she lowers her hands and just kinda starts to heal the arm up. she had not much better to do right now. 

Her eyes wander to the fish on the ground, then towards the statue before setting her gaze on the boy in front of her. She doesn't speak and just observes him. Was he another one of Masters army? She doesn't know.

Her eyes wander back on the arm as it now was fully healed once again. She takes a deep breath to recatch her chakra. She needed to work on that aswell.. Before she exhausts and faints or something like that thanks to her chakra loss. Oh well... * - Fri Oct  2 12:18:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath, once again. She was just.. Gonna.. Practice again probably? She takesa deep breath and moves her hands through a few handseals again before a blue chakra erupted around her hands. The chakra she moves into a sharp blade like. She inspects her hands with her eyes before placing it down on the arm on her lap. She'll cut right through the arm. A few fingers move thanks to it. But. Nothing was able to be seen from the outside. On the inside the muscles would have been sliced in two. * - Fri Oct  2 13:02:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath. She looks over at her side as the christian walks over. She shakes her head before walking off, on towards the prisons. Once there she would simply walks over at three of the prisonners.. Bandits. Who were already about to be excecuted. She pins senbon in their body to disable their movement before she grabd them by their feet and dragging them with her over the ground.. Through the sand and the stone on towards the hospital. Once there? 

We'll see next rp.* - Fri Oct  2 16:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Freeee...Free Fallin - Fri Oct  2 16:39:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head in response while she places one of the man down on the the operation table. ''It's fine.'' The man stared at Zenaki and would yell at her, curse at her and such. She doesn't give a fuck about him and takes her dagger. The still alive bandit would be pierced by the dagger and cut open from the chest down to under his abdomen. The male would yell out in pain and try to move. But he was paralyzed. He couldn't move. He starts to bleed and such while still screaming. A painfull and slow death.

''Go check on him. Do not heal him but use him as a doll to get to know more about the anatomy. How everything works and all. It can get pretty bloody. Inspect everything in his body. And don't you dare to heal him up. Squeeze any organs to see what will happen and the durability of them.''* - Fri Oct  2 16:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes one of the remaining bandits and places him down on a chair, binding him so he could sit straight up. ''Oh. I love to let them suffer. The screaming ives me a tingling sensation you know. It's like music to my ears.'' She blankly responds in her robot like voice while she crouches down in front of the bandit on the chair. She smiles at him softly. She turns and walks over at the DNA stuff in the drawer. She takes some of the DNA and places it down in a bottle. What kind of DNA was this? 

She looks at the DNA stuff and smiles softly. Dogs. Perfect. She takes another bottle and stirs up the DNA with the bottles liguid. She then takes a needle and takes some of the liguid from the bottle. She'd walk back at the bandit and places her hand on his head. She pushes it forcefully to the side while placing the needle in his neck. She presses the liguid inside of his neck, letting everything flow through his body. 

Meanwhile her gaze moves back on the christian as she waits for it maybe to have some effect on his body.''You're doing well. This way I found out everything about the human body. Don't check only the organs and bones you do know. But check the things out you -don't- know.'' She explains before she turns her gaze back at the bandit. His tongue was now hanging dwon from his mouth and he was crying like a dog would. A puooy dog, rather. He was sad and tried to break free. Poor puppy.* - Fri Oct  2 17:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side again, her deadly eyes set on Bryson. ''Because there were no female bandits ready to be executed. Only males.'' She'd say in response with her dull and robot like voice. The screaming of the man would fade away slowly as he was loosing his concious thanks to the bloodloss.. And.. After some time being he simply died in a slow and painfull way. ''But if you want  to check out a female, there must be one in the morgue still? Who knows.'' 

Her eyes shift over at the still remaining bandit who was bagging for her to stop and kill him on instant.. The puppy like man was howling softly as it tried to break free from the chair where he was on. ''What should we do with the last one?''* - Fri Oct  2 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him before looking back at the shivering still remaining guy. ''Hm.. Breaking all his bones. Oh. I know something. We can force him to break all of his own bones.. And we will see how long it'll take before he faints.'' She says as she looks at the bandit. She walks closer to him and crouches down. ''Or.. You can break all of his bones. Or just give him a quick death. He needs to be excecuted anyways.''* - Fri Oct  2 18:49:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time as she watches the christian take control of the situation.. Killing the poor male. She'd walk over at the doggy like bandit and fliscks a senbon in her hands, piercing it right through his troath she wasn't about to clean up more mess then they already made. ''Mm.. I guess. This worked the best for me. You know. Just inspecting bodies and such.'' She says to him before turning towards the door. She leaves the mess behind, she'll clean it up later. She opens the door for the male so he can go out where she after followed., closing the door in it's lock once again.* - Fri Oct  2 19:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time as he moves over at Berith. Train torture resistance. Why no start right away? She takes her arm and just kinda drags her over the ground, making sure to make a big way around the square as she walked over at the hospital. Draging the girl with her. She'd put her down on a chair in the corner of the room they walked into. After she'd chained her up to make sure to not let her go. * - Fri Oct  2 21:53:42 2015

''Go lay on the bed and hand me the eye..'' She'd say as she looks down over at Seisuke. 

If he would accomplish.. She would use some medicines to put him asleep ofcourse.
She'd start to open up the bottle and walks back. She'd take a random white cloak and puts it on over her own clothing, a facemask was applied along with some plastic gloves. Ofcourse. This was a very carefull surgery. The last time she did one she fucked up her brothers eye. And made him blind. She'd glance back at Berith for a small moment before starting her preperation.

She takes small knifes and such, placing them down on the table. She'd attach the guy to all kind of monitors to look at his heart beat and such while she performs the surgery. As soon as she did set it up everything she'd walk over at the sleeping Seisuke. She takes a tool to widen his eye. She then takes another tool to carefully take his eye out without spilling to much blood. She was alone and had no assistant. It was difficult.. 

She was sure not to shake to much with her hand as she takes a small knife, carefully cutting around his nerves..  But making sure she would not kill them. Hopefully. She'd turn her body slightly to place the pulled out eye away and take the one from the jar, carefully. Her hand moved towards the empty eye socket, using different tools to place everything down carefully before she starts to stitch it up, all carefull. After that she moves her hands in a few handseals, healing up the remaining wound. 

After that she'd place the eye back in the socket, all carefull as she works.. After she was done she cleans up everything and let's the guy just simply sleep out.She'd walk over at the other room again, Where Berith was. What wuold happen there? We'll see.* - Fri Oct  2 22:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks closer towards Berith, glaring at her as she walks inside of the room.
 ''You stole Master.. From me.. By saying you're his wife... Why did you do that..'' 
She'd say as she moves her hand in her pocket, taking a dagger from it. She'd look at the girl for a small moment. 
''Do you like that? Stealing my love? My Master? You are my dinner tonight.. Just so you know.'' 
She'd say with a whispering, robot like voice before she simply  places the dagger down on her troath. 
''I wonder how you'll taste like..~'' 
She'd say as a girn curls on her face. The marks on her face at both sides of her mouth extended it a bit more. She'd then pierce her dagger right into her troath, cutting out the Adam's apple from her neck. The blood spurting all over Zenaki as she did so. And the worst thing. Berith couldn't do anything due to her being paralyzed completely. * - Fri Oct  2 22:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks back again towards the room where the lovely Seisuke was in. Oh. She had to thank him later probably. Or.. Just when she'd eat her before they all will find out? That'll work aswell. She looks down at Seisuke as she looks at his eye again.. Looks like.. Oh god no. She shakes her head and takes some of the tools. She'd do the surgery again, cutting away the eye and replacing it with the other one. Carefully and such she'd be sone with the surgery. Healing up the eye and placing it back in his socket before cleaning up everything again. 
Succes.
After all of that done she'd remove her bloody clothing and throws it in the laundry. Time for a great meal tonight. One she surely enjoys. And maybe? Maybe she'll invite people over. * - Fri Oct  2 22:50:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Seisuke as he woke up. ''Welcome back to the world. You should rest. I will be checking on you in an hour or less..'' She'd say before walking to the other room again. She looks at Berith's body before taking it in her arms, walking off with it towards the basement. Her lab. Perfect. She'd place the body down in a cool cell. For later use.
After it she'd walks back at the room to clean up the mess she made. She hums as she cleans up all the mess and such. She'd then walks back towards the basement, looking at the coolcell. She opened it up and looks inside for the body of Berith. A smile curls on her face before she starts to cut it down in small pieces. Clothing and such removed first ofcourse. 
As Berith was chopped into small pieces she'd take the heart and place it in a bottle. For her nephew later on. The rest she'd put in small jars and cans before placing it down in the cool cell again. She closes the door and takes the heart with her. She places it down on one of the drawers. The bones from the body? She'd throw them onto the pile of other bones inside of the room. 

After all that. She'd walk back at the male in the other room.* - Fri Oct  2 23:07:56 2015

''Mmhm. It's succesfull, your eye, that is.'' She says with a smile.* - Fri Oct  2 23:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm. I'd say rest a little bit more. I'll take the bandage away in 30 minutes. - Fri Oct  2 23:19:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Don't get scared. I am going to heal your eye once more. - Fri Oct  2 23:19:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves up her hands to perform a few handseals before a green hue moved around it. She'd place it down right above his eyes and start to heal it once again, speeding up the healing process. He would feel, if any pain was left, the pain fade away. After ten minute's or so she'd move her hands away again from her eyes. ''There.''* - Fri Oct  2 23:20:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Well... The first attempt didn't go well. I had to replace it. But it works now. - Fri Oct  2 23:24:09 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him. Her dull and lifeless eyes set on him before turning her gaze away. She'd move her hands forwards to take of his bandage, starin down at him. ''Mm..'' She was unsure if it really worked... But... She tried to.* - Fri Oct  2 23:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hands in front of her eyes to shield his still sensitive eyes from the light. '' Be carefull.. And If I was you. I would hide the sharingan. It can be chakra draining.'' She responds to him. She knows just way to much about medical stuff. Her hands moved back to give him an eye patch, placing it on his red eye. '' There.''* - Fri Oct  2 23:31:50 2015

''I somethimes am not really carefull and such, you know. Gotta deal with it.. I fucked up Zetsumo this way aswell.'' She responds to him. 
Now she closes her eyes.. Just.. Just hoping he wouldn't torture her.. Just like Zetsumo did after it went all wrong.* - Fri Oct  2 23:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side as he grabbed onto her hand. She raises a brow in response. '' Mm.. No problem.'' She says before moving her body  and wrapping her arms around him to pull him up. ''You can try to look with the other eye. It would probably be a bit weird. But you can try anyways.''* - Fri Oct  2 23:45:29 2015

After some good amount of time she returns with a warm pizza. Meat, cheese, tomoato sauce, veggies and whatever else was on top of it. It was sliced and wall. And smelling delicious. She moves to stand nextto her Master and moves the plate in front of him. ''Don't worry.. It's not poisoned.'' She says in response as she was already munching down a slice herself.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm.. Hi. - Sat Oct  3 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sighs a time. Welp. She had nothing better to do.. So why not do some training? Her hands moved in a few handseals. Meanwhile.. Well she just thought about things. What if her Master finds out about what had happend? Will she die? Or just get tortured into hell... Or maybe.. Maybe nothing happends? As long as he doesn't find out she'll be all fine.

Zenaki's eyes shift downwards to look at her hands as a green hue emited from her palms. It forms all the way around her hands. She sighs softly as she keeps on thinking about everything that had happend. She.. She lied to her Master. That was the worst part. But then. Everybody took a bite of her delicious pizza. The pizza made of the meat of the one she killed. 

Zenaki starts to chuckle under her own breath, thinking about how she died in front of her eyes and in what way. It.. It was just way to funny. The Adams apple being cut away and that blood.. So much blood from her body. It made her chuckle again as she keeps concentrating on the green hue around her hands. Yep. It was just way to funny.. Now the only thing left is to bring the heart towards Suitengu.

Her hands moved to the side with the green hue still around it.. Then to the other side. She then parts both her hands and the green hue fades away. Mmm.. She places her hands down again and chuckles once again. Yep, it was a funny sight. And nobody knows about it~ And there is no way they are going to know about it. * - Sat Oct  3 12:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand in her pocket to take a human arm from the bag where she was grasping in. Sheplaces the arm down on her lap.. Looks like another arm then last time. Now it was a tanned arm instead of a pale one. 
Her hand strokes over the arm to inspect it.. It looks so smooth and such still.. So fresh aswell. The female starts to laugh softly before she moves up both her arms. 

She goes with her hands through five handseals before activiating a blue color around her hands. She focusses on the blue chakra and moves them in a blade like form. It was sharp.. She places her hand down on the arm on her lap, just to cut inside of the arm on a muscle. This jutsu was used to work more carefull and less messy during surgery's. 

Zenaki stares at the gingers of the hand on the arm as they started to move due to the cut being made inside of the arm. If it were a still living human it would scream and cry. Zenaki closes her eyes to focus a buit more, thinking about that screaming voice from the male where she got this arm from. Perfect. That was just perfect. Zenaki starts to chuckle once again  as she moves her hands over to another spot on the arm, making another cut underneath the skin.

The whole arm on her lap now starts to twitch before it lays down, paralyzed. She giggles at the looks and feeling of it on her lap. It looked funny. After that she releases the jutsu and stares down at the arm. She takes a deep breath to reagain her chakra. This jutsu was quite exhasuting.. And we do not want her to be exhasuted right? Her eyes opened up again, performing a few other seals to heal the inside of the arm, reattaching all of the muscles together. 

After all of it done she takes a deep breath, placing the arm back in her bag. She moves up her hands in the tiger seal and concentrates on her chakra. Time for some rest.. She doesn't want to drain herself out.* - Sat Oct  3 13:00:48 2015
