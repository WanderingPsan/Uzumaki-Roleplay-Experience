<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It wasn't obvious already.  - Sat Sep 19 07:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Well, I'm admiting it now! - Sat Sep 19 07:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Will you torture me now...? - Sat Sep 19 07:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Just one kick, pleeease~ - Sat Sep 19 07:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: No. I am not kicking anyone who gets horny from it. - Sat Sep 19 07:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Horny, you think I'm insane? - Sat Sep 19 07:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: I call it pleasure, kinky work. - Sat Sep 19 07:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Just like you enjoy your "dolls".  - Sat Sep 19 07:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I don't enjoy it. I love it. And I don't really turture them. I use them for experiments. Just watching them die slowly before I heal them back up is just the best. - Sat Sep 19 07:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: But it is just horrible to see people get pleasure from getting that to themselves. - Sat Sep 19 07:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) had litteraly never talked so much about this. Whut happend with the old Zenaki?

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It's no fun to hear people moan because of pain. Screaming is way more funny. - Sat Sep 19 07:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You guys like strange things . . . I get pleasure the normal way . . . - Sat Sep 19 07:12:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: Sure. - Sat Sep 19 07:23:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It is very precise work. If I don't do this precisely. I will poison myself. - Sat Sep 19 08:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: And we don't want that, right? - Sat Sep 19 08:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Not really. - Sat Sep 19 08:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Kinda makes me feel useless here though. - Sat Sep 19 08:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since can't really do anything. - Sat Sep 19 08:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Almost done. - Sat Sep 19 08:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I can use you to test it on. If it works. - Sat Sep 19 08:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: It will only paralyze probably. - Sat Sep 19 08:12:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nope. - Sat Sep 19 08:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Nooope. - Sat Sep 19 08:14:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You've got this guy. - Sat Sep 19 08:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'm sure he'll enjoy the pleasure of . . . being paralyzed temporarily. - Sat Sep 19 08:14:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Oh. It can kill him aswell if I added accediently to much Huruki in it... The flower, that it.  - Sat Sep 19 08:15:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Heh. - Sat Sep 19 08:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath before she takes her bag. She sits down in the grass and places her bag in front of herself. She takes out all the stuff she needs.. A small table.. Yes. She has a table in her bag. She places it down and then takes all different kind of herbs. The female sorts them out carefully. She flicks her wrist and with the moment there was a dagger in her hand. A few bottles are placed down aswell. Ah she really needs to do some fuuinjutsu later on.

After she'd placed down everything she takes her notebook and opens it. She searches through her notebook for a small moment before nodding once. She reads a piece in her notebook about ingredients and then simply takes everything. A heart shaped leaf, some snake poison and a yellow colored flower. She places everything down.. 

She looks over the notebook again.. This must be mixed with water and you get six batches of it. She nods a time before taking the same things again. She adds them. Enough for 12 batches right now. She then takes the leaves and starts to cut down the leaves. The liquid comming from it she needs later on.

After she'd done the leafes.. She takes the juice what is left with a bottle and places everything inside f it. Her hand reached out to take the snake poison.. She adds it inside of the bottle. A straw is taken from her bag and placed inside of the bottle. She mixes it a few times. Her lips moved around the straw as she blows for a few times in the liquid. 

The straw is taken out of the bottle.. She then moves on to the two yellow flowers. She carefully starts to cut down the stem of the flowers.. All the juice left from it is yellow colored.. Zenaki uses her knife to pour and scrape down everything into the bottle. Hell no she is going to touch that... 

After it she takes the leafes of the flower. The yellow colored leafes.. She cut them in half and places them in the bottle aswel.. The leafes seem to vannish after some time. As if they are melting away in the liquid inside of the bottle. Zenaki smiles softly. She loves this job but is simply to lazy to do it all the time over and over again. Her eyes close for a small moment. She places the knife down and stretches herself. She reajusts her body in another position to work in. 

Her hands reached down after she had reajusted herself  She takes another bottle.. With water in it. She pours it down in the poison bottle just to create more of it. After it she places the water bottle down and closes her eyes again. She waits for a moment for the mixture to mix together. Her hands locked their fingers for a moment and she stretches them, cracking and knacking her fingers. Mmm.. 

Her hand then reached out for the bottle again and she takes it in her hand. Her other hand takes the lid and she closes it. She then starts to shake the bottle.. Her whole body wiggles along, something Zenaki hates so much. After a good time of shaking she laces the bottle down and looks at it.. She inspects it and nods. In the meantime she was kind of talking already. A perfect golden yellow color is formed inside of the bottle.

Her hand reaced to take the lid of. Her hand flicks out and a senbon shoots inbetween her fingers. She was talking with Kilm and waits for an answer while she dips the senbon into the poison. She has to test it. Otherwise she doesn't know if she needs to add more or not.. Welp.. Seems like a scaredy cat.
She turns to face the boy behind her and out of nowhere shoots the senbon towards his leg. It scratches along it and makes a faint cut. Within a few seconds the boy should feel his leg getting paralyzed.. Zenaki watches him carefully and then nods. It works. 

She then takes all kind of small bottles, seringes to be exact. She pours the poisonous liquid down in the seringes and shakes them up carefully. She then starts to place everything back. Carefully. She washes everything clean with the water she had left. She is going to fill that later. Hm. After everything was done she stares down at the boy and says nothing for a moment. She then parts her lips.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: FINALLY! - Sat Sep 19 08:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises her brow. Pain? Heh.. That's awesome. She then walks ove to the male and grabs his hair. She drags him back by pulling his hair, dragging him over the ground over towards the place they used to be. Letitng him swing against and over all types of ground to scratch open his legs... The poisons slowly fades further into his body, numbing his other foot aswell.. Even his fingers.* - Sat Sep 19 08:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shinji(Xyndart) says: @W-w-hat is wrong... - Sat Sep 19 08:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Not thinking before you act doesn't make you stupid, so I'm not calling you stupid. - Sat Sep 19 08:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: But it sure as fuck makes you un-fun. - Sat Sep 19 08:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Yeah . . . - Sat Sep 19 08:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Too many fuck ups . . . Too many things done wrong . . . Probably cause of me not thinking . . . Definitely gotta just stay quiet when I can't come up with something normal to say. - Sat Sep 19 08:54:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks back while dragging the boy at his hair over the gorund. His legs are bleeding from the ground. Zenaki closes her eyes and releases the boy. Since he was numbed on several places because of the poison.. He would probably smack with his head on the ground. Because fuck him. 

Zenaki walks over and leans against the fench, careless about Shinji. * - Sat Sep 19 08:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: . . . And that's why I said no to you testing it on me Zenaki. - Sat Sep 19 08:56:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I thought I could handle some herbs or poisons. - Sat Sep 19 08:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm no.. It's fine. - Sat Sep 19 08:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But then you said that fucking up in the slightest could just end up paralyzing me anyway. - Sat Sep 19 08:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Welp. yea. You can look at Shinji. I paralyzed him more then I actually wanted.  - Sat Sep 19 08:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: But this is more fun. - Sat Sep 19 08:58:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: Hm . . . But that means he gets pleasure from pain . . . Would he get pleasure from not being able to move some parts of his body? - Sat Sep 19 08:59:56 2015
