<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up as a caravan arrives. And looks like Fujitora walked out of it. She mves to stand up immidiatly and a small smile curls on her lips. Her Master was back again. Her right hand moved up to hug him back in return. 
''New test subject hm?'' She asks as she looks at him after the hug.* - Fri Oct  9 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods, leading him off.* - Fri Oct  9 11:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens up her house allowing them inside. She looks to her right, sighing softly. If Fujitora was going to look over there.. He would see a statue made of Suitengu's body. Eyes missing. It was neatly placed back together again. 
Her eyes averted towards the basement door, walking over. She opens it up and whatever else, walking through the nasty basement before opening another door which leads through a long hallways towards her lab. Once there Fujitora would do what he just did. 
Zenaki looks over the body and goes with her hand along the large burning gash. ''Mmm..''
Zenaki take a few medical supplies and starts to gather some of the blood before she walks over to one of the devices, checking the blood for what kind of DNA. ''Good..'' She says for herself before looking up at Fujitora, giving him a weak smile. It loks like Zenaki had it still really hard with processing the dead of Suitengu. She closes her eyes for a moment, her lips flattened once again. She releases a sigh before she goes on to work for the DNA.* - Fri Oct  9 11:14:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand on top of her ear, rubbing over it.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly before walking off towards her house.* - Fri Oct  9 19:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves into her house, closing the door behind her again as her Master had walked inside aswell. She would walk over at the couch, sitting down on it. She places her elbows on her knees and her hands on her head, stroking her hair bach as she releases a loud sigh. It seems like this was all to much for Zenaki. Her eyes closed as she takes deep breaths to calm herself down and place her mind together again. If she even could. Aftr she openes up her eyes again.. They looked more lifeless then ever.

Her eyes averted to the side and she cloes her eyes again. Taking another deep breath and releasing it again. She opened up her eyes and looked up at her Master with her lifeless eyes before she looksdown again. She starts to concentrate on her chakra as her hair seemed to be magically starting to move on it;s own. She focusses and moves to wrap her hair around her own wrists. 

She moves her hands away from herself, seeing how strong her hair woulf be with the chakra on it. It was pretty strong. While Zenaki focusses she keeps on pulling her arm, trying to break it free. After some time it does break free. Her hair keep on moving around herself, as if it's a part of her own limbs. It looked probably quite a bit creepy. But it was worth training it.* - Fri Oct  9 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up as she let's her hair hang loosely down again. She walks over towards the door and opens it up, raising a brow as she sees it was Beth. Her lifeless eyes set on her and then looking to the side at Fujitora before letting her in.* - Fri Oct  9 20:49:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Hey. - Fri Oct  9 20:50:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a step to the side to let Beth inside and just closes the door after her. 
''Quite a lot..'' She says as she walks over to wherever Beth was going.* - Fri Oct  9 20:56:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) notes there is a shit ton of meat inside, sushi aswell. Bottles of different alcoholic drinks, normal drinks and ofcourse, pizza.* - Fri Oct  9 20:59:31 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head.
''I know I am not pregnant. I would know that.'' She says with a soft subtile smile before she moves to plop down on the couch. ''Besides, I don't want children yet. I need to finish up all of my studies before I can even get preggers. Plus.. I don't want my child to have the same sickness I have.''* - Fri Oct  9 21:37:55 2015

''You remember in the start.. When I just reunited with Zetsumo again? I coughed alot and I never really.. Got to fight or so. That's why I became medic. You remember that?''* - Fri Oct  9 21:40:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Beth, shrugging. She points over behind her.. If she didn't see it yet.. It was Suitengu's corpse, now a statue.. No eyes anymore, though.. But it was neatly placed together again. She then looks over at the basement door. ''And downstairs one.. Some random guy Master killed with some good Chakra DNA.''* - Fri Oct  9 21:48:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I want to watch you make it.. My little pizza cook. - Fri Oct  9 22:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shrugs her shoulder, walking over at the kitchen. She moves her hand over mtioning for Beth to follow her. The height difference was quite funny, even. Her eyes averted to the side for a small moment before opening her drawer and taking some flour. She takes a mix bowl, pours water inside of it and then adds the flour to it. Her hands she would wash before she start to mix the flour and the water tgether with her hand. As soon as it it mixed quite well she places it on the kitchen table and mixes it up even more into some sort of bread. She uses her palms over her hands to spread the dough into a pizza form.. Flat and round.* - Fri Oct  9 22:20:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens the fridge, taking the cheese and tomato sauce from it. She'd take a spoon and places it in the tomatosauce, before placing it on the flat pizza,, stroking it all oout with the back of her spoon in a circulair motion. 
''Anything you don't like on the pizza?''* - Fri Oct  9 22:25:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: There is no fat on it. I will make sure to use the almoste fate free pieces. - Fri Oct  9 22:36:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) places the cheese down on the pizza. 
''And if you don't want to gain that much weight.. You shouldn't.. Eat pizza?'' 
She opens the fridge again to place the tomato sauce and cheese back before taking the needed veggies and some pieces of meat. 
She places the veggies down carefully and the meat to the side. As she was done with the veggies she moves to the meat and starts to chop it in pieces. Just simple meat. it looked like. She makes sure to take the skinniest pieces so there will not be to much ''fat'' on it. After it she cuts them in pieces and neatly places evertyhing down in slices, as if she was making pizza salami. 
''There.''* - Fri Oct  9 22:39:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the pizza and places it on a plate before placing it in the oven. She puts it on like 200C and for about 10 minutes. That will do.* - Fri Oct  9 22:43:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Well I might have smoe fun with her. - Fri Oct  9 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves up her herd, trsoking through her long white hair before taking the front part of her hair and starting to braid it down carefully along her scalp, making sure she doesn't leave any hairs out of it. She closes her eyes as she works on her braid.* - Fri Oct  9 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Though she threaten to not do my surgery. But I'm feeling a little frisky. - Fri Oct  9 22:58:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her head to the side, brigning forth her braid to braid it further along her shuolder, all the way down towards her hip.. Yes.. Zenaki's hair was just amazingly long.. 
''Mm.. The pizza is almost done I can smell..''* - Fri Oct  9 23:01:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would not really think anything. Just some sort of humming.. A happy like humming perhaps?* - Fri Oct  9 23:09:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes as she feels her body moved on it;s own again. She does whatever Beth wants to with her dull and lifeless gaze, putting of the oven and all that stuff... Before she simply sits down next to Beth. resisting was no option anyways. * - Fri Oct  9 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would do as Beth wanted.. She closes her eyes, obviously not pleased with this. 
''Beth... Stop it..'' She'd think in her mind. * - Fri Oct  9 23:19:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) does as is stated, again. She doesn't seem to respond to much on it. 
<Do I need t stop that surgery... Or add an ugly small penis on you with the surgery? Maybe just sew down your vagina..> She thought back as a small reddish color creeped on her face. She ofcourse tries to fight back against the rubbing now.
<Just stop it. Or I will tell Master.>* - Fri Oct  9 23:25:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) doesn't mind to take another gulp. She liked alcohol anyways. But she tries to keep her hand away from herself, using a quite bit more force against it. 
<Just stop it already Beth. You're trying me out right now.. Stop it... I demand you..>* - Fri Oct  9 23:33:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) woudl have a bird sitting down in front of the window, waiting to deliver a message to Zenaki.* - Fri Oct  9 23:37:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) forces herself not to rub or squeeze. Hell no. 
<Beth. Stop. It.. I will not let your dream to be a male come true. Just stop it.>* - Fri Oct  9 23:41:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) obviously fights back, trying not to move an inch as Beth wished to. 
<Beth. Stop it. I demand it once again.> Her eyes opened to glare towards Beth's sleeping frame. * - Fri Oct  9 23:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) tries not to move herhand towards her button.. And she really struggles to not open it up.. But after a few minutes struggling.. It would open up eventually. Her eyes averted to the side again, closing them.. Her hand clenched into a fist slowly on to not force herself into her pants.
<Beth stop it! I don't like this! If Master hears about this. He is going to kill you for sure!>* - Fri Oct  9 23:58:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) glares at Beth as he was released, closing her button again before pushing herself up without the help of Beth. She'd lift her foot in a quick manner, aiming to kick Beth straight at her face as soon as she wanted to stand up. * - Sat Oct 10 00:08:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down on Beth.. So tiny... She'd turn the bottle a bit in her hands before she looks back at her Mastr again.
''Something happend again.. Like I told you once before, Master.. This is Beth.. A friend of mine.. Or whatever I have to call it.. ''
Her eyes moved over at Beth.. Who was hopefully focussed on the approaching Fujitora. Suddenly her hand snaps out, aiming to hit Beth straight in the face with the bottle of alcohol! Breaking it ofcourse... If it would hit. * - Sat Oct 10 00:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down on Beth.. So tiny... She'd turn the bottle a bit in her hands before she looks back at her Mastr again.
''Something happend again.. Like I told you once before, Master.. This is Beth.. A friend of mine.. Or whatever I have to call it.. ''
Her eyes moved over at Beth.. Who was hopefully focussed on the approaching Fujitora. Suddenly her hand snaps out, a senbon being summoned in her hand and forcfully being placed in Beth's shoulder.. Aiming to paralyze one whole arm.. Fun part~ On the senbon is poison... The poison would spread through her body slowly.. Paralyzing more limbs from her, the more she moved. * - Sat Oct 10 00:32:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Beth, giving her a dead glare. She stays quiet, completely.. Lifeless and dull. Her eyes averted towards her Master before loking back At Beth again. She takes out another senbon, with poison.. Just in case... She holds it inbetween her fingers and waits for the right momentum.* - Sat Oct 10 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at Beth, lifeless and careless. She moves her arm over to pull Fujitora away from her. Master was her Master... True Yandere.
''Use one arm.. Beth..'' She'd says, strictly and robotic like.* - Sat Oct 10 01:05:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at her Master.. He and Beth had to strip for him.. She nods slowly as a small smile curls on her face. She'd move her body, pushing Fujitora down on one of the chairs. She leans forwards, presseing a kiss on his lips before walking off towards Beth, shaking her hips from side to side as she places her senbon back once again. Then she starts to unbutton her kenryoku cloak... Yes.. She was still wearing it. 
''Enjoy the show.. Master...'' She'd say with a faint smile before letting the cloak drop on the ground, revealing her corset underneat her cloak.. With her pants and a blouse under the corset.

Her hand moves over towards Beth her hand, moving her hand to interlock her fingers with Beth's very own while her other hand moved to unbutton the cloak over Beth. ''Let me help you... Just as Master asks for... Let's strip for him okay~ I am sure you'll enjoy it.. To please him..'' She'd say as she unbuttons and whatever else to loosen up her cloak and let it slip off. The small pleasant smile on her features, and a small blush on her cheeks. ''I can give you something to drink perhaps.. Beth.. To get you in the mood~''* - Sat Oct 10 01:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Susumu(JustCallMeGromp) thinks: This will be good for my book. - Sat Oct 10 01:32:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) WOULD NOTE THE WINDOWS ARE CLOSED!!

Zenaki smiles softly and subtile. She'd move her hands over at Beth's sides, placing her down on the bed so she doesn't fall over. Zenaki moves her hands up, lifting up the shirt of the female gently and pulling it over her head.. This made her shoulder move.. And probably hurt her like fuck with this senbon inside of it. She'd then move her hand out of, slapping the poor female once on her chest before she backs up and slowly on loosens up her lovely corset. 

She'd take small steps, swinging with her hips from side to side in a sexy manner in front fo Fujitora -and- Beth. She'd slip doen the corset and let it fall down on the ground. She walks past Fujitora, placing a kiss on his cheek before walking over at the fridge. She'd take out a bottle of alcoholic drinks and walks back again. Her hand moved over to take Beth's hand and press it down on the bed while she opens the bottle with her teeth. She then brings it forwards, placing it on Beth's lips, kinda letting her drink with her own help. ''Mmm~ Drink something of it~ I'm sure you'll enjoy this.. Just like you think I enjoyed your stuff..''* - Sat Oct 10 01:44:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Sadly this strip stuff isn't my style. But I guess it's better then being dead... Rrr I need to get the fuck out of here - Sat Oct 10 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to grin wide, leaning forwards and moving the bottle away from Beth's lips after she'd drunk enough.. She needs to get to remember anything... Anything.. They do... Her head moved infront of Beth's face as soon as she removed the bottle, pressing her own lips against Beth's own. She feels the liquid of the alcohol fill her mouth at that moment. A smile curls on her face as she moves back and simply swallows the lovely alcohol. ''Mm~ You have soft lips~ I didn't expect that~''

Zenaki moves away from Beth again, unbuttoning her own shirt before letting it fall on the ground. Her own chest is aswell being bandaged up. She leans forwards again, unbuttoningthe pants of the female.. And maybe taking it off afterwards even~ What kinda underwear was she wearing~?* - Sat Oct 10 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) thinks: I wonder how she taste...Hmm~ - Sat Oct 10 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side, hearing her Master speak, nodding. She smiles softly to Beth again as she takes her pants off completely. She moves to sit on top of her new play doll. Zenaki leans forwards, smiling softly and staring with her dull gaze into Beth's eyes. 
''Mmm~ Do you love me and my Master?'' She asks in a playfull way before she moves her head lower, placing another kiss on her lips before moving to kiss he slowly lower, along her cheek towards her ear and down along her neck. 
''I bet my Master loves you.. Just as I do.. Hm~'' She says before she moves her hand up to slowly pull away the  bandages. ''M-Mm.. Master~ What do I need to do to her..'' She says as she places her head down on top of Beth's chest, listening to hr heartbeat. * - Sat Oct 10 02:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand down, pulling down her chest bandage, exposing her breasts. Zenaki moves down with her kisses undtil she reaches her breasts. She feels the hand of Fujitora on her right breasts, getting groped and messaged around gently. 
As soon as Beth gave some sort of Command, Zenaki opens her mouth and simply bites down on one of her nipples. Hard and quite forcefull. It was most likely going to bleed even. This would make the numb feeling go away.. On her body. Just a bit of pain and pleasure is enough~ Plus.. The poison doesn't last for to long! 
Simply because Zenaki was to lazy to make the poison last longer..* - Sat Oct 10 03:06:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her head a bit, licking the blood away from her nipple. Her other hand moved to pull the other side of her bandages down aswell. ''Mm~ They are so cute.. Beth..'' She says as she hears her scream out in pain and pleasure. Her fingers moved to pinch the nipple of the lovely girl.. The one who already was bitten and bleeding. Her head moved to the other one to bit aswell, almost piercing through it with her teeth. 

She feels Fujitora lay down on her back, making her move a slight bit lower and lay down on top of Beth.. Carefully not to crush her underneath herself, ofcourse. She moves her body,now gently kissing in Beth's neck again before suddenly biting down, drawing blood once again while Fuji did his work.* - Sat Oct 10 03:39:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sits down on the ground as she was waiting. Her hands moved up to perform a few handseals before a blue chakra hue forms around her hands. She stares at it and.. Just simply closes her eyes, concentrating. She needs to master technique's some times.. And.. She'd been busy for quite a time. So why not take the oppurtunity of waiting and do some training? A deep breath was taken as she opens her eyes again, staring at her hands.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares down at the girl, observing her before moving forwards. She'd crouch down in front of the leg, looking at her side at Paine. Her hand moved out to block the poke towards the leg, a glare given to her. She'd observe the leg and takes a deep breath. She'd nod a time.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) courches down next to the tiny  girl. People are so tiny... Or was she just big with her 6'0? Oh well. 
Her hands moved in a few handsealsbefore a green like hue emits from her palms. She places it gently on Katsune's gut, healing it kind of and just retracting the pain away. The bruise would still be there.. But the pain would go away atleast. * - Sat Oct 10 18:59:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time before she ppushes herself up again, walking over at Setsuko. She moves her hands over at the wheelchair itself. She lifts the foot piece of it and placed it in position.. ''Rest your leg on it instead f using your muscles.'' She'd say to her before moving behind the wheelchair. 
''Paine. You go along. Since you have to stay with me.''* - Sat Oct 10 19:03:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks inside of the hospital.. Which was still beign fixed up. She looks around and walks over towards one of the already fixed rooms, rolling the girl along and placing her still in the room. She'd looks around.
''Some brute fell from up above all the way down to the besment, crushing everything.. If you both were wondering.'' She explained with her dull and robotic like voice.* - Sat Oct 10 19:09:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: When will you give me surgery... - Sat Oct 10 19:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Paine for a small moment before looking back at Setsuko.. ''Mm.. Now might work.'' She'd say before moving to lift the girl from the wheelchair and placing her down on the bed in the room, carefully to not break more stuff. Her head turned towards Paine again. ''Take the wheelchair and wait in the hallway for me..''
Meanwhile she takes some stuff, including an IV. She takes some alcohol and places it on a rag, cleaning up the hand of Setsuko before placing the IV in it carefully. She was making her ready for a surgery. Her hand moved over to some other devices and clips the girl on it. For her heartbeat and breathing obviously. * - Sat Oct 10 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) Closes her eyes for a moment, making herself ready mental. She needs to concentrate on this stuff. She'd take some medicines, placing it in the IV.. One to put her asleep The other one to relieve the pain for if she would wake up. 
As soon as the girl would get that flowing through her blood.. She would probably fall asleep within 10 seconds.. In a deep sleep.. Zenaki walks over towards the drawer, taking out different tiny tools, pincets, knifes, plates. Such things. She then walks back again and places down everything neatly. She then leads Paine out of the room, motioning her to sit down on the chair outside.. Before she closes the door. She takes hr white doctors cloak and gloves and puts on everything. Her hair is tied up in a low ponytail before she starts her work!

She takes the knife in her hand and places it down on the knee of the girl, cutting it open Yep.. Shattered. It doesn't matter to much. It wasn't to much of a horrid situation. Zenaki takes the different small tools and starts to place everything neatly together again.. Her hands then moved into few handseals, healing it up.. Or well.. Just speeding up the healeing process. She then takes a needle and dread and closes the wound again. Everything is being done neatly and carefully.. Just to make sure she doesn't mess up anything.

After that she moves over to take the ancle of the girl, pulling and tugging it to place it back in place neatly.. After that she moves her hands in a few handseals again before she places it down on the wound again on the girl her knee, closing the wound mostly.. And healing up the process a bit more. Ofcourse it would take ages to recover. But it will be fine.

After that done, she takes cast and wraps her leg up in cast. From her foot, being placed in 90 degrees. She wraps up the cast all the way up to the middle of her upperleg. 
In total this would probably take up to two hours since it was a carefull process. But after that all done.. Zenaki cleans up everything.. This time she didn't make such a bloody mess. Time to wait for the girl to wake up.. Which wouldn't take to long. Meanwhile she leans up her hands and undresses herself from the medical clothing again.
* - Sat Oct 10 21:35:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly to her. ''No problem.. Have to help fellow medics.. Make sure to heal your leg twice a day to speed up the process... And.. Don't do anything stupid.. The cast has to stay around it for two weeks.. Including the healing as it speeds up.'' She explains before she walks over at the door, knocking on it for Paine to come inside again if she wanted to.
''Your knee was pretty shattered.. But it is alright now.. Just don't do much yet.. It will be fine.. In four weeks if you keep up the healing. Okay?''* - Sat Oct 10 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nakahara, Setsuko(TheOfficialMidknights) says: I'm sorry.. but.. I can't heal myself.. I don't know any medical ninjutsu techniques. - Sat Oct 10 21:51:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks out of the room. ''Wait here..'' She says before she walks out, taking a wheel chair with those giant tires and walking back again. As she walks back, Fujitora would most likely see her tied up hair.. It was tied up in a low ponytail. She rolls he wheelchair inside of the room and walks over at Setsuko. She takes all the stuff from her body, and then lifts her, placing her down in the wheelchair softly. She places the support part up, placing the leg on it.
