<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -chuckles- - Sat Oct 24 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: A tail, claws, horns, and really sharp teeth. - Sat Oct 24 22:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -chuckles- - Sat Oct 24 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: wonder if she could do something like that. - Sat Oct 24 22:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns her body a bit more, looking at her. Observing her body rather. She closes her eyes to think for a small moment. 
''Little bit of a devil... Horns... Claws.. Sharp teeth... And a tail..'' She imagines the picture in front of herself before a grin curls up her lips. She pushes herself up.
''I recall you wanted a large tongue aswell..'' She starts to chuckle a bit as she moves to the exit and unlocks it. She chuckles again. ''Be right back~''* - Sat Oct 24 22:32:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: is she..really.. - Sat Oct 24 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to laugh softly as she closes the door behind her. She starts to walk through the village, knowing very well there are in the desert a lot of snakes and lizards. Zenaki crouches low to the ground and wait, twirling a single senbon in her hand. She saw something moving, in the corner of her eyes. She shifts her gaze by only moving her eyes. A little horned lizard. Perfect. She throws her senbon in a swift movement and pierces the poor beasty. It struggles and such to keep itself alive.. Zenaki moves over and takes the senbon in hand with the small monster pierced by it.
She walks back to her house and opens it, locking it behind her after and holding tiny small monster pierced on the senbon. She walks towards the basement door and opens it before walking down.
''Come, Hanae.. We're going to test some things.''* - Sat Oct 24 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response to Beth. ''I sure did.'' She says with a smile on her face as she alk through her bloody basement towards another door. She opens it and allows Beth to pass before she follows after. ''Go all the wayto the end and enter the door at the end. I'll meet you soon.''* - Sat Oct 24 22:56:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) follows after her for only a small moment before moving to the side, opening another door and walking inside of it. She there places the lizard down and let it's blood drip out of him into a jar. Her hands carefully wrap around the beasty to squeeze out the blood inside of it. It was squirming and biting even. But it died. Poor beasty.
She then places the beast aside. It was so sharp on the skin thanks to the horns that the horns had made cuts in Zenaki's hands. It didn't matter for now. She'll heal them later. She takes the bottle and walks to the other side f the room, pouring the blood inside of a small machine. It starts to shake and another jar with liquid was filled.. It was a device to seperate the DNA from the blood. 
After that done she takes the new liquid jar and walks out of the room, closing it behind her with  her bloodied hand before walking over at the room where Beth was in. A slight grin was on her face as she walks inside, closing the door behind herself. 
''I wonder if it will actually work.'' She says with a smirk as she walks down and places the bottle down on a random drawer. * - Sat Oct 24 23:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time towards Beth before starting to grin. This reminds her of how she'd trotured Fujitora. She starts to laugh softly again as she walks over towards a closet. She opens it and looks inside of it, taking three seringes with needles from them. She walks back towards the liquid. Once there she places the seringes inside of the liquid and absorbs it inside of the seringes. Once done she taps the seringes a few times, her hands still bleeding. She looks at her hands, sighing softly. 

The seringes are placed to the side and her hands formed handseals, a green hue emits from her palms as she heals her hands.
''Ready?''* - Sun Oct 25 00:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head.
''No need.''
She then takes one of the seringes with needles and walks over at Beth. She takes her arm and simply places the seringe into her upperarm, the DNA being placed into her blood stream and it would flow through her body. She then moves back, looking at Beth. She raises her brow and sighs. Nothing happends yet. 
''Do you feel anything? Aside from pain.''* - Sun Oct 25 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time, walking back and taking the next Seringe. ''Let's try it again.''
She walks over and presses the next seringe in her arm, pushing it empty into her veins. 
''Now?'' She asks as she takes the seringe away from her.* - Sun Oct 25 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the last seringe after she placed the other one away. She moves it up, tapping the back against her chin. 
''No... It would be there within a few seconds. It will be set down in your blood.. So it must work in a few seconds..'' She says as she walks behind Beth, moving her arm over and placing the seringe inside. She presses it down into her arm. ''Last one.''
She then pulls it out again.* - Sun Oct 25 01:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: 9my penis is throbing - Sun Oct 25 02:02:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) sighs a time as again nothing happend. Sadly. She walks of towardsthe rest of what she had left. Not enough for another one. She closes her eyes. 
''Hm... Guess one had failed this time.. Might try later on more..'' She says as she cleans up her stuff.* - Sun Oct 25 02:09:42 2015

''Made you some food.'' She says. * - Sun Oct 25 03:24:48 2015

''Beth. My experiment. After that I will allow you to do whatever you want.'' Her hands moved in a few handseals, blue chakra emits around it, like blades. ''You better step away from him.''* - Sun Oct 25 19:29:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Beth and Fujitora, nodding slowly. The blue fades on her palms.
''Thanks...''
She then walks over, observing the guy. 
''You've been here for long hm... Don't worry you will sleep soon.'' Her hand moved up to ruffle his hair before walking over towards a drawer. She takes all kind different jars from it and looks at them.. Hmm.. ''Puppy... Puppyy...Puppy...'' She looks through them and then takes one. ''There we go.'' 
She fills the seringes with the DNA of a puppy. ''Mmm..'' 
She then walks back at the guy, sitting down in front of him. The six seringes she just had filled she places down in his legs. She only takes one in hand though and let the others only be inside with the needles. She presses one empty in his legs, watching if something was going to happen.

''I wonder Hanae~ If he is as strong as you are~'' 
She leaves the other seringes inside of his body.* - Sun Oct 25 19:50:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes another seringe and pushes it down into his le, emptying it.

''After this he is yours, Hanae..'' She says as she pushes the seringe empty.* - Sun Oct 25 19:58:04 2015

''Your turn, Hanae~ Go have your fun.'' She says before he walks over next to Fujitora.* - Sun Oct 25 20:05:45 2015

It made Zenaki laugh to see this.. It sure was a very funny sight. 
''Well done both of yoou~'' She says chuckling and clapping her hands softly.* - Sun Oct 25 20:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time to Beth before looking at Fujitora. She flashes a big grin.. But it fades as he started to speak. She sighes a time. 
''Hanae, your girlfriend is here.'' She says in a joking tone before she walks upstairs after her. Toward the door.. She unlocks it and walks outside.* - Sun Oct 25 20:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Beth, following her instructions and handseals carefully with her own. she takes a deep breath and focusses her chakra into her palms just as Beth did. Easy.  A blue hue would emit from her palms. She then walks over at Fujitora and place her hands on his chest. A smile on her face. Ofcourse. She tries to infuse her chakra into him to give him more. Or something. Mmm.. But probably nothing really happends to him.

She sighs a soft time as she moves her hands lower, the blue would fade. She then moves her hands up again, concentrating. She moves her hands through a few handseals before again blue aura emits from her palms. She places it forth on Fujitora his chest, trying to infuse her chakra once again.. But again nothing really happend. But.. She was getting there slowly. 

Zenaki closes her eyes, concentrating once more. This was going to be it. She moves her hands through the same handseals again, closing her eyes and concentrating. Her hands are placed back onto Fujitora's chest, she concentrates and let her chakra flow go. Into his chest. She smiles softly as she did so, moving away her hands after a several minutes. She takes a deep breath, closing her eyes after. ''Mmng..'' She says softly as she moves her arms up, letting the blue hue fade and wrapping them around her Master for a hug!* - Sun Oct 25 21:57:32 2015
