''I have two for you, actually. And you say if someone is bleeding to death in combat? Or such. I know one which is very usefull.''* - Sat Oct 17 14:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time before simply looking around herself. Sand will do.
''This technique allows you to make temporary bandages around a wound. Since bandages can mean the difference between life and death. It's a technique I created. And goes through all the villages in the nation. 
You use objects such as grass, sand, water, mud, leaves.. Whatever else. The bandage will last for about five minutes without the new insertion of your chakra.'' She explains. ''Sounds usefull right?''* - Sat Oct 17 14:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him. She moves forwards and sits down in front of him. ''It's quite easy. Once you get the hang of it.'' She says before she simply takes his hand. She places it down on her lap. Her hands moved ontop of the sand and she takes it in her hands. ''You infuse the chakra in your hand.. Into the sand.'' She says before placing the sand down on his arm. '' And mould it into a bandage.''
Somehow the sand seemed to stick together. She rubs it over his arm softly while the sand sticks together. A bit more of sand is added to complete the bandage. ''There.'' She says as she moves her hand away from his arm. * - Sat Oct 17 14:17:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) extends her arm, placing it on his lap. 
''Now you try it. Use my arms to try on.'' She says.

''Nope... Don't know where Hassan is.'' She says before she heads off towards her house. Her own place for pizza's.* - Sun Oct 18 00:07:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Bernadotte(Iron Zorro) thinks: I know what I must do. - Sun Oct 18 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her house, walking inside. She allows him inside and locks the door behind her. As always. The doors and windows shut aswell. As always. 
To the right is a statue, made of a real human. A boy of age seven. Suitengu.
Zenaki walks over at the kitchen. Starting to make the pizza.. And such. To lazy to actually.. write it out.* - Sun Oct 18 00:12:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) notices in the corners of her eyes that he would place his hands on his Katana's, 
''Put your hands away from the katana's, no fighting in my house.'' She says as she kneads the dough bfore flattening it in a perfect shaped pizza crust. She takes tomato sauce and cheese and places it carefully down on the pizza dough, rubbing it oin place with her hands gently.* - Sun Oct 18 00:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) keeps her eyes focused on the pizza as she works to make the pizza. '' Place them next to the door, next to the statue..'' She explains as she works on another masterpiece.* - Sun Oct 18 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shifts her attention immidiatly as she notices his movement. But.. To bad for her. She has no reflexes at all. Or no good ones to say atleast. Not from such a close distance. The sheath of the blade would connect her neck and she winches in pain. She moves her hands away from the pizza and wobbles backwards, before suddenly another strike is delivered in her side. Zenaki falls down on her knees, grunting in pain. ..She was quite dizzy from the slam in her neck, her eyes closed to get herself together. * - Sun Oct 18 01:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) groans out in pain as she is pulled by her hair.. Her beautifull... Long white hair... Her eyes opened slowly to look at the guy... But then a slap was given on her face. She grunts softly in response, moving both her hands up to take his hand where he holds her hair with. Then he would spaek for a moment before she simply got slapped again. She grunts out once again before she was pushed over. A sudden yelp escapes her lips... He was talking again and while so she moves her hand forwards to push him away.. But before she even could do that.. She was turned around, flat onto her belly.. Her body was still tingling and paralyzed after that slam in her neck.. Most likely there is a bruise forming there right now... The same for her side. Her leg moved, aiming to send a sudden kick towards wherever on his body to get him away from her. Meanwhile she tries to push herself upwards before she suddenly feels a katana cut down her clothing. Her eyes widened up and she lays still, completely. Not moving. Nope. She didn't want to die or get cut by a fucking katana!
''N-Nnngh. W-Wait until Master hears about this...'' 
Aswell, Zenaki is unaware that anyone is in the house.* - Sun Oct 18 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the katana as it was placed n front of her troath as soon as she heard Beth's voice. She keeps her gaze on the katana but could easily see her in the corners of her eyes. As soon as he moved behind her back and pulled her up by her hair.. She was forced to stand.. EVen while this dizzy. She groans and grunts out in pain before th katana was placed down on her neck. Zenaki was hopeless in such a situation... and she simply couldn't do anything. Moving an inch would be useless. She shfts her gaze on the tiny Beth, looking at her as if seying help me.. 
She closes her eyes as she starts to grind up against her naked body, causing her to move and slightly lose her balance since.. She is just simply fucking dizzy. * - Sun Oct 18 01:56:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would ofcourse dropontot he ground, her eyes closed and her lips pursed together. She would forcefully be turned around by her hair, groaning muffled thanks to her pursed lips. She opens her eyes slightly just to look at his... thing... And purses her lips even more. She would move her head slightly to the side as he moves to poke his rod against her mouth. 
Zenaki moves up both her hands, placing it on his thighs.. Her eyes focussed on his dick.. She had an idea.. She loosens her lips, turning her head back in place and opening her mouth slightly, allowing him to push only the tip inside of her mouth before her hand suddenly snaps forwards, grabbing his balls tightly and piercing her sharp nails in them with quite some force!! She didn't use her teeth.. But nails...
The devil she was.* - Sun Oct 18 02:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her head back again, barely even touch the man. Her hand tightened up even more onto his balls, just so he couldn't get away or his balls would get ripped off. Own choice. Meanwhile Zenaki turns her face away from the male, collecting the saliva in her mouth before spitting it out on the ground..* - Sun Oct 18 02:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) releases his balls, pushing herself up again. She nods in agreeing with Beth  as she walks over at the sink. She takes a glass and fills it with water. She takes a good bit of water in her mouth, rushing it along her teeth before spitting it out again. Grose! 
''Have fun with him.. Hanae.. Don't kill him..I need to have my testobjects alive.''* - Sun Oct 18 03:08:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Beth pounding the guy in the face, a smirk curling on her face. Once she was done.. His face was most likely bruise all over the place and swollen, bleeding. Whatever. Zenaki moves her hand out, taking his hair, and gesturing for Beth to release him. SHe then moves her hand out towards the basement door, pulling him along and down the stairs. Zenaki steps aside so he can ragdoll all the way down, towards the ground. Leaving more scratches and bruises behind. And perhaps also something broken? WHo knows. 
Zenaki follows up after, taking the male by his hair and placing him down into a chair, binding him down after around his waist, hands and ancles. On the insides of the belts... Were spikes. So every movement he would make.. A spike, or more, would pierce down in his body. 
''My my.. Aren't you a lovely toy...'' She says in a quite seductive tone.. Around Zenaki aswell lingers an aura of pure evil.. And she has plans with this guy.. Great plans... * - Sun Oct 18 03:21:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a step away from the male, staring at him, grinning. But.. Not long after she was hugged by Beth. She moves her hand back, in an akward position to ruffle up Beth's short hair.
''I sure am... Thank you..'' She says qith a smile. '' What should we do to him? I thought about taking his DNA ofcourse, and give him a total of four arms..''* - Sun Oct 18 03:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at Beth, trying to figure out what she was going to do.. Once she knew what she was going to a giant smirk curls on her face. 
''Let me wake him first.. That way he will scream out in pain and agony even more... Make sure to do it nice and slowly.. And watch his face as you do so..'' She orders with a grin on her face. She starts to chuckle softly. even. The best part that if her were to move.. The spikes would pierce into his skin. 
Zenaki forms her hands in a few handseals.. A green hue emits from her palms, placing it down on the males face to heal his wounds.. Just slightly.. And to wake him up. Her lifeless and dull eyes set on him.. And if he would wake up? Which was most likely she'd grin even wider. 
''Hello dear... Did you sleep well? My my.. Aren't you lovely looking...A perfect playmate..'' She would release him again and step behind him. Her hands placed onto his shoulders to massage them.. ''Calm down and relax... Okay...? We're going to make you feel good..''* - Sun Oct 18 03:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) starts to laugh as he starts to move in the chair and scream out in pain and agony. She watches Beth do the work. She leans in, pressing her big breasts against the back of his head. 
''Ahahahah! Well done Hanae~ I am sure he loves this feeling! Hear him scream! This is slo lovely hm~'' Zenaki calls out over his screaming, laughing quite devilish aswell. She bends down, gently licking him over his head down towards his neck. 
''I wonder how you taste like...'' She says, licking her lips before she suddenly leans in, biting quite forcefully in his neck! Obviously aiming to cause him to bleed. And ofcourse... If she would she would take the blood in her mouth, suckling on his wound even .. SHe would smile happily if she moves backwards, a stream of blood running down along the corner of her lips towards her chin, swallowing the rest in her mouth. She licks her lips right after again. ''Delicious...''
Zenaki starts to chuckle once again, her eyes averting towards Beth her doings. * - Sun Oct 18 04:13:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at Beth as she did her work.. Laughing as she heard her talk. Oh she was injoying this way to much! As soon as Beth leaned in to simply bite of his penis... She would move her hand forwards and stop her riht before she could take a bit. Zenaki moves around the male and wraps her arms around Beth. ''Mmm~ I need him alive my precious..'' She whispers to her before looking up at the male. 

''Monsters hm~ Only that? I expected a worse name.'' She says, chuckling while holding Beth in place, her naked body pressed up against her manly form. 

''Oh how much I love your screaming and your pain.. How much I love to see what Beth is doing to you... I can stop it... Only if you listen to me hm~ So beg me.. Beg me to be your mistress and that you will do anything.. Anything.. You will be my experiment.. I will test stuff on you for the rest of your life.. Until you fucking die...And how you will die?'' 
Zenaki moves her head forwards to press a kiss on Beth's head to calm her down. ''That's up to my precious Hanae...''* - Sun Oct 18 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand forwards, taking Beth's hand in hers and placing it back. 
''Enough Hanae... Enough for now...'' She says with a faint smirk.. ''We don't want him to die yet.. We want him to live.. I have several experiments to go.. Plus... I bet you would love to torture him even more.. You will get the chance to do so.. Once I am done alrihgt?'' Zenaki bend down iwhth her head to press a kiss in Beth's neck as she makes handseals. A green aura emits from her palms. She moves it forwards to heal up his penis.. And other wounds.. Or not completely heal up... But just enough to stop the bleeding. The pain would certainly be there...But it stopped the bleeding so he didn't die. Meanwhile her elbows being used to prevent Beth from moving. * - Sun Oct 18 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) releases Beth after she healed him up. ''He's going to knock out any moment. Leave him be... I will come back to him later.'' She says with a faint smirk on her face still. She pushes herself up, moving her arms under Beth to pull her up aswell. She grabs her hand and leads her of, upstairs towards her lcigin room again, locking the door of the basement behind herself, leaving the guy alone in the basement. The ice cold, dead smelling basement.. Surrounded with body parts and blood.* - Sun Oct 18 05:23:50 2015
