<br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Beth, her lifeless gaze set on her. ''Hm?''* - Mon Oct  5 21:01:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Can you change how I look? How my voice sounds? Can you make me a new person? - Mon Oct  5 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I probably can. Why so? - Mon Oct  5 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Because its wht I want. - Mon Oct  5 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It's what I need. - Mon Oct  5 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: To be a new person? - Mon Oct  5 21:04:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Yes. - Mon Oct  5 21:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Why so? - Mon Oct  5 21:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: WHy doy ou need to know? - Mon Oct  5 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Can't you just do it? - Mon Oct  5 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Curious. - Mon Oct  5 21:09:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: It's just sometihng I need to get done. - Mon Oct  5 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hand up to remove Beth's hand from her shoulder. She nods a time. ''Right.. Not right now though. How would you like to look?''* - Mon Oct  5 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Remember. It's the first time for me. - Mon Oct  5 21:10:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: So there are risks. - Mon Oct  5 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: The risks don't matter to me...and well - Mon Oct  5 21:11:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks back at her, raising a brow. A fiant smile curls on her face. She nods a time. ''For your voice I might try and make pills.. As well as increasing muscles... For the face? I can probably make it more manly.. ANd the rest.. I can probably do aswell..'' She whispers back with a soft smile. Eventhough after what Beth had done to her? She'd experienced worse now. But. Still she loves her Master.  She moves to look at the door of the basement. ''I wonder when Master will come home though. And I need to prepare a lot of things. You know. This will also mean you are my experiment. Another experiment for my collection. After that ofcourse I will let you free. You will not be one of the dolls.''* - Mon Oct  5 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I know that. - Mon Oct  5 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm.. - Mon Oct  5 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Not like I would stay your "doll" even if that what you wanted. - Mon Oct  5 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Heh. Nah. - Mon Oct  5 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You've played with me enough already. - Mon Oct  5 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: who the fuck do you think your talking to.. - Mon Oct  5 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -smiles- - Mon Oct  5 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) lets her smile fade into nothing. Just the usual cold and lifeless gaze as ever. She turns to look at the drawing before she walks towards the basement door. She didn't show her the rest yet. Or was it a him now? Oh well. Not yet. She walks up the stairs and opens up the door again. ''Coming?''* - Mon Oct  5 21:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) allows Beth to go through the door before she closes it. She locks it again.
''My Master is my Master. I love him. He loves me. He used to love someone else. But that's no more love.'' Zenaki says casually as she walks over at the kitchen. She opens one of the drawers and takes some bacon look a like stuff. She opens it and takes two sticks from it, placing the rest back again. She starts to munch it down as she walks back again.* - Mon Oct  5 21:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda munches down the meat as she looks at Beth.. She makes a handseal. Oh god. 
Zenaki doesn't seem the move. She was not scared for it anymore. She shows no experssion on her face, at all. 
''Same old trick again?''* - Mon Oct  5 21:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would obviously grab the body of Beth and place her to the side and then sitting down on the bed. Her eyes remain dull and lifeless as always. 
''Why are you so intrested in him? And why are you using the same old trick again? Can't you think of something better? It's getting old..'' Zenaki's tone in her head was robot and dull.. Yet, really arrogant.* - Mon Oct  5 21:44:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares dully forwards. She wasn't going to resist. That would become less fun. As she knows herself. It's way more fun when your targets struggle against you.
''Changed a little hm? Well.. I will not change you if you keep this up. So stop it immidiatly. If not? I might send my Master after you.. And I call him Master because I love him.. And he loves me..'' She responds. She ignores the part of hatin. Ofcourse she does.* - Mon Oct  5 21:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at Beth as she bends over to put on her shoes again aswell. 
''Mm.. Worried why so? No need to be worried about me.''* - Mon Oct  5 21:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: I don't know I guess this master thing... I mean even fi you love someone you don't really call them master. - Mon Oct  5 21:57:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: but who am I to judge. - Mon Oct  5 21:58:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mh.  - Mon Oct  5 22:00:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I am all fine. - Mon Oct  5 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I love him truly.  - Mon Oct  5 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I do anything to stay and be with him. - Mon Oct  5 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: -anything- - Mon Oct  5 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Right. - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: So if he asked to kill me would you do it? - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: you to* - Mon Oct  5 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: He has no reason to kill you. - Mon Oct  5 22:01:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Well thats good to know. -chuckles- - Mon Oct  5 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) thinks: Still got some digging to do. - Mon Oct  5 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mmm. - Mon Oct  5 22:02:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Katsune are you ok? - Tue Oct  6 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Katsune(Shimizu3598) says: Mhmmm. - Tue Oct  6 07:10:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at Bryson, saying nothing. She was about to train him. What about the bible? It was most likely going to be bloody. Even if it was just new. * - Tue Oct  6 07:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: I will have to try this out... - Tue Oct  6 07:13:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Oh Zenaki... my sister devil... are you ready for our next lesson? - Tue Oct  6 07:14:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares forwards, nodding once. * - Tue Oct  6 07:23:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Sure.. - Tue Oct  6 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Very well my sister shall we go - Tue Oct  6 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Mhm.. - Tue Oct  6 07:40:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: So... do you have a female body for me today my sister? - Tue Oct  6 07:41:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at the corpse as they alked into the morgue. Did it look like Zenaki cared? No. 
''How sad.. Glad she died.'' She says in a robotic voice. ''I don't know her. Probably some other random citizen.'' She says with a sigh afterwards. She looks up at Bryson, staring lifeless. ''And what do you expect me to do with the information? She died. Can't do anything about it.''* - Tue Oct  6 08:06:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just stares at him, moving up both her arms to fold them. ''Looks at the bone structure of a female. After that I will let you choose between two skeletons. I'll let you decide which one is male and which one is female.''* - Tue Oct  6 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: So if you ever find a body with only sekelton or whatever.  - Tue Oct  6 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You can see if it was a female or male. - Tue Oct  6 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Easier to identify. - Tue Oct  6 08:20:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) lift s her head up to look at the roof above herself. She hears a lot of booming and cracking. Her lifeless gaze awaits and simply takes a step to the side. As soon as he crushes down on the floor in front of Zenaki she shifts her lifeless on the unharmed man. ''Mmm..'' She says as she observes the man from up to down. What the fuck was this thing? 

Zenaki follows him with her eyes as he starts to look around. ''Hospital..'' She says in a cold lifeless voice.* - Tue Oct  6 09:26:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at the brute. It seems like she didn't care about him being close to her. Not at all. She doesn't show any feelings or such and just stares up. 
''This person died. Couldn't save her.'' She says in response before she takes a pill from her pocket, holding it out in front of his face. '' Take the pill.. It takes your head hurt away.'' She responds to him as she holds the pill out. 

If he would take the pill, he would feel his body becomming numb. And all the pain that was in his body would fade away.* - Tue Oct  6 10:04:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) follows the pill as it is tossed away and then shifts her lifeless gaze back on the brute. 
Her eyes opened up wide for amslal moment as she was suddenly grabbed by her thigh and lifted up, upside down. She sets her lifeless eyes again on the brute, examining him from upside down. Her long white hair hangeing down and touching the ground. Her hands simply hanging down and whatever. 
''Act like what? What's wrong? Can you put me down..?''* - Tue Oct  6 10:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at the brute, showing no emotions still as she was being prod over her body. She seemed to allow it. ''Put me down..'' She responds in her monotone robotic voice.

''I am a person and I hav feelings. I do not like to show them. And stop prodding me.''* - Tue Oct  6 10:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just rests her lifeless gaze on him as she was lifted. Her leg did obviously start to hurt. But she didn't show it.

''Put me down. I do not like to show my emotions. Emotions make weak.'' She plainly responds as her lifeless and dull gaze was set on his brute ones. She doesn't seem to care at anything in the world. Really much like a simple play doll.* - Tue Oct  6 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) plainly stares forwards as she feels the grip being tighter around her thigh. 
''Put me down. Now.'' She says as she simply stares forwards. She doesn't move an inch. Sturggling wouldn't matter anyways. It wouldn't do anything against him. * - Tue Oct  6 10:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Put me down. Now. - Tue Oct  6 10:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes in response. ''Put. me. down. now.'' She says sternly. She was not going to ask him please. No way. ''My Master needs me soon. So put me down.''* - Tue Oct  6 10:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her arms with a swift motion as she feels that she is released. She catches herself and with a twist of her body she moves to stand again. ''I am no slave.'' She says as she brushes down her clothing, back in place.* - Tue Oct  6 10:51:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Yes. I have a Master. But no. I am no slave. - Tue Oct  6 10:53:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) raises a brow and lifts her arm up in the air, waving him of. ''Bye.'' 
She wasn't such a talker. Never really been one. But over the years? She did become really different. She was nothing like her usual self anymore. But only others would notice this. Zenaki self doesn't know about her sudden change; as she is sealed. * - Tue Oct  6 11:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: ....Mmm.. - Tue Oct  6 11:09:26 2015

''Quite good.. I still have something inside the village for you if you are intrested.. I do not know if it will help you anymore though.'' She says as she simply stares down on him.

''Why would that be a fucking surprise! That's no fun at all Suitengu!'' She yells out at him before closing her eyes and taking a deep breath.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at Fujitra, then down at Suitengu. She was planning to pick him up.. Just like she would do back then. But nah. She turns and walks inside, passed the guards, motioning for Suitengu to follow her.* - Wed Oct  7 20:39:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) would walk towards her own house, opening it and closing it after she let Suitengu inside, she locks the door to make sure nobody would come inside. * - Wed Oct  7 20:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Do you like it here? - Wed Oct  7 20:42:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response. ''Would you like something to drink? If not we can go to my lab so I can check you out hm.'' She responds to him as she walks over at the basement door, next to the kitchen.* - Wed Oct  7 20:43:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the jar with the heart in it. she takes the heart in her hands and observes it as she opens the door and walks downstairs.

''Don't look at the mess... Still need to clean up everything..'' She says in her newly usual robotic like voice.  
The basement was ice cold, like freezing cold. Which is really good compared to the weather outside. It had a dark kind of aura everywhere in the basement. There were three bodies hangin on their necks, used as targets. A kitchen, body parts and corspes spread on different tables. There was blood, litteraly everywhere. In the corner is a giant pile with bones and on the wall was a picture hanging. A drawing rather. There were happy faces on it, with names written underneath it -Zetsumo, me, dad, mom- Three other names are smudged out with blood. 

Zenaki moves the painting away slightly, opening another hidden door. she waits for Suitengu though.. If he had any questions or so.* - Wed Oct  7 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shakes her head in response. She doesn't hear the knock of Fujitora. She is in the basement.
She walks through the hallways hidden behind the door. A whole underground path leading towards one of the chambers all the way in the back. On the way there the light was lid up by some candles and there were a lot of doors. She opensthe last  up. There was abit blood on the door and a sign with DANGER on it. 
Inside of it, everything seemed to be like some sort of torture room. But it was all cleaned and neat. Also a lot of medical supplies were there. And all things needed for a medic.. Or maybe an insane one. 
She closes the door after she'd let Suitengu inside, placing the jar down with the heart on top of a still empty drawer. 
''She never tried to, she didn't dare to. Why so?''* - Wed Oct  7 21:08:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns around as he slowly places the jar down. Her lifeless eyes, now piercing daggers at the young boy. 
''You.. Killed Yumiko... Because she attacked you!? You could have fucking brought her to me!'' She closes her eyes and shakes her head. '' I would have punished her. Why didn't you bring her to me. Why not, Suitengu.'' Her eyes opened up again, staring deadly at the young kage, There was still no shimmery at all in the eyes of Zenaki, no emotions at all.. Yet.. She seemed to be really angry at the moment. * - Wed Oct  7 21:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Because I felt no need to save those who wished for their own death. - Wed Oct  7 21:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I'll let you know, her death wasn't quick. - Wed Oct  7 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: She was scalped, her heels cut. - Wed Oct  7 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: So in a way. - Wed Oct  7 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: .... - Wed Oct  7 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: I did punish her like you said you were. - Wed Oct  7 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Still didn't had to kill her..  - Wed Oct  7 21:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: She's dead. Nothing else about the subject. - Wed Oct  7 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Her body however, is free to come to you whenever you'd like. - Wed Oct  7 21:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes again, placing herself in one of her very own torture chairs.
''Burn her body. A heart is enough. I don't need it.''

<I could have eaten her.. But that is useless with all the poison inside of her.> She thinks to herself before opening up her eyes again. She looks over at Suitengu, leaning forwards, leaning with her elbow on her knees and her head on her hands. ''What ddi you want to show me... Why I should check you out,..''* - Wed Oct  7 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up and observes the body of the boy as his arms randomly started to come sort of loose from his body. She pushes herself up and walks over to observe it from up close. 
''Mmm... I see.. Intresting.. Suitengu.'' She says to him, her voice even colder and more robotic now after that news of the poor Yumiko. She walks a round around the boy, moving out her hand to go along the new pair of arms, just to inspect it. She then nods another time in response. 
'' Mmm..Good to know you are improving.. Brother would be proud of you.'' She says to him in response with her cold, robotic voice. * - Wed Oct  7 21:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: He always saw you, Suitengu. But you know him. He doesn't show it. - Wed Oct  7 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: He never gave hugs right? - Wed Oct  7 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: But he would love to give one. - Wed Oct  7 21:52:25 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: You aswell.. - Wed Oct  7 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: But he was just to stubborn to say it or do it. - Wed Oct  7 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Hmph. Doesn't matter now, I guess. - Wed Oct  7 21:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) crouches down in front of Suitengu, looking at him. ''As long as you know I will always be here for you hm..'' She then moves her hand forwards, placing it on his chest where a heart would be, normally. ''And he will always be with you. You are just as special to me as your father is hm.'' Her hand moved up to bop him once on the nose with her finger before she moves to stand up again. * - Wed Oct  7 21:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) allows him to leave. Her eyes closed simply to think more. 
The door can be unlocked from inside out what will lead him outside ofcourse.
Zenaki takes her 2000 pages book and starts to write things down in it about what she'd remembered about the eye.* - Wed Oct  7 22:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just kinda walks out of her house, looking around herself and closing the door. She walks North and opens her eyes wide as soon as she spots Suitengu's body. She rushes forwards and courches down, picking up the body of the poor boy. She looks and inspects the body beforeshe closes her eyes. 
Her body starts to shake and to shiver as she holds the body even more close to herself. Her only family left had died. How? How did he die? Zenaki's eyes opened slowly, a single tear runs down her right cheek. Was she crying? Was Zenaki crying? 
Her eyes closed again, hugging the body close to herself, the body of the young poor boy. 
She pushes herself up as she holds the body close to herself. She takes a deep breath, taking no notice of anyone around herself. She turns and walks back towards her own house again. She releases his body with one of her hands and opens up the door again, walking inside if she was not stopped.* - Thu Oct  8 12:24:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns her head slightly as she walks inside of her house. 
''Go fucking away.'' She says strictly to him before she walks inside and slams the door shut. She doesn't lock it though. She walks over at the bench and sits down, holding Suitengu's small frame against herself.* - Thu Oct  8 12:27:56 2015
