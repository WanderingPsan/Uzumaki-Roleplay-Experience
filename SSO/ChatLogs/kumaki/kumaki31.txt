''Ah... You will be staying here until the next morning. Think well of what you did..'' She says before she locks the door and walks back again... Her wing dragging behind her whilst the other one is folded on her back.

Then she walks over at the side and takes a broom.. But she removes it and only keeps the stick from it.. She walks back at Paine.

''Right... Listen carefully. If you bend it in place. I will not be able to listen to you because of the pain.. I will explain you right now what to do exactly. You will bend it in place.. With that you will fold it until it's folded like the other one... You place the stick against the broken part and will wrap around the bandage tightly so it will not move away from it's place.

A soft sigh escapes her lips and she later pushes herself up to stand..She moves her wings a bit.. Or well attempts to. She then walks towards the door where her child was behind.. She opens it slowly and looks inside. 

''Are you going to.. Listen.. Akari...?'' She would ask as she stares down at the child, making sure the child can not escape.* - Sat Dec 12 19:56:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks down at him. 

''I know enough...'' She says before she closes the door again, locking the child again... She walks to the kitchen in the basement, taking some cold cooked meat from it and she walks back. She opens the door of the room and hands the child the meat. ''Eat..'' She says before closing the door again. She was just teaching the child a lesson. And he is not going to get out of that room. Before he apologizes and will listen to is mother. * - Sat Dec 12 20:02:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) sighs a time. In the basement.. She would grab a big blanket and wrap it around her wings and her body... She would then walk up the stairs, opening the door slowly after she had unlocked it. Nothing of her wings or body was visible athe moment... Or well.. ofcourse not to be seen. The big blanket would say otherwise.. She peeks along the corner and she spots Sanoke. Her eyes widened up for a small moment before she slowly closes the door again, leaving only a small slit to speak through.

''S-Sanoke what do you need?'' She asks, her voice deeper than normal. She moves her hand up, locking the door in this position by a hook. She moves then her hand to move out the lights behind her.* - Sat Dec 12 20:12:06 2015

''A-Ahm...u-umm.. I'll think about it. I have to take care of a lot of things here first. Besides. I would love to get something in return for it. I mean. People never come to me for healing or something. My job is litteraly stolen from me by the medics around. I would love to also do something again..'' She simply explains.. Her voice is darker then normal, and sometimes a groan of pain escapes her lips. Her wings was still broken after all.. And it hurts like hell. * - Sat Dec 12 20:24:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) notices a Sanoke walk down the basement. She opens her eyes wide and wraps her blanket a tad more around her, though it was obvious she was hiding a lotta shit underneath. 
Her eyes go back to Akari.

''Hurt you..? I hurt you...?'' Zenaki then starts to chuckle softly. 
''Do you know how much this hurts for momma, to have her child yelling at her. This breaks my heart, Akari.''* - Sat Dec 12 21:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as the Sanoke suddenly stand behind her and aims to pull of the blanket! She pulls it back and groans in pain.. Only to fall down on her knees. 

''L-Let go of that!'' She demans.. But as her strength is weakened in this state, the blanket is pulled away, revealing her large wings on her back! One is bandaged up.. And her whole body is covered in fur... With a closer look, also her hair got darker and she had very sharp teeth and nails.

Claud turns her body and looks quite shocked up at Sanoke! Oh god what was he going to do! Her face suddenly seems to calm itself down.. Remembering what had been told. 

''U-Uhm.. I can eplxain it..''* - Sat Dec 12 21:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) pulls out the piece of plate.. She throws it to the side and then moves her hands in a few seals, forming an emerald aura around her palms and she places it down on her wound, healing it slowly.

''Oh by the way.. Thanks..''* - Sun Dec 13 07:27:05 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Why so? - Sun Dec 13 07:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(TempusKing) says: Yes, are you a friend of hers as well? - Sun Dec 13 07:45:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she hears cracking. Before she could even respond, Chikyu grabbed her tall body by the waist and hoist her up to the small mountain. She sits down and stares down to the waters. 

''..Uh.. The hell..'' She says before she looks over to where the water source came from.. Water in the desert. Funny thing. * - Sun Dec 13 08:50:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) just slowly nods. She'd experienced a lot. But not really.. Something this big. Not even when she was with Zetsumo. * - Sun Dec 13 08:56:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks over at Chikyu, shaking her head. She activates her suimen, just to be sure with the water. 

''Thanks tho. But I am not hungry..'' She says... She then closes her eyes, thinking. She can also just fly.. But.. That wasn't a good idea either.. Maybe.. When it was really needed.* - Sun Dec 13 09:06:04 2015

''I'm her, silly.''* - Sun Dec 13 10:16:54 2015

''At home.'' She says before eyeing Chikyu again. ''They're sleeping I assume.''* - Sun Dec 13 10:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) thinks: Wow. No one is even praising me for saving the village. - Sun Dec 13 10:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Ah.. Yea.. And it's okay, Chikyu. You couldn't have noticed me. I'm having quite a different look.  - Sun Dec 13 10:21:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: But aye. Mirai was your name right? Uh... I guess I can help you out. And perhaps you do aswell know of some techniques I do not know about yet.  - Sun Dec 13 10:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I'm not a very skilled medic. - Sun Dec 13 10:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I could probably teach you little to nothing. - Sun Dec 13 10:23:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I only know the basic healing. - Sun Dec 13 10:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Perhaps I can ask Kiyoko later on then. Hm. - Sun Dec 13 10:24:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I need to talk with her anyways. - Sun Dec 13 10:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Just let me know. - Sun Dec 13 10:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves up the hand of hers to pat the bat who had most likely landed on her head now. She looks over at Mirai and nods slowly. 

''Aye... I'm always ready. But it would be more usefull if you and Kiyoko are around so I don't have to explain it twice.''* - Sun Dec 13 10:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Can we have seperate sessions? - Sun Dec 13 10:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Uh...mm..  - Sun Dec 13 10:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) sighs softly, taking the bat from her hat and placing it in her cloak to keep it in a dark place. Her eyes ander of to Sanoke and then raises a brow, only to look back at Mirai again. She starts to grin just a little bit. Medics that are both medics, and they don't get along? Claud was going to change that. May it be the soft.. or the hard way.* - Sun Dec 13 10:42:30 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: ... - Sun Dec 13 10:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: What is it? - Sun Dec 13 10:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Right. - Sun Dec 13 11:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods a time, walking off.* - Sun Dec 13 11:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) place Nubi down. * - Sun Dec 13 11:50:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Nice place you've got here. - Sun Dec 13 11:51:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) would unlock the door and walk inside. To the east is an iron door. Sanoke know most likely very well what is behind there.. In the corner of the room is a statue made of a body.. The body of a small boy, Suitengu's own..

''Uh.. Thanks...'' She says before she opens the door tothe basement. ''Aye. Stay here I'll be right back.'' She says as she wakls downstairs. * - Sun Dec 13 11:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Right. - Sun Dec 13 11:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: Hi, Nubi. - Sun Dec 13 11:59:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) would scuffle a bit around, downstairs, grabbing a body in a sack downstairs before simply lifting it and aking it upstairs... She places the bodybag to the side and then closes the door behind her. On the bodybag is a lot of blood.. And what's inside? Welp, most likely a corpse... 

Claudette would just walk to a closet, opening it and taking table from there. She unfolds it and places it to the side before taking the bodybag, opening it and placing the body on top of the table. 

''Aye, Mirai...'' She leans against the table as she turns around.. She looks over at Mirai. ''You know basic healing you say? Anything else?''* - Sun Dec 13 12:00:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods a few times. '' Right then. What I have more for you is Gantai no Jutsu, CHakra scalpel and chakra transfer... And maybe another one, after you -mastered- those.'' She explains as she looks at her.Her right hand moves back to stroke softly over the leg of the body. 

''Gantai no jutsu.. Is a D-rank. It makes a temporary bandage and lasts five minutes if there is no chakra inserted in the substance. In a shinobi world there is this one time.. Where a bandage can mean live or die. But sometimes a medic runs out of bandages.. This is a quick way to make a bandage yourself, with water, grass, sand or whatever else is around that you can use.''* - Sun Dec 13 12:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softly. 

''Gantai is more usefull in field than the chakra scalpels. It's rather easy.. Perform the handsigns...'She shows her the handsigns.. ''And then just transfer your chakra into said object you want to use.. Mold your chakra together with it and bend it in place. That's about it.'' She says before she pushes herslef up, sitting on the table next to the body. * - Sun Dec 13 12:27:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Well, it's a pretty easy technique. - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Can't she just get both? - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: She can. - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Why the hell do you think why I asked her here? She can do and learn both. - Sun Dec 13 12:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Oh. - Sun Dec 13 12:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: See. Wasn't that difficult.  - Sun Dec 13 12:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I suppose you're right. - Sun Dec 13 12:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Now come here. - Sun Dec 13 12:56:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) turns her body, hopping of the table and looking down at the body. 

''Right then.. For chakra scalpel it is very essential you have a good control.. It is used to tear muscle tissues and to perform surgeries without making so many mess... Yet. As you are taijutsuist.. It may come very hands in combat.. Since you can render your opponents paralyzed by hitting on the right spots.'' She moves her hands in a few handseals before a blue hue llike knifes form around her hands. ''It is mostly used to precise the cuts with a surgery.. Actually.'' She says before placing one of the hands on the arm of the body, cutting the muscle inside of it's body. She then removes her hands. 

''Open it up.. You will see the muscle is cut now. Eventhough. You see nothing from the outside.''* - Sun Dec 13 13:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) notes the body is just randomly. Suitengu is a statue behind them.

She just looks on as the female was performing the technique. Long not perfect.. Like Claud it would do.. 

''Mm.. Will work for now. Practice it well.. You can practice it here, or on other corpses.. Perhaps persons..''* - Sun Dec 13 13:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Mirai(Rakkatta) says: I intend on practicing on my spare time. - Sun Dec 13 13:36:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) shrugs her shoulders.

''I wouldn't mind. You guys can go out, stick around here and have something to drink or eat.. And then..mm.. I dunno..''* - Sun Dec 13 13:48:32 2015
