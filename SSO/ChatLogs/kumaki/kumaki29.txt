<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) closes her eyes, nodding slowly. She concentrates on herself whilst listening to her mistress... She then opens her eyes slowly. 

''Mmm.. How.. Do I do it.. J-Just concentrate on myself or..?''* - Mon Dec  7 22:35:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) takes a small step backwards as she nods a few times. She then closes her eyes, concentrating on the dark energies in her body.. She tries to activate them... ANd once done.. She starts to groan softly, feeling her back being ripped open! Blood moves down her back slowly... she bends over a bit, feeling her teeth grow aswell... And her skin changes color.. She tries to keep her posture but it was quite hard.. For the first time being in some sort of transformation!

Her hair changes color to a dark red, almost black... And large wings starts to erupt from her shoulders! Bat like wings! Her teeth are even sarper now, fangs like.. And her skin had gained fur over her whole body.. She grunts and groans in the transformation, and suddenly her wings are flapped to th outside.. She moves to stand up straight slowly, panting softly as she looks over at her mistress with her black eyes. Her wings each had a wingspan of about 8 ft. They were, very large.. She closes her eyes softly.. Before opening them up again.. Claudette looks down at her body to inspect it before looking up at her mistress again. She said nothing.. * - Mon Dec  7 22:52:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks over at her Mistress.. She raises a brow and shrugs her shoulders.She looks at her bat wings and tries to move them like she would move her arm.. It was hard at first but they would move a bit. She would fold them so they're flat on her back, probably reaching high up above her and almost touching the ceiling.. Her wings also touch the ground, and if she would walk.. They would drag behind her.. She looks back at her mistress. 

''I.. Think I can.. But.. Is it.. Smat to go outside now..?'' She asks, carefully not to bite her own lip with her big fangs right now.. Her whole skin is so fluffy right now.. And her large wings more like a leather like fabric. * - Mon Dec  7 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: smart* - Mon Dec  7 23:12:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods slowly in response, concentrating herself and then let the dark fade from her body.. She closes her eyes in the progress, groaning and grunting as her wings got back into her shoulders again, the fangs went away, yet a slight hint of sharp teeth is left behind. The fur on her skin also fades, returning to her normal greyish color. * - Mon Dec  7 23:19:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) raises her brow as she hears a familiar voice.. She and Asteroth stop in their tracks before she turns around. Her completely black eyes fall on him, observing him from top to toe before she opens her mouth.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) stops in her tracks, looking back at Asteroth for a moment.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles lightly at Hanae's actions. 

''Hanae~ Let's go to the hspital..'' She moves to grab a hold of Yoshima's hand and pulls him with her.. Hanae must know what she was going to do.. As for a small note.. Claudette had two ripped places on her back, with blood coming from it. Like two large cuts in her shoulders. She walks of with a sly grin on her face. * - Tue Dec  8 01:00:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Alex(Ninask115) says: O-Oh. Can I go with....? - Tue Dec  8 01:00:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) places the guy down on the bed.* - Tue Dec  8 01:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Punish you...? - Tue Dec  8 01:12:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at him, all calm it seems like. Her right hand moves in her pocket, retrieving a dagger and she spins it  a bit around in her hand before holding it tightly.

''And why do you deserve to get punished?'' She asks as she looks down at him, holding the dagger tightly in her hands.. Her teeth seemed to be even more sharp than normal.. Her skin is no longer grey-ish.. But more red-ish.. ''Hm..?''* - Tue Dec  8 01:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) starts to chuckle softly before she snaps her dagger forwards, planting it into his shoulder. 

''Ah.. I guess as a sorry from the last time in the mansion?'' Claudette looks down, chuckling again. Her teeth only seemed to grow a tad larger. * - Tue Dec  8 01:21:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: his left* shoulder - Tue Dec  8 01:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) starts to laugh devilishy as he starts to scream out for more. Ah, another one like Hanae... She looks back at Hanae for a small moment before placing both her hands on the shoulders of the boy.. She moves his shirt down slightly to reveal bare shoulders.. She then leans in slowly to him. '' Hold that dagger for me will ya~'' 

She then places her teeth down on his shoulder, digging in her large teeth! By bending over in such a way it hurts her shoulders like hell.. Because there are simply two gigantic wounds on her shoulders. 
Her teeth are sharp as they dig in the skin, piercing through it and making it bleed. She bites hard, before suddenly moving her head back, ripping of this piece of his skin.. A whole piece of his body inside of her mouth..

She starts to eat it whilst she retrieve senbons, pinning the boy in his shoulders and hips.. To completely prevent him from moving.. He was like a doll now who she could do stuff to.

She swallows the piece of human meat..''Delicious...'' She said, lickling her lips before she speaks again.

''I'll punish you.... But I will promise you... This'll be worse than hell...'' The Angel of death then chuckles again.* - Tue Dec  8 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her hand up with a swift motion, grabbing his troath and squeezing it down.. This ways she can pull back and just eat alone. No way he was going to kiss her.

She however, feels the blade being dragged over her skin.. She groaned in pain, taking a step back after he was paralyzed. 

''You son of a bitch...'' She says in a groan.. The blood drips down from her thigh... She didn't like pain herself, at all...
But at this moment, he's paralyzed. To bad.* - Tue Dec  8 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her hands in a few seals, a green ara around her palms as she starts to heal her leg.

''You son of a fucking bitch....'' She says as she heals her leg.. After some time she bends over him, grabbing the dagger and cutting him open completely! She then places the dagger to the side, pushing her hand -inside- of his body through the wound. 
''How does this feel!? My dear~? I bet you love it..'' She moves her hand, grabbing onto one of his kidneys.. * - Tue Dec  8 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) never removed his clothing.... 

She just cut right through it... His upper body..
Cutting him open completely from shoulder to hip..
In there she went with her hand! Into his insides to grab his kidney.
She had never even dared to remove his pants..
If he would get erect... That would most likely hurt as fuck with his pants pushing down on it. 

She just chuckles softly and then squeezed the organ with her hand.. It starts to coat with the blood.. Her whoe arm dows.. And her teeth only grew larger... As if she was some sort of vampire.. * - Tue Dec  8 02:00:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her hand back, which now was covered with blood. She chuckles softly as she takes a step back, licking the blood from her fingers.. The blood was still warm...

''mmm... I love this... Hanae.. Your turn..''* - Tue Dec  8 02:05:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hanae(Ej900) thinks: He'll bleed to death with a hole like in him..he sure was pissed. - Tue Dec  8 02:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) just kinda starts leaning against the wall, licking her hands and arm even from the blood. * - Tue Dec  8 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Don't kill him alright, Hanae~  - Tue Dec  8 02:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) starts to chuckle as she looked over at him..

''Hanae.. Want some pizza?'' She chuckles again as she looks over at the guy.. She places a hand on his chest and walks around him before grabbing onto his head. He should be passed out by now..* - Tue Dec  8 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softly again, seemingly not getting a reply from her dear dear sister. 

She then takes the dagger from the bed and pierces it down in the past out guy his troath.. He was paralyzed.. And Ko'ed... And she was very hungry...Finally some good old times again. She chuckles as she slowly cut open his troath more and more. Yep. She was killing him. She couldn't save him anyways from the bloodloss of his giant wound on his upperbody. * - Tue Dec  8 02:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) takes some samples from his body as he had died.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) pushes Hanae to the side, only taking her stuff.. She was going to loot his body first. Fuck her. She had killed him! She takes scrolls, weapons and everything. She had killed him first. Fuck her. * - Tue Dec  8 03:02:36 2015

Her skin is a red-ish grey like color. Her eyes completely black.. Her long red hair covering most over her body. 

''Hello there..''* - Tue Dec  8 21:54:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothCaged) whispers: You here to deliver a message, at all? - Tue Dec  8 22:05:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at her, taking a soft step backwards. She shakes her head. 
 She says something softly in a whisper... She was getting nervous somehow as she holds the children tighter in her arms. She didn't want to say it. Maybe.. Maybe she was going to say it later on.. She glances around at all the familiar faces.. To her atleast. The others would most likely not recognize her. Unless someone had a very good sensing ability and could recognize her chakra.* - Tue Dec  8 22:08:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) whispers: She's... My cousin...  - Tue Dec  8 22:08:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) would retrieve a key and open up the door. She then walks inside and allows the girl to come inside before she locks it again. * - Tue Dec  8 22:12:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks around the room, starting to chuckle softly.

In the corner of the room next to the other door is a statue, made of a small boy his own body. Suitengu's own. To the right of Claudette there was another door, made of iron.  She moves her children, placing them down on the couch before plopping down on it aswell..* - Tue Dec  8 22:15:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: My hair is also normally a white color. My eyes red. - Tue Dec  8 22:21:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at the fake fishy zenaki as she walks oout of the room.. A zenaki who had been working here in place of the real one.. It looked like the real one, normal skin, red eyes, long white hair. 

The real Zenaki moves a dagger from her pocket and throws it in the fish thing, only to let it poof and leaving a fish behind, dabbing on the gorund before it bleeds to death. 

''mmm.. Just a lot of things..''* - Tue Dec  8 22:24:00 2015

''There.. Anything else you wanna discuss..?''* - Tue Dec  8 22:35:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) sighs, she closes her book again and places it in the bag she usually caries with her. But since nobody ever payed attention to her, the real her, Zenaki. In the past. They would probably not even recognize it. Now she knows how much people like her. Not at all it seems like. 

Zenaki pushes herself up and closes her bag, moving her hand in her medical pouch and feeling around in it. She then nods sowly to herself before her eyes wander back on the group again. Her completely black eyes. Her lips are flattened.. She looks down again, rasing her arm slightly.. She looks at her hand which has  a red-sih grey like color, just like the rest of her skin. In the meanwhile she movs her tongue over sharp teeth, vampire like.

Another sigh was released.. She was going to note everything that she sees changing on herself.. Note down every little thing. Her black eyes move back on the people again, staring at them from a distance..

The ones that have good sensor abilities and had payed attention to Zenaki's chakra in the past.. Would most likely notice it was Zenaki. But otherwise.. She just has a slight resemblance.. Nothing more really..

Not that anyone cared anyways. * - Wed Dec  9 00:53:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softly as she sees one of the two babies is awake.

''Hey hey... Akari... Have you slept well..?'' She asks softly as she walks over, moving to sit next to him. * - Wed Dec  9 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) lifts up the kid in her arms, placing him on her lap. She moves her hand up, stroking over his hair. * - Wed Dec  9 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her hands, moving his tiny hands away. No baby food for the grown child. For a two years old with tiny teeth. Nope! 

''You hungry?''* - Wed Dec  9 01:12:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm?.. - Wed Dec  9 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softly, moving the child next to herself on the couch again.. She then looks up as she hears the door unlock and someone woould walk inside! 

Claudette sits there, with a child.. And a sleeping child.. Her skin.. Red-ish color.. Her teethe sharp like a vampire...Hair crimson red.. And her eyes completely black, even the white part.
Her eyes widened up as she noticed it was Fujitora! But she said nothing. She was not allowed! Evenhough she wants it so badly.

''Look.. Dad's there..'' She whispers to the child next to herself who was awake.. As if giving him some hint to let him run over or something. 

The chakra inside of Claud is completely dark, but indeed. It was Zenaki. And he was.. Probably the only one who would recognize it!* - Wed Dec  9 01:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at him, lips still flattened. She holds the child a tad closer to herself.

''Your child? Our child...'' She moves her lips in a small forced smile. Yes indeed. She looks not the same at all.. And the dark chakra.. Or well mana.. That had taken over her sould only made it worse.. It looks like. She looks back behind her at the dead fish like body.. And then back at Fujitora.

''Uhm.. I... Will explain... Sit down calmly please..'' She says, before chuckling softly. Her voice even was different. * - Wed Dec  9 01:24:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at him, placing the child gently down on the ground. She pushes it slightly to move it over to Fujitora.

''Ah.. Uhm.. You see.. The Zenaki behind me on the ground.. Was afish.. Some sort of clone like creature.. I.. Went on a trip... With hanae... And.. I forgot.. To uhm.. Tell you... But I am sorry..'' Her head moves lightly, bowing a tad bit down at him before looking at him again.. The Chaotic and  evil presence, as always still around her. 

On her back, as a small sidenote will he be capable of seeing it.. Are two giant wounds.. Like giant giant wounds. At the place where her shoulders are. * - Wed Dec  9 01:28:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) starts to glare at him.. She then releases a soft sigh. She can't.. Can't tell the truth. Nope. She can't.. Her mind is controled so she can't tell anything.

''M-Master! I am telling the truth.. My name is Zenaki.. I know I might look completely fucking different... But I am the true Zenaki! I can even proof myself. Any way you wish. Ask me questions, I'll answer them..'' Claud says as she takes a deep breath after. * - Wed Dec  9 01:36:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Ask me.. Ask me questions... Anything you wish that only the real Zenaki knows.  - Wed Dec  9 01:36:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) keeps her eyes locked on Fujitora.. But moves her arm to wrap around the child.. She pulls him close to her whilst she showed no fear.

''I dyed my hair, my skin got colored with it somehow. My face did not change, only my eyes. I am wearing large contacts.. Can't take them out somehow anymore.'' She explains.. The listen seal does not work.. Her sould is corrupted.. And mindcontrol is set into play. The seal does not work. 

''I.. Am sorry that I scared you like that. Do I have to explain the things we had done together? The ones where I laughed so hard because of your hopeless figure in the chair when I explained about Berith. Where you raged all out and nearly killed me. Or that one day that you had unsealed me.. And you got ass raped by a bone.. It all happend downstairs in the basement. I can even show you the places where it had happend... And you know well. That basement is locked on all sides. You can't look in there.. Or anything else right? So do you believe me or do I have to explain more, show jutsu's or something else? How I create pills.. Make poisons.. Do experiments on these dolls of mine..'' She now shuts her mouth, looking sternly at her Master. ''Please Master.. I am really Zenaki...You are scaring your son...Akari...''* - Wed Dec  9 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) grunts as the grip only tightens up on her head. He then backs off, causing Claud te release a soft sigh and then she looks up at him. Her hand extends, grabbing his hand as he backs off.. She was not allowing him.. 

''W-Wait.. Please don't go outside.. Please..'' She says softly, as if almost crying. ''You.. You know it's.. It's the real me.. Why.. Why aren't.. Aren't you glad that I came back...'' She whispers softly as she looks at him. 
''P-please... You.. Maybe.. You can do this one jutsu to make me speak the truth.. So.. You see.. You see...'' A tear rolls down her cheek as she looks at him.. No.. She had missed him to much. No way.. She was going to let him flee from her! * - Wed Dec  9 02:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks up at him, staring into his sharingan eyes.. A long time ago she'd seen this one... She smiles softly at him and then listens to his words.

''Why.. I left... I.. Got taken away.. By Hanae... She.. Took me on a trip to Konoha.. Where I was being held.. And.. I couldn't escape. They made me head of the hospital and I couldn't leave... I raised the children there.. That is why.. Akari might not recognize you.. I am sorry... But.. I could only return now..''* - Wed Dec  9 02:12:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her arms, lifting up the baby softly and placing him down on her lap. She leans her head against his and moves her hand up to point softly at Fujitora, as if directing his eyes.

''He's.. He is daddy... He is not scary... Mommy was just being bad that's why he got a bit angry.. But he isn't scary... can you say hi daddy? I am sure he would love it and that he would smile..'' She says with a soft warm smile on her face. But this was only because she was with her family. 

She then looks over at Paine. ''That was just back then. Don't be scared..'' She chuckles softly before looking at Akari, taking his hand and moving it up to guide him by the wave towards his dad.* - Wed Dec  9 02:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Then... Can you do it for me? Akari..? - Wed Dec  9 02:33:10 2015

''He's shy... DOn't blame him...'' She looks at her child before looking up at Paine and Fujitora again... Still a weird sight.. Some sort of demonic woman sitting on the couch, with a child in her hands.  She truly looked like the Angel of Death now.* - Wed Dec  9 02:40:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) had the child lifted up in her arms.. And well... The child knows Zenaki longer then today.. So throwing his arms at her was no smart idea.. Zenaki moves her head, grabbing his tiny arm and biting orcefully in it.. Piercing her sharp teeth in his skin.. And letting him bleed just a little bit... She then moves her hand up, pressing the boy on his neck with some rough force whilst bitting down on his arm. This would most likely KO them.. Because Zenaki knows exactly where to hit.. * - Wed Dec  9 03:24:22 2015

Poor poor child. She doesn't seem to respond to the others.. She places the kid in Fujitora's hands, moving her own hands on his arm and healing up the tiny wound of the child. * - Wed Dec  9 03:29:29 2015
