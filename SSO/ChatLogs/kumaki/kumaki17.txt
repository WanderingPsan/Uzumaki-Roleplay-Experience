<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) wakes up after a good long while in her own basement. Being bound down on several places. The back of her head was bleeding.. Her whole back was full of strains and hand marks. On her cheek i a hand mark, her ass, her neck and her thighs also had hand marks left.. All of them were forming bruises. In her neck, on her shoulder and on her breast are gigantic bite marks left.. Bleeding even heavily. Her wrist are both having strain marks from the rope that was around them. Along with a several other bruises and wounds on her body like nail marks in her thighs and inbetween her legs giant marks and bruises. This all happend thanks to the 'love' Beth had given her. 

She grunts out in pain as she moves her arms to push herself up.. ''G-Goddammit.. B-Beth..'' She grunts out with her sore voice.. Or well.. It was just not there.. It as even lower then a whisper. With a lot of pain in her body.. She somehow managed to stand up and walkover towards the stairs.. Once there she falls down onto her knees again.. Her shins slamming against the stairs. Zenaki once agian grunts in pain, panting from the pain even. It was horrible to make it upstairs.. But.. After ten minutes.. She finally made it. She opens the door and litteraly crawls inside of her house before falling down, panting from exhaustion and pain.* - Wed Oct 21 17:55:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes a deep breath, pushing herself upwards again.. Her body starts to shudder and shake again as she does so.. She takes a chair and pulls herself upwards, using different furniture to go towards the Bathroom.. There.. She opens up the shower.. Takes of her remaing clothing slowly and simply sits down under the shower.. Grunting and groaning with her muffled voice  as the hot water drips down on her body.. ANd onto the wounds.. It would fade the blood away from her body, making a slight puddly of blood underneath her. ''Mmmggnn..''* - Wed Oct 21 18:04:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her door, letting Reg go inside before closing it again and locking it.* - Thu Oct 22 21:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a slow time, sitting down on the couch. She moves her hand up, pointing at the kitchen. ''If you need something to drink.. There you can get some, help yourself.''* - Thu Oct 22 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time before scaanning her eyes along the room. There was water around the couch and different big blood puddles on the ground.
<Still need to clean it, it seems...>

''Alright, sit next to me. I will use you as example for it.''* - Thu Oct 22 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly before moving through a few handseals, a blue hue forms around her palms, like knifes.
''This technique allows you to litteraly cut through muscles... But. It doesn't affect the skin.''* - Thu Oct 22 21:12:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at her side, concentrating. 
''Hm? Something else?''* - Thu Oct 22 21:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Misa hm? - Thu Oct 22 21:19:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Ah I see. - Thu Oct 22 21:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Anyways the blonde Misa was also able to use snakes a medical technqiue to numb one of my friend's injuries. - Thu Oct 22 21:21:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I see. - Thu Oct 22 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: You know what, we'll just call the blonde one Mia, because there's two people named Misa that I know. - Thu Oct 22 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Hm.. Will do. - Thu Oct 22 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes for a small moment.
''As I was explaining, this is a jutsu to simply tear tendons and muscles. Very usefull in combat combined with taijutsu. And it hurts like hell.''
Her hand moved on his leg, cutting the muscle inside of his leg. He would probably not able to use it.. Now. And it would hurt like fucking hell.. Zenaki didn't care if people were hurt. 
* - Thu Oct 22 21:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: Dammit,. - Thu Oct 22 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) laughs softly as she hears him scream. Her hand moved away, allowing him to use that basic healing on himself. 
''Do you like it? The jutsu, that is?''

Not the Beth: They are sitting on the couch. * - Thu Oct 22 21:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Reguel(Airide) says: I do, it's not the charka enchanted strength I wanted, but it is something I would use. - Thu Oct 22 21:44:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: Oh you are a rude person. - Thu Oct 22 21:49:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side at Beth before looking at Reg. Her elbow shots out at his side, with quite some good force! 
''Answer politely. With your name.''* - Thu Oct 22 21:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response to Reg. She turns to look at Fujitora and then at Reg. Her hand moves in her pocket, taking a scroll and pushing it on his lap. ''You.. Should better leave hm.. Read it.. And then practice as hard as you can. I will ask about it later. Understood?'' 
She stood up and walks to the door, unlocking it for him and allowing him to go outside. Yep. This was no good if he stayed any longer.* - Thu Oct 22 21:59:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I want the scrollback. - Thu Oct 22 22:00:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) locks the door when Regual took his leave. She then walks over at the bedroom, only to find it locked. She closes her eyes, placing her hands donw on the handle and breaking through it. She then walks inside of the bedroom, closing the door behind her and leaning against the door to look at the two. Her arms folded.* - Thu Oct 22 22:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks a bit closer, sitting down on the bed next to Beth. She listens to her Masters words and simply closes her eyes. * - Thu Oct 22 23:04:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up at her Master for a small moment, before glancing over at Beth. She said nothing or did nothing.* - Thu Oct 22 23:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Master... Did you know... Her flesh is delicious...  - Thu Oct 22 23:30:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) chuckles softly as she looks at Beth, leaning a bit closer to her.
''I can surely take another delicious bite from you... I remember when you screamed out in pain.. It was so lovely..'' A faint grin curls on her face as she looks over at Beth. * - Thu Oct 22 23:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hey...Guess who else like biting.. - Thu Oct 22 23:44:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just keeps her distance a slight bit between them, looking at them. The grin curls wider on her face as she watches Fujitora doing his stuff.* - Thu Oct 22 23:45:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just stares ahead, grinning wide from pleasure. Laughing softly even. Oh this was sooo much fun to watch. The small tazer reminded her of her lovely little doll.. Who'd sadly vannished from the world. Her heart, though... Was still in her basement. In a jar just above her kitchen.* - Fri Oct 23 00:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just stares forwards as Fujitora simply punishes the shit out of Beth, she squints her eyes at him starting to grind up against Beth. She shakes her head slowly, closing her eyes. 
''Don't do that Master.. You'll make me jealous~''* - Fri Oct 23 00:44:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oh?..Does this make you want to punish her? With that whip of yours?..Hm?..She'd getting so much of my attention with her soft, soft skin~ - Fri Oct 23 00:47:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Beth(Ej900) says: -_- Bru. - Fri Oct 23 00:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks slowly closer towardss the two. To be honest. Her panties were slight wet from this scene. She sits down on the bed and move forwards wrapping her arms around him. She aims to pull him away, while giving him a soft kiss in his neck. ''Don't Master.... Master... You make me jealous... Stop that to do that to her and give me pleasure instead Master....'' Zenaki her hand moves down to unbutton his pants softly.* - Fri Oct 23 01:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: Hanae has came all over your master....Does this..Make you jealous?... - Fri Oct 23 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns her body, pushing Fujitore down on the ground. She leans in to kiss him on his lips. Her hand slides down over his body onto his boxers, rubbing over it oh so gently to make him even more hard. ''Mmm~ Master I will do anything for you... Beth had enough already hm~'' She says inbetween the kiss. She turns her gaze slightly to look at Beth then she closes her eyes, her hands slipping inside of his boxers to rub softly and getnly over his bare skin. ''Mmmmm~ I love you Master~'' 
Zenaki moves her leg, shooting it out inbetween the thghs of Beth, pressing down against her slit with some good rough force!
Ofcourse this made her jealous!!* - Fri Oct 23 01:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly in response''As you wish, Master..'', moving her body lower and using both her hands to pull down his pants and boxers. She lowers her head and presses a soft kiss on the tip of his rod before she feels her ass being squeezed softly by Beth. She allows it... Her clothing and everything was still on. 
Zenaki lowers her head, wrapping her lips around Fuji's rod only to twist her tongue around the tip and suckling on it to please him, using her tongue to please him more. * - Fri Oct 23 01:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) continues on with her actions to her Master before she feels Beth starting to try and slide her pants of. Wrong move.
Zenaki moves away from Fujitorea and moves in a quick movement over towards Beth, grabbing her wrist and pinning her down onto the ground. She glares down at her, gathering saliva in her mouth before simply spitting it down on her face. 
''Don't you dare to try and fucking please me. You whore. Nasty little slu. I fucking hate you for the way you fucking tortured me. And don't you fucking try to come inbetween me and my Master.'' She leans in. ''Be glad I didn't fucking kill you ff yet for all what you've done to me so far...'' Her hands moved, now starting to dig her nails into her wrists. She lowers her body a bit and aims to bite down in the shoulder of Beth, her teeth sinking into that flesh of hers!* - Fri Oct 23 01:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) bites down even harder in her shoulder, tearing the flesh almost of her body... The blood fills her mouth. She closes her mouth after, the blood still in her mouth. Her gaze looks over back at Beth again, blood running down along her chin. Her head moves over, pressing her own lips forcefully down onto Beth;s own, as if to kiss her. If Beth were to part her lips or not. Zenaki would forcefully pres the blood of Beth into her own mouth... So she can taste herself on a whole new level. If this had happend she moves herself back, grinning wide. ''So... You're delicious right~? I should perhaps take another delisious bite from you.. Eat you slowly... You're... So delicious...And you sound so freaking adorable when you scream out in pain...''
Zenaki leans closer to her shoulder again, piercing her teeth into the flesh again only to rip her flesh of completely. Zenaki keps the girl pierced down on the ground, eating the piece of flesh, litteraly, again! Raw and well.
''Mmmm~''* - Fri Oct 23 02:09:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Hm... - Fri Oct 23 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: The person within the basement I sense...Who is this?... - Fri Oct 23 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves to sit upon Beth, using her full weight to sit down on top of her stomach. She turns her head slightly. 
''Some dude that tried to rape me earlier. He is there now for a few days.. Probably starving.. I should check on him later on..'' She explains to him before looking back at Beth infront of her. ''Would you lik more? More pain and pleasure? I can grand it. I love your screaming, after all...''* - Fri Oct 23 02:26:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes, taking a deep breath. Nope. She movs her hand over, grabbing her hand gently, pinning it down to the sideof her body, outstretched. A senbond was taken and she pins itdown into her handpalm, into the ground. To prevent it from moving. 
 her other hand took the knife from her pocket, rather, dagger. She stares down at Beth and suddenly leashes out into her arm, tearing through her muscles.. She starts of right under her shoulder, taking it out and stabbing again, a few inches lower.. And again, and again.. All the way down over her whole upper arm towards her elbow.. And lower. With ehevery word she said, lower towards her wrist. Beth was not capable of using her arm for quite a good while!
''Once more....''* - Fri Oct 23 02:59:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) glares down, pushing the blade only deeper down before twisting the blade, cutting through her neck..Quite fucking deep, but barely missing the important vain. She moves the dagger to the side and presses it down in her other hand. She stares at her... Ofocurse. She would never kill Beth... But she should know her place. 
Her lips are flattened and her soulless eyes set down on her. She says nothing and simply watches her, listens to her if she were to talk more. 
Would she bleed to death? No. Zenaki would heal her just in time. But Zenaki was raging. Like hell... Nobody dared to ever tease her like this.. To ever fuck with her mind like this.. Why.. Why did she had to do that.. Out of all persons. 
Zenaki closes her eyes for a moment, listening to what Beth had to say.* - Fri Oct 23 03:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her hands up in a few seals, a green hue emits from her palms. She places it on Beth her neck.. Just to heal her up so she doesn't bleed to death.

''Goodluck.'' She says before moving to stand up, bringing the dagger towards her mouth to lick it clean from the blood. * - Fri Oct 23 03:32:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) shrugs her shoulders, then nods. She walks over towards her own house. The hospital was useless anyways. She opens the door and let the others go inside before walking in herself and locking the door behind her. She motions for the table. ''Take a seat.''* - Fri Oct 23 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) stares at Kilm as he lays down on the table? There are chairs next to it. She sighs softly. As if she was going to make a whole some sort of operation. 
''Sit down on a chair, place your arm on the table.'' She says as she walks over towards one of the drawers, taking two needles and six small bottles. Just tiny ones. Three for each of them. She walks back and waits.* - Fri Oct 23 19:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the both males, staring down at them as they sat down.
''Ofcourse I will..'' She responds to ZoleShe moves over and sits down on the chair next to the table. She takes Kilm his arm, using a rope to tug off the blood straim from his arm before taking the needle and placing it down in his arm, gently. She takes the three small seringes and clicks them in, one by one.. The seringes are filled with his blood. She shakes them for a small moment before placing them aside. She takes a gazuze and presses it down on the place where the needle is and pulls the needly from his arm. Her other hand now moved to take kilms other hand and place it on top of the gauze. Hold it for like five minutes and it should be good.''

She then turns her gaze over at Zole, doing the exact same process. After that done she takes the small seringes. ''Feel free to explore my house. I'm going to check this out.'' She says before walking towards a door, opening it up and closing it behind herself. She walks of into the cold basement. 
If they would follow her, she seemed to have vannished.* - Fri Oct 23 19:42:43 2015
