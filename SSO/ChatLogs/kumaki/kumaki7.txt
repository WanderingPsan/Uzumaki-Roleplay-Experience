<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) brings both her hand forwards, placing them down on his face. She smiles softly at him, hopefully to calm him down. She looks and inspects both of his eyes in particular. She says nothing as she inspects them. She then nods and sits down on the ground. Her dull eyes moved over towards the book she pulls out of her bag. She places it down on top of her lap and starts to search in it. Every specific page of the giant book. It has every medical thing in it, every anatomy, every dojutsu whatever. She moves to the pages with the eyes and inspect them. She looks up for a small moment as she was searching. She needs to find the right one. But. Sadly. It wasn't in there. She spits through the book, while eyeing Suitengu another small time.. 

''Hmmm..'' Her eyes closed as she thinks. What could it be. Meanwhile she closes her book and places it down.
''You see something different or.. Got anything on your body that looks different or feels different or something?'' She asked in a hushed tone with her eyes closed, still thinking. It could be anything. It was.. Just this rare that it wasn't even in her medical book. 
She then opens her eyes, knowing something. That must be it. ''Never mind that question. I'll read something up and search things. Don't worry about it. It's fine. But be carefull..'' She says with a soft smile as she pushes herself up again.* - Wed Sep 23 19:58:43 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) turns her dull and lifeless gaze and focusses it on Ushinawa. '' I know that...'' She responds once again before walking off. Zenaki doesn't seem to be herself at all. Not at all. The usual sadistic and not listening one is gone. Gone for now.. But how did that happen? Her eyes closed again as she walks on, expecting Suitengu to follow her.* - Wed Sep 23 20:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as her arm was grabbed. She faced him and her eyes dulled off again. In their newly lifeless state. She nodded once before moving her hand in her pocket. She takes her gathering scissors and hold them tight in her hand. ''Y-yes.. Master.. Let's go then..''* - Thu Sep 24 21:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kohaku(JustCallMeGromp) says: Yo. - Thu Sep 24 21:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods once in response after she'd listened to Fujitora. She follows after him and walks over at the herbs. Her dull and lifeless gaze turned towards Kohaku for the moment.. She awaits a response from Fujitora to her before she actually starts to gather the herbs.* - Thu Sep 24 21:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Greetings young one.. - Thu Sep 24 21:31:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) whispers: A few toys. - Thu Sep 24 21:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response to Kohaku before turning her lifeless gaze on the male. She listens to his whispering words and allows him to stroke through her white soft hair. She closes her eyes and nods in response..

She crouches down and starts to gather the flowers, leafes, whatever else. She gathers them slowly and is carefully to not cut them in pieces. She needs them still half alive and not broken down. A few jars are taken from her pouch as she fills them with the herbs.. Refilling them rather.

On each of the jars was written down where the herbs are for. Poison, health, chakra.. She opens the jars and places the herbs inside of it. A few bags are taken from her pouch aswell.. On those are aswell the same words written. As she was gathering, she places everything in the jars and bags. Everything sorted out nicely. 

She just kinda did this thing all over and over again, and again, and again. The female takes a deep breath in the meanwhile and sorts out everything nicely. As she kinda was gathering her supplies.

Once her jars and bags were filled she places themback in her pouch. She closes her eyes as she places her scissor back in the place where it belonged. Even in her bag everything was sorted out nicely. Poisons with the poisons.. Jars with jars..Bags with bags.. A small table.. Few daggers, senbon, whatever else she needed. * - Thu Sep 24 21:49:26 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) smiles softly as he wants it. A dull smile to say atleast. A forced one. Not a really meaning one.. She was busy.. With her gathering stuff. Her lips parted. ''M-More.. Experimenting. Huh..'' She says in a lifeless and dull tone as she looks up. She then moves her lifeless red eyes over at Sanoke, but stays quiet.* - Thu Sep 24 21:58:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) wakes up from her slumber or whatever she was doing. She moves her hand up and rubs in her eyes. She nods once. ''G-Goodmorning, master..'' She responds before pushing herself up. Her hand moved away from her eyes to stroke through her hair, as if combing her precious and beautiful white hair.* - Fri Sep 25 08:43:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the bandi in the hands of Fujitora. She moves her gaze and observes him from up to down. ''A prize...'' She says as she was hugged from behind. Her eyes closed before she eyes her master. ''Practice... M-Mhhmm..'' Her hand moved up agian to rub in her eyes. As soon as she was released she pushes herself up and takes her clothes, just to dress herself. After that she'd turn to look at Fujitora, waiting for him to lead the way towards the basement.

As a note for Sanoke: They are in the house. * - Fri Sep 25 08:57:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks down with her master and she looks at the chained up bandit. He was wiggling around and looked really unpleased. He was moving and tried to break free.
Zenaki's dull eyes wander over the male for a moment and nodded once in response to her master. ''You can watch, if you want to.."She responded as she walked over towards the table where her stuff was at the moment. She closes her eyes and takes a few supplies. She takes four senbon and walks back at the chained up bandit. 

''I never really smile..'' The female responds as she locks her lifeless but still really deadly gaze on the male. A wide grin curls on her visage. Her hand snap out at the males shoulders and legs. With this she completely paralyzes his body.. But he can still feel anything on it's person. She then walks around the table and takes the hands of the male. She snaps down each bone in each finger. Bones can he heard crushing through the basement. The sound of crushing bones echoing in her ears. It was a delicious sound. At the same time loud screams were released from the bandits mouth. More pleasure. Oh. She loves these sounds way to much. 

''don't worry…'' She starts to whisper to the bandit, closing in with her face right next to his ears. A giant grin present on her lips. ''It will not hurt that much as you think it does..''

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) was just kinda sleeping against the tree. She'd been working really hard. On her cheek was a bit of mud and her hands are also with mud, and even a bit of blood. Her lips were slightly parted as she was breathing through it. Her eyes closed and her cheeks slightly reddened. Her clothing was aswell dirty and muddy. What had she done? * - Fri Sep 25 18:03:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) opens her eyes slowly at the sound of the shout. Her dull and lifeless gaze moved upwards and locked on the girl. She then moves up her hand to rub once in her eye before pushing herself up. ''Leave me... I.. Need to gather more herbs.'' She responds before she proceeds to walk away.. As soon as she did that she starts to cough. A few good hard times.* - Fri Sep 25 18:10:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes as she feels arms being moved around herself. Her hands moved and she places them on the girls hand, moving them to release her. She keeps a stable stance on the ground. ''Dont touch me.. I'm fine. I a---..'' Starts to cough again a few times, turning around to lock her dulled eyes on her. ''Not sick..''* - Fri Sep 25 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time. ''I gathered herbs, cut open my hands thanks to that.. And just been outside a bit long.. Don't worry about me..'' She says in response in her dull voice. Her eyes wander off before she turns around again, walking off. * - Fri Sep 25 18:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods in response as she walks on. ''Cooking aswell, yes.'' She says in response. Her hands moved over on her black cloak and wipes it off. On the back was a sign.. But it had faded and her hair was hanging over it. Her eyes closed as she walked on. * - Fri Sep 25 18:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just walks on. She doesn't notice Suitengu ofcourse. ''No.'' She blankly responds as she walks on. * - Fri Sep 25 18:37:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) just walks on, ignoring Lulu completely. She had no time to talk to her.. After she was of the brifge she walks to the right. She crouches down and simply starts her research and gathering her herbs again. On the side of the water. She needs it for her personal use later on. As she was busy, she starts to cough once again, away from the precious plants. * - Fri Sep 25 18:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Suitengu(XenoKuthric) says: Aunt Zenaki. - Fri Sep 25 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks up from her busy being. As for note, her clothes are dirty and muddy. Her hands muddy and bleedy. A bit of mud on her face. Her dull and lifeless gaze moved upwards to look at Suitengu. She nods a time to him before she goes on with her stuff.

''Okay.'She simply responded as she walks on.* - Fri Sep 25 19:31:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) pushes the door open and slams it shut. Right before Lulu. She moves to sit down on the couch and uses the tsable to start and sort out her herbs.* - Fri Sep 25 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) doesn't open up. She needs to concentrate. * - Fri Sep 25 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) //
After she'd done anything and sorted out she places the jars in the drawers.

She sits down on the couch again and takes a scroll from her pouch and opens it. She starts to read it over and over again, taking the information in it in her mind. Meanwhile she makes the handseals needed for this particular jutsu she was going to train.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes abnd brings her hands down as Lulu walked inside. She places her hands down on her scroll and looks to the side. ''What do you want..''* - Fri Sep 25 20:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: O-Oh... Hm.. I gathered herbs.. And she followed.. Me..  - Fri Sep 25 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I.. Was practicing my jutsu just about now. - Fri Sep 25 20:54:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Oh? That's good then..I have some jutsu to teach you when you think you're ready. - Fri Sep 25 20:56:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Fujitora(Tre sanders) says: Once after, I'll let you ..Experiment on me..Consider it my way of trying to make you smile. Since...I am a virgin to torment and true pain..I may as well meet such eventually. - Fri Sep 25 21:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks over at her master, watching him performing the trick. 
''I.. Mainly use senbon.. Senbon are like needles and are just perfectly fitting in my hand.. It's usefull aswell for my medical knowledge because I can paralyze people with those.'' She responds as the shuriken are thrown. She never threw shuriken before to be honest. 

Her eyes closed and she turned her head away slightly. Her hand was brought up and she coughs in it a few harsh times. Her hands were bleedy and dirty. Some mud on her cheek and her clothes dirty from mud aswell. Yep, she'd been gathering herbs.
After the coughing she turns back again, looking at her master with her dulled gaze and flattened lips.

<And I need to be quick with those medicines... Otherwise I'll end up in bed again..> She thinks to herself.* - Fri Sep 25 21:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly in response. The only weapon she has.. Are her senbon. Her favourite. She closes her eyes and walks a bit backwards. Meanwhile her hand shove into her pockets. She takes threesenbon inbetween her fingers and throws them. There were actually sixe in her fingers. As she throws the senbon got sepereated and would pierce deeply into the tree. Zenaki takes a deep breath and sighs.. The coughing comes up again. She turns and coughs a few times. 

Her gaze turns back again to look at her master, nodding once. ''D-Don't worry about the coughing.. It's nothing.. Probably just a cold because of the mist here..'' She responds. Her gaz turns on the tree again. Her other hand moves into her pocket and takes out again sixe senbon.. She throws them once again towards the tree.. But this time it looked like there were only three senbon while there are six. They would pierce all six right into the tree. ''Mmm..mm... Something like tha---..'' The turns her face again, coughing. Ugh! She really needed to make those medicines quick again! Or just take them again. Her hand shoved into her pocket to take her usual medicines from her pocket. ''Something like that..?''* - Fri Sep 25 21:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at him and nods slowly. She turns her gaze away and locks it on the medicines in her hand. ''L-Let me take these please so I can..Go on..'' She says before she looks back at Fujitora again. * - Fri Sep 25 21:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods softly before taking out two of the medicines. She opens her mouth and places them on her tongue before swallowing them. Without water. She closes the small jar and places it back again. She closes her eyes. 
<Will do for now.. I need to think of better ones later on.>* - Fri Sep 25 21:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks at the techingue and watches him perform the jutsu from his hands. Then even fire was added on it. Fire hm... Zenaki closes her eyes for a small moment before looking over. ''I also have the fire affinity, but do not use it.'' She says in respnse to the fire show off.

''But then again, I do not have any shuriken.. And senbon is aimed to pierce directly and not to change course.'' She adds on later as she keeps an eye on the flying shuriken.* - Fri Sep 25 21:52:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the shuriken in her hands with the wires aswell. Her gaze moved up, nodding once. She takes a deep breath before taking the shuriken in her hands. She'd never thrown shuriken before.. This was going to be a challenge for her. Her hands moved up as she moves to throw the shuriken. With the wires attached to them she moves her hand to try and twist it in another direction. But instead it falls down on the floor.

Zenaki takes a deep breath and sighs once again. She pulls the wires to get the shurken back in hand. As soon as she got that.. She throws them once again, the wires going along. She inserts the chakra in the wires and pulls them back with a small tuck on the wire. The shuriken spins in the air and goes from behind into the tree. A small smile curls on her face, but it fades again a second later. ''There..'' She says before she looks over towards her side, trying to get approval from her master.* - Fri Sep 25 22:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks to her side and a small blush creeps up her face as her rear was patted. She closes her eyes for a moment. ''Experimenting.. Hm... I still have that bandit.. If he didn't die from pain yet.'' She'd say as she opened her eyes again. * - Fri Sep 25 22:07:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) closes her eyes as they walked inside, letting him lead. An arm was wrapped around her body as she is being embaraced in the house. Her eyes opened softly and she nods to him. ''Will do... But.. I.. Don't want you end up dying. You know. I can't promise you live with my experiments.'' She responds blankly. She was a medic. But experiments were experiments, high risk of dying.. After all.

''And I'll need supplies, like DNA from other shinobi, or animals.''* - Fri Sep 25 22:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods once in response to him. She'd then turns her gaze to the side. ''Aiming for... I guess just to test and power up people. I first didn't even want to become a medic.'' She says in response as she leans against him since he had her in his embrace.* - Fri Sep 25 22:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly in response. ''I had nothing better to do anyways.'' She blankly responds as she sits down on the couch. * - Fri Sep 25 22:45:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks towards her side. ''Eyes awaken?'' She asked in a cruious manner. She thinks back to her medical book. Her hand moved in her bag as she takes out a giant book. She places it in front of her down on the table. The giant book had like 2000 pages.. Or more. With every single thing written down in it. She moves her finger through the book, moving on towards the eyes. She opens it up and loks at him, now really curious. * - Fri Sep 25 22:55:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) moves her gaze back onto the book, searching through the eyes. She ends up by the sharingan and places her hand down on top of the paper. ''Found it..'' She says with a soft smile. She reads through it. ''Uchiha clan..Tomoe 1.. 2... 3... Hm.. Not much information.. Probably some clan secret stuff..'' Her eyes closed for the moment, turning her gaze back on the male before opening her eyes again. ''I.. Might try to help you out. What did you all try to wake the eyes?''* - Fri Sep 25 23:01:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) walks on towards their home. She opens the door and walks over towards the basement with all her medical supplies. She walks over towards the body of the bandit she did test on before. SHe inspects it and closes her eyes. A subtile smile curled on her face as she takes the body and places it down in the freezer.  She takes her dagger and cuts of a piece of the arm. She takes the arm and closes the freezer before she makes her way over at the table. She cuts the arm  in pieces, thowing the rests away. She cleans up everything before walking upstairs with the human meat. 

She closes her eyes and thinks about the question Kastune asked her earlier. Human meat on pizza? Why not. The smile faded into a smirk as she starts to make the pizza, covering it with the meat. Some vegatables, pizza sauce... And ofcourse the cheese. 

She places it in the oven and starts to bake the pizza. After ten minutes or so the female stands up again and checks on the pizza. Perfect. A smile curls on her face as she walks off with the pizza in hand. She places it on a plate and cuts it in pieces before walks to the exit and off towards the waterfall.* - Sun Sep 27 05:37:04 2015
