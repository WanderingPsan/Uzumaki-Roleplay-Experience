<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I'll be at the hospital. See you both soon. - Sat Dec  5 01:53:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) places the child in the corner.

''Akari. Don't you dare to wake up while I a working.'' SHe says sternly to the sleeping child before she walks over to one of the drawers, checking what all they had here.* - Sat Dec  5 01:59:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Studying, as per usual. - Sat Dec  5 02:09:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) was working and searching through the drawers. This.. Was not like her lab in suna. Nothing like it at all.. She doesn't feelcomfortable at all.. And she can't find anything. A loud sigh escapes her lips as she continues to look aorund in the room, gathering different kinds of herbs and placing them all down on the table. She then takes some knifes and different liquids, a bowl aswell and places everything down on the table. She then takes a chair, placing it against the table and she sits down on it.

She stares at the stuff she has...
''I need to.. Get more herbs... Perhaps a mission for one of the genin around will suffice..'' She mumbles to herself before looking up at Menma. She then raises a brow and shakes her head. ''Nop..'' 

A sigh escapes her lips again as she takes the herbs. She starts to cut everything in tiny pieces, carefully and all. She makes sure to get the right herbs. Hmm.. * - Sat Dec  5 02:19:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods slowly a few times in repsonse to Asteroth. 

''Aye aye... The DNA stuff I have to work on really hard still I noticed. So please let me work really well on that.. WHilst I make these. I can make drugs to paralyze and even kill. But also boost chakra, strength or speed. I can replenish blood if someone looses to much and all that kinda stuff.'' She explains as she was working. Indeed. The work with cloning and DNA and such was still very risky.. EVen for herself. Especially right now.

After cutting everything she places it in the bowl, juices and all that leaked from it. She then adds a special kind of liquid and then mixes everything together with the knife she just used. She then places a sieve over another bowl... Pouring the mixed texture in the sieve to get all the grove pieces out and leaving only a liquid. She places the bowl and the sieve to the side and then adds something small in the left over liquid. She then mixes it again and places it to the side. 

''Now we'll wau till it's all set. It will dry up and then we will have the pills..'' She looks up at Asteroth and gives her a soft smile.* - Sat Dec  5 02:33:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: wait* - Sat Dec  5 02:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) nods a time in response, smiling softly.

''T-Thank you.. '' She says as she was given a compliemtn and her cheek is softly being stroked. She then pushes herself up, walking over at her child and lifting him up in her arms. She then sits back in the chair again, handign the boy a leaf in his hands to play with while Zenaki closes her eyes. She was quite sleepy.. And they had to wait anyways for the pills. * - Sat Dec  5 03:26:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If you're going to sleep, do it within the safety of your home. - Sat Dec  5 03:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Don't worry about it.  - Sat Dec  5 03:26:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I might.. Just make myself a tad more comfortable here. Later on. - Sat Dec  5 03:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) notes the leaf is not dangerous or something. You can actualy eat it.* - Sat Dec  5 03:29:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) whispers: I don't know. I just walked.. In.. Actually.  - Sun Dec  6 00:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: I'd suppose. - Sun Dec  6 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: This village has more people than I expected. - Sun Dec  6 00:14:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What have you been doing for that day? - Sun Dec  6 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: That day?  - Sun Dec  6 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: This day, I mean. - Sun Dec  6 00:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: Uhm.. Studying and taking a small break from these crying children.  - Sun Dec  6 00:16:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That's all? Do you cook? - Sun Dec  6 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: I... Can cook yes.. - Sun Dec  6 00:19:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Mmm. No, I don't trust your cooking. Let's grab a bite. . - Sun Dec  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Zenaki(Kumaki) says: U-Uhm.. Alright then..  - Sun Dec  6 00:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) takes the menu and looks in it, she then looks up at Asteroth and then back at the menu.. WHat was.. The best...
Zenaki really likes her home made pizza. And she was very hungry.. But she can't order a pizza with such a femine beauty with her, her own mistress..

A soft sigh is released before she orders all different kind of stuff. She didn't care. She had enough money anyways; sushi, beef, salades, ramen and whatever else was very very delicious.. At the moment she just hopes she chooses the right things.. * - Sun Dec  6 00:31:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) hands the menu back to the waiter as he walked of to complete the orders.

She looks up at Asteroth and stays for a moment quiet as she was talking. She moves her arms anc places them down on her lap. 
''My.. Childhood and all? Uhm... Let's.. See.. I guess I had a happy childhood till most of my family deceased.. I.. Uhm.. At my age was like 12? I don't even really remember it. But well I was 18 and kind of became a shinobi of Konohagakure but I quit quickly with it.. Thanks to a sickness I had.. I still have it but I have medicines for it... Uhm..

That year I also met up with my brother, Zetsumo, again. You might know him as he once was a hokage himself. Further.. Thanks to him and my sickness I was forced into the medical field. I didn't like it at all. Not at -all-. But I found a way to enjoy myself in it. I became very skilled in it over time. Then... My brother died and I fell in love with Fujitora from Sunagakure. I went to Kirigakure and stayed there for a small time with him before going to Sunagakure. And.. There I parcticed and practiced more on my medical skill.. I know a lot already, but not enough yet. I have to study and study..

And.. With that actually I gave birth to my two loving children. And.. Then I got brought here to you by Hanae..'' A soft smile is on her face. ''I really enjoy the medical field now by the way..''* - Sun Dec  6 00:49:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks over at her side as the plates are dleiviered. She moves her hand in her pocket and takes her wallet, taking out the money needed and handing it over. She sighs softly and then looks back at Asteroth again as she smells the delicious aroma's.

''Uhm.. Yes I will.. '' She says softly in response before she starts to explain her family tragedy.. She doesn't remember everything from it to be honest.
''I.. Think it was some sort of attack. I really can't remember it. I thought I was the only one left until I found out about Zetsumo.'' She explains softly. She really can't really remember it. * - Sun Dec  6 01:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Zenaki(Kumaki) looks down at the food as she aswell takaes chopsticks. She gathers some food and stuffs it in her mouth. Zenaki was not the best.. Formal eater in the worlf. But she tries to for Asteroth. She eats and swallows the dish before she starts to explain her goals for now.

''U-Uhm... When I was young I really wanted to get rid of the sickness.. Which is why I became a medic in the first place. A pharamacist. I created my own medicines for it. Uhm.. But I really wanted to be on the battle field. But I simply couldn't. I learned to accept it.. And now let's see... I plan on study more and more become even more great in the medical field. I want to learn anything.. And ofcourse.. Ofcourse.. Uh..'' She stops for a small moment to lower her voice in a whisper. ''And ofcourse to serve you.. '' A soft smile is on Zenaki's face again before she starts to eat a bit again. * - Sun Dec  6 01:15:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks over at Asteroth as she was talking. She nods slowly in responseto her and then closes her eyes and later she opens them again.. She moves her chopsticks and takes something with it before she places it in her mouth to eat it. 

She then slowly nods slowly to her. 

''Finished merging...'' She repeats softly to herself. She then nods slowly again and looks back up at Asteroth. * - Sun Dec  6 01:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods slowly before she stood up. She walks over at Asteroth and carry's her off. towards the home of Asteroth.. Possibly going to the basement later.* - Sun Dec  6 02:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Oh.. - Sun Dec  6 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Finally awake? - Sun Dec  6 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: H-Huh.. Uhm.. Mhm...  I-I am sorry I fell asleep.. - Sun Dec  6 07:28:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) Asteroth says: Oh..
Asteroth says: Finally awake?
Claudette says: H-Huh.. Uhm.. Mhm...  I-I am sorry I fell asleep..* - Sun Dec  6 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: It is fine. - Sun Dec  6 07:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks at Asteroth and then down at her body. She shrugs softly.

''I don't know actually..'' * - Sun Dec  6 07:54:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: If you could, you'd have shown me. I wonder how large you'll be able to grow in bat form. - Sun Dec  6 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her hand up, rubbing over her nose. She then nods slowly to her.

''O-Once I can I will immidiatly show you..''* - Sun Dec  6 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: You'd better.. - Sun Dec  6 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Mhm... - Sun Dec  6 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What's on the agenda today? I've completed my studying. - Sun Dec  6 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: On the agenda... Uhm..  - Sun Dec  6 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: I.. Still have to practice some of my jutsu's and work on poisons...  - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: --Oh. I knew you made pills. - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: But poisons too? - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: What is in the works? - Sun Dec  6 08:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: At the moment I can paralyze people completely. Maybe even.. Uh kill them.. But I know I have to work on that aswell.  - Sun Dec  6 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: . .  - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: That sounds like boasting. - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Last time you bragged, you turned out not to be as good as you claimed. - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: Do you want me to show you? - Sun Dec  6 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: Yes. - Sun Dec  6 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Asteroth(Lordlol45) says: And have an antidote ready as well. - Sun Dec  6 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) chuckles softly and then nods. She moves her hand in her pocket and takes a senbon from it. She flicks it forwards and presses it in the arm of Asteroth. Wanted or unwanted. She want it to be showed. She gets it showed. 
Within a few seconds Asteroth would feel her arm getting completely numb, and her body slowly follows after.. From that side.. Arm to shoulders.. To chest to legs and finally the other arm. 

Meanwhile Claudette moves her arm in her bag to search around whole Asteroth is being paralyzed to find the antidote.. Ofcourse if everything goes accoordingly. * - Sun Dec  6 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) starts to chuckles softly again as her hand was swat away.

''Ah.. I am sorry I thought you voluntaired.. Mmh.'' She then moves her hand in her bag instead of later on, grabbing the antidote.. She hands the senbon with poison and the antidote over to her Mistress. * - Sun Dec  6 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: volunteered* - Sun Dec  6 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) takes a step backwards.. But she was hit in the ribs anyways! She feels the senbon enter her skin and pierce right along her bone ribs.. She grunts in pain.. And only a few seconds after the senbon had entered.. She would feel her legs go numb.. She was shaking slightly as if trying to stand on her legs.. But she would fall down.. And the rest of her body itself soon after followed, leaving her sit there like some sort of doll after barely 6 seconds. * - Sun Dec  6 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) litens to her mistress her words as she was just simply sitting there. Her eyes closed and her head hung forwards..Her long red hair covering mostly of her form. She then groans as the seringe was planted in her skin! It hurts like hell.. aagh! 

But ofcourse she can't really respond but groan to it.... A few seconds later, Claudette moves her body and her head, slowly looking up at her Mistress.. She didn't say anything in response yet. She looked like a total mess, some sort of zombie that just awoke from it's grave. 

''T-That hurts.. L-Like hell...'' She says softly as she slowly would move her arm to pull out the senbon, and said seringe. * - Sun Dec  6 08:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) pushes herself up, trying to regain her full strength again, which was there in no time.. With that Asteroth jumps on her back it seems like, arms arapped around her neck and legs around her waist. She releases a loud sigh before she walks outside again, time to look around for people.* - Sun Dec  6 08:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) simply walks inside. She was looking around for people whilst carrying Asteroth on her back. Where would they walk into?* - Sun Dec  6 08:55:53 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) walks inside of the house. There she would place the giant girl down.. Her legs were hurting like hell,.. At the moment. 
She then walks over to the closet, retrieving two towels and she places them in her bag. Meanwhile she let Asterth do as sshe would like to do, and eventually accept orders.* - Sun Dec  6 10:23:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) looks over at her for a small moment before shaking her head.

''Most of the time I was sick in bed and was working on my medical studies.'' She explains.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods a time, she throws her bag over her shoulder before walking off, taking Asteroths hand to walk to the shops. If ofcourse was allowed. If not they would just walk alongside eachother.* - Sun Dec  6 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods slowly in response before she looks through the suits... She takes a black one that will perfectly fit around herself. She pays it and places it in her bag before walking off with Asteroth again.

''There we go..''* - Sun Dec  6 10:53:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: A-Ah... is this one good enough or.. Another one..  - Sun Dec  6 10:55:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods slowly in response to Asteroth, looking down at her before she looks over the place. She finds a small clean spot and places the towels down there, neatly. The bag with whatever else Claudette needs was placed to the side. Her standard medical stuff was in it, along with poisons and antidotes. She just always has it with her.* - Sun Dec  6 11:09:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) nods slowly.
''S-Sorry...'' She simply says in response to her first blur..

She then takes her swimsuit aswell and goes behind a tree to redress herself, slipping of her cloak, corset, dress and whatever else she was wearing before slipping on her new swimsuit. It was more like a bikini. But attached to eachother with dreads and small pieces f fabric in a quite sexy way.

She then looks at the water as she was placing everything she just pulled of in her bag..
''Uhm... I can't think of any way.. I'm sorry.'' Claudette says in response.* - Sun Dec  6 11:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) follows the female with her head before looking down at her body. It was just a bikini? Oh well...

She sighs softly before she sits down on one of the towels. She opens her bag and takes a jar, a bowl, a jar with liquid, a scissor and some leaves. She then places everthing neatly down so she can work on her own things while her mistress was relaxing herself. * - Sun Dec  6 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Claudette(Kumaki) says: leafes* - Sun Dec  6 11:49:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) shakes her head softly. She then moves over to sit along side Asteroth before she aswell slides into the pool. Not to swim.. No.. SHe had gathering herbs with her. She goes down with her face aswell and decides to cut some plants under the water. She then moves up, out of the water and places everything  down at her place. She then walks with her wet body over at some other plants in the area. The water from the pool dripping down along her blue greyish skin color.. She coutches down as she starts to gather different flowers, plants, herbs and whatever else she needs.* - Sun Dec  6 12:07:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) was tottaly catched ofguard as the Kappa did attack her! The turtle frog like giant thing had pushed her down. She opens her eyes wide as the gross slobber trails would fall down on herface. She opens her mouth to scream out as she was dragged into the water, but quickly shuts her mouth and holds her breath as she was forcefully dragged into the water! 

As for a side note, Claudette was only wearing a simply bikini which was connected on some places with eachother with some frabric. Her very curvy figure very good visible in it. 

Down in the water she keeps her eyes closed and her breath hold in. She opens her eyes slowly to look at the Kappa. She'd seen it before. WHen she got captured! Oh god it was such a creepy thing!* - Sun Dec  6 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) opens her eyes wide as she is being grabbed on inpropiate places! She moves her body and aims to push him away instead! Zenaki was slightly stronger than the Kappa, lucky for her! But he was faster and would most likely strangle her down under the water surface. Thanks to her own movements it was harder to try and keep in her breath. She moves and moves! Struggles and tries to break from the grasp as his pelvis is pushed into her side. She opens her mouth to yell... But that was not smart. She spills the oxygen she had left with it, quickly closing her mouth as she tries to break free again! But thanks to her needing to breath she accediently breaths, under water! Just a tad bit!She shakes her head again, coughing under water after for as far as she can.

After a few more seconds struggling she simply passes out, which was most likely after 2 minutes in total. * - Sun Dec  6 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) is brought up on the surface again, once there she would take a deeep breath and cough harshly. She places her arms on the sides and keeps on coughing. Her eyes closed. At the moment she didn't even care that her bathingsuit was not sitting perfectly well. After some coughing she moves her head to the side, only giving a glare at Asteroth. She said nothing for now, just because she was once again interupted by her coughing.* - Sun Dec  6 13:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) moves her gaze down on the grass, coughing once again before her hand moves down to do her bathing suit.. She then pushes herself up slowly and she sits down on the water side.. She moves her hand up, coughing a few times more.* - Sun Dec  6 13:22:59 2015

''Claudette.. But call me Claud. Nice to meet you.'' The aura around Claud was made of pure evil, and would most likely make people around her uncomfortable, and people who are good or lawfull send shivers up their spine. Claudette's presence was surely to be noticed.* - Sun Dec  6 23:07:31 2015

''I am no shinobi but yes I live here.'' She explains to the new girl, she was not going to give away to mcuh information ofcourse..

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) shrugs her shoulders.

''I uhm... Use chakra yes.. But also traditional methods. Not everything can be healed with chakra.'' She explains. EVenthough healing was not her style at all.. She was forced to like it. * - Sun Dec  6 23:33:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shin(Yaori) says: Though it isn't much - Mon Dec  7 14:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Claudette(Kumaki) takes a deep breath and she releases it again. She listens to his explanation. Why the fuck was her even explaining a random jutsu to her while she didn't ask for it... Ah well... She closes her eyes and listens, while meanwhile concentrating a bit on her chakra to boost it. She has to show her mistress later on aswell of what she's capable of right now.

'' Small flames.. Got it..'' She says softly in response as she opens her eyes again to look at Shin, then over at the clone that was performing an example of what has to be done, inhaling oxygen and exhaling it in some sort of gas.. As the fireball is shot in it.. It simply enlights the whole sky! She raises a brow and places a small step backwards to not get caught by the fire. 

Claudette her demonic black eyes are set back on the male again, listening to his words. She nods slowly in response as he was explaining by every little subject.. she gathers the information. Not blow thi shit out when fire is coming her way.. Duh...

Conceal her poison? That's smart. She nods slowly in response... Why not mix the both? Poison and gas together... A deadly combination... Something to inhale when they would send a fire jutsu, the will paralyze them completely... But when they send out their fire.. The gas will explode aswell.. And then them being paralyzed? That's fucked up. 

She then shakes her head to not get drifted off the thoughts Mix her oxygen with fire instead of making a mixture of poison huh? He nods slowly in return to her own thoughts.. And if she was given the start signal she would move her hands up in said handseals, if there were any. She would inhale deeply and focus her chakra into her lungs.. She mixes up the oxygen in her body with the chakra of her own and then would blow out, forming a small ball of fog.. But nothing was really with it.. She would take a lighter and try to set it on fire. But nothing happens.

Claudette releases a loud sigh before doing the said steps again, making handeals if there were any, inhaling the oxygen and mixing it with her very own chakra.. She then would blow it out of her lungs Now the mixture starts to look a bit more like some sort of gas, instead of actual fog. 
Claudette moves her hand forwards, enlightening the gas.. But again nothing really happens.. Or maybe just a bit. The fire inside just gets a tad bigger then it would normally be.

She takes another deep breath, before exhaling it again.. This was horrific She sighs deeply and then decides to do it once more. She inhales deeply as she makes the handseals if any was needed. She closes her eyes and focusses on her chakra inside of her body.. She mixes it with the oxygen. You have to concentrate that it would be a tad more fire like instead of poison like. Her eyes opened again and then she blows out a big load of gas. She takes a step back from it to observe it.

She then smiles softly and looks over at Shin.. She motions for him to light up the gas.. As he did she takes a deep breath and takes a small step back again.. The gas would lihght up in fire! It was not as big and perfect yet.. But it did the work it was supposed to do!
''There..''
