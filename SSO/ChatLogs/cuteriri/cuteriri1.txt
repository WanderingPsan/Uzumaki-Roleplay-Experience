<br><font color=yellow>*Hozuki, Sirozan(XxkasukuxX) Sirozan begins wondering the outskirts of The Hidden Mist at dusk, Which his superiors tells him that it's dangerous, Blowing them off and begins looking for a massive water source, Since his village is running low on A hydratation liquid. He begins walking and thinking about the lectures he'll hear from his superiors when they hear he returns from outside the village, Before he can remember, he looks up and it;'ss very dark out thinking, "Well, I need to hurry before wild animals start thinking they can attack me..." after this statement he is very cautious walking about. Looking back and uses his peripheral vision to his advantage. After walking several minutes he gettings very bored and even considering returning home. But, this actually made him want to travel faster, he then crouches down and begins to scout a tree branch and locks on and releases his stance and goes soar towards the branch, then begins to get a rhythm taking one foot at a time on branch consecutively. He then hears something like someone following him, lashing out his kunai and attaches a wire on it and fires it's behind him as a trap wire. He then feels this same wire move and stops and gulps thinking, "As my predictions was right." and says in a calm voice, "Come out, I can tell your there...". He then gets into a basic fighting stance cleching his fists and yells, "COME ON NOW, YOU CAN'T HIDE!" then he hears a tree branch breaks close to him and his heart begins to beat very fast. The figure begins to appear from what of the dark with Sirozan's kunai stating, "This trap was successful, Your senses are redefined, But You Should have stayed home, Boy." Sirozan's teeth begins to clamp hearing, "Boy." He begins to walk from the darkness smirking, touching his headband and swinging Sirozan's kunai on a finger. He looks like clan from the Hidden Mist called "Hoshigaki" with a rogue headband and with rags on his back. Sirozan then comments on his headband, "I see your -where- from The Hidden Mist...?" with his guard on even more alert. The Hoshigaki then asks, "That trash of a village? Psshh, Anywhere is better then there..." Sirozan then jumps down from the tree on to the ground with the Hoshigaki following him. Sirozan then thinks, "He's following me so he must be a lethal threat...I have to attack off-guard so i can continue searching." The Hoshigaki then pulls out a jar from his kunai holster and begins to consume the contents of it saying, "Ahh...That's goood water...Now, This is what's going to happen. Your going to give me all your suppiles or Die...or, i can rob you AND kill you." with a maniacally laugh. Sirozan says, "You won't do either you punk!" and picks up a giant stick the size of a 4x4 and perpares to attack the Hoshigaki. The Hoshigaki then throws the jar to the ground and shatters it perpares a defense. Sirozan then begins swinging the stick violently with relatively ease matching the Hoshigaki's stolen kunai. Sirozan then props up the stick on the ground and throws his body weight into a kick towards the Hoshigaki's gut. The Hoshigaki then wipes the blood from his mouth and leans up and perfroms some handseals and shouts, "Water Style : Water Clone Technique!" then punches the clones expelling all of the water onto the ground. Sirozan suprised kneels down and uses his finger to lick up some water and he starts to sulp it up saying, ' AHHHH! Water taste so good...This is going to be clockwork now!" then his muscles begin to pump alittle with every sip. The Hoshigaki then tells Sirozan that he better look up and Sirozan sweepkicks The Hoskigaki, The Hoshigaki is suprise by his speed and elbows his jaw and begins to start flying backwards. Sirozan then grabs his stick and begins to walk and stops to zooms into the place he elbowed The Hoshigaki, barely hereing the Hoshigaki annouce his Water Style : Great Exploding Water Colliding Wave trying to outrun it then getting hit dead on to the back,"W-What..NOOOOooo..."when the blast settled he found him self inside a bubble of water. The Hoshigaki then pops up with a ripped shirt and taking deep breaths looking fatigue saying, "I underestimated you, Now it's time to see the real power of the Hoshigaki Clan!" rushing into the floating injured Sirozan perform and landing harsh connecting chains of combos with very loud grunts then Hoshigaki says, "See you are weak, Hidden Mist trash..Should have stayed home child, Heh.." Sirozan then begins to wake softly saying, "Well....I told you wasn't going to kill me...or rob me......NOW TO KEEP MY PROMISE!" with a electric voice. With Sirozan's rage on a new peak his body begin to liquify and he comments on his teeth saying, "My Teeth...I'll Rip You Apart!!!!" The Hoshigaki then is stunned by his transformation. Sirozan races towards the Hoshigaki and throws everything at him with bashing combos connecting and breaking every move the hit touches. Sirozan then picks up the nearly dead Hoshigaki and states, "You gave me a fight i thought i wasa going to lose...Thank you, For this Great Fight, But you have to die...But, Before that. I'll tell you my name, I am Sirozan from the Hozuki clan, Hozuki, Sirozan!" he then tosses the almost lifeless body of the Hoshigaki then, soaks up the water like a sponge. Then, swims up towards the sky and goes shuffling into his pockets and hosters thinking, "It's -gotta- be in here..." and then opens a pocket wide and finds a underwater lighter saying, "Yes, Now I can finish this." after he flickers the lighter and surrounds it in a small water bubble putting one hand on the bubble performs couple of handseals and shouting, "Water Style : Water Dragon Bullet!!!!!" a large amount of water formed into a giant, powerful dragon with the underwater lighter infused into the water is rushed at the almost-lifeless Hoshigaki the size of a large oak tree is expelled into the  Body of the Hoshigaki causing a large devasting wave of water covering alot of the forest with a small explosion of the underwater lighter inploding. After the water settles, He slowly floats down reverting from his Water Hydration Technique, Looking at the now officially lifeless corpse, with complete white eyes with -no- iris. of The Hoshigaki. Sirozan didn't waste no time giving the Hoshigaki pity and limped and buckled towards the Hidden Mist Village with required water inside his body.*

Lightning Seals: This character is capable of completing strings of handseals within a few seconds so long as it doesn't extend beyond ten handseals. Anything more can completed in half a minute. 

Lightning Reflexes: This character's reaction speed is impeccable. They can contend with a gate user within the first four gates and dodge a number of their strikes. They can dodge large projectiles at close range, though they are incapable of dodging consecutive weapons; and fighting a gate user of the fifth gate forces them to block a number of strikes, as dodging becomes harder consecutively. 

Strength: This Character has a great deal of body power. Their physical power is more than just impressive. Their strikes are capable of rattling bones, and an unguarded strike can break bones. This character has enough strength to take on medium sized beasts such as those who are summoned via contract on equal grounds. Note: This perk is not compatible with Oukashou or any other strength replacing techniques.

Tailed Chakra: This character's chakra pools are so immense, that it can match that of a tailed beast once matured. An untrained student easily has the reserves to match an untrained jounin. The character with this perk's reserves appear endless, at times, and once they've hit the rank of jounin, their chakra levels easily tops that of the average kage. The chakra pool pushes the character four untrained ranks upward when they are untrained, and five untrained ranks when they are indeed trained.

<br><font color=yellow>*Sozen(Radori3) Heightened Reflexes: This character's reflexes are even more impressive than that of a character with the reflex perk. They are capable of dodging projectiles at medium range, and are capable of trading blows and blocking effectively with fast characters. 

Speed: This character's speed is amazing. They can move like the wind, and breeze by the competition with ease. 

Blinding Seals: This character can complete up to thirty handseals within a minute.

Will of Fire: The Will of Fire is found in Konoha Shinobi who embody the fire that drove the ancient Senju Clan to greatness. They never give up on their philosophy, and have the strongest resolve. They fight on, and will never give up, finding the will to fight even after their body has failed them. They are capable of rising to fight against once after they've been defeated. After they've been put down a second time, their body will no longer move, until they have been healed, though this rarely stops them from trying

Exotic Weapon Proficiency: This character can handle a number of exotic weapons that don't have a specific perk set to them.*

<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) shrugs and simply stares into the fire. "Go away." she said.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) places her hands on her hips. "And if I don't?, she said.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Then i'll just walk away.

<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) raised an eyebrow, seeing the blood drawn  all over Jenah's face. She had seemed fairly familair to her, however she could not put her finger on it. "You look.... Familair....", she said, but then she shrugged of the dejavu she was experiencing. "Anyway, what happened to you? Were you attacked? I wish to help you."*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Go away. I do not want your pity.

<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Now leave.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Oh really? So I suppose you got permission from the Mizukage? And you look a little young to be claiming to be a hermit..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: And hermits aren't usually out in the open where people can see them.
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) slowly stands and begins walking off, her sword over her shoulder as she shrugged.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) epic follow.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) comes to a stop. "Go away." she said once more.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Nope.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I won't.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Do you want my sword? Is that what you want?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No, I don't want anything of yours. I just want to bring you back to Kiri and treat your wounds.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Just leave me the hell alone. Take whatever the hell you want.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I don't want anything...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I want to help you
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) holds the blade horizontally against her own neck, beginning to walk. "I dare you to follow me." she said.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Fuuu-
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) follows.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: If your going to do it.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Then do it..
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) slams her blade into the ground and glares at Karina.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: That's what I thought.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Th.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Tch*)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: If you're going to rape me, then just do it. Get it over with.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: What the fuc---
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Who said anything about rape?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Can you just leave me alone?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I've said it plently of times now.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I want to help you.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Just get the hell out of here.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: You shouldn't meddle into other people's affairs.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Not until you come with me so I can help you.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Not like I care.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Then fuck off.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: You need help, and I am here to offer it.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: And I decline it.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Bitch, who you think you talkin to.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (omit)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Get out of my fucking face.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Your curses aren't going to make me not want to help you.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: You're just a slutty bimbo.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Get out of here.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Riiiiight.
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) begins walking off once more.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Says the girl who's breasts are half explosed.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Says the one who shows her legs off.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I can do this all day.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I can pretty much see your ass.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Bitch.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Not really.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Since I have shorts on.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Shutup. Let me see.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: What........
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: They're booty shorts.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I know this.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Watch.
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) motions over to Karina and falls to her knees, staring at the booty shorts.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: ....
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) moves back.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: And your point?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Now that you know i'm a creep, walk off.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: That doesn't matter.
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) begins walking away once more. "Not that you're even cute." she said in a mutter.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I still want to help you.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: You're kidding me right now..?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Get used to it.
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) begins climbing up the tree with her excess strength.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Staying up in the tree won't help you.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Get out of here, bimbo.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No..
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) throws a kunai at her face.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) moves to the right, completely avoiding the kunai.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Attacking me won't help either.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Just get the hell out of here..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Before..before..I rape you!
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Yeah..I'll rape you!
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I won't mind. As long as it means I can help you afterwards.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Are you a lesbian?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Maybe, but that's besides the point.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: We can do this all day blonde.
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) jumps down from the tree, bending her knees as she did so. "..Fine. Let's go." she said, attempting to slap Karina across the face with her almighty strength and make her hit the ground. "..That's for annoying the fuck out of me." she said gently before she moved over to Karina and leaned over, lifting her in her arms as she began skipping off to Kirigakure.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (uh)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (you slapping me while coming down?)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ Yeah. ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ q.q take it omg. ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (i dont wanna D:)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ i wanna bitch slap my enemy icly ]
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ just do it so we can hold hands while we recover. ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (why am I your enemy >:l)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ because you're a hoe ]
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ :) ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (im not >_>)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ -_- ]
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ My slut? ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (uh)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (k)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ k ]
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) watched as Jenah came down from the tree, she quickly did a fast backflip with her speed in order to avoid her attack. She wasn't doing anything lethal, so she saw no reason to perform a counter attack. "What the fuck... Now I get attacked for trying to help you?", she said, placing her hands on her hips a bit annoyed from the sitation.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ Wow. x-x ]
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Let's go, slutbag.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (wat)

<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Now.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Tell me.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: What happened to you? And why is there blood on your face?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Let's go inside.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: What.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Inside where?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..A house?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Are you that blonde?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Fine..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I was raped.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Bottom line.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I blame the stupid infant Kage.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: He sat there and allowed it to happen.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (you srs?)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (if so, im killing him....)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (or well, going to try...)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ I'm making that apart of the story, ya ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (k0
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (rping)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [kk]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (you know....)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (this all gives me even more of an ic reason to kill him...)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (because he has been icly spying on me and taking pictures of me...)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ wow lol ]
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) facial expression turned to a angry one to a depressing one. She took a wild guess on what happened to her, however she had no idea it would be true. At the sound of it being the Mizukage's fault, an angry expression came over her, she clenched her fist with the utmost madness within her. "Are you.... Serious?",she asked. She need confirmaiton of what she was saying was true.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ sick ass x-x]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (ikr)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Yes..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Who raped you? Did you see what he looked like or who he was?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Three black men..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: .........
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: -sigh-
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Y-yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: You understand why I was such a bitch.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Look, i'm sorry if I acted a bit mean before..
<br><font color=yellow>*Yushiki, Sanada(Takakashi z) summons trinity with the "Bish come here" Flashlight!*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Yeah, it's alright..
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) slowly stands and makes her way over to Karina, opening her arms up to give her a long, compassioante hug. "..I'm sorry." she softly said.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) was embraced within Jenah's arms, her face was still filled with rage for the Mizukage. "It is alright...", she said. "I will make the Mizukage pay...."*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) pulls away slowly, wrapping her arms around Karina's neck as she looked into her eyes and slowly leaned forward, giving her a soft peck on the cheek. "..You're brave and..you're just like when we were younger..you always stood up for me..and I truly couldn't ask for a better friend than you..It's Jenah." she said slowly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Oleic(Oleic) What's this verb do?*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) felt the soft tap of Jenah's lip on her cheek, a bit of confusement befalled her. At this point Jenah was seeming more and more familair to her the closer she got, it was like they had been friends at some point. Hearing the words and just listening to the way she was speaking, Karina suddenly knew who it was. "Jenah.......", she said, a slight tear forming under her eye as she quickly wiped it. She placed both of her arms around her, so very happy to see her friend once more, hugging her tightly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) gently smiles as she feels Karina's hug tighten. "..I missed you.." she said softly as she hugged her as tight as she could, closing her eyes slowly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) closed her eyes to hold back her tears, "I missed you too Jenah... Where have you been all my life?", she asked. Continuing to hug her.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..T-that's a cute pickup line, Kariri..Hehehe..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Heh...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: But I really mean it...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I haven't seen you since I was a genin....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..I know..I..It..was bad..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..T-trust me..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: And you were an academy student...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..I..got beat alot..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: By who?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Alot of people..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I was sold like a sex slave..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..All because of him..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: The Mizukage?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Y-yes..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Don't worry about him anymore...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: He will be taken out of the picture soon...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: B-But...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I have fought him before...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: He is not to be taken lightly....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: -sigh-
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I might need to train a bit..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Let me help you..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: You want to help?
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) nods slowly. She slowly lifted Karina with ease into the air. "I'm strong.." she said gently.*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Heh....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Alright..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: You can help...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Yay..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Maybe I can teach you something....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ...Oh..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Come with me....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..O-okay..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: You remember how I wasn't really good with using jutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Well, I haven't been sitting around doing nothing while you were gone... (rping)
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) closed her eyes and took a deep breath looking at the large tree infont of her. She held out her right palm down to her side, a small orb of chakra appeared. Almost instantly, the small sphere grew to a much larger size, the spherical ball of chakra rotated in multiple directions at once. The ball reached to about the size of a small soccer ball, as she ran towards the tree with her right arm stretched towards it.

"Rasengan....", she murmered as her arm quickly moved towards the tree, small waves of chakra illuminated from behind her. Upon coming into contact with the tree, she was able to blow a large chunk of wood out of it, leaving the tree looking like it was about to fall over any time now.. *
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I created this jutsu to make up for my lack of talent with hand seals....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..W-what..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I think if I can teach it to you, we can bring down the Mizukage....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I'm stupid, Kariri..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I can't learn that type of stuff..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Heh, you sound like me trying to learn a hand seal jutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Hehe..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Two peas in a pod..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: However...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: If we are going to kill the Mizukage.... We both still need to get stronger...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Yes ma'am..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Heh, call me Kariri.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Kariri.~
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Are you sure you don't want me to teach you the jutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..If you want, I will try..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Well alright...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Just for you..and because I get to see your nice butt while we're learning..~
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) giggles gently.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: i'm*)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: It will take three simple steps to learn it...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: You can either begin the first step now, or we can begin tommorow.
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..We should begin tomorrow..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I'm still abit..beat up..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Alright...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: You should get some rest Jenah...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Y-yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: I'll go rest..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Alright...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I will watch over you..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: And I promise....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: I will never let anything happen to you again.....
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..T-thank you..
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) gently leans forward and gives Karina a soft kiss on the cheek once more.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) smiles as Jenah gave her a slight kiss. She grabbed her by the hand and began walking, "C'mon, let's go find you a place to stay."*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Okay..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: This will do...
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Y-yeah..it will..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: ..Sleep with me?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: If you want me to I will. 
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) lays down on the bed and pats the area beside her. "..Okay.." she said gently.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) takes her shoes, holster, and head band off as she climbs into the bed.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: giggles gently and looks at Karina, stripping herself of her shoes, her sword and heaband.
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) wraps her arm around Jenah as they both layed in the bed, she hugged her body tight and pushed her face up against her neck. "I really care about you Jenah...", she said as she closed her eyes.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) gently smiles and holds Karina tightly, she looked into her eyes and nodded slowly. "..I know..and I really..care about you..Karina.." she said softly, kissing her neck gently over and over, giving her a dozen kisses before closing her eyes gently.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) giggled a few times softly as her neck was tickled with Jenah's kisses. She returned the favor by kissing her on the neck a few times while keeping her eyes closed.*
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Hehe..that tickles, Kariri...
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (omg)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (your icon)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (D:)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (is the bug back? D:)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: Hehe..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Hehe..
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Is this your way of being seductive, Kariri!?
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: No, I just almost forgot hwo soft your skin was....
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: how*)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ don't talk on ooc shh. ]
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ act afk to everyone lol ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (my ooc is off lol)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (omfg)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (the bug is back....)
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (i just saw someone get hit with it...)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ omfg ]
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: Oh..
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (Q_Q)
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) softly rubbed her warm skin against Karin's skin, hugging her tightly as she began kissing her neck gently, nibbling and licking her neck very softly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) moaned gently as Jenah tickled her even more with her kisses and licks, sending chills down her spine. She bit her bottom lip and began doing the same to Jenah's neck. Softly kissing it and giving slight licks.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) lightly shuddered in a gentle, loving moan. "Mm.." she giggled softly, her eyes closing as she lowered her hands to Kariri's plump ass, gently squeezing her soft piece of meat. "Mmm..you have such a nice ass.." she said gently.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) smiled as she bit her lip, jumping a little from Jenah squeezing her somewhat small cute ass. "Hehe, it's nowhere near as good as yours.", she seductively said, placing her right hand on Jenah's ass and beginning to rub it softly while sucking on Jenah's neck to give her a nice hickey.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) giggles gently, her ass being rubbed gently, causing her to gently purr. "A-awh..my neck..that feels so nice, Kariri.." she gently moaned as she leaned forward and began suckling on Kariri's neck to also give her a nice, big hickey.~*
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (lolwut....)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ He spammed. ]
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ on ooc ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (oh)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: [ lol ]
<br><font color=green>*Karina(Trinity606) says: (lawl)
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) moaned a bit as she felt Jenah sucking on her neck, giving her a hicky that would be very noticable when she was done. She moved her right hand up to Jenah's face, also moving her face up to Jenah's as she begins kissing her soft ebony lips with her own. Her tongue protruded from her mouth and into Jenah's as she began to play with her tongue, moving it around and softly rubbing her pussy up against Jenah's.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) giggles gently and meet's Karina's face, leaning forward to lick her lips, her purple glossed lips meeting Karina's as her mouth opened gently, alowing her tongue to portrude from her lips and enter Karina's mouth, gently tugging and sucking her tongue and mouth, having very much fun with her mouth. She purred gently and slid her leg inbetween Kariri's legs, rubbing her pussy directly against Kariri's pussy.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) moaned gently as Jenah began sucking on her tongue, her juicy saliva spilling into Jenah's mouth as they played with each other's tongues. Her pussy began to leak as they both came into contact with each other, her panties under her pants becomming a bit wet. Placing both hands on each side of Jenah's face she began biting down on her bottom lip while kissing her, closing her eyes and enjoying her. "Mmmm, you taste so good..", she said while continuing to enjoy Jenah's kiss.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) 's juicy saliva began sharing and collecting with Karina, diverting between omuths as if it were a link. She purred gently as her pink panties began getting wet as she rubbed against Karina, her pussy wettening up on her as she began nibbling on her tongue as she suckled it down. "Mmm.." she purred out, letting out gentle moans as she closed her eyes slowly.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) no longer could resist herself, she wanted to make Jenah moan even more. She moaned gently as they continued to kiss, she seemed to taste better by each passing second, and she didn't want to stop. She moved her right hand slowly down to Jenah's body, making her way to the front of her pants and rubbing on her pussy through her pants slightly, sliding her fingers up and down rubbing it lightly, feeling the juicy wetness that was coming from it.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) continued to kiss, slurping up her juices as she giggle gently but then widened her eyes, letting out a deep, loving moan into Karina's mouth. "Mmm..m-my pussy.." she purred gently, her pussy beginning to juice up in Karina's fingers as her eyes gently closed.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) giggled a bit at Jenah's words. She retracted her face from Jenah's lips, a long line of saliva being left behind that Karina quickly licked up with her tongue from Jenah's chin. She made her way to Jenah's boobs, which were nice and plump. She popped open Jenah's shirt to reveal her large ebony boobs and her nice brown tits. "These are nice...", she said, beginning to grop them with her left hand. Her right hand slowly made it's way inside of Jenah's pants and now her finger were rubbing up against Jenah's panties, getting a better feel of her wet pussy. She did the same thing and slid her fingers up and down on her panties, arousing Jenah as much as possible.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) widened her eyes and watched as her jacket ripped open, her large, brown tits. She purred gently looked up at Karina, winking gently. "..Just for you.." she said softly, letting out a deep, audible moan as Kariri groped her titties, squeezing those marshmallows with ease. "Mmm..Kariri...my titties.." she said gently before she began cooing deeply at her pussy being rubbed, her eyes closing gently as she took her left hand and cupped Kariri's crotch, beginning to rub against her pussy with each, running her finges up and down her slit.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Karina(Trinity606) smiled at Jenah's words, she placed her face up against one of Jenah's tits and began sucking on one of her brown nipples. She couldn't resist how juicy and plump her tits were, and could no longer help herself. She sucked on it and began using her tongue to make swirls around it to stimulate Jenah even more. Her pussy began getting even more wet as Jenah began rubbing it from her pants, "Mmmmm.", she said, continuing to suck her tits while finally sliding her hand into Jenah's panties fully, running fingers up and down on her bare clit, her hand becomming soaked with Jenah's juices.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) blinks gently as she walks up to the Kazekage. "Kazekage..could you please help us begin training now?" she asked.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) let out a hefty chuckle. "Indeed. Here." he said, tossing Jenah a two scrolls. "Begin learning how to perform these two techniques. Sign the first in blood and then the other will teach you a new technique." he giggled gently.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) nods confidently. "T-thank you, Akahoshi-kun!" she said brightly as she grappled onto the two scrolls. She then walked off to do her things.*
<br><font color=green>*Akahoshi(Axdudexx) says: (The jutsus are Ninken and Earth Dome)
<br><font color=green>*Jenah(Cuteriri) says: (ooh..okay! )
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) smirks gently as she opens up the first scroll. She cut her finger with a kunai and allowed it to drip blood. She then blinked and looked around, smearing her blood onto the paper where the other names were. She began writing her name in the blood, coaxing it entirely as she wrote out her entire name.

Soon after, she formed the bond she needed with the dogs!*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) tosses the first scroll into Akahoshi's desk as she takes the second and begins scanning it through entirely. She lifted her hands and began going through a series of handseals, as if trying to complete them vigorously. "Mm.." she gently giggled whilst closing her eyes.

She then began performing the handseals over and over, attempting to perform them and memorize them.*
<br><font color=yellow>*Jenah(Cuteriri) continued by lifting her hands, beginning to go through the handseals once more..and when she had gotten them down, she took it under her wing to come to a halt on the final one, looking about before she looked toward the scroll. [2]

After performing the handseals, her chakra would begin to pile up, converting and mixing together into one intertwinable element while her chakra points began piling off to her center, clumping up masses of chakra together. [3]

Jenah gave off a gentle sigh inbetween her teeth as she lifted her hands once more, going through a series of handseals that ended by holding the final handseal, looking onto the scroll with fierce confidence. After this, she began moulding her chakra, morphing and altering it in her inners, trying to take it and create a new mixture.

When this was complete, she had finally gotten enough gathered chakra to perform the technique. She pressed her heel outward and clamped it on the ground, rotating her body as she slammed her right palm on the ground, allowing the ground underneath her to rise out of the ground uncontrollingly and create a dome of rock around them, pebbles wrinkling down from the newly formed rubble.*
