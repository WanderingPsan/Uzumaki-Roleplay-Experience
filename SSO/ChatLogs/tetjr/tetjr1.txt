<br><font color=yellow>*Kuol(Tet. Jr) took hold of his thread and needle. - He was going to create a work of art. The boy's face remained blank as his focus had been comepletely on creating a robe that had come to mind. He wanted to create something light and smooth to touch. - As a traveling tailor, his only dream was to sell his art and become the best known Tailor of them all! A smile would usually come across Kuol's face but at this time, smiling is only a distraction. 

He slides the thread through the needle and begins to form his base. - The collar. It was a fur of some sorts. Without any fur, Kuol used the softest yet strongest thread he had and mimic'd the properties fur would usually have. It was a simple procedure. Take each thread and drive them into each other. The results being a soft and fluffy 'fur' collar.

The sight made Kuol want to kiss his fingers! "Mwuala!" He exclaimed within his mind. - A slight windy breeze brushes through his hair. A perfect mood for the perfect robe!

Kuol quickly grabs hold of his trusty knife and cuts at the white thread, quickly sliding in a greenish tan thread. It was time he finished off the robe by creating the torso area.* - Mon Nov  9 23:25:52 2015
