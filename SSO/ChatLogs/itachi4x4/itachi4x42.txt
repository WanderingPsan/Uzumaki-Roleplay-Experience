<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) was pushed..

More abuse from Kariudo!* - Tue Dec  8 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: .............. - Tue Dec  8 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I didn't even push you hard, how are you that far away. - Tue Dec  8 12:50:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) exaggorated!* - Tue Dec  8 12:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) stood in his usual spot. Both his hands are tucked away with his pants and his usual zanbatou is hitched to his back. His eyes are subtly closed and his breathing is paced, for the first time in a while he was just relaxed.* - Wed Dec  9 08:05:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) 's eyes crept open and fell upon the bubble just before it was popped. Tsubasa had nothing against training, but it was weird that Kariudo was the one to offer such a thing. A hesitant expression forms on his visage as he spoke. "Uhh, okay. Sure, why not.."* - Wed Dec  9 08:09:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) followed behind her.* - Wed Dec  9 08:13:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) didnt' really care where the ended up, it's not like they were on a life or death mission and trying to escape the enemy lines.

"Yeah, you could say that. I can hold my own with just my fists though." His voice isn't the same for some reason. It's less hyperactive than usual and his facial expression only added to the serious vibe. If anything, he was more calm and collected than usual.* - Wed Dec  9 08:18:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) shook his head and shrugged. Tsubasa didn't mind training, that didn't mean he took the initiative to do it. "Nothing."* - Wed Dec  9 08:21:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You think you can take me on with all these arms? - Wed Dec  9 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: No, but I'm still willing to give it a shot. - Wed Dec  9 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Right okay...no sword, no ninjutsu? - Wed Dec  9 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) squints a bit.

"I rather you not hold back at my expense. How else am I supposed to make progress?"

He pulls his right hand out of his pocket and reached behind his back, clamping on to the hilt of his zanbatou. With relative ease he'd unsheath it and chuck it off to the side, showing that he agrees to the terms of 'no sword'.

Tsubasa wasn't sure whether or not Karuida was aware that he had absolutely no Ninjutsu, but that didn't really matter. He supplies a slight shrug and turns to face the female, preparing himself.

"Whenever you're ready."* - Wed Dec  9 08:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) was planning to work on his legs. His idea of a perfect fighting style consists of: all elements of Taijutsu, all elements of Kenjutsu and the proper speed and strength to back those two elements up.

With Kariudo aiming to thrust her leg forward, Tsubasa retaliates with his own leg shooting forth. The intent was clash shins with her, hoping that his own strength and durability would catch Kariudo off guard. Course, he did hold back some for the sake of dragging this spar out.

With all six of her arms aiming to unleash an onslaught on him. Tsubasa answers with the only option her had. He uses his left hand as a guard for the initial punches while cocking his right arm back at the elbow and clenching a tight fist. While his left arm took the blunt of her onslaught, even though she did land some of the hits, he'd unleash fire off his own blow aimed just above her right breast. He didn't want to hurt her so he did hold back on this attack --- at most he planned to stun her.* - Wed Dec  9 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) folds over, the first punch proving to be effective.

The uppercut, in that same combination, forces his spine straight and his chin to glare at the sky ---- a close range battle with Kariudo was becoming interesting. He staggers back a bit, attempting to quickly regain his awareness; which didn't take long.

He paces back toward her with left hand uncurling from a fist. At that point, he'd go to slap initiate a slap across her face, but purposely make it fall short --- the tip of his middle finger would graze against her nose. Tsubasa's left leg shoots forth, aimed to cause concussive damage to as much of her arms that acted as a shield.

If push came to shove the purpose of this kick was to force Kariudo off balance, using the feint slap as the distraction.* - Wed Dec  9 08:59:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) went skidding back, Kariudo's understanding over muscles and all that besting him.

Nothing he thought of doing would've worked against her, that was a given. To make matters worse? She had a great deal of balance so even if he did damage, it was like punching a brick wall and only causing a crack.

Tsubasa makes an attempt to regain his footing, using his left hand to take the place of his left leg in his efforts to stand. His right knee tucks under his body and he hops a single time, planting the sole of his right heel into the ground.

He looks up at her and remains where he was, resorting to crouch after finding that he wasn't too efficient in his legs to just hop around on one.* - Wed Dec  9 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) thinks: Attacking her upper body is pointless.. - Wed Dec  9 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) thinks: Going for her legs is my best option, but the lower set of her arms can protect that.. - Wed Dec  9 09:10:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) thinks: Going for the arms in general is suicide. - Wed Dec  9 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) thinks: I know what I must do. - Wed Dec  9 09:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) took a moment to wiggle his toes, making sure he had just enough feeling back to continue the spar.

He audibly sighs.

Tsubasa bursts off, using his right foot as the source of his power. The entirety of his body aimed for her midsection, he decided that going hand to hand with her may be in vain but to out wrestle her may be the only option. Of course, he knew that this was a form of cheating so he wasn't going to be a dick and attempt to suplex her or something.

Instead, with his frame charging for her midsection, he'd uses both his arms to wrap behind her thighs and pull them into him ---- scooping her legs from under her.* - Wed Dec  9 09:15:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: Who even does that?  - Wed Dec  9 09:19:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) was once again sent rolling.

The vibe of this training session was getting heated and quite honestly he had his enjoyments from it. With her hit dazing him once again and his left leg still throbbing from the onslaught he'd justdo a final roll to his back and just spread out there.

Tsubasa is panting a bit, but not much. A bruise forms on the side of his head, evidence that Kariudo handed his ass back to him on a silver plater. His eyes momentarily closed and he just remained quiet for a bit.* - Wed Dec  9 09:21:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) 's eyes inched back open after a few minutes. By this point his breathing slowed back down and his leg was now bareable to the point where he can actually walk on it. The specific side of his head that took the hit was aching and throbbing, but he wasn't going to bitch.

Tsubasa sits up and craddles the bruise with his palm, slowly shaking his.

"Nice," he mutters out loud.* - Wed Dec  9 09:25:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) continued to sway his head from left to right.

"I see why you're so.. you. You can handle yourself pretty good."* - Wed Dec  9 09:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) shrugged a bit, flopping back down on the ground and closes his eyes as well.

"I'll be fine."* - Wed Dec  9 09:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Did you learn anything? - Wed Dec  9 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Yupp. - Wed Dec  9 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Good good. - Wed Dec  9 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Yeah, thanks. - Wed Dec  9 09:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: First time I've actually trained. - Wed Dec  9 09:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Good good. - Wed Dec  9 09:33:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) remained silent a bit. He really don't think it would've made much of a difference, he'd lose in the end anyways.

"You'd just have handed my ass to me later rather than sooner."* - Wed Dec  9 09:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I don't know. - Wed Dec  9 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: I've never fought someone with a sword like that. - Wed Dec  9 09:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: They're lucky that you haven't. - Wed Dec  9 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Hah. - Wed Dec  9 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You seem different, Tsu-san. - Wed Dec  9 09:38:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) 's eyes crept back open.* - Wed Dec  9 09:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: What you mean? - Wed Dec  9 09:39:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You are acting much more...humble and reserved. - Wed Dec  9 09:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Ehh? - Wed Dec  9 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: You think so..? - Wed Dec  9 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah. - Wed Dec  9 09:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Is that a bad thing? - Wed Dec  9 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: No its a good thing. - Wed Dec  9 09:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Ahh, okay then.. - Wed Dec  9 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) nodded.* - Wed Dec  9 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Good, good. - Wed Dec  9 09:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) caught her at the corner of her eye and smirked a bit. "Thanks." He grabs from her and hoists it high into the air as if it was feather.* - Wed Dec  9 09:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: That ...is really freakin heavy. - Wed Dec  9 09:48:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Hmm? Yeah. - Wed Dec  9 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Took me a while to get used to it. - Wed Dec  9 09:49:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah I couldn't even carry that on my back I don't think. - Wed Dec  9 09:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Are you looking to learn how? - Wed Dec  9 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Nah, probabaly not, I'd probably cut an arm off. - Wed Dec  9 09:52:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: I'm guessing you're talking about one of your own. - Wed Dec  9 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Yeah. - Wed Dec  9 09:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Oi, are you hungry? - Wed Dec  9 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Uhhh, yeah. - Wed Dec  9 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: I'd go for a bite. - Wed Dec  9 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: You like spicy food? - Wed Dec  9 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Is there any other way to have food? - Wed Dec  9 09:57:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell yeah. - Wed Dec  9 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: Did I just find a new food buddy?! - Wed Dec  9 09:58:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) looked at the hand, his eyebrows rose. He takes hold of it and cracked a grin at her excitement. Once pulled up, he'd strap the blade to his back and nodded.

"Possibly, haha."* - Wed Dec  9 09:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) doesn't know where tf to take us for a cafe so fuck it.* - Wed Dec  9 10:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) folds his arms across his chest as she talked, the grin he was fighting back only grew wider. "Listen here, missy! I thrive for curry! It is all I eat and it is all I'll ever eat to live!" His own eyes narrowed, mocking her intense glare.* - Wed Dec  9 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) went to a full on smirk!

This was war --- he shall not lose!

He leans forward over the table a bit and squinted a bit more.

"You don't know what you're getting yourself into!"* - Wed Dec  9 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: And you don't know that I'm the QUEEN of spiciness! - Wed Dec  9 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ..That sounded wrong. - Wed Dec  9 10:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: ...... - Wed Dec  9 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) would usually throw in a mizumi and drool comment, but he just played it off.* - Wed Dec  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: If you're the queen.. - Wed Dec  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: Then.. - Wed Dec  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) says: I'M THE GOD! - Wed Dec  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT! - Wed Dec  9 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: New best friend, check. - Wed Dec  9 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) 's brows furrowed in and he looked up for the waiter.

"CHOP CHOP! SHE HAS A CHALLENGE TO LOSE!"* - Wed Dec  9 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: WOAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. - Wed Dec  9 10:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) blinks in thought, leaning back a back.

"Errr..."

He suddenly gets cocky and boasts his chest up a bit and grins from ear to ear!

"ANYTHING YOU WANT!"* - Wed Dec  9 10:29:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) shook his head..

"And what if you lose-.. WHEN YOU LOSE!?"* - Wed Dec  9 10:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) says: ......mn...  - Wed Dec  9 10:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) nodded his head. "Deal!"

He looks down at his bowl of green curry and licked his lips in excitement! This battle is going to be legendary, now ay around it!* - Wed Dec  9 10:33:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: No way he can win. - Wed Dec  9 10:34:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) can't lie, he never had green curry. He does love spicey food, but the stories about green curry made him stay away. Still, he couldn't allow Kariudo to make him out to be some bitch that won't even go in battle with her!

He takes in a deep breath and exhales it, diving in to the bowl!

From the get go he knew he was way out of his league, but god damn it his pride wouldn't allow him to fold. Almost instantly he starts to sweat. It wasn't heavy, but mild and noticeable!* - Wed Dec  9 10:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Engi, Kariudo(-Assassin.R-) thinks: ....Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. - Wed Dec  9 10:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) went to look up at Kariudo but his eyes immediately found one of his glasses of water. The temptation was real but he couldn't just give up --- he REFUSED to give up! Instead he gave Kariudo a wide grin and dove back in. By the way he was acting you'd think he was making a dent in his bowl, the fucker was only at the half way point to finishing!* - Wed Dec  9 10:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ookina, Tsubasa(Itachi4x4) actually took a good look at his bowl, realizing that he had a lot to go left. He gulps, painfully, and sighed. The sweat was now dripping relentlessly down his face and he felt like he was dying.

He went to take another bite, but couldn't. The second the food touched his tongue he dropped the utensil he used, allowing it to clink against the bowl. He rushes for the two glasses of water and tried his best to moderately drink down one --- this was torture.
