<br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) had been hanging around for quite some time probably shy or perhaps even slyly watching, but tonight, that was the night that that all changed. While his silence had given him more than enough time to examine a bit more of how things worked for genin shinobi, it had gotten boring as hell and made it a bit awkward for  him to suddenly try and get social.

But Ken wasn't the type to not just go ahead and do what he wanted. So with a neutral and probably even curious tone in his voice he'd speak while walking up to the young lady with the two katanas. Ken was looking her over, mainly examining the swords at her waist. 

"Hey. I'm Ken. I was uh looking for a person to help me out with my sword skills. Think you could help me out? If it's not too much trouble?" * - Thu Sep 10 12:55:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) whispers: There was a armorsmith roaming around here once upon a time, but I don't know what happened to her. - Thu Sep 10 13:05:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) looked to them both trying to examine their responses basicalyl asking the both of them.* - Thu Sep 10 13:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) looked like he was about to explode with how rough that fist came in. "I alredy have food and water. So It's as simple as me finding the mission specs. Sir."* - Thu Sep 10 13:12:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) looked down to the scroll excitedly. Going to open and begin reading it. His excitement for the job quite literally ended upon reading the very large 'E-Rank' at the top of the scroll. He wasn't going to take a crap on or regret what he'd gotten though. Mainly because he'd asked for it. So with a small sigh, he'd rolled the mission scroll back up and stuffed it back into his pocket.

"I'll get right to it Mizukage Sir."* - Thu Sep 10 13:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) wouldn't really go to waste any more time waiting for an extra response. As he'd go to walk his way right into the large Mizukage mansion. Looking up almost wide eyed as he'd fully examine and intake the scenery. His family lived pretty comfortably, but this was it. Ken wouldn't mind many things for a shot at a spot like the mansion for life.

So once Ken made his way deep enough in while sure not to really make his simple task too obvious. He'd go over to the bathroom, and get a broom and dustpan. Though before making his way back outside of the mansion, Ken was sure to basically imprint the interior of the mansion that he was able to see into his brian. 'Alright. I guess it's time to get to work. . '* - Thu Sep 10 13:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) After finally returning from his short trip after about four-five minutes. Ken would go to snag a trashcan and put it at the bottom of the steps and start his task of sweeping the entire set of long front steps. A relatively easy task for the ryo presented for it.

Regardless of difficulty, Ken planned to make it easy. Going to take the broom and start from the wall and front door of the mansion and go to sweep the surprisingly large amount of dust and dirt down the steps one step at a time. Eventually forming a pile of grayish brown powder to be moved from step to step with a pep to his careful movements now that a spar was to be in session.* - Thu Sep 10 13:37:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) With all that work in it didn't take much time for him to reach the bottom step and allow the true style on the mansion steps to be shown once again. With the layer of stuff from how well-traveled the mansion ws gone, the true colors seemed a lot better. 'Cause cleanliness is a nice thing to have around here.' 

With that done, Ken would scoop the large pile up into a dust pan and in turn into the nearby trashcan. After repeating said action a good four times, he'd go right ahead to stop and look at his work with a smirk; before taking the trashcan and putting it back over by the bench with both the pan and the broom.

Ken's next words were pretty sure. "Mission complete!" With him making sure the Mizukage could hear him well.* - Thu Sep 10 13:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) heard the green light and would very very simply go to put his hands infront of himself a few inches apart as he'd begin to concentrate his raiton element into a decently sized ball of what looked to be blue condenced energy! AS this happened, he'd get in a slightly lowered stance before putting it low and to the side of his waist obviously preparing to toss it before it'd practically explode into a mass of electrical energy! "One!" 

Ken's self signaling was the one of the many indications of his next action as he'd go to quite literally launch the ball of lightning energy to Lera. With it all happening in a skillful and fluid motion over the span of two to three seconds. Ken was trying to impress.* - Thu Sep 10 13:57:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) wasn't expecting the ball to be rejected like that so easily, though he felt like he should've known better than to assume she could only use fire and water ninjutsu as he found his lightning ball being rejected and dissapating along with his own weight being somewhat ripped from the ground sending him backwards onto his bum and forcing him to roll backwards up to his feet.

A simple gust was not going to be enough to handle Ken though he did take note of ht ninjutsu as he got back up to his feet having removed a kunai in the short tumble before going to slid his way forward in a low stance that was clearly an amatuer's kunai fighting tai stance.

If he wasn't interrupted in the short time that this would take, he'd try to do a full on kick towards her. Mainly because he planned to do some kickboxing in the future. All while smirking as well. This was what he'd asked for alright.
(given that he had to get back up i'd say this could've easily been anywhere from seven to ten seconds)* - Thu Sep 10 14:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) did indeed plan to kick right though the odd Lera-shaped golem. Making a very displeased expression upon his foot simply being engulfed and held. 'Not this mud crap again! How many elements can this chick use??' His thoughts would zip through as he put his hands together quickly to charge another attack, in a less shoy and far more quicker fashion this time. "Five!" Almost as if counting his nonexistant steps, Ken would shove a considerably larger lightning ball through the clone and focus it through towards the real Lera!* - Thu Sep 10 14:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) had managed to free his leg, but the multiplying clones. That wasn't something he was too fond of! IT wasn't the type of fight he'd liked to be in, so upon seeing the one turn into two, he'd go to clasp and pull his hands some distance apart before going to toss a ball at the original one that'd reformed while going to get some distance! "One!" Still counting. If anyone else had been as well, it'd be slightly obvious that his counting dictated the size of the lightning balls he'd shoot out!* - Thu Sep 10 14:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) looked to the girl sitting next to him and wondered whatever the problem she had with him was and went to smirk at her like a nice guy. After-all. That's the best way to find out if you can vibe with another person. Give them a nice face to look at.

"I can show her how things are done. Yeah. Are you trying to learn too? The more the merrier you know?"

Ken wasn't going to make any of the energy he was getting from the girl on the bench next to him negative. Because that's what a real man does. The only real response to her statement would be his question to her.* - Thu Sep 10 19:06:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) hated that sort of atitude she had. He'd never really spoken or even stood around her before tonight and his expression would show part of that subtle disdain for that kinda attitude, though he'd hold off on really letting the girl have it. Can't let everyone and their mother know how he liked to do things. Ken would suck up his harsh words and go to respond accordingly.

"I don't see why you'd want me to be mean to my own comrades. Especially with all the crap I've been hearing about. I also don't even know what you mean by tactic. Say something happened -right now- as you complain about me having stopped here to talk to someone else? IF I was some overly ansty douche bag like you're coming off, how would you expect me to respond? I'm getting the impression that you might not even be able to manage something like that without getting out of shape if you're this bent about ME a 'nice' guy trying to invite a 'nice' girl to what I planned to do anyway. I'll stop talking to you, sure. But don't try to get bent about what Violet here wants to do."

Ken wasn't some scrublet. He hated that the girl could get that much of an impression from him sweeping some steps and going to have a single spar, but he knew how he'd look at her with this.* - Thu Sep 10 19:15:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: I hope with our combined effort we cant defeat him - Fri Sep 11 04:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) had no idea who Zetsumo was or what he was capable of, but he wouldn't mind becoming a mist swordsman at-all. It was shown on his ace and the events of the other day had him a bit excited fro whatever may have been on its way. "Hey. How are you to?"* - Fri Sep 11 04:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Hmm? Hello, Ken. - Fri Sep 11 04:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: I was abit curious. About the other day when you were handing out swords. - Fri Sep 11 04:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: Or A sword rather. - Fri Sep 11 04:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: I've also been meaning to ask Mizukage Sir. Do you know the raiton chakra nature release? - Fri Sep 11 04:37:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I love how more and more people are seemingly becoming more interested in them. - Fri Sep 11 04:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Also, I do not. - Fri Sep 11 04:42:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: Well. I've only just now really decided it might be interesting. While I was going to try and learn some Kenjutsu either way. - Fri Sep 11 04:43:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: I hope you understand that these swords are extremely heavy. - Fri Sep 11 04:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: I do sir. I know it'd be a very long way for me. I do not exactly train my muscles like aI should. . - Fri Sep 11 04:43:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: Hmm. As a user of large swords, I assure you that strength isn't the only thing needed. - Fri Sep 11 04:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hogo, Tethys(Uptown Realest) says: You'd need balance as well. - Fri Sep 11 04:47:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: I do think I sort of see what you mean. Her words were pretty harsh. Also, yes. - Fri Sep 11 05:23:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*De la Cruze, Violet(Jarrodhun20) says: Yes - Fri Sep 11 05:23:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) says: She needs some personal security. I mean. Have you cheated on her before or something? - Fri Sep 11 05:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mitsuru Himura(Theodysseygamer) says: I think it's more to do with the fact she hates the opposite gender. - Fri Sep 11 05:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) in that exact moment would go to do some of the most facinating chakra accumulation he could muster allowing for his chakra to condense infront of himself as he'd put his hands together steadily and swiftly rearing them apart with a master's control birthed from years of practice and a natural affinity for the Raiton element.

Once the swift ball of ocndensed energy was formed, Ken would just as quickly speak pwoerful words as some sort of signal for both himself and those around him as he'd go to shift his hands and inturn his chakra and it's shape and nature! This would allow the ball of chakra to easily explode into a decently sized ball of lighting in his hands as he'd go to shoot it and it's surprising speed outwards towards Kida!

"FIVE!!" With Ken's words booming like the lightning his technique embodied! It would move in a very very slight spiraling motion as it zipped towards him. With the entirety of the happening being done in about 3-4 seconds.* - Fri Sep 11 23:26:04 2015

"Five! And Ten!"

Shooting them both out like some sort of baseball played with the deftness of a shinobi! Ken was able to let out his jutsu's full potential and stretch his muscles for raiton chakra nature!

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) wasn't expecting to have been just tested by Kida, but Ken wasn't the time to quit because the going was tough infact, that was the reason he did spar so actively now that he'd been out of the academy for about a month. With him abandoning -all- to go and catch the foot at his shoulder painfully. Ken could not hold all the weight. "Gah!" It was pretty painful. Sure to bruise. Something he'd remember. But Ken couldn't let it happen. He asked for this. He wated to be seen. He wanted everyone to know of the Takanami clan. HE WAS DRIVEN. 

So if nothing was done. If the kick was held. If it was stalled like his understanding of the word estimation. Ken wouldn't use any of the time from his partially downed position to recover, or check his injuries or -quit-.

Instead. If nothing changed in the time it'd take him to register and cope with that well-placed hand pain. The potentially broken fingered block would become the jaws of a gator as he'd try to charge a lightning ball with Kida's foot there.* - Sat Sep 12 00:42:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) FOUND himself falling over on his backside. "Hurgh!" sliding backwards with that kick off of his form. Though espite the scraping and clearly bruised hand. Ken was really trying to push it. Like that one song. As he'd get up a good moment or two later about a meter or two away. There was dust and small pebbles in his larhe head of hair and he was looking close to done. By now. One should be able to realize that Ken had been working towards perfecting his ninjutsu for a long time. To the point of it encompassing most of his fighting style.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) was not a pansy. Or at-least in his mind, as taking the full brunt of that dangerous looking combo attack would sure make him feel like one. So he wasn't having it. Going to find himself with thigh pains, then you guessed it. Two swift and powerful punches headed right for his handsome face! That was where he drew the line. Going to raise his arms defensively while back pedaling to avoid the next attack. 

"Gah! This is getting me nowhere! Lets stop for now." Ken wasn't going to go to the point of being bruised and bloody as it wsa clear he was outmatched. In fact. His only real close ranged ability came from the fact that he didn't have to use handseals for his lightning ball technique, so if the potentially dangerous combo continued at-all, he'd probably be too worse off to train normally. Ken was done.* - Sat Sep 12 01:52:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ken Takanami(OboeCat) also caught the bottle of water. That was the main thing that woke him up. Not wasting any time, he'd go to down the bottle of drink like he was in some product placement commercial that influenced young shinobi to buy their water. "Aaaah.~"

Only then turning to Violet with a hearty look on his face saying. "Alright. Just come to me then and I'll hook you up."* - Sat Sep 12 02:23:34 2015
