<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked out shortly after, escorting his friend back to her house.* - Mon Nov  2 09:30:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would go through the one seal once again, he was truely beggining to get the complete hang over the jutsu like he immagined that he would in the past. He remembered the last time that controling the shadow was like controling an exension of his own body, and he enjoyed that feeling. 

Ziare would inch the shadow out little by little at first, just trying to see how little he could move the shadow, although he would probably never move it this little in the first place. He would then release it at his fullest speed directly at a few targets that he had draw out in the grass.

He was working on it's manueverability, so he would angle it in a way where he could hit all three of his targets without expending the most chakra, he would need to conserve the best that he could, and he was defninitely getting a lot better at it. Far better than he was just a week ago when he just pissed away the chakra.

He had managed to successfully hit every single one of the points without having to expend too much of his own chakra and released the shadow imitation technique. He got up from his kneel and would test one last theory of his before he would be done with the test and feel like he knew everything he needed.

Ziare would break off into a sprint into the north by the mountain. While he was running he created the one handseal he needed and shot his shadow forth at the markers on the ground. The shadow taveled independantly of himself even when he moved, but because he moved it was awkward and took longer to get to the desired location.

That would be noted that using the jutsu while moving would only be beneficial if he was being chased down, there would be no other need to use it while moving when he had better jutsu to stop someone in case of a chase. With that he stopped his trining for the day and went out back to his home.* - Mon Nov  2 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked into the flower shop and took one good look around the area. He never really liked it around here too much, but he did enjoy the aroma of the flowers. He watched how the sunlight bounced off he cases and the plants to form shadows that he wished he could mimic. Once he walked in he looked to his old friend and spoke up, "What's up?" he asked.* - Mon Nov  2 19:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had begun to do a bit more expirimentation with his own shadow possessin jutsu. He got to a kneel as he reeled out his shadow like a fishing line. The sahdow went out and threatened to attach to a sparrig partner that he was training with. The shadow had failed to hit the mar the firs time due to him dodging.

Ziare knew that hitting him would not be easy due to the fact that unlike most of his stil targets, this man was able to move freely and wuld be able to attack back at him freely. He cursed a bit under his breath knowing how much harder that would make this fight before shooting his shadow out again defensively

The enemy backed up a bit from the theat of the shadow hitting him before going into a more defensive mode. He had the man on the ropes at this point, the man would not dare to come close and would stay mid range to attack at him. Ziare was able to dodge the flurry of weapons thrown at him from mid range and when the man ran out Ziare attacked back

He shot his own shadow back out at the man once again. His shadow ran quickly throgh the ground before connecting with the man and giving Ziare ultimate control over the man and his actions. Ziare would smile a bit of an evil smile as he walked off towards a tree and prepared to teach the man how to use his head properly

Once he was in front of a big tree he had found he cocked his own head back before slamming it foreward. He had no chakra left after this so it would be his last action, the man's actions followed and he hit his head knocking him out. Ziare walked off knowing that he had won the petty spar.* - Tue Nov  3 03:44:51 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right... - Tue Nov  3 04:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked into the resturant with a grim look on his face, he hated public areas like this. The shop had already known Jover, almost as well as he did. Ziare ordered what he normally ordered and let Jover order his own food.* - Tue Nov  3 04:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had his elbow on the table and showed off his horrible manners, "You know, horrible as usual.." he would comment unenthusiastically. He hated the shitty nicknames Jover and Rias had come up with for him. He couldn't decide which one hehated more 'Smartz or Z'...He would reply back with his smartass nickname he gave Jover, "And you, Slim?" he would ask knowing full well this boy was no skinny.* - Tue Nov  3 04:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) ate like a normal person with his fork. He wasn't exactly hungry and just picked at his food as he began to slowly put it down. "I see, so clothes and bags of chips...Seems like your type of thing man..." he would say as he continously picked away at the beef patty on his plate. He was still astounded to see how much food Jover could put down so easily.* - Tue Nov  3 04:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was still just picking at his food, "Nothing is wrong...Who is this guy?" he would comment from the side of his eye as he noticed some guy sit down without saying a word.* - Tue Nov  3 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked over to the girl and just wore his usual gloomy face. "Hmm...I just saw you the other day, I can;t miss you unless you're gone.." he would say, although he obviously enjoyed the two's company more than they probably knew.* - Tue Nov  3 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was poked on the forehead and rubbed it sadistically. "Ouch that hurt..." he complained mainly to himself but to the others at the table as well. He had just finished his food and would proceed to stand up. "Are you gonna keep eating or do you guys wanna find something to do?" he asked the three while sticking his hands in his pockets.* - Tue Nov  3 05:05:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just keep up. - Tue Nov  3 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Rias you start us off. - Tue Nov  3 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hit that scarecrow. - Tue Nov  3 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Jhunt713) says: got it - Tue Nov  3 05:32:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: Ha Scarecrow. - Tue Nov  3 05:33:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would follow up on his comrade's assault, he wanted to put in everything he could so as not to holld the team back like he so commonly accused his team of doing all the time. He had gotten to one knee and would activate his own jutsu. The jutsu would veer off towards the scarecrow and sine the object couldn't move it would hit.

Once Ziare had made contact with the scarecrow his attention would imidietly shift over to his prized teammate. He wanted to make sure the team was okay before anything else in the first place. Rias's own jutsu should have been deactivated by this time and she should have been back. She would wake up in his arms.

Now he had to position his body in a way where it would leave the target open for a follow up attack by the final attacker, their own friend Jover would be doing the finishing move. With his jutsu active there wouldn't be much left for him to do other than seal the deal, and thats what he assumed he would do.* - Tue Nov  3 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would pull back his shadow at the very last second as to save himself from being affected by the sarecrow's horrifying beatdown. It seemed his friend wanted to go overboard and completely massacre the thing. As he reeled the shadow back in he would just watch it get torn to shreds.

He spoke up, "I guess that's what happens when you fuck with Jover..." looking towards Rias to see how she was doing, if she still didn't move she would still be learning on him for his stability. Since he was done with his portion he would try to help her stand back at her full height. "cmon thats enough leaning on me.." he would complain.* - Tue Nov  3 06:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I know. - Tue Nov  3 06:43:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But makes relative sense I guess. - Tue Nov  3 06:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) wasnt paying attention to max, his jutsu would have no effect.* - Tue Nov  3 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah, not bad. - Tue Nov  3 07:22:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We just need to be quicker. - Tue Nov  3 07:22:27 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll make up for you then. - Tue Nov  3 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: My shadows are pretty fast. - Tue Nov  3 07:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Plus I don't only need just shadows to take people out. - Tue Nov  3 07:34:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: All you gotta worry about is if you're hitting hard enough. - Tue Nov  3 07:34:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Basically if Rias can keep up, then we won't lose. - Tue Nov  3 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Jhunt713) says: I can keep up... I just need the faster hand and the element of surprise - Tue Nov  3 07:44:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Element of suprise? - Tue Nov  3 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't need suprise. - Tue Nov  3 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You guys should master some of your jutsus while you're here. - Tue Nov  3 07:48:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Jhunt713) says: Its hard to master a jutsu thats so... different - Tue Nov  3 07:49:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's your clan's jutsu. - Tue Nov  3 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You need to be a beacon. - Tue Nov  3 07:53:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You are a future clan leader. - Tue Nov  3 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I mastered mine for the most part. - Tue Nov  3 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You too Jover. - Tue Nov  3 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(Jhunt713) says: Yea, I know... - Tue Nov  3 07:54:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: Yeah, - Tue Nov  3 08:02:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: Ill work on it. - Tue Nov  3 08:03:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He has people - Tue Nov  3 09:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) pulled out a kunai and would begin channeling his own chakra through the kunai. He liked the way this felt rather than having to rely on the shadow possession jutsu, but at the end of the day he would rather use traditional clan jutsu than the new ones that he had invented on the fly through boredom, trial, and error.

Ziare would have to perfect the art of just flowing his own chakra through the kunai in the first place. He would do a couple exercises of just inveloping his chakra over the kunai and then releasing the chakra that he had just put all the effort into. He would do plenty of these as his main workout.

Ziare would continuously envelope his chakra aaround the kunai and then stop and then go and then stop and then go again. He had to continue this effect over and over until he could get it perfectly with no hessitation. He was beggining to get it down better and better but still it was not to his liking and so he continued.

He noticed that he was not channeling enough chakra like he was when he was doing this at the very beggining. He would grip his kunai tightly and channel far more chakra than was nessisary into the blade activating the chakra flow effect but expending a bit more chakra than he needd to. That was something to work on there as well.

For the final piece he would just throw the shuriken at the shadow of one of his oppoenent. The kunai would dip down like it normally would do before sinking into the ground of the shadow of his opponent and stay there. Any live opponent wouldn't be able to move at that point and would usually surrender.* - Tue Nov  3 09:47:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would grasp his kunai once again and hold it firmly inbetween his hand and he took another deep breath and repeatd his process form the last time. The only way to get better would be to practice until he could no longer practice. He would channel his chakra through the shuriken once again only to fail from not having the chakra to do so.

Ziare would not let this stop him he would just channel more chakra through the kunai then he had done the time before and this resulted in him being just short of getting the jutsu to activtae once again. He cursed under his breath and threw the shuriken towardds his feet in frusteration. He took a couple of deep breaths and let himself calm down a bit.

Ziare pulled the kunai from the ground and grasped it tightly this time around. Although the grasp would have no adverse effects to how the jutsu would have turned out in the end, he felt that a tighter grip would result in a better outcome due to confidence factor. He was always told as a kid Confidence before Compliments.

Ziare charged the remnant of his chakra into the kunai and watched it light up with a light blue aura. "Perfect..." he commented to himself as he heald the kunai outwards towards the scarecrow that they used as a dummy and punchingbag in most cases.

Ziare threw the kunai with all of the strength that he could muster and hit the shadow dead on, he rarely ever managed to do that. If the scarecrow was a person it would find it extremely hard to move any portion of it's body until Ziare pulled the kunai out from the ground.* - Tue Nov  3 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Damn.. - Tue Nov  3 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I hate training... - Tue Nov  3 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Have a good night. - Tue Nov  3 10:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Have sweet dreams about me~ - Tue Nov  3 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Not happening. - Tue Nov  3 10:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I know it will~ - Tue Nov  3 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So annoying.. - Tue Nov  3 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked closely at the kunai he was using to create the effect of the shadow imitation technique without having to cast his shadow. He wanted to study the kunaia bit so that he might find a secret hidden in it's design that he may have missed in the first place.

He found nothing and went back to his normal mindless level of training. He channeled large amounts of chakra into the kunai, he had actualy oversatrated the amount of chakra he needed in the first place and as a result failed the jutsu itself.

Ziare doubled back when his own chakra stung him from holding the kunai just from the amount of chakra he was using. He needded to be more careful, he could not let the emotions get he better of himself. He erased everyone from his mind and started over again.

Ziare picked up the kunai and grapsed it tightly, this time he had learned his lesson and channeled far less chakra intot he kunai than he had befor ein the first place. With the chakra he had not channeled enough and ended up scrwing up the jutsu

Ziare realized that he needed to just relax and go through the motions like he was able to in the first place. This jutsu was beggining to come together for him so he was going to get it soon whether he liked it or not. Ziare channeled an average amount of chakra

The kunai lit up blue and showed signs that he had gotten the utsu perfectly and would be able to use the shuiekn for it's intended purpose. Ziare threw the kunai at the scarecrow and hit the shadow, he wa almsost off though which would have been a problem in a real fight.

Wth that he retrieved his weapon and headed back home to go to bed, he was tired and needed a break for the day.* - Tue Nov  3 10:42:59 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) heald out his kunai and began to channel chakra through it like he had before at any other time. He had gotte good at this part and just needed to practice continously throwing and hitting his target. He spun the kunai in between his finger as he channel a constant amount of chakra through the object. "Hehehe.." he would giggle to himself as he progressed.

Ziare would once again throw his shuriken like he had any other time he was training. He would then cock his arm back and throw his kunai at the target that he was aiming for only to miss slightly. He needed to get better at hitting his target or the technique would be useless.

Ziare picked up his kunai and stared at it. He knew how to funnel his chakra into it but he was still wasting exess amounts of chakra in the process. He shouldn't have been doing that and it was showing in his technique. If there was one thing he hated more than training, it was wasting in excess.

Ziare locked the kunai back on the awkward place on his side and sat back down as he drew plans in the dirt. He needed to srategize something to keep his mind busy while he chakra regenerated or he would just fall back asleep once again.* - Wed Nov  4 04:16:00 2015

He simply nodded to her and went back to the convorsation with the meat head which was going no where in his opinion.* - Wed Nov  4 08:37:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) scratched the back of his head loosening his ponytail a bit and letting out a bit of an angered ruffle from it. He had to tighten it all over again now and it would take a while. He heard a bit of a murmer from Yonbu's mouth and looked up, Hmm?"* - Wed Nov  4 08:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's eye twitched from anger, he had enough of this man at this point and was really hitting his limit for the patience he could and would show for any one person. Ziare stood up and looked at the man aggressively, his ponytail now fixed tightly on top of his head.* - Wed Nov  4 08:55:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) left the bulding motioning the man to follow, "Let's go then.." he would say angrily, but he did not lose his head in these situations.* - Wed Nov  4 09:03:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ume(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Hmph. - Wed Nov  4 09:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) turned to the man, it was finally his turn to take this man down a peg as well, he hated when people got under his skin the way they did. He looked at the man and smiled a bit of an evil smile that he had been practicing.

"I see you feel weak without you friend to come bite me, you have to fight me 1 on 2 to win huh?" he asked in the most cocky voice he could manage. Damn pissing people off sure took a lot of effort. * - Wed Nov  4 09:17:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) took a deep breath as he calmed down a lot. "Listen man, I don't care about your abilities at all, if I really had the energy or the drive, I would shit on you without breaking a sweat." he would say. It seemed it was his turn to get a bit out of his own character wanting the last word befoe the argument was truely over. 

"We can settle this at any time, it doesn't need to be around a lot of people.* - Wed Nov  4 09:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked at Marrissa with a bored expression like he expected her to do a dance or something. He wouldn't expend the nessisary effortt to really say 'Hello'. Althouh he did act like that to everyone asside from a couple people.* - Wed Nov  4 09:30:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) leaned foreward in his chair and finished his bowl o ramen soup. He loked back at Marrissa and answred her so as not to be rude, no other reason really. "No thanks, training requires too much work." he would admit as he finished his bowl and looked to Rias to see if she was ready to go home. She looked to him knowing the look and would most likely take heself home knowing that Ziare would not walk her back, he never did...* - Wed Nov  4 09:42:49 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) opened the scroll but didn't look directly at it at first, he would wait for Ume to look first, if she wasn't affected by adverse affects he would read.* - Wed Nov  4 10:21:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) read through the scroll quickly picking up everything very quickly. He was talented at what he did, but overall he was a waste of talent. Once he felt lik eh got the general conept of the jutsu down he looked back up to question it as soon as he got it.

"So this is saying that you need to stop chakra flow in your mind to stop a genjutsu because genjutsu targets the mind rather than anything else?" It was a fairly good question from someone who never really dealt with genjutsu before such as himself.* - Wed Nov  4 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked back over the scroll for a moment he had missed the general concept of forming a handseal to stop the genjutsu, over the course of his second reading of the scroll he had retained a bit more information.

"So you're expected to form a handseal when you use this jutsu?" he asked before continuiong. "What if as soon as you are trapped in the genjutsu you can't move?"

He was legitamately curious about this, who would be able to? He never really understood genjutsu and as a result he was full of a bunch of basic questions that Marrissa could probably answer.

After a moment he would ask another question, "What if you screw up stopping your chakr flow in your brain, wouldn't that harm you?" he asked puttting down the scroll for now.

He knew plenty of people who had poor control over their chakra, if screwing up a basic jutsu like this meant mental harm, this seemed too risky to learn how to use.* - Wed Nov  4 10:34:01 2015
