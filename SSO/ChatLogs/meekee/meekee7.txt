<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked off to his room, he undressed and went to bed, "Right right." he said before he left the guest area.* - Tue Nov 10 11:55:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked into the scene with his hands in his pockets as usual, he watched the scenes of the envioronment unfold to see what was going on in the world today.* - Tue Nov 10 19:15:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Did you piss everyone off again? - Tue Nov 10 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would get to his usual training spot and began to train a bit more like he uually did. Little did anyone know that Marrisa's words had acually gotten through to him a bit.

He would feel as though he needed to practice the obvious first and foremost before anything else. Ziare did a long and powerful stretch before doing a few pushups and standing up.

He would get a runing start like was nessisary if he was going to do any type of fighting technique. And he would jump into the air, pull his leg ack and then shove it foreward trying to hit the dummy.

He didn't quite hit on the head level, h had hit the chest so he would need t go at it once more. He would keep trying until he got it and could successfully hit his opponent on the head with every strike.

He walked back as he prepared to practice the same move once again from the very top. He could see now why Rias thought that this technique was useless, the two of them would never use the technique.

He looked at the dummy for a moment before charging back in on the dummy with his top speed and jumping into the air once again. He felt a bit like a bird as he flew through the air unable to be stopped.

He would land on the dummy foot first right into the face of it. Kicking it away he landed back on the ground as the dummy stayed faced up. He smiled at his skill and even gave himself a pat on the back.* - Tue Nov 10 20:18:33 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: If that were the case though, it would probably fall to Ziare. - Wed Nov 11 02:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 11 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's private here. - Wed Nov 11 08:42:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was shocked by the decsion she had made, he looked at her carefully and spoke up, "...Why are you leaving?" he asked, genuinely worried about his old friend.* - Wed Nov 11 08:45:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had gone limp, the three of them were supposed to stay together until the end, they werent supposed to split up, this is why they trained so hard together. He didn't know what to say, it was obvious everyone wanted to get out of this shitty village. Highest murder rate per capita, poorest village, worst shinobi care...Hell they werent even techniqually shinobi. He didn't want to look at her, he didn't want to speak, he just stared at the ground.* - Wed Nov 11 08:50:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) slid up a bit and wrapped his arms around her tight pulling her into him, she really was as soft as she always said she was. He just held her by him, he didn't want her to see him cry, but she would feel the droplets of tears hit her every so often. Nothing would be said as he just held onto her, she was leaving, but he was using her for emotional support.* - Wed Nov 11 09:03:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) just remained silent, "I don't wanna let you go..." he told her suddenly. It would be one of the very few times he actually spoke about how he felt. He usualy just hid behind his emotions or bottled them up and Rias would know that. He would slowly begin to release his grip as his tears stopped coming down from his face. He felt like he was losing a little bit of what made him, him...* - Wed Nov 11 09:14:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let out a sigh and took a deep breath that he didn't want anyone to hear. He pulled himself together mustering everything he had, the will of fire burned strong in him, he only needed the blaze for a minute. He looked up at her, his face had color as if he wasn't crying. 

"Yeah you're right, you'll be safe in Suna, so go and get so strong that you are the best. In turn I will get even stronger, I refuse to dissapoint you." 

In that very moment, with those very words, it had seemed like the spirit of a totally new man blazed within him. He almost didnt='t even sound like himself. His eyes burning into Rias hoping to ignite her spirit as well.* - Wed Nov 11 09:22:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I wont - Wed Nov 11 09:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was kissed and as she left he had completely broken down. But he held it together just long enough to give her nothing to worry about.* - Wed Nov 11 09:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: . . .  - Wed Nov 11 10:02:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Life is rough here - Wed Nov 11 10:02:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked into the area with his hands in his pockets, he looked down at the dead body and then past it. He had seen plenty of dead bodies in the village and was completely desensitied to this type of thing by now as were most in this village.* - Wed Nov 11 10:03:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just kep rping, ur chaacter will develop it eventually - Wed Nov 11 10:53:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I mean the only place for me to really go would be Suna...but I can't go there. - Wed Nov 11 10:54:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: True. - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I hear he's old as dust. - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He probably won't see me past his cataracts. - Wed Nov 11 10:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Heh, yeah. - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I think I might just go lay down for a while... - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: See you around man... - Wed Nov 11 11:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would place the dummy where it wa meant to be and would then begin his training to master the art of kicking somethign really hard. This really wasn't his style and he prefered not to do it this was so much anymore, but what could he do?

Ziare had promised that he would become extremely powerful so that he could and would always protect Rias, even if it meant his defnite doom. He rolled his arm and looked at his target dead on.

Ziare took a deep breath as he made sure to lock eyes with the target, he had to make sure he did that because it increased the chances of him hitting the target he wanted to hit.

Now that he knew where he was going he just ran with everything that he had in him. With his sudden sprint he would cover a good amount of ground, but not enough in the least bit for anything.

As he jumped into the air he could feel the air rushing through his hair, he let out a loud yell of excitement as for those few seconds he had truely felt like a bird in the air before descending.

Once he began to descend he would extend his foot as he prepared to slam it dad into the face of the dummy and knock him right down and out only to be prawled on the floor with no chance of recovering.* - Wed Nov 11 11:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) unraveled th wire under his coat again and looked at it carefully. He needed to learn how to use it if he was going to learn how to combo things on his own nowadays.

He unraveled the large amount of string and went over it, he would mentally count how much string he actually had in his mind before he would do anything with it in the first place.

Ziare ravelled the string back into his sleeve very slowly. He was still fairly new at the jutsu so he wasn't exactly completely able to thrash the string back into his sleeve instantly.

Ziare would loook at a nearby tree, he first had to learn how to shoot his string around the tree if he was going to get anywhere in the first place. He squinted closely at the tree.

Ziare would reel his arm back and shoot the string right at the tree. The string would bounce off harmlessly on he trunk and he would reel them right back in. He was sad with himself now.

He needed to get the jutsu down even if it killed him. Once again he reeled his arm back and shot it again, this time it was not aimed directly at the tree, but he string shot past it.

He realized his mistake again and reeled the string right back into his sleeve once again. He needd to get his shit together if he was going to improve at all in the least bit.

Once again he would reel his arm back asd shoot the entirety of the string back out at the tree. The string would wizz through the air as it traveled and he would then make his move.

Ziare twisted his arm in a way where the string would reel intwards to the tree and begin wrapping itself around the tree. He ws iproessed with hiself for his ability with the skill thus far.* - Wed Nov 11 12:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) pulled out his wire string once more to begin his practice session with the wire bind technique. He was planning on using it for things other than just binding people with a bit of wire.

He was learning how to use it for other things than just binding people, he could do that with his own shadow possession jutsu and it didn't even require as much chakra to pull off.

Ziare had learned how to quick throw the string in a way where he would not have to throw back his arm and go through an entire process. He realized that he could do everything he needed very simply.

Ziare stood on top of a tree and looked directly down below him, if he fell from this distance he could possibly crack his head open or even worse if it came to it, he shuddered.

Ziare pulled out the wire as he usually did and jumped dead off of the tree and let himself fall a bit before he whipped his hand out and let the string grasp the tree a bit.

He could feel himself being swung by the tree until he was let go, he needed to act quickly or he would fall from where he was. He whipped his left hand and binded to another tree as he continued.

Soon Ziare was swinging from tree to tree, he was still very awkward with it, but he was rapidly improving his skill with hittin the tree limbs and using them to pull himself a ways.

As he swung through the air he let the breeze fill his face and he smiled as it did. He enjoyed getting outside and doing something new liek this. He wasn't used to being like this.

He had to come to a stop so on his last swing he swung his body hard and let it flip ontop of a tree. Once he was on the top he grasped the tree tightly so as not to fall onto the ground.* - Wed Nov 11 19:05:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What are you doin around here? - Thu Nov 12 04:10:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had to start up his next practice sessions once again if he was going to be able to leave the village and pursue a better life for himself and those around him. He thought about what to improve in his arsenal first.

Ziare first went over the handseals for the jutsu that he needed to use for the jutsu he was planing on learning. He went through a series of handseals very slow, he made sure to eccentuate every seal.

He had to make sure he could get every single seal down perfectly before he would consider that he was ready for moving on foreward. He went through the same series yet again.

Once he finished the series he did it once again, he had no intentions of stopping the same series of handseals that he could use. He was a perfectionist and would not stop untilhe got it right.

He fially felt like he could seal perfectly well for his style at this point. He stopped practicing the same seals over and over again and would take a deep breath as he would now begin using the actual jutsu.

Ziare went through the handseal to the jutsu, he made sure to perform all of the handseals perfectly and with haste like he normally did when he used the jutsus.

Once he completed them he cocked his head back, he could feel the bits of fire congealing in his mouth. He would then blow a small stream of fire into the woods, the fire would dissapar without doing much.

He nodded to hismelf seeing what he had done, he was happy with his progress up until this point and took a short break befre starting again.* - Thu Nov 12 07:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) got back to the jutsu, once again he would be getting right back to work on the things he had to do. He cracked his fingers and slammed his palms together as he took a deep breath.

Now that all of that was out of the way he sprung into action with the seals but he formed them incorectly once again and had to take it from the top and start again.

Ziare went from the top then and there. He formed all of the seals over again, there were a lot of seals that he had to go through to form in the first place so he had a bit of trouble.

He completeed the seal fairly quickly never the less and remembered his training with the fire jutsu and how he needed to treat fire jutsu differently from normal jutsu.

He felt the embered forming in his mouth as he converted his normal chakra into fire natured chakra as he breathed in a deep breath. He would then exhale with everything he had left.

Ziare formed a stream of fire that blasted out into the woods, it was stronger than the one he had managed before this one, but all in all it was still fairly weak for an overall technique. He needed a lt of work from here.* - Thu Nov 12 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) heald his hands out as he began to practice his fire style more now that he had a bit of free time and would be working on his fire jutsu from this point on. Ziare cupped his hands just like he would do any other time and would prepare for the chakra control training.

Ziare instantly began to pour his own chakra into his cupped hands as he continued to train with everything that he had. He had to make sure he was payign close attention to the amount of chakra that he was using this entire time. He couldn't go too far.

With that said he couldn't go not far enough if he was going to improve his fire using ability. Hehad to make sure he was giving it everything he had but wasn't trying to drown the flame. Once he felt that he had a good enough flow of chakra running into the cupped portion of his hands he yelled out to the world. "Burn it up."

It would be more than just a little bit anticlimactic as he just formed a small burning flame in between his hands and nothing more. He sat there and watched it for a bit making sure he didn't give too much flame to the chakra, but making sure he was feeding the flame as well.

After a while the exercise had gotten boring, he had already gotten the style down for using everything he needed for this. That meant he could start the last part of his fire training which would be learning to truely burn things and max out the power of the Fire Style. He smiled a bit to himself.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ziare went through the handseals for the Flamethrowing jutsu once more. He needed to get everything down to perfection if he was going to be even remotely satisfied with himself at this point. He needed to be in top form if he was ging to improve.

Ziare went through the seals yet again, he obviously wasn;t joking around with the jutsu, he knew the severity of the situation he was in, his dad had still not come back now.

He would need to be like his dad and abandon his own family for the sake of making the world better. Thoughts of Rias popped into his mind and then out. He had completed the seals 10 times since he started.

Ziare could feel his own chakra in the pit of his stomach coalescing into something incredible. He was able to more efficiently convert it into something better, fire power.

With the increased Fire nature chakra in the pit of his stomach he opened his mouth and it would appear like a furnace to he common joe smith around the area. He looked for a target as he scanned the area.

Ziare found one and spit the flames right at the tree burning it down to the ground right in front of him. He had finally matred the jutsu.* - Thu Nov 12 10:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: That will benefit me. If you restore your village while under my tutelege...That will be a powerful ally for Kirigakure no Sato..And in doing so, I'll have one extra bit of leverage for the time when I remove Sunagakure's hand from around Kirigakure's throat. - Sat Nov 14 08:04:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You should join in with others to try and overthrow him. - Sat Nov 14 08:07:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: The Kazekage, while old and grizzled, is a great man. He doesn't neccessarily have a winning personality, but he's rathe- Overthrow the Kazekage? Even if that were possible..The shinobi of Sunagakure are -leagues- beyond anyone in any other village...An individual couldn't even get close to him, let alone kill him. - Sat Nov 14 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Damn.. - Sat Nov 14 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Besides, he's done great things for my village as well as many others...I'd be worse than scum if I were to turn on him. - Sat Nov 14 08:08:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah. - Sat Nov 14 08:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What are you talking about? - Sat Nov 14 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I sent a squad on a mission and they haven't returned. - Sat Nov 14 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Would you like if I searched for them? - Sat Nov 14 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: I couldn't ask you... - Sat Nov 14 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll do it. - Sat Nov 14 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You saved me, allow me to help you. - Sat Nov 14 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) stood up from his sear and straightened his jacket. "Tell me where they went, please."* - Sat Nov 14 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Very well..They went to Genjigakure. But may have stopped off in Amegakure on the way...I've heard dark things about Amegakure..I hope they didn't go there... - Sat Nov 14 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ...Could you give me a map - Sat Nov 14 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right. - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Which one should I check first? - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Hmm..I'd say Genjigakure, and if they're not there. Then Amegakure. - Sat Nov 14 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right. - Sat Nov 14 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grabbed the map and placed it into his jacket, he would then leave thebuilding headed for Genjigakure.* - Sat Nov 14 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had entered the large village he had never been around these parts, upon recieving the message from the Mizukage he spotted the three kids he was meant to look for. He would try to catch up to them while he began to process what was going on in this situation. 

"You three fit the description, are you with Kirigakure?" he would ask.* - Sat Nov 14 09:18:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Done. - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had finally gotten into the general area, he noticed the man with the bounty on his head, but saw his main targets and would have to let him get away for now. Ziare met with Yumiko first and would kneel down to her resting his hand on her before speaking directly to her, "Are you okay here? What's going on?" he would try to ask to invoke an answer from the girl.* - Sat Nov 14 09:45:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) tried to sit her up against the tree so she could recover, "Rest up." he would tell her as he stood up and began to near the fight between the two. He would need to help the best he could, using the shadow of the large tree as a base he would create a single handseal and manipulate it to shoot out and catch the woman's heel. Regardless if she was binded or not she wouldnt see it coming and it would add onto the bindings if she managed to break from the genjutsu one.* - Sat Nov 14 09:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You want her dead or alive? - Sat Nov 14 09:59:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Shut up slut. - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And you kid? Dead or alive? - Sat Nov 14 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: Why would I tell you!? Shrimp! *spits* - Sat Nov 14 10:05:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let out a sigh, it seemed everyone wanted to get all worked up now, he just wanted to end this, he heard another comment from the woman and he was already tired of her voice. He went through a quick series of handseals with blinding speed, before manipulating the chakra even further.

Now the shadow crept up onto the woman's figure, it would climb up her body and sport a hand that Ziare could freely manipulate on her body. She was fairly close so the strength of the shadow would be very powerful. The hand would seemingly grasp the woman's neck and squeeze, immidietly she wouldn't be able to breathe and the life would slowly escape her. Within a minute or two she would pass out from oxygen deprivation and 30 seconds later she would be dead.* - Sat Nov 14 10:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can't beleive i'm being forced to use this... - Sat Nov 14 10:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shadow reeled back into him instantly showing no sign of a jutsu being used, the only evidene of murder being the dead body.* - Sat Nov 14 10:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I was asked to come help your squad by the Mizukage. - Sat Nov 14 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: He was worried about you all. - Sat Nov 14 10:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I owe him a huge favor, so this was nothing. - Sat Nov 14 10:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I am still from Konoha. - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But as you know the village is in shambles. - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I started roaming. - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Mm.  - Sat Nov 14 10:15:15 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But the Mizukage saved me. - Sat Nov 14 10:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's how I got here. - Sat Nov 14 10:16:06 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) says: Yumiko, are you alright? - Sat Nov 14 10:16:57 2015
