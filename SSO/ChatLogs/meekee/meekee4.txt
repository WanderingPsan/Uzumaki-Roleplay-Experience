<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would begin to pretend reading, he would angle himself in a way where unless Marrissa was observing him closely she would not notice him dozing off from complete lack of intrest.* - Wed Nov  4 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was asleep fairly quickly.* - Wed Nov  4 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would look at the clone, the way she was going about it was not very intimidating in the first place. He did what he said because he felt his life was threatened like when he had met Edge for the first time. If asked questions he would quickly spot the information he needed only resulting in low amounts of information retention.

As she was, she would not be getting through to him due to his inherit laziness and lack of will to do anything. It would be similar to the teachers that tried to teach him in school, he was unwilling to learn in such a boring way.* - Wed Nov  4 10:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Wed Nov  4 10:58:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Why would you hurt me? - Wed Nov  4 10:58:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would begin to quite basic laws that he knew.* - Wed Nov  4 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's not considered a spar unless both parties agree. - Wed Nov  4 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And if one party attacks without another's permission. - Wed Nov  4 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's considered assault. - Wed Nov  4 11:00:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: A punishable offence. - Wed Nov  4 11:00:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll just disable your leg with my kunai! - Wed Nov  4 11:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) cocked his arm back applying chakra flow to his kunai before throwing it with all of his strength from his distance. IT should have been a hit but he would seemingly throw his arm awkwardly and aim far too low to hit the leg. He felt it and would curse at his own weakness. The kunai would fall shirt and miss the woman's legs and feet entirely. 

He would look up at her a bit dissapointe in himself as he would try and walk away.* - Wed Nov  4 11:06:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Damn I didn't think you would catch it... - Wed Nov  4 11:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) withrew his only two shurikens and threw them in a way where it would somehow cost him chakra to hide one in the shadow of the other, this was all just a distraction though.* - Wed Nov  4 11:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shurikens would be aimed at her legs, it was a low throw, the one on the bottom wouldn't end up hitting her leg but would hit by her feet. He hoped he threw it low enough where she wouldnt notie the bottom one.* - Wed Nov  4 11:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Pain in the ass... - Wed Nov  4 11:16:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But it looks like I have to. - Wed Nov  4 11:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) dropped to a kneel and formed a twick handseal, in that very moment the shadow from the tree would burst to life and lash out at MArrissa aiming to grip her in it's powerful clutches. He would try to catch her by suprise like he did most people who fell victim to him manipulating shadows.

But there was more, utulizing his strategist trait he would be able to split the shadow in two  if she tried to dodge both aimed to cut off further dodging routes as well as ensnare her all at once. It was xtremely skilled with this tchnique having to be. The small looped earing he wore would glimmer for a moment.* - Wed Nov  4 11:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Had me confused XD  - Wed Nov  4 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) sighed to himself, he was out of weapons and tricks at this point...Well tricks that let him run. He would do what litle strategy he had left. He wasnt the leader of the Ino-Shika-Cho group for no reason. He formeda quick 4 handseals before bolting off towards the east to get away.* - Wed Nov  4 11:32:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) saw that he had lost and just accepted it at this point. "Guess so, if you're gonna do it, then go for it..." he would say boredly as if he was already tired of living. In reality he was more upset with himself for losing as a few more strategies popped into his head all innate failures due to the woman's overbearing strength. At the end of the day, the gap between the two was too large.* - Wed Nov  4 11:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would sit on the ground with a scroll on top of his head as he went over what was nessisary for him to improve his skill in the technique that he was being forced to learn.

Ziare would close his eyes and feel for the channel of his own chakra. He could not feel it as he was and felt he had to go deeper to feel for it. He scourered his chakra system trying for feel for the flow to no avail.

Just as he was about to give up from boredom he suddenly felt the flow of chakra in his system and could predict  how his own chakra would move and flow. He was honestly intrigued by himself and the flow of his own chakra.

Ziare would begin by disruptin the flow of his chakra by how little he could. He would continously disrupt it slightly over and over again in different parts of his body before he regained his attention.

Ziare would have to focus not and formed he one handseal that he would need to form. With that one handseal he would find the chakra in his brain and stop the flow for one milisecond before continouing the flow once again.

He could feel the small change in his system, it was a bit like a system restart for his body since the chakra began at the brain and ended at the brain. He would exhale before going at it once again.* - Wed Nov  4 22:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) felt for the flow of his own chakra once again, he was able to spot it like he normally did at this point. He could play with it and mess with it in different ways, but he could concentrate now.

Ziare made sure the scroll on top of his head did not move one single inch as he sat on the ground cross-legged with his eyes closed just feeling for the enegy inside of him that breathed life to him.

Ziare would blink for a moment before he began the process once again. He formed the one handseal that he needed to form for the jutsu to be cast and began to manipulate his flow of chakra.

The chakra in his mind and body would fluctuate for a moment before calming down a bit and settling. He formed the handseal that he needed before concentrating extremely hard and cutting off chakra flow for an instant.

In this instant the chakra flowing to his brain would cease for a just that small time frame before being continued once again like a small creek. He had done it once again and he was getting better.

Ziare let out a deep breath for a moment knowing that he would need to continue the traiing if he was going to get any better.* - Wed Nov  4 23:22:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would continue sitting cross legged on the ground as he stared off into the distance. He could feel his chakra flowing through his entire body and he felt it rise and fall with every breath.

He was calm and still had plenty of reserves to keep continuing the jutsu, even though in reality his reserves were pathetically low. He had no chakra to just waste around willy nilly so when he used jutsu he usually showed a level of skill with them.

Ziare would stop staring off into nothingness and get back the the training that he needed to do so desperately. He would straighten his posture as he would get back to his training. He may as well have done this rather than anything else.

Ziare began to speed up his chakra flow completely by will, as if he was going to use a jutsu or was preparing to use a jutsu. He didn't know why his chakra did it but it did.

He could feel the chakra in his mond racing, he knew how he was going to have to stop it form flowing even when it was moving quicker, but he practied on the chakra points throughout his body.

He would disrupt and move the various chakra points located at all the points of his body. He wanted to get a feel for it, this is probably how it would be in a hostile situation and he needed to be used to this type of pressure.

Once again he would locate the  chakra in his mind and the reason it was racing and would instantly form the handseal gaining a higher amount of contorl of the chakra in his own body.

Now he woud do more than just disrupt the flow, he would stop the flow completely all together. With this the chakra momentarily ceased to flow in his brain before continuing again. 

He felt a bit dizzy like he had done something wrong and would need to further work on his progress but he knew that he had done it corretly, he just needed practice usig it in combat situation.* - Thu Nov  5 00:02:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) sat there on the ground and would continue his training before taking a long nap and resting for a while. He needed to get some rest anyway he had been working for 25 minutes straight.

He had gotten the bulk of what he needed out of the technique, but there was no hard in mastering the technique a bit further. He let his chakra race more than he had done last time.

He winced knowing that he would be even dizzier and more hurt afterwards when he used the technique, but it was something that he was willing to deal with since he was training for combat purposes.

Ziare would close his eyes as he created the handseal and feel the flow for his chakra. It was like feeling for bug that was buzzing by his face for the longest amount of time.

He would suddenly open his eyes and stop the flow of chakra momentarily before letting it continously rush once again. "Got it..." he said to himself affirmatively.* - Thu Nov  5 00:54:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was back at his training again. He had the scroll on top of his head and he sat compleely still as he felt for the chakra inside of his body one again. He could feel the chakra in his body circulating rapidly in the system.

Ziare could feel the chakra in his brain and he knew that he needed to be rpecise to stop the flow to dispell any type of genjutsu set on his mind. He took a deep breath. 

Just as he was going to use the jutsu he opened his eyes and spotted Rias in front of him. He stayed cross-legged on the ground and looked at her expecting her to say soemthing.* - Thu Nov  5 04:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Sup? - Thu Nov  5 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hi hun~ - Thu Nov  5 04:55:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hun? - Thu Nov  5 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: yeah. - Thu Nov  5 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Just don't distact me. - Thu Nov  5 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I wont~ - Thu Nov  5 04:57:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Arent you going to train? - Thu Nov  5 04:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right.. - Thu Nov  5 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) went back to his training on the genjutsu release technique. He grabbed the scrols still shocked by her ability to learn even quicker than he could. But he would master the jutsu befoe her.

He sat the scrolls on top of his head and began to concentrate his chakra as best as he could. He could feel his chakra circulating around himself and knew that he was alive.

I can feel my pulse rising.. He thought to himself as he focused mainly on the chakra that circulating around his brain. He would relax a bit and take a deep breath. Time to start

Ziare created a single handseal with his hands and would focus on the minute point of chakra in his mind. He would have to stop it and then let it start naturally again in the smallst bit of time.

With the extra bit of control he got from using the handseal he would be able to stop the flow of his chakra before continuing it again. In that moment he feltlike he had just pressed the restart button in his mind. "Phew..." he said exhaling...* - Thu Nov  5 05:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You know, you're incredible. - Thu Nov  5 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't think you even need to read the scrols. - Thu Nov  5 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You just learn the material by skiming over it. - Thu Nov  5 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) felt like he was beggining to get the jutsu down by second nature. He was practically about to master the jutsu. Ziare stayed still just the way he was. He faced foreward and breathed regularly.

he closed his eyes and just felt for the flow of chakra through his body. He could feel it second hand now. He felt it through his toes, to his feet, to his legs, to his groin, to his abdomen, to his chest, head and hairs. 

When he meditated like this he truely felt like he was a part of something greater than himself and it reflected in his actions as well. H was a part of chakra and chakra a part of him.

Ziare would begin to track the way his chakra flowed throughout his entire being. He looked up at Rias through the slit of his eye to see how she was doing in her training.

She seemed to be doing just fine, it was weird having her around when he just trained to himself but he couldn't complain. Having a pretty girl around never hurt him, but he would never tell her that.

He went back to concentrating on the flow and direction of his chakra once again and just like time and time before, he had found it. He let the chakra flow easily through his veins for a moment before focusing further.

He was now tuned in on the chakra in his mind. He was calm as he felt it flow so free within himself. He would need to change that but only for a moment. He created the hand seal.

For a split second he would stop the flow of chakra to his brain before continouing it again. He felt a tny bit dizzy from the effort but he ragained his compusure. He truely felt like he had mastered the jutsu.* - Thu Nov  5 06:12:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) sat on the ground cross-leged and his eyes closed still with the scroll balanced perfectly on top of his head. He really did not like to train, this was exhausting to  him and he had already taken plenty of naps for the day.

Just as he was feeling for the chakra inside of his person he had peeked to catch Rias's progress as usual. She always seemed to advance faster than him somehow and it really annoyed him although he would never let it known.

Once he peeked he noticed another man walking into the room as well. He let out a sigh and let the scroll drop to his feet on the floor. No point in training under pressure he may as well take a nap..

So like that Ziare had his back leanred against the table and was out like a light. He was in his happy place now.* - Thu Nov  5 07:50:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Trying isn't good enough.. Shinjin demands the best. - Thu Nov  5 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Shinjin? - Thu Nov  5 07:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: But its hard to remember someone. - Thu Nov  5 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Who doesn't make themselves known... - Thu Nov  5 07:59:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Because they are knocked the hell out. - Thu Nov  5 07:59:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: But it makes you weak, for example. - Thu Nov  5 08:00:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was snoring at this point, he slid in his seat and rested on Rias's body a bit.* - Thu Nov  5 08:12:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) felt his head being pet and woke up gently, he was too lazy even in his sleep to bolt up. He looked up at Rias with a bit of an annoyed look, "How did I end up like this?" he asked attempting to sit back up on his own.* - Thu Nov  5 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) scratched the back of his head a bit annoyed at her for not waking him sooner, even though he'd be mad if she woke him up early as well like she did. "Anyway what did I miss? he asked as he stood up and with drew a kunai to begin practicing again.* - Thu Nov  5 08:22:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Some guy drew a weapon on ypu - Thu Nov  5 08:23:02 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I didnt want to disturb you - Thu Nov  5 08:23:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I would still like to be conscience if my life is being threatened. - Thu Nov  5 08:24:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Good - Thu Nov  5 08:27:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) spun the shuriken in between his fingers as he looked at it closely. He wanted to inspect it as much as possible but he had work to do with his jutsu so he could be less of a burden to his squad.

Ziare spun the kunai in between his finger and he thought about how he would go about things. He stopped immidietly and began to channel chakra through the kunai.

The kunai blazed a brilliant blue now as his chakra was channeled through it successfully. This was the first thing that he worked on in the past and he did not need to contnue doing so. He was already adept at this small thing.

He needed a target to hit, he could not find one in the short amount of time that he needed, so he aimed to hit a nearby target instead. He threw the kunai onto the target and hit close, but he didn't hit the bullseye.

He nodded to himself pulling out the kunai from the board and walking back to where he had started in the first place. "I'll just try again..." he said to himself as he repositioned himself.* - Thu Nov  5 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked back at Rias making sure she was alright the entire time, when she came to, he would back off of her so she wouldn't think Ziare cared so much.* - Thu Nov  5 09:09:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) passed Rias a cup of cold tea. "You want it? I drank the rest" he would say not looking her in the eyes. He scratched the back of his head again seeing as his ponytail was annoying him.* - Thu Nov  5 09:17:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Is what bothering me - Thu Nov  5 09:21:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) got up and prepared to follow her, he was slouching as usual.* - Thu Nov  5 09:42:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Hello again pupil. - Thu Nov  5 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) stood there with his back to the woman ignoring her as if he wasn't being talked to.* - Thu Nov  5 09:54:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: Man, I can't wait for the evening to roll around. - Thu Nov  5 09:55:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You improve any? - Thu Nov  5 09:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) peeked to ensure that she wasn't only to be wrong, he hoped she didn't catch his peeking.* - Thu Nov  5 09:56:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) turned around having been caught, he wasn't much for being sneaky anyway. "Yeah, I learned the technique, so I did improve." he told her, his voice reflecting a bored and low tone.* - Thu Nov  5 09:59:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) stood a ways behind her with his hands in his pockets just looking at Marrissa in the eyes. He had a bored look in his eyes and as always he lacked determination. His attitude could be summed up in his slouching.* - Thu Nov  5 10:08:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had gritted his teeth at the fact that even she was pushing his buttons now. He had completely control over himself though, he hated losing more than anything, one day he would get her back so that he could rest once again, hopefully for the rest of his life.* - Thu Nov  5 10:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Can we get this over with? - Thu Nov  5 10:16:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Hey I only call him Z! - Thu Nov  5 10:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) waited for the showoff to lead the way.* - Thu Nov  5 10:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Then what should I call him? - Thu Nov  5 10:18:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Perfect. - Thu Nov  5 10:18:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Goodie~ - Thu Nov  5 10:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright. .  - Thu Nov  5 10:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: So . .Why don't you both come at me. . and then we will move onto jutsu! Spar before we move into the fun stuff! - Thu Nov  5 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ...I hate sparring.. - Thu Nov  5 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I know Ziare. - Thu Nov  5 10:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Think of it as a Game. . IF you win. . You get to sleep, and I leace you alone. . No extra training. .  - Thu Nov  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: leave* - Thu Nov  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ...Fine. - Thu Nov  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll accept your dumb game. - Thu Nov  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Should I? - Thu Nov  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Of course. - Thu Nov  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do I look like I wanna be out here? - Thu Nov  5 10:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ...alright - Thu Nov  5 10:22:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) dropped to one knee and formed a single handseal , his shadow would real out towards Marissa's right, naturally this would force any person towards the left. But due to his straategy perk this was just a setup. The shadow would split in front of Marissa one end would try to wrap around her behind while the other continued to flank her left. Normally this would push a person towards Rias but seeing as Marrissa was a lot faster than the shadow and ona  different level this would likely prove to be slow to her.

If he managed to link with her he would yell out to Rias, "Now!" he didn't have much time to wait and knew Rias needed to be extremely quick if they were to be successful.* - Thu Nov  5 10:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Headed at u - Thu Nov  5 10:32:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: u. - Thu Nov  5 10:45:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would go down, but he formed the seal he needed, little did people know that Nara's don't create shadows, they manipulate them. Now that he was seemingly out for the count he would still move the small shadow he had cast with his neck towards MArrissa now that she thought he was down. With her attention totally off of him he would aim to lock her in place with his shadows for just a moment, just long enough to let her get hit by the jutsu Rias had planned. 

This was a change of plan but he was extremely flexible in battle when it came to changing plans.* - Thu Nov  5 10:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: blob* - Thu Nov  5 11:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would show off his control by following through with his jutsu to cut off multiple escape routes that marrissa would take by spliting the 1 chakra path into 4 different chaka paths. He needed to just bind her for a single moment and give Rias the opening that she requried. He could tell what Rias was going to do, they werent friends since childhood for no reason and they have been training since they were kids for a reason.* - Thu Nov  5 11:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It just stops and u get conscience back - Thu Nov  5 11:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Many factors are taken into consideration. Mind Transfer is best affective when used on a binded/stationary person. It is more of a conscious thing I suppose. There won't be any rebound where someone gets hit unless the person steps in front of the initial path. As far as it being controllable, you can't arch it after ur activated the jutsu, but when aiming TO launch it, you can add that 'arch' or 'slant'. -) - Thu Nov  5 11:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says:  but when aiming TO launch it, you can add that 'arch' or 'slant'. - - Thu Nov  5 11:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: if it is conscience i assume i still take control - Thu Nov  5 11:33:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was hit by the soul, his shadows would vanish around him as quickly as they came. If everything happened how it was supposed to he would have Rias in his body.* - Thu Nov  5 11:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was yanked closer to the ground and fell since his target had the same happen to them. Ziare sighed to himself, he no longer had the will to keep on fighting at this point, he just wanted this to end. He got back down to a kneel with the seal made, he would sit there with a disasified look on his face. He was next to Rias at this point as thy waited for Marrissa to stop constantly running. * - Thu Nov  5 11:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: this is good im learning  - Thu Nov  5 12:05:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Careful. - Thu Nov  5 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She may try to come from under us with her and her clone. - Thu Nov  5 12:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Stay focused. - Thu Nov  5 12:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) relaed his stance and stood normally. "I was waiting for you to quit, I don't want to go on anymore either..." He was annoyed with his hair and pulled the band out of it letting it drop to his shoulders.* - Thu Nov  5 12:09:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: No thanks. - Thu Nov  5 12:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't want any prize. - Thu Nov  5 12:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked up to Marrissa and handed the scrolls back, they are too hard for me, I don't want them. He said lazily.* - Thu Nov  5 12:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) watched her stumble everywhere and into Ortho, he looked at the man plainly, "What was that about?" he asked.* - Thu Nov  5 12:21:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would return the hug, he knew if he did she would leave him be and not bother him about it.* - Thu Nov  5 12:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Hm? - Thu Nov  5 15:19:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grabbed his kunai and looked at it intensely, he was going to have to channel a lot more chakra into it if he was going to master the jutsu that he needed to combine with his team.

Ziare channeled a lot more chakra than nessisary to get the blue glow to form from the kunai before throwing it extremely hard at the wall. He as off of his mark but only barely.

Ziare pulled out another kuni from his weapons case and threw it with as much strength as he could muster. He had forgotten to aadd he chakra to it making the kunai virtually useless.

He had learned from that mistake and pulled anoher kunai form his pouch. This time he had no intentions to miss his mark. He channeled plenty of chakra into the kunai once again.

He threw the kunai again with intentions of hitting his mark, he would impress Rias a bit with his accuracy if he could. The kunai flew through the air and just barely hit the taget.* - Fri Nov  6 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grasped his kunai once again and raised it to the air as he channelled a good amount of chakra through it. He hated having to learn higher ranked techniques such as this one. It was fairly annoying learning how to perform these.

Ziare cocked his hand back when he channeled the chakra and threw the kunai at the dart board. He had slightly missed and cursed to himself before realizing his mistake.

He wasn't canneling his chakra the correct way the entire time. He would have to go over the chakra channeling chakra lesson with himself once again. He would have to work from the begining

Ziare heald the kunai out in front of his and would begin to channel his chakra once again. He stopped channeling it rappidly and just flowed it through the kunai smoothely and easy.

Ziare's kunai reacted a bit differently, the chakra would add the same effect but it wouldn't throw his kunai off of it's target so much anymore. Now his kunai flowed smoothely through the air and hit it's target.* - Fri Nov  6 12:59:05 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) head out the kunai in front of his person, he would gripn it tightly as he began to channel his chakra through the entire weapon. He made sure not to get too excited now like he did before.

The chakra woul flow smoothly through his weapon as he flowed it and let it copliment the blade. He would then hold the blade in front of his body and stare at the target.

With his chakra flowing through it he would be able to bind whoever he wanted to bind as long as he hit the shadow of the person that he was aiming for. The shadow would be simulated as a dart board.

He would squint at the dartboard and feel as though he was mils away when it was right there in front of him. But that would mean nothing to someone who was going to hit it regardless.

Ziare threw the kunai with all the strength he could muster and hit fairly close to the dartboard. When th eKunai hit it would signify a new mmet for Ziare, amomet where he could use this jutsu effectively.* - Fri Nov  6 18:16:32 2015
