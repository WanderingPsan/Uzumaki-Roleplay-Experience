<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) dropped to one knee and began to inspect the battlefield before the fight started. He had faught him many times before and knew it like the back of his hand. As the man ran at him he created a handseal and manipulated his own shadow out towards him to catch him and snag him like a fish.

If he was unable to catch the man before he went invisible he would curse from annoyance and extend 7 more shadows out at any possible areas the man could be at. He knew that he could not be traveling fast since he had went silent, if he was runing he would be able to hear the man. With that bit of knowledge the shadows would close in like sharks on the possible location of Nigen.* - Wed Dec  2 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had gotten up, he had to go through the motions now as all of his shadows came together to one that would connect Nigen with him. He would stand there with his hands in his pocket and look directly at the man. 

"From here, it's pretty simple, how do you wanna lose?" he would ask the man.

Of course he was not looking for a direct answer and would weave a short series of handseals almost instantly, his fingers were lightning fast. From there he would just manipulate his shadows even further. A black hand would begin to creep up the body of Nigen and would grip onto the man's neck squeezing. The chakra inside of the hand made it physical, meaning the hand had physical properties, things were no longer just shadows.* - Wed Dec  2 05:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Impressive - Wed Dec  2 05:58:24 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Z thats enough... - Wed Dec  2 06:04:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) felt Nigen's intent to kill and it took him aback, his eyes widened and his heart began to race a bit. The grip from the shadow would waver a bit as he was losing a bit of his focus. He quickly moved to his back pocket to pull out deadly weapons, he was prepared to truely kill the man until he heard Rias's voice. He calmed down just enough to get a hold of himself and released the jutsu. He let out a deep breath and walked back to Rias's side with his hand's in his pocket. 

"Good spar.." he said un enthusiastically, he truly truely hated having to fight other people.* - Wed Dec  2 06:06:56 2015

Tightening it even further until the heads of the dummies popped clean off. He would then resew the heads back o with  a flick of his wrists using the shadows that stemmed from the dummies.
