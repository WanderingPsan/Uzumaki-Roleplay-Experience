<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would continue walking down the road trying to ignore the roadblock as he neared it. He used everything in his power to not look directly at them or else he might be sucked into the trouble as well seeing as what hapened to him the other day with the same kid.* - Sat Oct 31 22:46:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had noticed them starting a convorsation now, it didn't seem deadly in the least bit. He would keep his hands in his pocket an continue walking until he reached the corner, he still did not acknowledge them or even look at them, he was just trying to mind his own business.* - Sat Oct 31 22:48:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) turned back around to begin leaving the area and head back north. He just needed to get back to where he started.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But i'm forced to, I have to abide by military laws. - Sat Oct 31 23:07:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I can understand that but, it just helps to not come off that way. - Sat Oct 31 23:07:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I've already created 3 ways of stopping him from harming me if he attacks fom mid to close range. - Sat Oct 31 23:10:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But they are all situational. - Sat Oct 31 23:10:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: At the very least one would work. - Sat Oct 31 23:10:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Lets go to the mansion. - Sat Oct 31 23:11:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded his head and replied with a firm, "Right..." with that he would turn on his heel ad begin walking back tot he courtyard. He dug into his pocket for the new book of the day, it read 'Shinobi 3' It was a part of a series that he enjoyed that glorified shinobi in an era of samurai.* - Sat Oct 31 23:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) layed in the grass nonchalntly as he would go from reading his book to watching the shadows from the tree's leaves dance from the sun every time the wind blew them. It was one of his favorite past times and he loved the melodic way they danced.* - Sat Oct 31 23:14:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) continued to train in themiddle of the trainign field. He would begin by creating the handseal he needed and casting out his own shadow through the area. The shadow would becircalized around him before he would be able to control it to his liking.

Once he had it cast out he would be able to begin testing new theoruies that he had to explain to himself what his shadows could do and what they would be capable of. His shadow began by sliding into the shade of a nearby tree before casting back out at an equal range, he noded to himself. This made sense.* - Sun Nov  1 01:29:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) now needed to see if it worked on inanimate objects. If it managed to work on them as well he could immagine plenty of new setups that could ensure him a powerful shadow and open up dozens of new strategies. At this time of day he knew were the shade would reach out from the walls, he would extend his shadow to that point.

Once the shadow was at that point he would guide it through the shade, and to his liking as long as there were other shadows, his own shadow would be able to keep moving due to the sunlight not stopping it. But this meant that he had to expend more chakra to do so. It was a bitch to keep this up, he would need to work on this.

He had the shadow appear from the other side of the training field and head towards the anvil's shadow before heading back to him. But to his dismay he had just ran out of shade and his shadow had stopped short like an elastic band. "Fuck..." he said while sweating from the exersion.

Ziare released the seal and his shadow burnt back into nothing, the dark black mark under his returned to light black color of a normal shadow and he sat down on a small mound of dirt to relax himself. He had been training longer than he normally did due to wanted to learn the secret behin the technique.* - Sun Nov  1 01:38:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Sun Nov  1 01:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You're here? - Sun Nov  1 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had a set of shurikens and began to toss them off two by two. The object of the training was to learn how to rapid fire the shurikens in a way where he could constantly use his Kage Shuriken ability. He had to watch the shadow under the shuriken closely to make sure that he wasn't missing anything.

Once again Ziare threw his shurikens in a way to ensure how the shadow under the shuriken would travel, it wa vital to know where it was so that he could better hide the shuriken under the shadow of the first.

Once he got a feeling where the shadow was under the shuriken he would once again throw the shuriken but before throwing it he would map the way the shadow would travel in his mind. One he released the shuriken his guess was correct for how the shuriken would travel and how the shadow would travel.* - Sun Nov  1 04:41:10 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hey. - Sun Nov  1 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Welcome back. - Sun Nov  1 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Did'jya have fun? - Sun Nov  1 08:46:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) decided it would be best if he would just go back to his training like he normally did. Ziare had created a single handseals and let his own shadow burst to life as it would glide across the ground into the middle of the field that he was training in. Once it hit the middle it dissapeared from the sun's powerful rays.

"Damn" he cursed as he had forgotted what happened when you let the sun blast over the shadow, the result would be a practically void shadow imitation technique. He had to improve, no, he needed to improve if he was going to get any better in the first place so he went back to his squat and crated the handseals once again.

The shadow would squiggle off into the trees right by the shade. He had learneed that he could increase the distance of his shadow as long as he had some type of shadow to refresh the distance it could travel. He immaged it would work on other's shadows as well but that was a theory to test for another day.

The shadow would then go to the very middle of the field with the help of the trees to refesh the distance. The shadow would then connect with the scarecrow that sat in the middle of the training field and their shadows would be connected, the long squiggle that would usually chase it's enemies would streaighten out.

Now Ziare could test his final theory if the imitation worked on inanimate objects as well. He would begin to move a bit, but the scarecrow would not. He was kind of annoyed with himself for thinking that somethig like this would work, but it was better to test things and expirience them not work then to be suprised in the middle of battle.* - Sun Nov  1 22:10:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) began to play with his shadow imitation jutsu, he would run it aroud himself in a cirle creating a wierd spiral shape around himself. He would stop after a couple seconds more intent on keeping his chaka reserves high than anything else.* - Sun Nov  1 22:13:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was sneak attacked, he recognized that voice anywhere, his voice resembled a sour face as if he had just drank an enitre carton of bad milk. His mind screamed, "Damn!!!" as he was attacked.

"What do you want Rias?" he would ask in his usual skulky voice, as if he was too bored to even act upbeat.* - Mon Nov  2 07:46:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's eye was twitching from the stress of having to deal with too many people today. He would adress Ketsuki first, no particular reason, "This isn't just any girl, she's an old childhood friend of mine...And i'm almost always bummed, havent you noticed" 

Turning around in his chair if he was able he would then address Rias, "I don't wear my hear up, or my...clothes...Outside of the manor...I don't exactly like to.." he told her although she would probably get the gist since she knew him for so long.* - Mon Nov  2 07:52:44 2015
