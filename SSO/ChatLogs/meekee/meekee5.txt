<br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Practice you jutsu - Fri Nov  6 18:17:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) went back to the jutsu, he would kick it up a level and test his control to see if it was where it needed to be. He would hold out two Kunai that were adjacent to each other and close his eyes.

With his eyes now closed he would begin to channel chakra through them getly. He just needed to get the smallest bit of chakra to add the effect he was going for.

With his chakra addded to the kunais he wouldnt notice either of them beggining to turn blue from the amount of chakra that he was using, only that they were vibrting a bit.

He spun the kunai around his index fingers quickly as he searched for the targets one again. Quickly finding the he would throw one of them at the target and hit it.

He would move or strafe a bit to the left before throwin the other kunai and hitting the target dead on with very little effort. He had done what he needed, he was a borderline master of this skill.* - Fri Nov  6 18:31:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would pull the kunai out from the wall as he had concocted a plan that he could easily use on any of his targets. He would channel chakra through the blades as he pulled them out.

He would then whip around extremely quickly as he moved he would throw the blades in conjunction with his moving body at the floor not aimed at Rias but aronud her area.

Itt was a quick motion and it proved to be successful as far as what he was going for. He picked up the kunai and placed em back into his holster. This was exactly what he wanted as far as wha he was going for.

He sat back down to get a drink of tea nd relax a bit as he had just mastered his next jutsu, now he only had one more to go before he would begin to master techniques he did not need.* - Fri Nov  6 18:57:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked at th shuriken on the desk and how they were laid out. He nodded to himself as he looked over each and every shuriken. He knew that he would have to learn certain combos with the shuriken that would make sense in the long run.

As he thought over some of the combos with the shuriken he had a few thoughts pop into his mind. from those thoughts he could immagine some combos to pull off. 

He didn't want to start his training back up so soon after he had ust sat down so he would begin to picture the art of throwing his shurikens properly. Each thought of a  throw added some immagination.

He woul spin and hold every shuriken seperately as he looked over it and smiled at every one of the individual pieces that made it what it was. He enjoyed just analysing things, it was what made him happy.

At the end of the day he was done looking at metal and decided it was time for him to relax and take a quick nap, here was no reason to stay awake with such low chakra reserves.* - Fri Nov  6 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) woke back up and went through the shurikens he was inspecting and analyzing earlier. They were still on his desk and they still did intrigue him greatly. He would spin one through the hoop on his finger.

Getting up he decided it was time to train once again and begin mastering this next technique. He needed to if he was going to improe in the slightest bit anyway. Ziare smiled for once.

Cocking back his arm he threw the shurikens in a way to hide the first under the  other's shadow. He messed it up a bit and the bottom shuriken would sway out of the alignment o the first shuriken.

Ziare cursed at him himself as he had messed up the jutsu and gripped the next two shuriken in a way where he could practice a bit more just like before. He stared at the target and began again.

Ziare tossed the shurikens 1 by 1 as he aimed to hit the target, this time the shuriken on the bottom swayed a bit before hitting the target, it came from under the shadow and was seen as well.

This screwed up his technique yet again and made him want to yell out of frusteration but he kept it inside and not on the outside. He hated when things wouldn't cooperate.* - Sat Nov  7 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) got back to work on his training. Ziare stood up and spun the shurikens inbetween his fingers as he stared at the dartboard he would begin training on. he let out a bit of a sigh.

"I just want to get this ucing technique down so I have soemthing to use.." he said to himself as hestared at the dartboard he had been training on for so long now.

Ziare ducked down and threw the shurikens with a majority of his strength once again with intentions of hittig the board with both of them but the lower one hitting closer to the bullseye.

And like before he ad made the bottom shuriken sway off and miss the shadow of the shuriken on top. He cursed to hismelf yet again even though this time he had hit the bulleyes.

If he wasn't skilled enogh to do this, he wuldn't be skilled enough to do many things. He cursed and sat back down for a bit to relax himself before strting back up with more training.* - Sat Nov  7 01:06:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Cool. - Sat Nov  7 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grasped a couple of his kunai and would begin tossing them at the dart board oneby one just nailing different parts of the boad. He was truely getting a lot better at this than before.

HE could even go as far as channeling chakra into the shurikens and throwing them at shaows to pin down the shadows of people and trap them in traps they would never expect.

Once he was finished with the basics of everything he  scratched the back of his head completely satisfied with what he had done with the jutsu. He would look towards Rias to see if she wanted to get something to eat for the time being aswell. 

Ziare would pull each of his shuriken out of the dat board already knowing that he could finally pull of the Shadow Shuriken technique as well. When he depostied his weapons he would lead the way to the ramen shop.* - Sat Nov  7 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would order some regular ramen, he was in the mood for something simple.* - Sat Nov  7 02:24:38 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) got his food and ate it like it was the most boring thing he could do, and to him it might as well be. He looked over towards Rias and spoke up at her, "Y'know, we've been eatin out a lot lately..." before going back to his food.* - Sat Nov  7 02:38:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let her learn her head agaisnt him, he was too tired to protest at this point. He heard her talk about having a child and just shook his head at her. "You probably don't want a kid, they are annoying." he would say casually as he continued to eat.* - Sat Nov  7 02:56:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) contrasted Rias perfectly, he came off as mopey or bored most of the time in contrast to her energetic self. He also seemed reserved and to himself while she was bubbly and full of life.* - Sat Nov  7 04:01:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) smiled as he picked up on all of the consellations in the sky and began pointing them out and sharing them with Rias by naming each and every one that he saw. He noticed them quickly but pointed them out slowly for Rias so that she could keep up with him.* - Sat Nov  7 05:01:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I bet. - Sat Nov  7 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It really makes you feel insinificant. - Sat Nov  7 05:18:43 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Like manipulating it? - Sat Nov  7 05:29:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Whats so special about it - Sat Nov  7 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) points to a bright star in the sky, "All times of year it never moves and it stays due north, so you could follow it and know where you are at all times, it sits on the pan of the big dipper there, y'see?" he would ask as he pointed this all out one star afteranotehr.* - Sat Nov  7 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) smiled as he continued to inspect the stars, "That one is Orion, that's his belt, those are the Cassiopiea, Herekles, and Taurus!" He could easily keep firing them off one after another just filling Rias in, he was enjoying teaching others about what he wanted his trade to be.* - Sat Nov  7 05:46:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) allowed her to move closer to him, he just suspected she wanted to get a better view of what he was talking about. He would continue to name the consellations and point to them. He'd turn his head for a moment to see if she was still paying attention. He didn't realize how close she was and he may have breathed on her a bit, his glasses fell off of his face a bit. He would need to straighten them.* - Sat Nov  7 06:24:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) watched as she began to lead in her head and he put his finger to her forehead to stop her from getting too close.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: Don't have to be today or tommorow. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:00 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Aden(TenaciousDeeznuts) says: Hm, and you're a coward. - Sat Nov  7 19:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: Violence from an argument. I'd expect that from Kojiro..guess he really is from Kumo. - Sat Nov  7 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Let's not fight. - Sat Nov  7 19:47:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had to intervene or else they may all get into some type of trouble. He moved foreward towards the two a bit and acted. Ziare wasn't quick enough on the draw to catch Kyushiki right away so he would likely get his jutsu off, but he wasn't slow either. He would manipulate the tree's shadow that touched his foot to reel out and catch him before he could toss any of the shurikens at Aden.

Meanwhile he reeled a second shadow out to catch Aden completely by suprise, if the boy aimed to moved out of the path of the bubbles he would let him but tighten the restriction on the shadow immitation technique as soon as he was out of harms way to bind him as well.* - Sat Nov  7 20:06:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had noticed what the bubbles had done from the effect of them on Aden, he would continue to manipulate the shadow to catch Aden as it continued to move foreward still fairly fast. Meanwhile he would pull out a kunai and toss it when the bubble got into his aiming range to pop it, those cuaht in his shadow would mimic him but wouldn't hit anything.

If he had finally managed to catch everyonein his shadow he would begin to speak up to explain his intentions, "So you two can fight, but you can't fight here, take it to the training arena or somewhere else, it's already a pain you made me jump in..." He seemed more upset he had to work rather than the two fighting.* - Sat Nov  7 20:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) released the jutsu and they would be free as soon as they were caught, most likely only noting the effects but not having paid attention to him, they would still have very minimal knowledge over his jutsu and abiltiies. He would walk off with the entire scene calmed down and lie against a tree as he straightened his glasses and continued reading. They were lucky Laxu-..Zues wasn't here to dish out his own form of punishment.* - Sat Nov  7 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) heald out his kunai in front of his face and smiled at it, this time he would learn to do his next new jutsu, a jutsu that he had been speculating could work for a long amount of time now.

The jutsu would combine elements of 2 jutsu that he had already known and used a lot at this point. He would somehow find a way to combine his Shadow immitation jutsu with his kunais.

Ziare would have to channel chakra into his kunai s that he could manipulate it. The whole purpose was to be able to manipulate long range shadows and hrow his enemy off.

Ziare threw his kunai into the shadow of a nearby tree, he had ran his chakra through a majority of the kunai as it slammed into the ground into the shade provided by the tree.

He would create a handseal and channled the chakra long distancely, a shadow would appear from under the kunai and would reel its way towards him.

The shadow would b far slower than the shadow that he could control when he used it from himself, but it moved towards him nonetheless. He smiled as it came closer and closer to him.

As he finally got the shadow to himself he dissaparated it and let out a sigh. He would have to work on the speed.* - Sun Nov  8 02:58:20 2015
