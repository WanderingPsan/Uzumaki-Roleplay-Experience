<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) blushed a bit under the table, his mind was racing, he never expected her to accept the offer. He had barely even pushed her, what was happening to her.* - Tue Dec  8 04:35:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: There's no way she accepted this.. - Tue Dec  8 04:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ... - Tue Dec  8 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let out a deep sigh and laid back down. HE mumbled loudly under his breath, if she was paying attention she would hear him.* - Tue Dec  8 04:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That one actually hurt...*mumbled* - Tue Dec  8 04:45:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) put his palm to his face softly and tried to explain himself as best as he could. "It was a mistake, but it was only brief and not lewd...Uhm..I'm talking too much...I apologize and it won't happen again.." he ended his small explanation hoping to atleast be looked upon in a better light.* - Tue Dec  8 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . .  - Tue Dec  8 04:48:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) got up and went to the fridge where he had some ingriedients to make his strange but unique tasting medleys that Saika probably would be used to by now. He made a good sized portion in a bown and set it down between the two, he had two smaller bowls laced on the table and grabbed one. She would probably not be shy to start eating if she was hungry and Ziare would dig right in.* - Tue Dec  8 04:51:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) continued to eat and let her go tot he room to do as she pleased. There was nothing he could do for her at the moment and she was probably still a bit mad at him for his comments earlier.* - Tue Dec  8 04:59:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had peered over towards the door, he walked over towards it knowing that he was going to get shit for this from her later. Manipulating the shadows in the locks, he used his precise chakra control to push the teeth of the locks together with the small shadow tendrils he had formed. IT would unlock the door and allow him to pop his head in with his eyes closed. (He knew the drill). 

"Are you okay Saika?" he asked, his tone more tired than worried.* - Tue Dec  8 05:07:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) didn't hear an answer and assumed that she was still asleep, he took a dangerous peek to make sure she was truely okay, it could have been an emergency and to his luck everything would be good gravy. He would close the door back and begin walking back towards his bowl cleaning it in the dish washer.* - Tue Dec  8 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had realized what he had heard and his eyes blasted open with the quickness. He walked quickly over towards her and first the first time he would touch her without her expressed consent. He laid the back of his hand onto her forehead, his hand was cool and smelled like some random flower scent from the dish soap. He was making sure she was not having a fever, it was completely possible that she was.* - Tue Dec  8 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) began to panic a bit on the inside, he had no idea what to do, but he had to act quickly. "Sh-sh-shhh...I'm here with you, your friend, just calm down." he said in the most soothing voice he could muster. All the while he rubbed her shoulder to try and help her calm down a bit.* - Tue Dec  8 05:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had run out of ideas and retracted from her as he sat down and took a deep breath. He focused his mind on the issue at hand and began to process the many different ways he could help her without having to jerperdize her privacy. She would most likely wake up in a panic with him sitting right by her in a weird trans-like state.* - Tue Dec  8 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) heard her cry out for help and something in his head triggered him to stand up, he stared at the woman and had to decide between two option, he would never hop into bed with her without her consent. He gently treid to wake her up from her dream and get her attention now, doing anything he could to get her up without causing any discomfort.* - Tue Dec  8 05:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) fell to his knees and let out a breath of releif to see that she was alright, she had scared the living shit out of him and it was obvious. He had dealt with bijuu, but he felt less scared then, than he did now. "Saika...If you're going to sleep again...Please let me help you.." he was trying to catch his breath for the most part now.* - Tue Dec  8 05:59:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked at her and watched her roll over, he was usually very easy going and didn't argue much with her. He beleived in the philospphy of a limber tree wont break. But he was adamant with this, "You scared me as much as you were scared by that nightmare, don't you see me shaking?" 

He let out a deep breah and laughed a bit at himself, he must have changed over the course of this year. 

"Listen, I can barely see, I won't think lewd or make a move or anything, just let me help you as a friend" he tried to explain. There was a hint of desepration in his tone knowing how adamant she could be.* - Tue Dec  8 06:06:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) joined her in bed, he was fully clothed aside from shoes. He respected her and her personal space so he would not touch her immidietly. He would just say, "I'm here with you now, so relax. Whatever your nightmare is, it's nothing compared to the travels we've been through." he just wanted to giver her some confidence.* - Tue Dec  8 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) knew what he had to do and kept everything under control and calculation. if he was able to he would slide his arm a bit under her and bring her slihtly closer to him, mainly moving himself as he brought himself in close. He tried to even his own breathing with her to further try and calm her down.* - Tue Dec  8 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was beggining to doze off but heard her cry for help, it was like a red alert for him making him jump into action, his mind was foggy now but he remembered bits and pieces of what he had to do. She was close to him now, but that wasn't enough to calm her down, he tried to think of the most calming thing for him and it was a low hum of the same tune that he hummed occaisonally on the journeys. But now he would be singing the words, it was ment to be a lulaby to calm children and put them to sleep.* - Tue Dec  8 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's friend would have moved in a bit closer than he would have liked. He finally understood why she did not want to do this the entire time. Women were like this a lot he guessed, but he kept it cool of course.

Now in any situation, 10/10 times, Ziare would have chosen a heart attack in any other situation than the scream he had just heard. His body jerked tight around hers for a moment from pure reaction before he began to calm down. He felt like a bomb had just hit him. He sat there close to Saika, his main priority now was just to calm down as she seemed to keep going through these symptoms. * - Tue Dec  8 06:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was beggining to chill out as well, it seemed the screaming was over and she was just laying on him like a pillow. He changed his breathing patterns to match hers more evenly so that she would have a nice easy time. He stared up at the cieling and began to count the tiles on the cieling to just relax himself.

He listened to her speak and it caught him off guard at first, he did not expect her to be like this when she relaxed herself. He looked at her from what he could see without his glasses was a slight smile, he had finally felt like his day was made.* - Tue Dec  8 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) knew that he would regret this in the morning, but with some sleep maybe the girl would be a bit less grumpy. He moved himself as close as he could get sharing body heat with her. It was probably not all that much better, but it would do since they were laying on top of covers. He would try to jiggle his free arm to the covers and fold wat he could over her legs. If she showed and sign of waking up, he would stop moving immidietly. He worked like a bomb squad agent.* - Tue Dec  8 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had finally felt at peace for the first time in a long time. She had said aloud to never leave her and in his tired state he mistook it for him. "I wont..." he said as he drifted away. His peaceful aura radiating from him in spaces helping him and Saika both sleep pleasantly for the rest of the night.* - Tue Dec  8 07:40:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would continue to lay on the bed, he had lost his cuddle partner and grasped at air until his hands touched something that he could use like a pillow. He seemed to be sleeping just fine now.* - Tue Dec  8 07:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was woken up and he wiped his eyes, he barely knew what had happened last night until it all flooded into his mind. "Jeez..." he said to himself as he got up. "Can I take a shower first?" he asked her.* - Tue Dec  8 07:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: No. - Tue Dec  8 08:01:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Damn.... - Tue Dec  8 08:02:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Give me a sec. - Tue Dec  8 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) changed the clothes that he needed to before leaving as well.* - Tue Dec  8 08:02:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Ready? - Tue Dec  8 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Of course. - Tue Dec  8 08:03:50 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .We can't go to Kirigakure right? You aren't welcome. . .Konoha I'm unwelcome. . .here us. . .sandy. . .That mess with Kumo. . . - Tue Dec  8 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: What options are left? - Tue Dec  8 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I mean... - Tue Dec  8 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We can travel through the woods for a bit. - Tue Dec  8 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .Works for me. - Tue Dec  8 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Cool. - Tue Dec  8 08:05:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kinami Hassan(Ninasky115) says: I can't help but think she's named after me. Haha. - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Manami(JustTheTip) says: Zzzz... - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Hrm? It was Mizora's idea. - Tue Dec  8 08:06:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) came to the gate and prepared to leave, he had caused no trouble and stayed on the low the entire time, he should have had no trouble leaving.* - Tue Dec  8 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Let's go. . .I didn't realize they were friends with Rias. . .I didn't exactly feel welcome after my story anyway. - Tue Dec  8 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) stopped by a river. He was tired after just having walked out of the entire desert. He stared at the pool of water and looked back at his company. "Do you know how to walk on water?" he asked her.* - Tue Dec  8 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you know basic taijutsu techniques? - Tue Dec  8 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 08:16:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So you can barely defend yourself? - Tue Dec  8 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .I use my ow- My families? Varition of combat. . . - Tue Dec  8 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's fine, but you should still know the fundamentals to defend yourself. - Tue Dec  8 08:17:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . .Maybe. - Tue Dec  8 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll show you them, just try not to go too crazy with them. - Tue Dec  8 08:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) pulled out a slip of paper and handed it to her, he would tell her how it was usd shortly after, "Channel a bit of chakra into it and i'll tell you what it is."* - Tue Dec  8 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded his head, "Lightning.." he told her.* - Tue Dec  8 08:26:01 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) just played his flure softly by the river side, if Saika paid attention to him she would feel a calming aura carress her. If not then she would expirience nothing as usual.* - Tue Dec  8 08:32:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) channeled chakra to the soles of his feet and began to walk along the surface of the water. He had exellent chakra control and was able to do it without thinking. 

"If you try, be careful, you're gonna fall in your first few times, put on the shirt I gave you so you don't get your dress wet." he said to he trying to look out for her.* - Tue Dec  8 17:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) kept his back to her only listening to her, every time he heard a pissed off comment he could laugh a bit. It was how he knew that she was okay and not in any real danger or pain. All the while he was setting up a fire and by the time she fell in the second time, he would just be feeding the fire to make it larger and hotter.

He would look back at her, "Uhm, use an old shirt of mine." he said to her regarding the towel. If she had found one he would wave her over by the fire to dry off.* - Tue Dec  8 18:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: What ever. - Tue Dec  8 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) went to his bag and pulled out a poorly made fishing rod and he begins to fish in the small river.* - Tue Dec  8 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: This is tough... - Tue Dec  8 18:48:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) did not ignore her at all, he was just fishing to keep himself busy. He had realized that lately there was a bit of tension between the two. He caught what she had said to him and looked over wide eyed, but she had already walked off. He was shaking now, but he didn't understand why, "Woah..." he said to himself.* - Tue Dec  8 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) didn't look back at her as he fished in the lake. He didn't think he could look back at her right now. He just fished and fished knowing that he had no bait so he would not catch anything. He was visibly shaking a bit still, if Saika had sneaked any looks she would seem him. He didn't even notice as his mind raced like dale earnhart trying to regain his barrings. * - Tue Dec  8 19:00:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had been hit with an apple and began to come back. He felt like he had expirienced a bit of a rush. He picked up the apple and wiped it on his shirt before taking a bite out of it. "Y-yeah.." he replied not really knowing what he was eplying to.* - Tue Dec  8 19:06:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You can see the small sillouette of the mountain up north. - Tue Dec  8 19:07:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Huh? - Tue Dec  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I heard the story of a bird that would come every year to sharped it's beak on the mountain. - Tue Dec  8 19:08:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: My mother told me over the course of a couple centuries, the bird would reduce the mountain to rubble. - Tue Dec  8 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So I never thought what an incredible mountain, but what an incredible bird.. - Tue Dec  8 19:09:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That was from a book I was reading...Nature really is incredible. - Tue Dec  8 19:10:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Tue Dec  8 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had looked up at her as she stood behind him. He was wondering what truely had gotten into her since she never did this any other time. He felt another rush once again, but he could not muster a word.* - Tue Dec  8 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had gotten patted on the head and complimented, she would be able to see him deeply blush as she patted him. "Thanks..." he forced out of what felt like a knot in his throat.

He pulled his pole from the water and stared up at the sky to watch the clouds roll by.* - Tue Dec  8 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You wanna keep walking? - Tue Dec  8 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: We can. .  - Tue Dec  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Okay... - Tue Dec  8 20:13:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) packed everything up and would put out the fire that was going on in the pit. He started to walk off looking to her for a moment to see if she would follow. Now that she had learned the suimen ability they would take far less time to trek to different areas seeing as they did not have to travel around bodies of water.* - Tue Dec  8 20:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would continue to walk towards the east aimlessly, he lokked back at her and spoke, "So where do you wanna go, or think we should go?" he asked her before staring foreward once again. He had to make sure everything was alright for the group. His head was filled with confused thought as well, but he was a bit less skilled at hiding them.* - Tue Dec  8 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let out a low sigh, there werent many places like that anymore for the both of them. He had figured out about the posible threat of war and knew thay they needed to stay out of harms way. Thoughts of Saika being injured because of his negligence entered his mind and he grit his teeth. That's something that he would not let happen, he was begginign to learn a lot more about himself as a person.* - Tue Dec  8 20:28:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had remembered that it was the dress that he had picked out himself. He spoke up towards her answering her back as usual, "I picked it out because you would look good in it." he said simply. Then he realized what he had said and shock filled his body for a moment, but he kept it cool on the outside like he had learned.* - Tue Dec  8 20:37:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) heard her stop moving, he was on the recieving end now. He took a deep breath and turned around forming the best poker face that he could. "I thought it would look nice on you." he said as simply as he could so it would not be taken the wrong way.* - Tue Dec  8 20:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had felt similar to her in the fact that he was changing, he was beggining to figure out why he was feeling like this though since he confronted his feeling far more openly and often than Saiko did. Seeing her become a bit dissapointed resulted in him losing interest and just continuing on. He spoke up again, not looking at her directly, "If you get tired, we can stop." he said to her, still openly looking out for her.* - Tue Dec  8 20:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) may as well have had the hearing perk by now having been with her,he was always listening close to what she said and caught the first part. He looked back to her for a moment, "That makes no sense.." he'd say passively as he continued to walk, slowing down the pace just a bit.* - Tue Dec  8 21:02:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) may as well have had the hearing perk by now having been with her,he was always listening close to what she said and caught the first part.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would just continue to keep walking, the two had seemingly gone silent now once again. With the pace slightly slower than before Ziare chose less rough paths for her to walk on to make the trip a bit easier for the two.* - Tue Dec  8 22:47:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let out a deep sigh, he had nearly been traveling with this woman for 2 years, in a sense they were growing up with each other. "Isn't it obvious? You're my best  friend..." he said simply. He said it as if it was there the entire time, as if they both knew it.* - Tue Dec  8 22:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded his head as she spoke, "Best friend." he assured her to get his message across towards her.* - Tue Dec  8 23:04:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) heard his name called a bit and looked up, "Let's just both stop bottling everything up, i'm gonna say something and you might not like me when I do..." he said, that alone took a lot of the confidence he had to fake.* - Wed Dec  9 00:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) put his hands to his face and dragged his hands across his face as he thought of a clever way to say what he had to say. He was red with embarassment and his whole body was hot. He could feel himself persperating but he had to be a man and get through it. He opened his mouth and spoke, "I have no idea what love is, only passion..." he ran his hands through his hair nervously over and over again. His voice was wavering constantly, it was tough for him to get it out. "But Saika...I think I might be falling for you a bit.." ....* - Wed Dec  9 00:29:26 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Huh? - Wed Dec  9 00:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) saw that she was crying, but there was no frown anymore, just a bit of a happy look. He felt like a weight had been lifted off of him and excitement welled up inside of his stomach. He felt like this woman was driving him some new type of crazy and he liked it. He fell on his back laughing alightly to himself as he started crying too. He had no idea why he was acting this way.* - Wed Dec  9 00:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked back over at her realizing she was calling him, he wiped his face and spoke up, "Yeah?" his voice was even once again, he was calming down a lot now.* - Wed Dec  9 01:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) got up with no hessitation and kneeled in front of her. He looked at her and smiled, his eyes and face still a bit red from crying or embarrassment, it could go both ways. "Yeah?" he asked.* - Wed Dec  9 01:07:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was hugged and he held her to him tightly as well. When she spoke and couldn't completely get it out he laughed again. "It's alright, I get it..." he told her. He would let her pull away and hide behind the tree. He would stay on the other side and just relax against the trees. He felt crazy, but oddly at peace, his aura being released again. He begancalming down a bit, but still could feel her touch like she was still in his arms.* - Wed Dec  9 01:13:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) skipped his last rock before dropping the rest and returning to Saika's side. He would sit next to her but wouldn't look at her, he didn't know if he could yet.* - Wed Dec  9 03:04:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had his hand grabbed and he looked her his hand to her. He smiled and leaned in just a small bit before looking back at the river and watching it flow, even though it was beggining to get harder as the day was coming to an end.* - Wed Dec  9 03:14:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) squeezed her hand a bit, not enough to hurt her, and took a deep breath. "Yeah, I promise you'll sleep just fine..." he said* - Wed Dec  9 03:25:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) blushed a bit, he would gain a bit of confidence to look right at her, he didn't expect her to look at him, "If you wanna be, I-I wouldn't mind that..."* - Wed Dec  9 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) smiled at her, his stomach felt like there were a bunch of butterflys were in them. He scooted closer to her. "Yeah, I want to." he told her. He liked being closer to her, it was like feelings of immaturity were blossoming into more mature feelings.* - Wed Dec  9 03:38:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) enjoyed holding her close, he liked having her close to him. He continued looking at the river as she began to make her jokes with him. He couldn't help but laugh, because it was true. 

"I've been dealing with you for this long now, i'll deal with you for all the years to come. I'm not going anywhere and as long as you arent, i'll keep dealing with you." he told her still giggling.* - Wed Dec  9 03:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) did what he was told and just stayed quiet. He was used to how she talked to him already and thought nothing of it, he was too passive to care and just considered it a way that she showed affection. It was better to think that way in the long run. When she coughed he asked her if she was okay.* - Wed Dec  9 04:02:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) hugged her into him as he sat by the coast f the river watching the water. He was eminating tranquility and he began to feel like if he had her around, he could manage to stay tranquil, with her around he wouldn't have to worry about anything even if the world was ending.* - Wed Dec  9 04:11:18 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) smiled and slipped from her grasp gently, he didn't feel rushed or on edge anymore. The silence that was once full of tension was now a silence that had a lot less tension, albeit a different tension. He began to set up camp like he normally did, these past couple years were some of the best in his life.* - Wed Dec  9 07:17:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What do you like about me? - Wed Dec  9 07:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would continue to set up the tent and camp, he went at it with a moderate pace and would end up finishing fairly quickly. He let everything she had said sink into him and it made him feel warm. She really did like him back and he couldn't help but smile a bit. As always he respected her privacy when she told him to shut up, although he just immagined that she was asking him to be quiet, manners werent her strong point.* - Wed Dec  9 07:32:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had finished setting up camp and looked back over at her as she talked to him. "I know you don't meanw hat you say." he said  to her.* - Wed Dec  9 07:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: W-What sort of question is that!? - Wed Dec  9 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You said maybe. - Wed Dec  9 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 08:33:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I wanted to be held first, STUPID. - Wed Dec  9 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Let's just go to sleep. - Wed Dec  9 08:34:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right. - Wed Dec  9 08:34:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked over to Saika and extended an arm out towards her smiling, "Let's go." he'd say to her trying to help her up and walk her to the tent.* - Wed Dec  9 08:41:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) led her into the tent and layed down first. He gave her plenty of space to lay down next to him. "The stars are bright tonight." he said, it being winter, it would have been slightly colder and they would need the covers that were in the tent.* - Wed Dec  9 08:55:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) held onto her of course, he would pull her into him tight, he liked when she was close to him. He was warm and soft, when he had her close he spoke up towards her, "I like having you close.." he said a bit silently. He was still embarrassed to say things like this to her.* - Wed Dec  9 09:04:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had kept her close to him and smiled when she told him to shut up, he was beggining to catch on a bit. He just continuously held her close to him, he didn't want to let her go. Life was short so he wanted to enjoy his times with her while he still could.* - Wed Dec  9 09:20:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) followed close behind to sleep.* - Wed Dec  9 09:24:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: This game is dead - Wed Dec  9 15:13:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Morning... - Wed Dec  9 18:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Moring. . . - Wed Dec  9 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: *morning - Wed Dec  9 18:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: How did you sleep? - Wed Dec  9 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Better. - Wed Dec  9 18:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Good. - Wed Dec  9 18:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Shall we get going to. . where ever we're going? - Wed Dec  9 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah. - Wed Dec  9 18:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) packed everything back up into the bag and hoisted it on his back. He went tot the river to wash off his face before turning to Saika and smiling, "Let's go." he said as he began to walk off with her.* - Wed Dec  9 18:47:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) made it an effort to walk side by side with Saika from this point, he heard what she had said and picked up on the gist of the message. "Yeah, I could teach you a few things, but they ar general things. You'd probably be just as set withouth the knowledge." he told her, obviously having chose his wording carefully.* - Wed Dec  9 18:52:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded his head in reply, "Yeah, i'll show you it all on our next break when we're realxing it, i'm not a half bad teacher." he was thinking over the techniquess that he had to teach her, it had been so long since he had done them that he had almost forgotten how they were used.

When she asked the second question his eyes widened a bit as he remembered the entire purpose of going on this journey was to see the world and find himself. He had learned a lot about himself so there was only one option left. "Just to see the world before I turn 25. When we're done, we're leaf-bound." he said to her. His pace remained slow and easygoing, he had learned to slow the pace they walked at a lot due to her complaining before hand.* - Wed Dec  9 19:07:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was thinking in the present when he heard the question asked by her. He was silent for a few moment before he gave an answer that was just like him. "Just be happy." he told her matter of factly. He realized that might not have been enough of an elaboration so h went on, "You have the best smile...Just be happy, when you're happy, i'm happy." that was the simplest way he could put it he was still a bit embarrassed saying those things, but he was getting used to it by now.* - Wed Dec  9 19:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) continued walking down the path that they had come across. He began to remember how Rias acted around women and how she was a new lesbian. Thoughts of her trying to hit on Saika began to creep into his mind and his eye twitched a bit. He spoke since he hadn't spoken in a bit due to himself thinking.

"I won't let her force you into anything...." he said plain and simply as they walked along the path. Once of the few times he spoke so seriously almost threateningly.* - Wed Dec  9 19:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was stopped with her, his hands in his pockets and when his arm was grabbed he looked over at her only to be kissed on the cheek. He tried not to get flustered around her anymore but he couldn't help it when she did things like this. She was alway so spontanious and it left his shaking a bit from excitement.

She walked past him now and he followed her behind, all the while he was looking at her he couldnt help but think that the greatest woman alive was accompanying him on his journey.* - Wed Dec  9 20:00:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked behind her trying to keep his cool, if she continued doing this, he would be either dead or having a heart attack. When she spoke to him he was regaining his composure and as such could answer appropriately, "Not much longer, I can see the sillouette." he stated as the mountanous gates of  Kumogakure were present.* - Wed Dec  9 20:16:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I am usually used to you. - Wed Dec  9 20:26:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: When you do that...Hahaha I could never get used to it. - Wed Dec  9 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hmph. - Wed Dec  9 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: We'll check a tea place first. - Wed Dec  9 20:27:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: LEt's go. - Wed Dec  9 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: R-Really!? - Wed Dec  9 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Tea~ - Wed Dec  9 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Of course. - Wed Dec  9 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: We really do know each other pretty well...I can't say that's not too nice. - Wed Dec  9 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hmm. - Wed Dec  9 20:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) politely walked up to Takuma, "Excuse me..." he said.* - Wed Dec  9 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you know where the tea shop is? - Wed Dec  9 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Hm. . We don't really have a tea shop here. . .Say. . .Weren't you guys in Sunagakure? - Wed Dec  9 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: N-No Tea? - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhh..At one point. - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: Worthless village. - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: No where here sells tea? - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: At all? - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: Nope. We sell Ramen. - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ...Mmm... - Wed Dec  9 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I see... - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: I kid, I kid. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Phew... - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: We got a tea shop, and a ramen shop in one building. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You had me going there.. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: My bad homie. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Can you point me towaards it? - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I was about to leave. - Wed Dec  9 20:46:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded to Saika and began walking off, "Thanks for the directions."* - Wed Dec  9 20:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takuma(Brosis55) says: You two have fun now. - Wed Dec  9 20:51:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ... - Wed Dec  9 20:53:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) caught the box of condom and just stared at the man, his eyes would not even peer at Saika. 

"Thank you, but I don't think I want these..." he said as calmly as he could. Everything in his body wanted him to run away from the scene, but he managed to keep it cool. 

He offered them back to Takuma, still his eyes did not even peer at  Saika.* - Wed Dec  9 20:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had her walking off now, he knew that she was mad, probably furious and that he would have to talk it out. It was going to be a lot of work, he let out an exhausted huff. <I just wanted to sleep..> he thought to himself as he tried to catch up to her to atleast patch thungs up a bit.* - Wed Dec  9 21:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: S-sorry about that. - Wed Dec  9 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I have no idea what that was about.. - Wed Dec  9 21:07:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: Man, that guy was a real dick.. - Wed Dec  9 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Hmph. - Wed Dec  9 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I know you're mad. - Wed Dec  9 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But, the tea shop is in the opposite direction. - Wed Dec  9 21:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . - Wed Dec  9 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) whispers: (I'll skype you when I get back alright?) - Wed Dec  9 21:11:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Cassi(TigerKitty) says: moping? - Wed Dec  9 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Mhm. - Wed Dec  9 21:22:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Cassi(TigerKitty) says: Okay. - Wed Dec  9 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Cassi(TigerKitty) says: But you are outside. - Wed Dec  9 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Not mopping.. - Wed Dec  9 21:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Cassi(TigerKitty) says: OH.. - Wed Dec  9 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Cassi(TigerKitty) says: Why mope? - Wed Dec  9 21:24:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Because my girlfriend is pretty mad and I probably could have stopped it.. - Wed Dec  9 21:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Cassi(TigerKitty) says: Should give her some flowers. - Wed Dec  9 21:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: That's cheesy. - Wed Dec  9 21:37:29 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I can't say the same for Konoha, but seeing as you didn't know.... You're hardly to blame.. - Wed Dec  9 21:56:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You won't attack me right? - Wed Dec  9 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: No. - Wed Dec  9 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Thank goodness. - Wed Dec  9 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: The war has been over for sometime anyway. - Wed Dec  9 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I practically gave up the shinobi life. - Wed Dec  9 21:57:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minatabi Eiyu(Dragonfile) says: I see.. What do you do now, then? - Wed Dec  9 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I wear this in honor of my late father. - Wed Dec  9 21:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Travel. - Wed Dec  9 21:57:58 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But, what can I say? - Wed Dec  9 21:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let out a sigh of relief knowing that he and his companion would be safe here for the time being without having to fight their way in or out. He exuded peace of mind and body, his very presence was calming to those around him, as he breathed evenly. He extended a hand towards Eiyu, "My name is Ziare." Ziare's voice was even.* - Wed Dec  9 22:01:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded towards the man, he was far too easygoing to push anyone into doing what they were too uncomfortable to do. He instead would bow respectfully towards Eiyu. "Also if you see a woman in a black dress, that would be my campanion, she is not very good socially so please forgive her in my stead." he said.* - Wed Dec  9 22:09:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: ...We're a couple.... - Thu Dec 10 04:50:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) felta sudden headrush when he was kissed on the cheek. He felt invincible for a moment. As she walked away he tried to keep his mond focused on the lake, but let it wander.* - Thu Dec 10 04:53:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's widened for a moment, she had completely caught him off guard. He told her that if she kept this up he would have a heart attack, and he almost did. He didn't let his compusure slip for one second but he would quickly eye her up and down, getting the best possible look he could before he would have to hide his inner male lewdness.

He spoke back to her and smiled a bit, "You'd be suprised that I can be kinda greedy sometimes, I won't let any other person enjoy this other than myself." his words werent meant to be heroic or anything, it was just how he felt, he spoke the truth. Stripping down to his boxers right then and there he would walk near her thinking they were getting into the water.* - Thu Dec 10 05:05:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) struggled to stay under control, but passion was overtaking him. He didn't even know she was capable of filling out the top the way she did. When she looked and spoke to him with dissapointment he replied in the most mindblown tone that one could think of, "You're the most beautiful woman on this planet..." he wasn't choosing his words wisely anymore.

He HAD to get bathing shorts on now or his penis would be seen. He hid it skillfully, all men were capable of doing such. Once he put on a tight pair of underwear to keep his penis in check and some trunks over those he returned to the scene to see her in the water glistening. He had nothing to worry about anymore and hopped into the water.

"Sorry about that, shouldve put some trunks on." he said trying to cover up his excitement and embarrassent.* - Thu Dec 10 05:46:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: ... - Thu Dec 10 05:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) watched her sink into the ocean and knew it was because of something that he had done. But then she began to back away from the area, he knew what this had meant and turned to see, another person standing at the edge of the lake. He walked over towards the man through the water to speak to him, "Hello." he replied in his usual calm tone.* - Thu Dec 10 06:03:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm...Can I ask a favor? - Thu Dec 10 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: Me? of course. - Thu Dec 10 06:13:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) whispers: Could you by chance give us a bit of privacy for 20 minutes,? I know that's a massive request, but i'l do you any favor if you help me out. - Thu Dec 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had a genuine look on his face and an understanding demeanor. He had recognized the man's calmness and felt that he would understand the most of anyone else perhaps, in the village.* - Thu Dec 10 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rotori(Tyrone From State Farm) says: What's your name? - Thu Dec 10 06:19:44 2015
