He looked towards the clouds for a bit as he watched them, he had just realized who Heiwa was and spoke up again.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked not far behind Ortho, his hands were in his pockets and he had a ciggarette in his mouth. He had taken to smoking to deal with a lot of the stress in his life, it wasn't uncommon amongst shinobi. He would see Ortho seemingly lose his cool around the female and raised an eyebrow. Judging from the scenes it seemed she possesed powerful techniques and was easily capable of making the guards seem like children.

Ziare would begin to inspect the woman taking from it what he could. She was tall and judging from the decapitated individuals she was skilled in the use of a spear.* - Sat Nov 21 11:12:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had noticed that Ortho was going into action and he decided to help the man, he had no reason not to help him since this woman was threatening him by association. He would like finish ebefore Ortho would easily eeing as he was only forming one handseal. The shadow cast from the overhand would bolt at the girl, likely not even noticed until it was too late. Not matter what she did the shadow would follow her attempting to ensnare her. If she had gotten caught she would find herself compleely unable to move from her spot. 

This is where Ziare thrived in combat, he was raised to be a support for other fights. His job was easy and simple, and most of the time everythig would follow through extremely well.* - Sat Nov 21 11:28:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Don't hurt her man, she's just a girl, we can all just talk this out... - Sat Nov 21 11:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked into the area and looked at the casualties. He had noticed that plenty laid dead on the ground, even Hatsujin who was frequently so over excited. It was kinda sad seeing as he was the one who always wanted to have the most fun.* - Sat Nov 21 22:21:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walked over towards Ortho and patted him on the back. "He's gone man, but look at his face, he's content..." Ziare pointed to the guitar in the boy's hands. "He died with no rerets Ortho." he tried to assure the man before looking over at his girlfriend, the anorexic goth chick. 

HE wuld attempt to pick her up and leave her somewhee in doors that would be a lot safer for her to manage.* - Sat Nov 21 22:44:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had Eri over his shoulder as he walked back to the house to keep her safer than out here. He looked at Menma and listened to what he had to say, he would only reply with one short sentence backat the boy. "The first step to overcoming your weaknes is acknowledging it..."

With that he would walk into the building to stick  Eri.* - Sat Nov 21 22:56:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) saw the woman was beggining to wake up when he laid her down on the bed. He knew that he could not risk her getting up out of bed without getting checked so he withdrew a kunai and channeled his chakra through it, a lot of it. He jabbed it into the matress right on her shadow. She would find herself unable to move until all of the chakra was drained from the kunai.

"Now I want you to go to sleep, and stay asleep until we find someone to help treat your wounds, you're gonna be looked after because you're Ortho's girlfriend." With that he would stick his hands in his pockets and begin to leave the building. Women were so annoying to him, they always needed some type of protection.* - Sat Nov 21 23:03:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had left with that, he knew that she would have to calm down eventually and when she calmed down and her heart rate slowed, she would be fast asleep.* - Sat Nov 21 23:07:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked over at Ortho. He saw the man was still freaking out over the dead. He remembered when he first saw his grandma on the streets dead, she was killed for her purse by a common thief, the emotion that brought on still effected him to this day. His hands gritted from anger at the thief and at Ortho. Although his next actions would be projection in a sense, there was still plenty of logic in his thoughts.

"Ortho, you need to pull it together, even if you have to fake it. Everyone here relies on you, if you sit there and act defeated everyone will be defeated as well." He was beggining to tear up a bit, he needed to pull it together as well, his grit his teeth and with everything he had he kept the tears back. "ORTHO, your girlfriend is in there and needs medical help, there are dozens of bodies on the ground and everyone is fucking terrified!!!" His voice broke....

"I don't care if you fake it just pull it together for 20 minutes and get everthig back in order." He needed to turn away and get his feelings back under control. He wa ssupposed to be a soldier who never lost his composure, even with the weight of the world on his shoulders...* - Sat Nov 21 23:13:55 2015
