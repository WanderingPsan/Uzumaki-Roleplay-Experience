<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Calm down a bit, we'll get through this reconstruction period. - Mon Nov 30 18:37:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I know... but... do you think I rushed things? - Mon Nov 30 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Personally...Yeah. - Mon Nov 30 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But it's fine. - Mon Nov 30 18:39:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Nothing... - Mon Nov 30 18:42:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) rubbed her back with one hand, "Just give me a job..." he hated to work, but he prefered to see her in a more positive mood, even if it meant he would have to work.* - Mon Nov 30 18:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would continue to rub her back but more affectionately, he let out a bit of a chuckle at what she had said. He looked away from her for a moment at the small makeshift office they were in. "Consider it done, i'll do what I can, i'll even try to impress you a little bit." he told her while digging into his other pocket with his only free hand.* - Mon Nov 30 18:49:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Nothing impressive. - Mon Nov 30 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: How many bandits are there? - Mon Nov 30 18:55:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: 5 - Mon Nov 30 18:56:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can take out 5 easily. - Mon Nov 30 18:59:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yo kid. - Mon Nov 30 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You got some free time now I see. - Mon Nov 30 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Come with me, I need a witness. - Mon Nov 30 19:01:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Err? - Mon Nov 30 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah you. - Mon Nov 30 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Follow me. - Mon Nov 30 19:02:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Why am I following you. - Mon Nov 30 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I enjoy company. - Mon Nov 30 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) thinks: This nigga is gay... - Mon Nov 30 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Okay.. - Mon Nov 30 19:04:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) thinks: Is he gonna butt rape me? - Mon Nov 30 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would be in the small thicket of woods owned by his own clan. As he walked through it deer would pop in and out of sight. Suddenly 5 man would surround the two threatening them with weapons and dirty glares. A fireball was blasted at Ziare forcign him to react by dodging it, only getting out of it by a hair and leaving the boy to fend for himself.

Ziare rose to the top of the canopy as he dodged and tried to aquire the attention of the attackers towards him rather than the young boy. He was going to be forced to react thusly to the whole situation and may have to use the fullest extent of his power.* - Mon Nov 30 19:06:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) completed the handseal that he needed and his body became a nexus for shadows that would burst from his position looking to trap all 5 of the bandits that seemed to randomly attack them. Atleast from Nyuki's perspective it would be random, whereas from Ziare's perspecitve it was provoked. Now that they would be trapped an unable to move Ziare would get one last good look at them.

With that last good look Ziare could understand and tell now that each and every one of the men were notorious bandits and were wanted by the law of Konoha. He nodded his had in satisfaction at his job and strengthened the black shadows that were bindign each and every one of these men, they would not be going anywhere now.

He would then look to Nyuki and speak up, "Thanks for the help kid, how strong are you?" he would ask the young 10 year old as if he expected him to be heraklean strength.* - Mon Nov 30 19:18:49 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Why did they attack you... - Mon Nov 30 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Because I crossed their territory. - Mon Nov 30 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And coaxed them. - Mon Nov 30 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I see. - Mon Nov 30 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would force each and every one of the members to get closer to each other by manipulating his shadows in more advanced ways. Once all of the men were near each other shadowy tendrils would apprear from the ground and stitch all of the men's bodies together into one large bundle once the stritching was over the men would be in a ball similar to that of a rubberband ball.

"Pick them up for me please?" Ziare ordered the kid, using his rank and his age to convince the boy.* - Mon Nov 30 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would begin to drag them himself, he shook his head at the kid, "Your generation is so lazy..." he commented.* - Mon Nov 30 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Right... - Mon Nov 30 19:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Are you done? - Mon Nov 30 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would pop back in with 5 bandits all attached to each other. Rias would probably instantly rcognize that they were stitched together. He would leave them as a mass on the ground waiting for her next order of what to do with them. 

"They're captured M'lady." he told her.* - Mon Nov 30 19:36:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: .... - Mon Nov 30 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Got another mission for me? - Mon Nov 30 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't know if you would consider it impressive, you can ask this kid here if he was impressed. - Mon Nov 30 19:37:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: I'd rather you not ask me. - Mon Nov 30 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: You won't like my opinon. - Mon Nov 30 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Nor was I given any indepth detail of the assault or why they attacked you. Just because they crossed your grounds. - Mon Nov 30 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: You crossed their Terrioty? Big whoop. That isn't suffice reason to take them out... - Mon Nov 30 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You talk too much. - Mon Nov 30 19:40:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: You attack and ask questions later. - Mon Nov 30 19:41:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Everything I do is calculated. - Mon Nov 30 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Right. - Mon Nov 30 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: It's funny how things are run here now... - Mon Nov 30 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: ...... - Mon Nov 30 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Okay then. - Mon Nov 30 19:45:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm.. - Mon Nov 30 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Most of that is common knowledge to you. - Mon Nov 30 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I know - Mon Nov 30 20:00:38 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Do you want another mission, there is still alot to be done - Mon Nov 30 20:12:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Not really. - Mon Nov 30 20:19:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Can I just hang with you for a bit? - Mon Nov 30 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I would love that Z - Mon Nov 30 20:20:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Nyuki, Yoshima(Maya Nonomyth) says: Yes. - Mon Nov 30 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) took a seat next to her and got into a relaxd position, he noticed the next guy walking in and looked him over briefly letting Rias handle him as usual.* - Mon Nov 30 20:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Yes, can I help you? - Mon Nov 30 20:22:49 2015
