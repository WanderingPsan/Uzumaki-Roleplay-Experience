<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) noticed that she had been training extremely hard, he felt hrrible that he had left her to train on her own all day. He let out a sigh of dissapointment in himself as a man and spoke up towards her, "Need some help training?"* - Sat Dec 12 00:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded back at her,he had already come up with a good training exercise for her if she was going to increase her speed. He looked to her and instructed her, "Don't let my shadow touch you.." he told her as he created a single handseal and exended it at her. It moved rapidly as it came straight at her.* - Sat Dec 12 00:30:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shadow stopped when she aid she wanted a normal spar, he hated fighting but he would do anything for her. He sighed to himself and retracted his shadow, sticking both of his hands into his pockets. 

"Alright then, come at me." he told her. The fact that he even accepted the spar was outlandish.* - Sat Dec 12 00:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) saw her coming in quickly and reacted as fast as he could, he formed the handseal near instantly and had his shadow reel out towards her aggressively to keep her on her toes and keep her from closing in on him so quickly. If she continued to run in on him she would be cauht by his shadow and unable to move. All the while he would laugh at her a bit, "As if I could ever hurt you..." he'd say to her.* - Sat Dec 12 01:00:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would release her after telling giving her some advice to beat him. "There is a downtime to my jutsu, outrun it and dodge it and then attack me." he told her giving away his weakness. He would wait for her to back up again before continuing with her once again.* - Sat Dec 12 01:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) created the handseal once again and had his shadow reel out towards her once again. She was fast and he did not expect her speed to come so quickly. His shadow attempted to grab at her and hold her in place once again. He was holding back a lot to give her a chance to improve rather than killing all of her fun immidietly. "Dodge!" he yelled off at her.* - Sat Dec 12 01:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shadow had hit his max range and stopped moving towards her, it gave her the open oportunity to begin to attack him. Just as he prepared to raise his hands to defend himself she had dropped a bomb at him. He sat there with his eyes wide open and his defense down, "Whaaaa?" he asked in a confused and dissapointed tone. He assumed if she brung the guy up who hit on her she probably liked him a bit too...* - Sat Dec 12 01:43:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was bombarded with Saika's attacks, he was already distracted and would not be able to defend himself against her. The attacks did not hurt and he assumed that she was holding back against him. When she spurted out her comments he said in a dissapointed tone, "You don't play fair..."

Now 4 shadows blasting away from him as if he was a nexus all aimed to close in on her, if she waited to long to dodge she would have her escapes blocked off and be caught. Unfortunaltely he would not be able to blindsidde her.* - Sat Dec 12 01:58:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was enjoying his sparring with her  bit, only because he did not have to be serious. He decided to play a bit more with her, he would form tentacles from the shadows to grasp at Saika, they tentacles were not like his sewing threads, they were weaker and more gentle. The main purepose was to suprise her and grab at her with them, he could play dirty as well.* - Sat Dec 12 02:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had noticed her begin to fall during the spar and his shadows shot at her like a bullet moving at her with full speed. It would catch her before she fell and hold her up. He would walk twards her and her him because of his jutsu. Once he stood in front of her he would release the shadow and speak up, "Are you okay?" he asked her.* - Sat Dec 12 02:28:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had dropped her off on the patio of the House that they lived in. He would sit next to her trying to hide the fact that he was exhausted after carrying her. "Let me help you with your feet..." he said to her.* - Sat Dec 12 03:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had caught his breath and shook his head, "You don't need to lose any weight, I just need to get stronger..." he said to her. he would rest his arm around her waist and giggle, "You're really something else, there's no way I could work as hard as you." he told her.* - Sat Dec 12 03:28:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) noticed her feet and body and let out a deep exhale. He hugged her briefly for a moment and whispered to her before goign back inside and getting a basic med-kit. He had no idea how to use most of the things in the kit but he could do the very basics. He would take off the old bandages and aply a thin layer of ointment before rewrapping the injuries. It would sting and burn, but the ointment would increase the healing and repair the minimal skin damage on her feet.* - Sat Dec 12 03:48:12 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) attached a mechanism to the bottom of her lower arm. It was small and it fit well on her.

It takes a bit to get used to." he told her.* - Sat Dec 12 14:06:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Let's go. - Sat Dec 12 15:29:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) created the handseal and let his shadow extend foreward at Saika once again, she knew the drill and how to avoid the attack by now. While he was manipulating the shadows he spoke to her, "Don't join those exams." he told her in between his attack as the shadow aggressively neared her.* - Sat Dec 12 15:32:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) noticed her burst off into a speeding bullet to circle around him, he would have another shadow shoot from where he wasn't facign towards her now, the shadow would move aggressively towards her as well, making a wiggle shape to throw her off, but it wouldnt seeing as she had byakugan.

"Because only bad things happen when the Gezo are involved..." he told her, not knowing how to completely explain it.* - Sat Dec 12 15:44:09 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shadows had reached their limit as they neared her and retracted back to him. This would leave him wide open for an attack as usual for her. Althoug he could have defended himself, he chose not to to allow Saika the expirience of attacking or he would never hear the end of it. * - Sat Dec 12 16:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's handseal speed would suddenly become extremely fast, if she did not have her byakugan he would have been a blur to her. A shdow would emerge from him backing her off of him forcefully to not allow her to get any closer. Although she was fast, his shadows were faster.

"You really want me to get serious?" he asked her?* - Sat Dec 12 16:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I can go all out. - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I...Just don't want to... - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But i'll do it if you want. - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: It's fine. . .do what ever is comfortable. - Sat Dec 12 16:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I told you, you deserve to be greedy, now's the perfect time. - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: . . . . - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you really wanna see m get serious? - Sat Dec 12 16:20:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: F-Fine. . .only this one time. . . - Sat Dec 12 16:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: I don't want to force you. - Sat Dec 12 16:20:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) nodded his head and created a handseal launching 3 of his shadows at her, they would reach her near instantly, but his instinct and duty would make him incapable of ensnaring her so violently, she would have a small chance of  dodgding the attack and getting out of the range of the attack.* - Sat Dec 12 16:22:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shadows would continue chasing her and forcing her to move, in that instant a tendril would grab a kunai on his hip and throw it with incredible power and accruacy in it, there was chakra channeled in the kunai. At the end of the kunai there was an explosive tag attached. It was aimed at her feet to force her to jump back when it landed.* - Sat Dec 12 16:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's kunai would land on the ground, it was aimed at her shadow of course, just when it seemed his shadow had hit it's limits it would tough the kunai and a new shadow would be birthed from it moving fast as every back at her, this time it would split into 5 shadows as it eared her to cut off her route for escape slowly and assuredly. If she kept runnign the way he wanted her to she would begin comeing close to a tree.* - Sat Dec 12 16:45:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shadows were not just shadows they were fully capable of taking physical form, in another instant he completed handseals and 15 thick sewing tendrils would shoot from his shadows. Some were aimed to stop the wires she shot while the rest were aimed to just catch her and restrict her without going through her skin like they were meant to. This required absolute contorl and concentration on his part. * - Sat Dec 12 16:55:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: From here I would use the Fire Dragon Bullet technique. - Sat Dec 12 17:06:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And with that I think I would win. - Sat Dec 12 17:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) thinks: I would have been melted? - Sat Dec 12 17:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had already released the chakra as he was speaking, she would be let go then and there, he would look at ehr seeing if she wanted to continue with more lighthearted training or if she was done for the day.* - Sat Dec 12 17:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) followed close behind, he understood where she was coming from so he would just stay quiet and allow her to do as she pleased.* - Sat Dec 12 17:13:45 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Yamato, Saika(Chaos Commander2019) says: Your start. - Sat Dec 12 17:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would form the handseal and let his shadow shoot out towards her, it was the same as before, it would be slow moving in comparison, but fast enough to challenge her.* - Sat Dec 12 17:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 's shadow was bypassed and she headed right for him. There would be nothing to do for him as he was assaulted by her gentle techniques one again, she would then run back and away from him. He assumed that it was a successful hit on her part before starting over again, this time using two shadows to ensare her.* - Sat Dec 12 17:32:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) 'd shadows would miss at first frcing him to make them dissapear and create new ones as she ran at him. He would try to catch her as she ran at him, and if she continued to dodge and weave through them, she would find herself unnaturally close to Ziare.

He would take a half heartted couple of sings at her now that she was close forcing het to continue dodging. Each punch was hyper controled, if he came too close to hitting her, he woulld stop before he did.* - Sat Dec 12 17:46:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had watched her dance around him,  over and over there was nothing he could do, even if he was going all out there would be little he could do to stop her. She would then hop on his back and force an "oof.." out of him. He could still carry her a ways. 

"Alright, let's go.." he said to her as he walked with her on his back.* - Sat Dec 12 18:04:06 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) worked like he usually did and reeled his shadow foreward at Saika. the shadow would move like he manipuated it to. It would be constantly sworvigng just in case she tried to strafe to the side.* - Sat Dec 12 18:38:14 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: * - Sat Dec 12 18:52:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had let her come in close, there was no trap this time around, she would be able to get fairly close to Ziare where he would switch to h2h combat on her. He held back a lot less than he did the first time, giving her nearly his best when it came to close quaters combat. All the while he woudld probably not land a single hit on her.* - Sat Dec 12 18:59:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was a terrible hand to hand combatant and it would show, he hardly trained as it was so of course he never practiced his close quarters combat techniques. When she fell back he smirked back at her, "Get over here." he said playfully as she shot 3 more shadawos that would arch around her. If she continued toback up, she would be caught, she would need to run in on him and attack him once more.

Once shse got into close combat range he would throw more punches at her trying to challenge her ithout landing a hard punch on her, it was harder than it sounded.* - Sat Dec 12 19:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was breathing fairly heavy as well, he rested his hands on her shoulders to help catch his own breath for a moment. He looked back up at her and asked, "Are your legs and feet okay?"* - Sat Dec 12 19:52:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) smiled a bit, "Yeah.." he would begin walking back to their home listening half assed if she would let out a cry of pain. He knew that she wasn't perfectly fine, but he would'nt want to ruin her pride.* - Sat Dec 12 19:56:44 2015
