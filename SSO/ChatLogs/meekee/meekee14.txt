<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) followed her by her side, he did not need a towel, but as they walked back to the hotel he began to shiver more and more. * - Thu Dec 10 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) shivvered as he walked into the room, he was really regretting not getting a towel.* - Thu Dec 10 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) looked away as always,she had said she was serious so he took it just as seriously. when she had finished he looked at her, she seemed to be wearing another swim suit. He was wondering why but he spoke up to compliment her, "I think that swimsuit suits you better than the last one." he said. 

He would begin to change next, but he made it clear that she could look al she wanted. "You don't have to look away from me, I don't mind you seeing me naked at all." he put his usual all black garments back on, they had a large fire symbol on the back.* - Thu Dec 10 07:18:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had finished getting dressed and clipped his belt on, on the belt hung his ninja tools but he had not opened the pouch much. He smiled at her and nodded, "It definitly felt nice! It's a shame we didn't catch any fish." he griped. He was going to have to step up now.

Ziare swallowed his fears then and there giving him a bit of time to speak, "Saika, I told you this, but you really did look stunning in the lake.." he told her. He was mentally focused on his breathing trying to control it.* - Thu Dec 10 07:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was yet again beated to the punch by her, he had set up this strategy in his mind only for it to come crashing down on him by this woman that had taken his heart.

He had locked lips with her and for the first time, they had their first actual. He heald her close for as long as she would stey befor letting go and watching her run off from him again. All the blood had rushed out of his head so he didn't even hear anything in the first place.

She had told him to go away but this woman for he had known for years did not mean it. He knew that she did not mean it and he followed her a lot slower to the bed but he sat on the floor, his back against the wall. 

"I think...I love you..." was all he could manage to get out as he was still feeling the effects.* - Thu Dec 10 07:45:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) sat up a bit, and looked at her buried in covers. "Look at me Saika."* - Thu Dec 10 08:04:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) stared at her, his tone was serious and his facial features reflected that tone. "Saika, if you were mad at me all day and didn't say one word to me, that would not have changed the fact that I love you, this goes past swimming, this goes into all the time we spent together." he had finished, he was embarrassed but he hid it.* - Thu Dec 10 08:09:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) smiled then when he saw her bury herself. He leaned in to embrace the silouette gently while speaking. "I know how you feel, if you can't say it, that's fine, as long as you know that I feel this way for you." he told her. He was warm now that he had heated up, and as always notoruously calm and soothing. He had felt like he had gotten everything out and felt much better.* - Thu Dec 10 08:35:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) spoke back at her, "Sure." he replied, back in his usual non chalont tone.* - Thu Dec 10 08:43:56 2015

He kept his eyes out for any intruders as well.* - Thu Dec 10 21:28:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had matured with their relationship, he understood her a lot more than before and rarely blushed or felt flustered around her.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) just held her close to him, he looked at her smile and couldn't help but smile himself. He had always thought she looked best with a smile on her face and no one could compare. As he stared at her he began to think of what his future would hold. He wanted this woman to be in every part of his future, to do that he had to think of ways to get her back into Konoha. His mind was going crazy as it naturally thought ahead and incorperated her in his life and lifestyle. He was calm on the outside, but a bit panicked on the inside. He needed to stop panicking himself and take a dee breath.* - Thu Dec 10 21:47:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) let her pull herself out of his hold and rested his head on his hand, his elbow was on the table. He never looked aay from her and spoke.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) heard her words, he had lost so much of his family already in this crazy village and the rest were leaving him. 47 brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins...He began to break down a bit and cry, he wanted to see his mom again, he missed her cooking...

"Dont leave too...You're the closest thing I have...If you leave I don't know what i'm gonna do anymore.." he was shaking a bit as he squeezed Saika's hand a bit tighter.* - Fri Dec 11 05:58:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) hugged her and held her tightly, he really did need someone in this world with him. Before he met her he would be drinking to drown his pain, now he had someone to help him through it. He would calm down after a bit and sat down, he hated how eerily quiet the mansion was.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) ran his hand through his hair, he did it whenever he was nervous which she might start catching onto or might have already caught onto depending on how perceptive she had been. He cleared his throught, "I-I don't know how to say this...But will you just always be there in my life?" he asked her. He was blushing now and did not look at her.* - Fri Dec 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) realized his mistake then and there, he told her to stay where she was and ran through the house as fast as he could. He found one of his cousins and asked to borrow a hefty amount of money, but his cousin was a ninja so he made a high salary.

Running back through the house he went through the sorr and sprinted to the nearest shop he could find. He was breathing crazy heavy as he asked for a ring. He felt like he was going to throw up either through happiness or from the constant running. 

Once he had gotten the ring he ran back to the house and busted back in through the back door. Sloppily kicking his shoes off like he was a kid he made his way back towards Saika. He was kneeling from the lack of air and what he was about to do. Once he caught enough of his breath he asked in a wheezy voice...


"Would you marry me?" * - Fri Dec 11 07:01:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) slipped the ring onto her finger, his hands were cold from going outside without a jacket. He spoke as he recovered from his huffs and puffs, "I want you and...Nobody else..." once he had the ring slipped onto her he would pull her into him, he smelled like the frigid air outside. He would then wipe the tears from her face, "You look the most beautiful when you're smiling, that's why i'm glad when you smile only for me.." he told her before trying to kiss her.* - Fri Dec 11 07:19:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) shared her feelings of happiness as he held her close. His mind was at rest for the most part, only thoughts of him having to mature now that he was engaged would come to mind. He would need to grow up so that he could settle down with Saika, possibly have to get a job as a ninja again to support her properly, no more living off of nothing.

He looked at her as he held her close and couldn't help but break out into a bit of a laugh every time he did, he was going to be married to her. He didn't think it woud happen or come true, but it was and he didn't grasp how happy he was, he didn't know he could be this happy.* - Fri Dec 11 07:30:08 2015
