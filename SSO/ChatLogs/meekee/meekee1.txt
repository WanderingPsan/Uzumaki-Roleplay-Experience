<br><font color=yellow>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) || The villagers seemed to hustle and bustle around for a bit at the sight of more ninja, they had all hated the ninja for what they did and how they intruded upon them. After a bit an old man walked out, a scowl on his face and spoke up, "What do you damned ninja want?" he demanded.* - Fri Oct  9 18:39:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Wonder if I should speak with the geezer..Maybe i'm not that threatening...  - Fri Oct  9 18:41:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) || The old man had Sanoke follow him. As Sanoke walked into the small village a man jumped from a window out of a building. He landed on his head and screamed at the ninja, "HELP, they are in here and they are going to kill that man!!!" he screamed as tears formed in his eyes. He was full of injuries not just from falling but seemingly frm somethign else.* - Fri Oct  9 18:47:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(Guest-2873063307) says: Ohoho, so little boy wants to battle me? - Fri Oct  9 19:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) says: Damn they caught back up. - Fri Oct  9 19:42:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***KazeKage**(Ziare1) says: They stand no chance. - Fri Oct  9 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) noticed that Ezikiel had left her with the duty of dealing wih the 2 men left. She knew that she couldn't quite fifhg the boy of them alone, but he had the Daimyo's body so they both would not dwell on her.

She unsealed her 3 puppets and had her strings attach to them. "Which of you will face off against me?" she asked as she moved into a more strategic place to fight in backing away from the bulk of the sand.* - Fri Oct  9 20:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) commanded her puppets foreward through the rainign sand, but foudn that they stopped obeying her orders out of no where. She kept tryin to comand them but before she knew it they exploded, weak poisons shot out of them all over the place, possibly near Tetsumi. She fell to her knees having been defeated so easily. 

"W-what? How?" she was near tears watching as she would be considered the weak link of the team. She wanted to run but she couldn't move the way she was.* - Fri Oct  9 20:16:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) saw the boy envelope himself in sand and lost it, her last trick didn't work. Her mechanized body would then activate. Most of her body had been lost due to an accident, now she was a puppet herself controlled by her own chaka and her leader in a way. She shot foreward now, all of her physical abilities enhanced. Easily outrunning the iron sand aimed to hit her she would slam her fist into the iron wall of sand trying to break it in a fw attacks.* - Fri Oct  9 20:26:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: If this doesn't work...No it'll work, can't afford for my comrades to die. - Fri Oct  9 20:38:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) felt the sand wrapping around her body profusely, she could not and would not let this stop her. She had tubes in her arm that llowed her to shoot powerful blasts of fire and water. She would release them allowing a torret of both powerful fire and water to hit anything around her. She wasn't aiming due to having been thrown over the deep end, but the abilties themselves would have caused a lot of damage, especiall if they hit Jiki.

As she was being wrapped shewould attempt to rip the sand off of her, she didn't know what it was and so it seemed only right to tear it off.* - Fri Oct  9 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Orien, Megan(Meekee) 's body was crushed and out would pop bombs all exploding at once, to destroy her body adn the attacker. The explosion would envelop a 10 x 10 radius and would shake up Jiki even inside of his shield, but he would not be dead, most likely a bit rattled. Once his shield went down, all he would see is a giant crater, and no evidence of an enemy that faught him.* - Fri Oct  9 20:48:25 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) pulled a shuriken out from a weird place on the small of his back. He spun in through the center of the hole and threw it at the gate. The shuriken would wail through the air as it hit the gate only to show that he had actually thrown two shurikens. When he was finished he walked back up and grabbled the tools before placing them back where he got them.* - Fri Oct 30 17:29:10 2015

He wanted to get the control aspect down just right so that he could guide the shadow the correct way from this point on. At the moment his shadow was still wobbly and had trouble going certain distances, especially in the sun.

He casted his shadow out and guided it across the ground. He had accidentally guided it out a bit too far and ended up hitting the sun. The chakra dissipated and broke off into the sun forcing him to start over again.

shot his shadow back out into the sun and began to test the way it moved a bit, he wanted to get a good feeling for the shadow and learn to guide it as if it was just second nature to him breathing. To do that he needed to improve the way the shadow moved across the ground.* - Fri Oct 30 23:17:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Going where? - Sat Oct 31 01:16:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: To the mansion. - Sat Oct 31 01:16:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? Sure, if you want.  - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Cool. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah I will too. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm gonna be practicing some Jutsu, and working on my control- that was the plan, anyway... Mrm. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hey, Takeda. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Do you know how to use Raiton? - Sat Oct 31 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I do. - Sat Oct 31 01:27:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I see... it's an element I've been planning to get into. I don't suppose you'd be willing to give me some tips, or somethin? - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm, what? - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Sorry say again. - Sat Oct 31 01:28:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'm asking if you'd be willing to give me any tips or hints on how to use Raiton, or how to get started at least. - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm...Raiton... - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Oh right, yeah sorry. - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Um. - Sat Oct 31 01:29:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Just vibrate your chakra. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Vibrate my Chakra? - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Yeah, you know. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Vibrate it as much as you possibly can. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: O.. kay. - Sat Oct 31 01:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: I mean, That's how you do it. - Sat Oct 31 01:31:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: You simply build your charka up within your body, then vibrate it as much as you possibly can. - Sat Oct 31 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Watch. - Sat Oct 31 01:32:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Impressive. - Sat Oct 31 01:34:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You probably need practice. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Look. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: No, I mean.. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I don't understand why. - Sat Oct 31 01:35:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: What does vibration have to do with anything? - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Because thats how you apply the change in nature to your chakra. - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right, but.. - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Why does it work like that? - Sat Oct 31 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Because thats what lightning is, vibrations. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Your chakra is the medium. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Think of it as a source of energy. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Makes sense. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Right... Okay. - Sat Oct 31 01:37:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I guess that.. kinda makes sense. - Sat Oct 31 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: By vibrating it, you are giving it more energy...kinda. - Sat Oct 31 01:38:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) just casually watched with his hands in his pockets. He enjoyed watching the two work towards leanring lightning style and thought about maybe practicing a bit on his own. He knew he wouldn't be extremly skilled as these others though.* - Sat Oct 31 01:40:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't do elemental jutsu... - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah? Well.. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Neither do I, yet. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: How about you and me spar? - Sat Oct 31 01:44:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'll spar you. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I specialize in support. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm. Kenjutsu. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Though I.. don't have much of a good weapon, admitably. - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Uhm, can I borrow a kunai? - Sat Oct 31 01:44:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) blushed a big as he picked up the kunai and put it in a holster on his side. He would step back a bit and begin inspecing the woman. He looked her over speculatively, he couldnt help but glide over her feminine features but he wa a capable ninja and could brush over it. Once he was done he came to a brief conclusion.

"You're tall so you have a good reach, judging from your body I assume you're fast and you move quickly...Kenjutsu, but your blade is a tanto...This is gonna be tough for me.." he spoke not too loud, but couldve been heard if the other payed close attention.* - Sat Oct 31 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: So.. - Sat Oct 31 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: You ready to start? - Sat Oct 31 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yeah... - Sat Oct 31 01:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was hit dead in the jaw and his body was knocked back a ways. He had that classic, "You gotta be kidding me..." looks on his face as he fell to the ground not wanting to get back up from the pain and the annoyance of having to fight like this. He groaned as he slowly picked his body back up, he was losing his will to fight from the aching in his body.

"I hate unexpected things like this..." he said to himself annoyed, now only at a kneel and a bit dizzy from being socked in the face with a foot. He would try to draw his kunai and go for a defensive type of kneel.* - Sat Oct 31 01:56:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) threw the kunai with all of his strength moving it as fast as it would go. He made sure to channel some chakra creating a weak chakra flow efect that wouldn't have been notable. It would whirl through the air but due to his recently hit head his aim would be off a bit and hit just at Ketsuki, it had no explosion tag and would pose no threat to her as it was. If the Kunai hit the ground by Ketsuki he would look at it and then at her with a blank and dissapointed expression. 

"Damn..." was all he would say as if he failed something that could have been a game changer.* - Sat Oct 31 02:01:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would have smiled if it missed, it seemed like it was all according to plan now. The chakra in the kunai would have done it's job and pinned down the shadow at her feet and made her unable to move. He was actually thinkning 3 moves ahead this entire time and everything seemed to be going to plan from this point on. (Strategist Trait)

If he truly was successful with his plan he would try to stand up but would still find it pretty hard.* - Sat Oct 31 02:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) created one handseal and let his own shadow extend the short distance to her shadow until it grasped onto her. Once he had gotten a hold of her she would be caught in his shadow imitation jutsu. Ziare had to focus now, he had to resist the urge to pull down her shirt and stare at her chest, but insead would pick up the kunai he threw on the ground and hold it to the woman's neck. The thing was, he didn't have anything to his neck, and she would. 

"Check mate.." he would say simply.* - Sat Oct 31 02:21:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would release the jutsu and hold his hand out, "Can I have the kunai as a prize?" he would smile a bit of a cocky smile, but by no means was he openly cocky about his victory.* - Sat Oct 31 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Sure, keep it. I've got plenty. - Sat Oct 31 02:24:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Thanks. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But yeah, I mainly excell in support. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I think up strategies. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And I assist my allies. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Mrm.. I didn't really use my usual opening move there, or things mighta gone different; I wanted to restrict myself to physical combat to make this fun. But that Shadow Jutsu- pretty good. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Thanks. - Sat Oct 31 02:25:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) blushed a bit from the compliment from her as he returned north to sit back down. He was tired from exerting himself so far, he wouldn't have lasted much longer in the first place.* - Sat Oct 31 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: So you must be really strong. - Sat Oct 31 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You run missions on your own and all. - Sat Oct 31 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Hrm? - Sat Oct 31 02:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Takeda Hideyoshi(Theodysseygamer) says: Hm... - Sat Oct 31 02:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...Mrm. - Sat Oct 31 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Hm? - Sat Oct 31 02:42:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: I'll be meditating on my Raiton affinity for a while, dude. - Sat Oct 31 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Feel free to do whatever; no need to keep me company. - Sat Oct 31 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right, I should get going. - Sat Oct 31 02:43:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yo, Big man, - Sat Oct 31 02:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Sat Oct 31 03:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kyushiki(Maruka) says: ? - Sat Oct 31 03:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Minimasa(JustCallMeGnar) says: .. - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Raitori, Amaya(Sage of Six Booties) says: -omit- - Sat Oct 31 03:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You guys really don't give up. - Sat Oct 31 08:08:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) leaned up against the gate and would begin to watch as the shadows of the trees and walls would dance around the field throughout the course of the day. This was bliss and real fun for him.* - Sat Oct 31 08:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Doesn't that kill the purpose? - Sat Oct 31 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Or meditating. - Sat Oct 31 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: ...I s'pose it does. - Sat Oct 31 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You're name is Ketsuki, right? - Sat Oct 31 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah. - Sat Oct 31 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Do you really use kenjutsu? - Sat Oct 31 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ketsuki(SephirothSage) says: Yeah, why do you ask? - Sat Oct 31 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I was curious. - Sat Oct 31 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Why do you want to get so much stronger? - Sat Oct 31 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) blushed a bit, but he managed to hide his limerance behind a wall of false cool feeling. 

"I always wondered why some people faught, as you know I prefer not to fight, in fact I prefer not to even show off my techniques"* - Sat Oct 31 08:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) began to understand a little more now, the absolute love people had for this place even though it was falling apart. He always felt a bit warmer for noticing this and smiled back at her, but his smile was a bit more of a hopeful one. "You know, for some reason that makes me feel a bit better." he said to her. Hearing the last part of her sentence killed him a bit inside though, Why did all pretty women have to have boyfriends?* - Sat Oct 31 08:36:16 2015
