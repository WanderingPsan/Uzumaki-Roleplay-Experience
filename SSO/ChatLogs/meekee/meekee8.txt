<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would begin to practice anipulating the shadows around him. With each shadow that he moved he would forma hand from them that would gain physical abilities. The hand could pull and push certain objects, the hands would grab things, although not heavy, and the hand could break limbs.

Ziare ran the hand through everything in the room, the hand would begin to snoop around as if it was looking for something. It could be controlled by the shadow that Ziare had created funnily enough.

Ziare would continue to rummage through everything in the room he was in as he watched the shadow just pop in and out of all of the random shit. He enjoyed it even though it was pointless.

The shadow would open a cupboard and Ziare looked at it like he had just hit a gold mine. He would try to pick up the cup with his shadow hand but menuvering each and every shado finger was tough.

He broke the glass that he was practicing with and his shadow reeled back in like a guily puppy that had just done somethiing wrong. Ziare saighed before starting all over again.* - Tue Nov 17 07:34:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would begin to practice his neckbind jutsu once again. He needed to get this jutsu to an adequate level or he would never catch up to his love/rival Rias at the end of the day.

He went through a quick series of handseals and slammed his palms together fiercly as he channeled the chakra from within him, rapidly and then tansfered it to his shadow.

Ziare would then reel his shadow out for a moment, it would suddenly bust to life as a hand that was capable of interacting with the phsyical realm. The hand would just crawl around the floor.

As the hand crawled and scooped around the floor it would pick things up on the ground and open and close cupboards. He was able to freely manipulate it within certain restrictions.

Once he had his fun with the shadow hand he would reel it back to himself trying to punch himself with the shadow. To his suprise the shadow hand was actually capable of hitting him.

After further tests he figured out that the shadow hands were even capable of hurting himself. He could feel the hand pulling on his fingers which meant that he could even go as far as breaking limbs.* - Thu Nov 19 10:08:51 2015
