<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Do you know where a key would be? - Sun Nov  8 09:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) walkd out the door, he would prompt Akira to follow him, "Fuck a key..." he would say as he closed the doors and jammed a kunai into it with all of his strenght. He particularly wouldnt be getting it out, but someone had to be strong enough.* - Sun Nov  8 09:22:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Guess it will only get tougher as time passes. - Sun Nov  8 09:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Yep.. - Sun Nov  8 09:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had done the stretching that he required himself to do before getting back to his jutsu and mastering it's new art form. He would finish with his basic stretches and move into what it took to get down to business.

Ziare had to first channel his chakra of coruse through a small kunai. He was already used to this part. He rmeembered back when it took him a week to learn how to do this.

Those times holding out ninja weapons in front of him to learn how to channel chakra through them were madness. His most vivid memory of it all was watching Rias do the same.

He couldn't say he wasn't looking at her massive chest the entire time, but the way she simply just mastred certain things out of the blue with no effort blue his mind in ways he could not simply explain.

She was the perfect girl in his opinion and had explained to him everything he needed to know about channeling chakra, and he would use it. He remembered how to flow his chakra into the weaon until it began to vibrate a certain way.

Ziare let out a grunt and threw the kunai at a nearby shadow, he point of the jutsu would be to throw off the enemy and make them beleive that he missed them instead of hit them.

He would then create the handseal and the shadow would form from the kunai which contained his own array of chakra rather than himself. It was ingenius to anyone who dind't expect it.

The shadow crept from his kunai and wiggled it's way towards the scarecrow that he used to train on. The scarecrow would be latched by his own jutsu making him smile a bit from the oddity.

He let out a breath as he prepared to go back at it again soon enough.* - Sun Nov  8 11:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had begun his practice once again for himself. He would let out a deep breath and grab his kunai as he was back at it again just like he always was and had been in the past.

Ziare finished some basic breathing and began to channel his chakra into his kunai like he had before, but this time he was having a bit of trouble channeling it, he figured he was doing it wrong.

He had to think back to what he was told by Rias, he couldn't beleve that he was still relying on her even to this point for mastering the jutsus that he had to learn. He sighed to himself but shrugged it off in the end.

Now unable to truely shrug it off he just let the thoughts flood his mind and remembered how she had taught it to him. He had to escape the dirty thoughts in training but he couldn't forget how she jiggled like jello.

He would channel his chakra through the kunai and stand back up as he threw it across the training area he was in and into the shadow of a nearby area. He was then proactive.

He had to think of ways to make the jutsu usefull, he immagined he could use it if Rias was no where near him and he needed get to her as quickly as he could manage without fail.

The shadow would come to life from the kunai he had just thrown and bolt at he scarecrow that he kept as a prop to use his own jutsu on. After the whole fiasco it seemed that he had done it.

He needed to take a break he couldn't have dirty thoughts of Rias constantly on his mind these days, he needed to watch some quality porn so that he could change his course of thought.* - Sun Nov  8 12:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh it's you. - Sun Nov  8 14:20:09 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You seem pretty expirienced. - Sun Nov  8 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: What should we do with it? - Sun Nov  8 14:26:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Bury it with pride. Every kage deserves a proper burial. - Sun Nov  8 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: But the blade has a name on it. - Sun Nov  8 14:27:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: What is the name? - Sun Nov  8 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: The blade that was pierced through his chest, - Sun Nov  8 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Takeda. - Sun Nov  8 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: The old elementalist shinobi. - Sun Nov  8 14:28:41 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: Could be that he's hiding. - Sun Nov  8 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Possibly. - Sun Nov  8 14:28:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I'll be going now. - Sun Nov  8 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right... - Sun Nov  8 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kurt(Zygman) says: I guess I'll see you some other day. - Sun Nov  8 14:33:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) got into the habit of training a bit for the day just like he normally would. He pulled out a kunai from his holster and spun it through the small hole on the very bottom that was usd to hang it as he searched for his target.

Finding ways to utulize the jutsu was the hard part, but when he saw that the scarecrow was set down by a nearby shadow he knew that he would gain the oportunityto use the jutsu with a less than skillful series of tricks.

Ziare channeled his chakra through his kunai again, the kunai would turn a very faint blue that wouldn't be noticed in any sort of battle. He nodded to himself for a moment before throwing the kunai with all of the strength he could muster.

The kunai had slammed into the ground next to the scarescrow where it sat still like a rock. The chakra would still be flowing through the kunai when he formed another set of handseals.

The handseals would prompt a shadow to form and begin to wiggle around a bit as Ziare found a natural balance for the chaka and speed of the shadow. all he had to do was lash it out.

The shadow reeled out and would hit the scarcrow, it would be a direct hit and if the scarecrow was a person, they would find themselves unable to move for a good bit.* - Sun Nov  8 22:10:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Rias is forcing me to train. - Mon Nov  9 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: It's whatever, but still a pain. - Mon Nov  9 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: No pain no gain. - Mon Nov  9 00:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right.. - Mon Nov  9 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Anyway I gotta get back to it. - Mon Nov  9 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You should train too. - Mon Nov  9 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You need to bein top shape. - Mon Nov  9 00:26:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: Im in the best shape ever look at me. - Mon Nov  9 00:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Mon Nov  9 00:29:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grasped his kunai onc again after having pulled it out of the dirt, the end of the kunai was beggining to dull a bit from the amount of times he had been using it as a weapon. It was not meant for this level of wear and tear.

Ziare had to search for a target first and foremost, he ad moved the scarecrow from it's original spot so he had to find it's place from scracth once again. After a swift moniter of the training field he found it.

Ziare channeled his chakra through the kunai just like he was taught by Rias. She had helped him with a lot of aspects that really helped him improve his abilities and have some push the envelope.

Now with his chakra flowing fiercly through the kunai he was ready to start the jutsu combination that he had been working on for the longest period of time. He cockd his arm back and threw the kunai.

The kunai would fly through the area and just hit past the scarecrow, he hit the shadow but his chakra was still touching the area that the shadow was on. And suddenly it would happen.

His shadow leapt to life and would grapple the scarecrow for a few moments before laxing.

He would return to the scarecrow and pick up his kunai before walking back to his stariting place to do it all over again like he always did.* - Mon Nov  9 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh. - Mon Nov  9 02:26:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: Ha traning. - Mon Nov  9 03:10:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Can't call it team training until you start. - Mon Nov  9 03:11:34 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Termine, Jover(Bosshoggoutlaw) says: I do. - Mon Nov  9 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Its fun - Mon Nov  9 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Oh, it's just you don't seem up for it is all. - Mon Nov  9 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I am but its tedious - Mon Nov  9 03:13:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I can understand that, I like to just train on my own too. - Mon Nov  9 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not even a big fan of spars. - Mon Nov  9 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would look to Rias and create his shadow immitation technique, he would reel a shadow out towards her body to have her mimic his actions and out towards the enemy to secure the target and ensue that the person would be unable to make any sort of escape. Once he had them locked in place he would just hold them.

Rias's body would be mimicing his own body. He made sure to stay still to ensure that she didn't come into any type of harm.* - Mon Nov  9 03:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would pick up his kunai from the dirt and twirl it in between his fingers as he looked off into the distance, he had moved the scarecrow and he would have to simulate finding it again.

Ziare scanned the area on a regular level just looking over it, but he didn't stop there. Ziare always scanned the areas he looked over in a strategic way, ways he could and would abuse his enemy.

He found a couple within the arena but those would be basically pointless for him to even consider against a stagnant enemy that he was going against like a scarecrow.

Ziare pulled the kunai back and launched it at the scarecrow, it would hit wide and glide past him as it hit the shadow behind the scaecrow. Usually he would be worried but it was all planned.

Ziare had channeled his chakra through the kunai like he had been taught by his friend Rias. She had made sure that he was goot at it and was able to ge tit done like he so pleased.

When the kunai hit the ground Ziare went throguh a sudden series of handseals before maniplating a shadow that would shoot out and grab the scarecrow, but with his he was not done, he would conitnue testing his abilites.* - Mon Nov  9 03:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would just wait for her to start again before latchng onto her body with his shadows, the use of his shadows was easy, they were small extensions of his person that he could guide across any place freely with no effort. He caught her in the shadow and caught the scarecrow at the same time, his skill with working with the twoa step above his own teamates, he would'nt be inhibiting them in the slightest.

He would form more shadows to fake a real situation where the enemy could possibly be forced back and put into submission through being cornered alone. Now it was just up to Slim to seal the deal again.* - Mon Nov  9 04:07:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) pulled another kunai from his pouch and would look dead at the scarecrow as he prepared to nail the target. He would throw the shuriken yet again and it would most definitely hit the scarecrow in the chest.

Ziare would have channled a bit of his chakra through the kunai as well so that it would activate the same effect as all of the other times that he had activated his jutsu by channeling chakra.

The chakra would run through his kunai making it vibrate a bit and when it hit the shadow that the scarecrow was casting Ziare would get down to one kneel and activate the jutsu he was planning.

The shadow would appear from the scarecrow now and wrap around him as if the initial shadow cast on him wasn't embarrasing enough to have. The shadow would then slide across the ground and latch onto a matching scarecrow.

With both of the scarecrows hit and one unable to move from where he was standing. He had successfully gotten both of the targets without endangring anyone else in the process, but he was slow.

He pointed out all of the flaws in his own abilities and cursed to himself for being so easily able to be stopped. If he got to a point where he could defend himself against average enemies, he would be set.* - Mon Nov  9 04:24:57 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grabbed his kunai and shook his head at himself, he could not beleive that he was going to be doing this, but he had to learn this jutsu if he planned on improving at all.

Ziare threw the kunai with intentions to miss his target as he ran foreward as a breakneck speed and would jump into the air. Once in the air he would attempt to kick at the target that he aimed for.

The kunai was just a distraction the entire time, in reality he was not aiming to hit the person with the kunai, he was aiming to kick the person in the back of the head.

Since his target's head would be focused on the kunai now he took that as his oportunity to jump into the air and attack with his full strength kick. The kick would have easily knocked the person over.

Once they were on the ground he considered that a checkmate for the person who was laying on the ground unaware of his attack. He then just simply walked off since he didn't want to go to jail for his actions.* - Mon Nov  9 20:18:59 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Better than this. - Tue Nov 10 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: This is barely considered a village.. - Tue Nov 10 02:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well, I guess it's a consideration. - Tue Nov 10 02:42:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well, Rias uses genjutsu. - Tue Nov 10 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So I think she uses one on the enemy, then your big friend crushes them. - Tue Nov 10 03:27:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: But I still don't understand why she goes limp and you just sort of stand there. - Tue Nov 10 03:28:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I've been good. - Tue Nov 10 03:31:37 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Nope. . I had vacation days. .and I didn't wanna lose them. - Tue Nov 10 03:35:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Because I have high hopes for you. - Tue Nov 10 03:35:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) attempted a last ditch efort of just ignoring the woman.* - Tue Nov 10 03:36:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Well. . Then. . Same agreement as normal.  - Tue Nov 10 03:37:36 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Right.. - Tue Nov 10 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) prefered not to speak when he didn't have to, he would glance at the man and then look back to Marrisa ready to follow her.* - Tue Nov 10 03:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hey new guy. - Tue Nov 10 03:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: It's Daiki. - Tue Nov 10 03:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Fancy showin' me the ropes? - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am Marrisa. . I don't live here.  - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Come along with us. . Ziare and I are about to spar. - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hm? May aswell. - Tue Nov 10 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Wonder if you guys can teach me anything. - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Probably not. - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright. .  - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: #.. - Tue Nov 10 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: So, either of you guys watching any good? - Tue Nov 10 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was already annoyed by her public displays of affection towards her boyfriend and such. But now she wanted to insult his stature, for the first time he was actually going to take a spar seriously, he wanted only to land a hit to put her in her place.

Ziare took off his glasses and put them back into his pocket where he would keep them and began to inspect the battlefield to see how he could best abuse the battlefield to his advantage. He had seen everything he needed at this point and bolted up north towards the gate on his side as if he was going to run away.* - Tue Nov 10 04:11:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) noticed the shadow that would creep up quickly from behind, his plan would be falling short at this rate, he had so go for a last ditch effort and stop. He channeled his own chakra creating the same handseal and extended his own chakra connecting it with Marissa's shadow to lock onto her as well. He had no idea whether or not it would work but he knew that it was worth a try in it's own right.* - Tue Nov 10 04:17:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) simply walked towards her.* - Tue Nov 10 04:21:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) just copied what she did, he hated how she would use his clan's jutsu.* - Tue Nov 10 04:23:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was punched in the chest and felt a force drive him back against the dirt near the gate, luckily he had put his glasses away or they may have become damaged. He was on the ground now and didn't want to get up but it was as if she was insulting his entire being and although he was unmotivated this was enough motivation to make him stand again. 

Now the way he looked at her changedm he looked determined as he would pull a kunai from his pocket channeling his own chakra through the object as he threw it at her with adequate accuracy aiming directly for her.* - Tue Nov 10 04:30:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: I've...never...Felt like this before... - Tue Nov 10 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) withdrew his last kunai and would channel more chakra into the kunai, he only had one shot from here.

He would run at Marrisa knowing damn well taijutsu was never his strong point, but thats why he needed to do it. His strong points would all be overlapped by by her because she could asily counter them, she thought she knew how he faught, but if he could bury a small seed of doubt into her he could abuse.

If he managed to get close he would jump and attempt to kick her dead in the chest, his bodyfacing the ground while he attacked. 

Meanwhile he was prepared to get blown back by her once again.* - Tue Nov 10 04:41:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) had been hit with yet another attack that he was already expected to be cast at him, he raised his arms to block he strike that would be telegraphed by the fan and end up blowing himself back again. He let out a groan from frusteration, suddenly he would stop rushing at her and begin things he could do to change the course of the battle. 4 plans popped into his head as he picked himself up off the ground and would begin walking back until he was under the shadow of the large tree, he would stick his kunai with his chakra in it in the ground under the shade.

He would then stand up and speak up, "You can come fight me now."* - Tue Nov 10 04:56:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: An earth jutsu...I should ask her to teach me some stuff... - Tue Nov 10 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Wonder if anyone here could help a new genin out and teach me the ropes.. introduce me to people and perhaps teach me some cool stuff. - Tue Nov 10 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) noticed the earthen shoots blasting at him aiming to hit him from all corners. He tried to jump out of the path of the jutsu but was stopped halfway and ended up locked in place. Fighting these types was the most annoying it was like only being able to play chess, but you werent allowed to know which pieces they had up or not. Fighting without information was always tough but as he struggled he knew he had a few options left even though he was unable to move.* - Tue Nov 10 05:08:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. Can't seem to find anyone. - Tue Nov 10 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: No one's around. - Tue Nov 10 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) noticed the fire around his person before it dissapeared and then the illusion began around him. 

Ziare could be seen at the gates of Konoha, Rias and Slim would be behind him both with their arms crossed. It would be obvious that they were not happy with him and that they wanted nothing to do with him any longer. Suddenly they would begin to speak to him first Slim and then Rias.

"We want nothing to do with you anymore, you're a horrible person and you're dead to us."

"I couldn't possibly have any more hate for you...Just die.."

These words had broken his heart and left him with very little fight left in him. He would be limp just laying on the bamboo shoots now instead of fighting against them trying to slip out like before. In the mirage he would just continously be walking off into the distance as the words "Just Die" were repeated over and over through his mind.* - Tue Nov 10 05:23:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: A..Akira wasn't it? - Tue Nov 10 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) fell to a kneel, at first glance he may have looked destroyed but he would seemingly have gotten a second wind, like a torch that lost it's flame, it was burning like a blazing bonfire.

"Why did you stop, I never said I was done." he said, his voice obviously wasn't pleased with how the match was going so far. If the spar was to keep going he would jump back and throw shuriken weapons at her simultaniously, he only had 3 shurikens on him due to him being poor as shit when it came to expenses.* - Tue Nov 10 05:31:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Hm? - Tue Nov 10 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah. - Tue Nov 10 05:32:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Was wonderin' if you could introduce me to all the key people of our village.. - Tue Nov 10 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Perhaps even teach me some things I should know. - Tue Nov 10 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Ok well. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Look around. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Thats all the key people. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Besides Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Besides that lady* - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: As for things to teach, I got nothing. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Ah. So.. Who's the high ups? - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We have no higher ups. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Everyone is a genin. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Don't we have a kage? - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No, He died a week or so ago. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: DAIKI FOR KAGE - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm.. That sucks. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Man. I need a sensei.. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So do I. - Tue Nov 10 05:37:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Heh. Both in the same boat I suppose. - Tue Nov 10 05:37:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yeah, Might ask that lady after her spar. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She seems to know a thing or two. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm. That does seem like a good idea. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'll let you have her though, no point slumping two of us onto her. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) was hit on the arm and sent back once again, his arm was loose and he lost a good amount of feeling in it. He hated when he coudln't do much, but she walked right into his trap, just past the kunai he had laid down in the shadow just a bit ago. He used the last bit of the strength he had to go through 3 handseals exceedingly fast.

In that moment she should have been binded without even knowing what had binded her since the shadow would have come from behind her and only by a couple feet.* - Tue Nov 10 05:40:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Judging by that hip movement. I'm guessing this is the village bike. - Tue Nov 10 05:42:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: They're still going at it..? - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: Atta boy, Ziare.. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) thinks: I knew you showed potential. - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) created another seal, a seal that was just as familiar as the firat seal that was used at the start of this spar, his own shadow would whip out at Marrisa binding her in place with two shadows. Once she was locked in place and would mimic his movements he would have her walk over to the kunai he had set into the ground and hold it up to her neck, he would be doing the same but with no kunai. 

He was sweating and his vision was beggining to get a bit iffy, he was on his last leg throughout the fight, if it went on much longer he would have to give up from lack of chakra.* - Tue Nov 10 05:51:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would keep the kunai where it was to her neck, her strength wouldn't be enough to move the kunai drastically as long as he actively faught against her. He was running out of juice but he managed to get out, "You need to give up, if I wanted to I culd have slit your throat and won." he told her as he kept the blade to her neck.* - Tue Nov 10 06:06:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Way to go Z! - Tue Nov 10 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) would speak up to her as he continued to fight with everything he had, sweat was drenching his face. "No matter how durable you are, your neck will always be an easy kill." he told her. It was the truth and if he had truely wanted to from the start of his trap he could have cut her neck, but he knew that she would never beleive him or even give up, he hated girls that were so strong willed as her. He tossed the kunai back to himself and releasd the Shadow Immitation Technique. He pocketed the kunai in his pouch and gave up from there, his arm was beggining to hurt and he needed to sit down for a bit.* - Tue Nov 10 06:12:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I'm not holding back. - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: And why would I want to be trained? - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Oi. - Tue Nov 10 06:16:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't think this is quite done. It's been a while since I've went a round with you, Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I must've fallen behind in my training, but I'm sure I can entertain you well. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you say? - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ....he's going to fight her? - Tue Nov 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grabbed the towel and thanked her for it. He wiped his face and dug into his pocket and put his glasses back onto his face. 

He looked for the nearest portion of a gate to learn against and layed against it with the towel over his head just trying to cool off. 

"I'm tired of fighting, that's enough training for the next couple years." he said.* - Tue Nov 10 06:19:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) grabbed the spool of wire, she really wasn't good at explaining things, ever...He looked the wire and began to thing of ways that he would be using the wire. Nothing would come to his mind for something that was a type o shuriken-jutsu. 

He truely didn't want to practice, but he knew that she was in no mood for his bitching at the moment. He would just cut her lessons later when she was in a better mood. "Right right..." he would say to her not knowing what to do but just playing with the string.* - Tue Nov 10 08:15:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Right. . So the process behind this jutsu is deceptivly simple - Tue Nov 10 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: You keep the spool hidden in your sleeve or on your belt, or where ever. Then you gather up chakra and form your handsigns, flowing it into the hidden wire. With that don, you use your chakra to direct where you want the wire to go. It can be amazingly helpful in combat, or in a suprise attack.  - Tue Nov 10 08:18:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) pulled out the wire and looked at it intesnely for a moment, he began to think of the many ways he could use the wire to his advantage in a battle. Not like he could ever use it against Marrisa.

Ziare pulled against the wire to test it's strength, it was extremely flexible, but judging by how hard he was pulling against it, they were fairly strong and stable, able to even make different pitched sounds from how he was plucking them.

Ziare would begin to practice the way he reeled out the string from his hands and from his sleeves. The string would shoot out from his sleeve and into the distance, he shot it a bit too slow. He began to reel the string back into his sleeve and started again.

Ziare started once again, with the string after he had just fully reeled the string in. He whipped his arm foreward at the distance tryng to see if he could reel out the string faster than he noramlly could. The string shot out faster than before, but it wasn't fast enough.

Ziare reeled all of the string back into his wrist as quickly as he could, he immagined that he needed to do that in a real battle. He would then reel it out just as quickly as he reeled it in, it ended up beng a jumbled mess for him.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ziare reeled all of the string back into his sleeve, he needed to reset completely and take it from scratch if he was going to get good at what he was doing at this point. He needed to take it from step one and start using it smarter.

Ziare looked at the tree that they were near and he would have to take it from there. He pulled his arm back and whipped it foreward like the nae nae at the tree trying to get the string to hit close or near to where the tree was. The string shot uselessly near the tree.

Ziare looked at his efforts in vain with a dumb look, this is why he didn't like to train, because he would always end up like this. He sighed as he reeled in his strings once again and prepared another session of throwing strings at trees.

Ziare took a heavy step foreward and lashed his hand foreward at the tree, the strings would move expertly, he was showing small bits of progress. Yeah things were looking up for him until the jutsu fell flat and he fucked up the strings once again.

He reeled the string back and a small smirk was present on his face, he knew that he was slowly making some progress now that he was able to do what he did. He nodded his head at the tree and would begin to think of ways to use the string jutsu.* - Tue Nov 10 09:18:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) stepped up to a large manor next to a small thicket, the thicket was meant to show off the Nara forest which was outside of the village. The door to the house was extremely large as he walked up to it. Small Nara children could be seen playing around the area, some would look over curiously at the new guest. Ziare swore to himself, he hated attracting so much attention.

He opened the door.* - Tue Nov 10 10:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Ziare(Meekee) entered the main room and was greeted by his mother yelling at him once again for having his hair down, he had known better by now and had forgotted to tie it up, but having it up was a pain in the ass for him.

Once she was done yeling at him she would look up at Marrisa seeing a new guest that wasn't Rias or Slim. "Oh my lord...Are you his girlfriend, is he finally intrested in girls?"she would ask nearly tears in her eyes.* - Tue Nov 10 10:03:18 2015
