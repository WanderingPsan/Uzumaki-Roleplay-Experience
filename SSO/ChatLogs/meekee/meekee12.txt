Saika on the other hand had the upper hand on him with this. She was wearing a loose fitting shirt allowing for more air to flow and breathe hrough her clothing. As well as it being light white reflcting the sun a bit. 

He looked up at her and noticed how big he had gotten it, he laughed a bit under his breath, "Sorry, I didn't want to get you something too small, that was my mistake." he admitted to her for the first time.* - Mon Dec  7 19:24:22 2015
