<br><font color=yellow>*Kahn, Bankai(Rexman122) laughed a bit seeing the over grown cat, giggling he jumped back and weaved through a session of hand seals as he took a deep breathe. Now heres when the trick came into play, filling the beast head with his own chakra he would begin too alter the vison and perspective of animal.
~
"Katon! Great fire ball!" He thought too himself for effect as the young male fired a giant fireball it would seem in the beast mind, only added effect was the heart that admited it's way off the blast. The genjustu user able to change and mold techniques he used and with some bit of mastery could fool even the most experience shinobi in the world.
~
The beast would now see it's self running dead into a massive fire ball, the child himself knew this would work against an animal of sorts. Reaching behind his back he grasped a small cap a purple tablet if you will as he laughed clutching it in his right palm just in case. "I'll smoke you out kitty." He thougt too himself with that childish grin on his face.* - Fri Sep 04 09:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) whispers: Include the cat's reaction to your genjutsu) - Fri Sep 04 09:24:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kahn, Bankai(Rexman122) whispers: right now ? - Fri Sep 04 09:25:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kahn, Bankai(Rexman122) as the large kitty darted towards the male it swung it's claws missing by an inch the male himself had been preping a justu and fired off what seemed too be a large ball of fire.
~
Two things entered the beings mind. "Hot & Run." The heat from the fireball was intense indeed, therefore this caused for the animal too begin to sweat with Sunas already burning heat this would cause dyhydration as it began too pant in place, roaring trying too think of an escape plann but sadly the fact it's mind was under the bidding of another it was hard too think or to even rely on instinct.
~
Waving it's tail back and forth it stood there ready too face it's possible death so it thought but the male Bankai wasn't gonna allow for that seeing it was nothing more then a mere trick. He'd fling the purple tablet he had rested in his right hand causing it too hit the ground breaking open releashing a purple poison gas. * - Fri Sep 04 09:29:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kahn, Bankai(Rexman122) nodded his head grasping hold of his Tonto as he walked towards the downed beast stabbing the blade through it's skull. It often happens too seem that animals have no emotions but the beasts expression was just a bit scary too him with chills running down his spine.
~
Blood splashed over his small body and face as he tilted his head too the side, therefore he yawnked his blade out the beast skull splashing it's blood on the floor. The young genin would place away his Tonto with fierece agression laughing a bit as he turned too the other male wondering what was gonna happen next. He did infact manage too lend a hand too him after all but this factor was small indeed.
~
"I got a chance to slay a beast. Interesting." He stated with the kitties blood running down the right side of his face, unphased and ready too move on too the next task.* - Fri Sep 04 09:43:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Kahn, Bankai(Rexman122) would attempt too catch a water bottle as if he was cool, but manged too get hit in the face. He'd gasp and laugh a bit once he kneeled down grasping hold of the water bottle and opened it with ease. Once done he'd pour it on top of his head the water leaking down and rinsing off the blood as he smiled a bit, he felt clean.
~
"Alright i'll follow you mister." He said in a very playful manner indeed, he was a strong willed Genin who did enjoy a good brawl.* - Fri Sep 04 09:50:43 2015
