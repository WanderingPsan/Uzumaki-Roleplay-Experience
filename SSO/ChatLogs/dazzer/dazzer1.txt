<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki Shakaku(Dazzer) twin black eyes scanned over the male before him, unaware of who this individual was he kept the normal; vacant stare about him as he awaited an answer.* - Mon Nov  9 07:37:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki Shakaku(Dazzer) Slowly paced into the area; where a large gathering of people were. His face had a vacant expression as he allowed his twin black eyes to roll upwards, inspecting each individual.* - Tue Nov 10 03:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki Shakaku(Dazzer) says: Hey there. - Tue Nov 10 03:57:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Fancy showin' me the ropes? - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: I am Marrisa. . I don't live here.  - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Come along with us. . Ziare and I are about to spar. - Tue Nov 10 04:00:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hm? May aswell. - Tue Nov 10 04:01:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Wonder if you guys can teach me anything. - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Probably not. - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Alright. .  - Tue Nov 10 04:02:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) allowed his hand to slowly slip out of his cloak; before suddenly performing a click with the slender body parts. Suddenly a puff of smoke was seen just in the gap of which he made by opening his cloak.

Stood there was a small, white and brown dog. In an adorable manner it released a small bark as it rubbed itself upon the Shakaku's leg. To which the cloaked man looked down; before abrumptly parting his lips, releasing a soft, modulated tone towards the small creature.

"Get up here, Muramasa." he stated and almost instantly the fuzzy dog had managed to scale the male, licking his youthful face in the process.* - Tue Nov 10 04:06:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: #.. - Tue Nov 10 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: So, either of you guys watching any good? - Tue Nov 10 04:08:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) eyes rolled towards Ziare who was so easily beaten before raising up a hand and perfoming what appeared to be an 'ok' sign; with his palm facing Muramasa.

"Well, that was a disappointment." he stated before breaking the okay sign with a flick which made contact with Muramasa's nose. Causing him to disperse into smoke.* - Tue Nov 10 04:27:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) thinks: I've...never...Felt like this before... - Tue Nov 10 04:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) thinks: An earth jutsu...I should ask her to teach me some stuff... - Tue Nov 10 05:00:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Wonder if anyone here could help a new genin out and teach me the ropes.. introduce me to people and perhaps teach me some cool stuff. - Tue Nov 10 05:02:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) released a slight shrug as he looked down towards Muramasa who infact didn't disperse. But instead scaled down his body and under his cloak. The Shakaku always used to enjoy making people think he had some kind of unique ability with his dog. However, it was just infact a dog.

"I'll see you guys around. I wanna go find someone to help me out with everything. Afterall I only passed the exam a few days ago." he stated.* - Tue Nov 10 05:03:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. Can't seem to find anyone. - Tue Nov 10 05:14:01 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Was wonderin' if you could introduce me to all the key people of our village.. - Tue Nov 10 05:33:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Perhaps even teach me some things I should know. - Tue Nov 10 05:33:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Besides that lady* - Tue Nov 10 05:34:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: As for things to teach, I got nothing. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Ah. So.. Who's the high ups? - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: We have no higher ups. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Everyone is a genin. - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Don't we have a kage? - Tue Nov 10 05:35:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No, He died a week or so ago. - Tue Nov 10 05:36:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: She seems to know a thing or two. - Tue Nov 10 05:38:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm. That does seem like a good idea. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'll let you have her though, no point slumping two of us onto her. - Tue Nov 10 05:39:37 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Judging by that hip movement. I'm guessing this is the village bike. - Tue Nov 10 05:42:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) twin green eyes followed Akira as he turned before darting off towards the new person on the scene. Scritizing her as he did so.* - Tue Nov 10 05:43:53 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I don't think this is quite done. It's been a while since I've went a round with you, Marrisa. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I must've fallen behind in my training, but I'm sure I can entertain you well. - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Mizeku, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: What do you say? - Tue Nov 10 06:17:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: ....he's going to fight her? - Tue Nov 10 06:18:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) departs the area swiftly.* - Tue Nov 10 06:18:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Don't think I've been noticed yet, ooOoo I'm invisible.~ - Tue Nov 10 06:24:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Sure whats on your mind hun? - Tue Nov 10 06:26:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) noticed the othergirl who had rocked up on the scene; offering her a teethy smile and a breif wave.

"Hey." he spoke in his modulated voice.* - Tue Nov 10 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well uh...I was just wondering if you wanted to go to that tea shop any time soon..? - Tue Nov 10 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) parted his lips once more; directing his words towards Owari.

"I'm Daiki, what's your name?" he quizzed.* - Tue Nov 10 06:33:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) thinks: Hmm, thats cool... I wonder what she is doing? And are there traces of chakra in her eyes? And why am I asking so many questions ? I really dont care.... - Tue Nov 10 06:35:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) nodded softly; as he did so he began to speak to the girl.

"Nice name. So you from this village" The Konohogakure shinobi quizzed intentively. As he did so there was a slight shudder of his cloak of Muramasa bit slightly into his leg and began pulling him closer to the fight. It seemed as it Muramasa was more interested in the fight.

"Do you mind? Mura?"

This was followed by a breif growl as the brown dog stopped it's attempt and simply walked over towards Akira and made itself comfy.* - Tue Nov 10 06:37:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Hmm.. So he knows fire style? - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: I'm guessing I better speak to him soonish.. - Tue Nov 10 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes swiftly noticed the Kirigakure headband. Suddenly losing interest in the girl he shrugged and walked up to Muramasa.

I guess that's why she's so ugly..* - Tue Nov 10 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) thinks: Did I just get blown off because of where I'm from? - Tue Nov 10 06:54:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) tilted his head to look down towards Muramasa. It seemed the fur covered beast was highly focused on the fight going on. As to not disturb him; he'd simply lower himself down to a seated position and begin running his hand through the creatures mane.* - Tue Nov 10 06:56:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) now diverted his attention to Akira.

"Hey Akira, I'm bored watching people spar. Wanna have a quick spar?" he quizzed.* - Tue Nov 10 06:59:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm waiting for a friend at the moment. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm. - Tue Nov 10 07:00:41 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) || Muramasa released a reletively aggressive snarl as Daiki llooked back towards the girl.* - Tue Nov 10 07:02:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: ..... - Tue Nov 10 07:33:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: She isn't good at sparring. - Tue Nov 10 07:42:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Becasue we are opposing fighting types - Tue Nov 10 07:43:21 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: We can spar... just as long as you promise me you will stop before you hit - Tue Nov 10 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm? So you.. don't want to get hurt? - Tue Nov 10 07:49:20 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: As I said I dont really spar - Tue Nov 10 07:55:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Rias, you don't need to spar. - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: But Z might be able to help... or Ortho or Marrisa - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm.. I might go Sunagakure. I'm bored here already. - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Good luck getting in there - Tue Nov 10 07:56:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Why would I need luck? - Tue Nov 10 07:57:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: I dont know, but leaving any village is dangerous - Tue Nov 10 07:57:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) watches as the guard departs to go fetch the individual who needed to scrutize Daiki.* - Tue Nov 10 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) noticed the same guard slowly making his way down the path; un-accompanied. Arching an eyebrow the Shakaku male would ask.

"So where is he?" he quizzed assertively. Scanning the boy before him with his hazel eyes awaiting a form of logical response or action.

However the guard simply replied that the man was slightly busy and would be here shortly. To the distaste of the Konohogakure shinobi. However he accepted is and just offered a breif nod.* - Tue Nov 10 08:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hey there. - Tue Nov 10 08:20:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes diverted back towards Hassan. A slight glint crossed his eye due to the lighting in the area before he slowly bowed down his head. This was reminescent of when a wolf would bow it's head towards it's alpha; acknowledging him and showing him respect before turning to head off towards the white haired man.

Who was supposedly scary. Oooh.* - Tue Nov 10 10:09:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Then we can spar for real. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Not being tripped up? Doesn't sound too hard. - Tue Nov 10 10:14:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) suddenly received a swift strike toward his ankles. Causing him to lose his center of balance and begin leaning towards his left. Shit.. Had he already failed to stay on his feet in the first attempt? Never.

The Shakaku swiftly snapped his fingers twice; from underneath his cloak. Where Muramasa was practically a resident, the Shakaku had his calf bitten by his partner and pulled back down to the ground. Lucky really. It'd have been a shame to lose on the first go.* - Tue Nov 10 10:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes widened as the white haired male continued his onslaught, delivering another kick to the Shakaku's ankle; causing him to completely lose balance along with Muramasa to be sent up into the air. Daiki really had no idea what to do at this point. In all honesty, there wasn't anything he could do..

Thump. The brown haired male slammed against the hard floor of the arena. A pair of slightly frustraited eyes glared towards Sanoke.* - Tue Nov 10 10:28:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Tsk.. - Tue Nov 10 10:28:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) sighed before pushing himself up; "It's.. Fine.. I'll be back once I'm stronger, and you'll be the one brushing the dirt off of yourself." he stated as he began dusting himself before snapping his fingers twice.

Muramasa simply walked back over to Daiki and disappeared into the concealment of his cloak.* - Tue Nov 10 10:34:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) makes his way over to the corner area; parting his cloak slightly before allowing his companion to depart the concealment of his clothing. Once the Shakaku could see that Muramasa had positioned himself a safe distance away before curling up and laying across the ground. The Shakaku offered a breif nod as he closed his twin hazel eyes. Shifting his right foot backwards in the process. In turn disturbing the dirt which was recently settled there.

Swiftly he opened his eyes after intellectualizing about the concept of learning a fighting style known as boxing. He had seen some books mention and slightly skim over the concept however he wasn't what you'd call 'well versed' or 'knowledgable' about it in the slightest.

Muramasa on the other hand just placed his head lazily on it's paw. Still giving off a feral look due to the colouring of its fur and the general wild looking eyes it possessed. However for the dog, this was about as nice as it got.* - Tue Nov 10 13:57:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) decided that it was time for him to start from the pure basics. Which was.. firstly to know and understand the basic boxing stance. Which is known to be very easy for boxers to attack and defend from. Due to the fact that in the stance the user will have both of their hands ready to attack accompanied by the fact that they are positioned to defend. Daiki was aware however this was a reletively basic stance and once he became more advanced would probably change it up somewhat.* - Tue Nov 10 14:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) finally finished intellectualizing about the stance. And moved on to actually visualizing it. Which was quite simple in all honesty for the brown haired male. Analysing his visualisation of a basic but 'proper' boxing stance. The front toe and back heal should be touching an imaginary, vertical line running upwards. Along with keeping the dominant hand back, which in Daiki's case would be his right hand.

Furthermore the weight should be evenly distributed across both the the legs of the user along with having the knees slightly bent in order to increase mobility. An expansion on where the legs should be is that the feet are diagonal and a little wider than a shoulder width apart accompanied by a raised back heel.

The hands are always raised up, just infront of the users face with the elbows down.* - Tue Nov 10 14:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) by now had actually visualized the boxing stance as was now ready to actually put himself in it. Which was good, as he felt like he was slowly understanding more about the art-form.

Firstly the Shakaku male drew a line in the dirt with his foot vertically. Which he used as a mental aid. His front toe was placed on the line whilst his back heel was also on the center line. This was accompanied by having his right hand back. From this his evenly distributed his weight across both of his legs; allowing his knees to bend slightly in the process. His feet were diagonal and a little wider than shoulder width appart and his heels were raised.

Now his hands we held up infront of his face.* - Tue Nov 10 14:16:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) slowly bit into his lips slightly as he became slightly confused. He couldn't relax in this position, something wasn't right and it was really bugging him. After intellectualizing for a while it suddenly hit the Shakaku like a tonne of bricks.

"The Elbows!" he exclaimed to himself before pulling his elbows from their outwards position; having them now positioned down and his hands in front of his face. This is better, it feels much more comfortable now..

After sitting in the position for a while the brown haired male nodded softly before dropping the guard and ending the whole stance. After which he swiftly rubbed at the dirt to get rid of the center line.

A moment passed before the dog-loving boy reconstructed the guard once, without any delay or any mistakes. After doing this, he repeated the act of deconstructing and reconstructing the guard multiple times till it had finally sunk in.* - Tue Nov 10 14:21:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm.. - Tue Nov 10 14:21:52 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hajimari, Owari(TenaciousRiven) says: She left after our training, you were there when she left. - Tue Nov 10 17:30:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hey. Are you busy? - Tue Nov 10 17:43:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) had arrived at the training ground once more with Muramasa walking beside him. The reletively feral creature simply plodded away from the Shakaku boy and laid down on the dirt a safe distance away, leaning up against the fence which ran across the terrain.

The brown haired boy swiftly went over the guard which he had learnt previously. Making sure it was easy for him to establish along with making sure that everything was how it should be. Which it was, thankfully. This meant the Konohakagure shinobi didn't have to spend more time working on it and actually had a decent understanding of it already, showing that this training wasn't just for nothing.

After deconstructing the stance the boy began to think about what else was importanti n boxing.* - Wed Nov 11 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) began intellectualizing about the basic boxing footwork understanding that as a beginner he would have to absollutely master what he refered to as the 'drag-step' and the 'pivot'. Simply due to the fact that they have a large amount of benefits and are easily the most used. The Shakaku did identify that these types of movements could seem difficult to do as he would perhaps have a habit of jummping off the ground instead of keeping them firmly place, like you should in boxing to ensure you're always ready to attack or defend. Plus jumping was always effort. Effort which should not be wasted.* - Wed Nov 11 01:14:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) after thinking about why movement is important the partner of Muramasa then began to focus upon the moves seperately. Starting with the most basic and commonly used movement. The drag-step. Often refered to as the core and most basic boxing movement. Which is simply a step with the leading foot along with dragging the rearfoot back into the natural position of the stance. This was done to ensure that the individual has their weight grounded and can easily goon the offensive or defensive depending on the situation. It then also prevents you crossing your feet and possibly falling off balance.

Daiki then constructed the ever so familiar boxing stance; his eyes closing for a moment as he began to visualize the movements he had to do.* - Wed Nov 11 01:19:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) eyelids parted; revealing a hazel gaze from within their concealment as the brown haired dog lover had finished visualizing what he had to do. The movement was his main priority now he was in the stance.

First Daiki was tasked with moving forwards. This was done by stepping his least dominant foot, in his case left foot forwards and then dragging the right foot to follow. Something which the boy managed to do with some ease. Although he was still a bit shaky when it came to returning perfectly to the stance. Something he'd have to master in reppetition. He also learnt that this was also how he would move left also. As he would just spread his legs horizontally instead of vertically which was very good for him to know.

Now it was learning to go backwards. A different animal entirely, although. It followed the same principle. Simply stepping backwards with his dominant foot, in Daiki's case his right foot and then dragging the left foot after; once again Daiki learnt that this would also have the potential to take him to the right also. Which is a big benefit to his learning.

After doing this the Shakaku would repeat this feat a multitude of times until he was able to comfortably move at speed and accurately return to his basic stance.* - Wed Nov 11 01:26:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) finally nailed the drap-step movement and had a smug grin grace his face in pride. He was picking up this boxing thing pretty good. He wasn't some little rookie at it anymore! Well he was.. but he was getting there, and that's what counts, right?

Anyways, it was now time to move onto the second and last basic movement in boxing. The pivot. The pivot is often regarded as the most important boxing footwork that a boxer will need. It is generally done by pivoting off of the front foot; however in the past is has been done by people using the back foot. One of the keys to why it is so important is that ic can be used to avoid attacks in a defensive manner and find new punching angles in an offensive one. It's also very useful for what is known as counter punching. By taking you out of harms way and keeping you in range to retaliate.

After thinking about all of this information The Shakaku began learning the the pivot. A reletively simple technique. Simply swinging his right foot and allowing his body to pivot over the left foot in the process. Something that was pretty easy and Daiki managed to keep in the boxing stance whilst doing. After practicing for a while; he began to become more accurate with his pivots. Conducting 45 and 90 degrees pivots along with big pivots of 90 degrees and 180 degrees, the latter being more challenging. 

After repeating it a large portion of times he stopped and decided to call it a day.* - Wed Nov 11 01:35:08 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: It's Ortho - Wed Nov 11 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Ortho.. Well I'm Daiki. - Wed Nov 11 04:38:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I was wondering.. If you'd help me out with my Katon? I sorta wanna learn more. - Wed Nov 11 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: I'll pass you a scroll to learn from, sure - Wed Nov 11 04:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Sweet! - Wed Nov 11 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hyuuga in konoha. Woudl be kewl. - Wed Nov 11 04:40:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: So.. What will it teach me? - Wed Nov 11 04:41:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Redrum, Ortho(DhatBoiNick) says: Depends on what you can do already. - Wed Nov 11 04:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: I can use Ninja Art Fire Run. - Wed Nov 11 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) says: That's literally it. Aha. - Wed Nov 11 04:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes open wide as the man appeared to just conjure a scroll out of nothing; a feat he had only seen once in the academy by the teacher. Darting down towards the scroll and scanning it, suddenly he noticed what it read.

'Fireball Jutsu'

Keep it straight to the point, I suppose. However a big grin graced his face as he took the scroll from the man who had offered him the scroll; parting his lips and a modulated voice escaping his mouth.

"Thanks Ortho!"* - Wed Nov 11 04:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) Nodded as the words chimed his ears.

"You bet!" he exclaimed.* - Wed Nov 11 04:56:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) received the pat on his shoulder, as it happened a grin graced his face as he looked down at the scroll before speaking.

"Alright. See you around."* - Wed Nov 11 04:58:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) Arrived at the nearby arena; scroll in hand with Muramasa following him with a rocking motion. The arena was empty; which benefitted the Shakaku greatly as he wouldn't want many people knowing about this training. He was much more intent on letting them think he was just a physical monster. Which right now.. He wasn't either. Although, he was pretty good at Taijutsu. Clearly his best suite.* - Wed Nov 11 05:01:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) watched with his twin hazel eyes as the feral beast known as Muramasa made his way over to the corner. A safe distance away from Daiki as the creature cast it's deep emerald gaze away from the scene. The dog wasn't a fan of the Shakaku's fire style. Due to the fact he's covered in fur and could in fact be set on fire in a battle.

The brown haired male allowed himself to sit down, openinging the scroll and placing it down on the ground.* - Wed Nov 11 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) allowed his eyes to scale downwards towards the scroll in question. Wind disturbing the ground causing dust to cover a segment of the writing; to which Daiki swiftly wafted it off of the paper. Before allowing himself to delve into the knowledge the scroll could provide. The first Chapter read; '

What is the Fireball Jutsu?'

Good question. What was it?* - Wed Nov 11 05:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) allowed himself to begin to think about what he'd expect the Fireball Jutsu to actually be. Quite a hard question. Perhaps it was a small, projectile which could be fired from the hands towards people. Perhaps causing piercing damage along with burn damage. Although that does seem rather complicated to do..* - Wed Nov 11 05:06:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) continued intellectualizing about what the fireball jutsu could be. Perhaps like a football? Like.. A football made of fire which the user would kick at people to engulf them in a raging inferno.. But wouldn't that burn the kicker too? It didn't sound very productive when the Shakaku allowed himself to think about it properly.* - Wed Nov 11 05:08:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) finally decided that he was going to look in the scroll and solve the mystery of what the fireball jutsu actually was. Swiftly his twin hazel eyes scanned the page; absorbing the information as best he could until he found it.

Here it is!

A technique where chakra kneaded inside the body is converted into fire and expelled from the mouth either as a massive orb of roaring flame or as a continuous flame-thrower.* - Wed Nov 11 05:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) had a grin grace his face as he finally found out that the technique was actually a really good one. His Chakra control wasn't the best. However he was confident of his ability to knead his chakra sufficiently. Although the fire being expelled from his mouth, especially in a massive orb or a flamethrower was both thought provoking and quite hard to imagine for the Shakaku.* - Wed Nov 11 05:13:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) had finally finished thinking about the technique and began to continue to read in order to absorb more information on the technique. The next extract went on to say; The scope of the attack is altered by controlling the volume of chakra that is mustered.

* - Wed Nov 11 05:15:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) started to decipher this in his head swiftly understanding that this extract was actually saying the size and overal potential of this technique can come down to the shear amount of chakra that the user invests in the technique. Which in turn makes sense; however it also means that should a highly skilled chakra user, with a large resvoiur use this technique. The capabilities are, scary.* - Wed Nov 11 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) continued to read from the scroll once more. Attempting to find out more information about the technique itself. Something managed to stick out to the Shakaku like a peadofile in a playgroup was this extract; The released flames will engulf their target, and leave a crater on the ground's surface.* - Wed Nov 11 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) once again began hypothesising about how he could use the flames in a fight; especially with that white haired guy from Sunagakure who completely embarrased him in their spar previously. The fact these flames could engulf the target with the shear power to actually leave a large portion of damage to the ground gave the brown haired boy some joy.* - Wed Nov 11 05:20:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) next moved onto the final few lines of the technique; which in turn seemed more like a warning for the technique. Basically making sure anyone who is learning said technique do not use it without considering the consequences.

'This technique apparently requires more than average chakra reserves and most genin should not be able to do this technique.'* - Wed Nov 11 05:22:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) finally reached the bottom of the scroll on this chapter which gave a very breif outline of the data to do with the technique. The key one which straight away caught the Konohagakure shinobi's eye was the rank of the technique.

'C-Rank'* - Wed Nov 11 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) his twin hazel eyes widened as he read the grading of the technique; causing his mouth to open in the process. Suddenly a glimmer of happiness darted across his eye. He had never learnt a technique like this before.. Nothing he could currently do was on par with this technique. Not by a long shot.* - Wed Nov 11 05:25:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) after finally calming himself; and returning to the data at the bottom of the scroll he continued to read.

The nature of the technique was Katon, or in other terms. Fire Release. Which was something Daiki already knew however it did bring a smile too his face as it was absolutely confirmed.* - Wed Nov 11 05:27:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) next he moved onto the data on the techniques range. Which in turn was Short-Range. Which was slightly surprising to the Shakaku however in all honesty. After considering it, it did make sense. It also furthered the boy's pleasure as it basically fitted his specification as the majority of the time he'd be conducting Taijutsu and will be in close quarters allowing this technique to be used in it's fullest.* - Wed Nov 11 05:28:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) had finally covered the last piece of data and proceeded to open the scroll more so, closing the chapter he had previously read. Allowing him to read the next chapter, known as;

 "What do you need to know to do it?"* - Wed Nov 11 05:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) firstly the page began to explain that the individual would have to be compatible with the nature of the technique which was in fact Katon. Luckily for the Shakaku he already knew he was compatible as he had learnt the Ninja Art: Fire Run technique. Meaning he already met this criteria.* - Wed Nov 11 05:34:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) after confirming this he offered a breif nod and continued to read; it began to speak primarily about the user and their chakra reserviour. Explaining that having a very large one is much, much better than having a small one. It also went on to explain that should you run out of chakra. You will die, so it practically explained this jutsu /could/ kill the user if used incorrectly.* - Wed Nov 11 05:36:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shakaku, Daiki(Dazzer) finally he managed to reach the last segment of the chapter. Which was a segment which was there to explain the handseals along with allow the user time to memorize the handseals. Each combination of handseals were accompanied by pictures of the handseals just below them to help beginners. However Daiki was pretty comfortable with handseals.* - Wed Nov 11 05:38:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) allowed his eyes to swiftly scan the two hand seals combinations. The first seeming far less complex and simple to conduct. Along with being faster due to not needing as many seals to conduct. Quite easy in turn. The first hand seal combination was the Tiger handseal followed by another Tiger handseal.* - Wed Nov 11 05:40:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) however the Shakaku was aware the handseals could infact both be relevant in terms of uses of the technique; so he made sure to quickly survey and memorize the second set of handseals which were as follows; Snake>Ram>Monkey>Boar>Horse>Tiger.* - Wed Nov 11 05:41:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) After finally deciding that it was not time to stop reading and actually start practicing and hopefully nailing the jutsu first time. Slowly he elevated himself up, with the use of his slender hands from the dirty ground which he had sat to read the scroll; closing his eyes slightly as he brushed himself down and faced west.* - Wed Nov 11 05:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) tilted his head to his left; quickly taking a last look over both sets of seals which can create this technique. At this point he began kneeding his chakra; similar to how he does when he conducts Ninja Art: Fire Run. This was him simply just doing what was natural to him when trying to use Katon jutsu.* - Wed Nov 11 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) turned back to face the was before raising up both of his reletively slender arms and suddenly slamming them together. Leaving the two fingers closer to the thumb pointing upwards; and allowing the other two to entwine with each other. He then repeated the construction again. Due to the Tiger seal being associated with Fire Manipulation, it was clear Daiki had an understanding of it. Suddenly he began to inhale; allowing the Chakra he conjured to mix with the air which had been inhale before he swiftly exhaled it; creating an all be it, unstable.. but raging flamethrower. Leaving very minor burn marks on his cheeks.* - Wed Nov 11 05:50:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) finished conjuring the flamethrower causing it to disperse by not feeding it anymore chakra so to speak of. He felt slightly fatigued. Leading him to understand why the technique had to be used correctly. Due to what he used being an unstable and all be it; weaker version. He hadn't used up nearly as much chakra as he would have if he was in a fight.

Anyways he now proceeded to create the other set of handseals; swiftly crafting them before.. Poof! Out of the boys mouth constructed a orb of fire; however unlike the finished article.. It did have rugged edges.* - Wed Nov 11 05:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hmm.. You seen anyone around? - Wed Nov 11 05:55:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: T-That little... - Wed Nov 11 06:03:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hey. I don't suppose either of you fancy a soft spar? - Wed Nov 11 06:04:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: ...Do you live here? - Wed Nov 11 06:04:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Nah. The Kage said I can be here though. - Wed Nov 11 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Oh. - Wed Nov 11 06:05:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: I'll spar you. - Wed Nov 11 06:05:39 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Mhm. - Wed Nov 11 06:06:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: You're only little. However if you're anything like what the rest of the people in Sunagakure. You're not one to mess with. - Wed Nov 11 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: So, what's the rules? - Wed Nov 11 06:07:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Nothing lethal. - Wed Nov 11 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: But. .  - Wed Nov 11 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Everything else goes. - Wed Nov 11 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: I saw you-- - Wed Nov 11 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marco(Gtgoku55) says: And he's gone. - Wed Nov 11 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: What would you class as lethal? - Wed Nov 11 06:08:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Lethal is defined as sufficient enough to cause death. - Wed Nov 11 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Or permanant injury. - Wed Nov 11 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: A'ight. Well, let's start. - Wed Nov 11 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Your move. - Wed Nov 11 06:09:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Are they going to fight? - Wed Nov 11 06:09:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes fixated upon the little girl. He wasn't going to mess around to much in this spar. For all he know, this could be the girl that Yan mentioned was good with Katon. If that was the case.. Daiki would probably be outmatched here, which was a shame. However he had to still go for it.

Suddenly from out from underneat his cloak a brown, fierce looking dog emerged with deep emerald eyes which gazed directly towards Izanami. The Konohagakure shinobi on the other hand had proceeded to go down upon his all fours, his body seemingly gaining a more feral look as his nails began to grow and his teeth seemed larger and more, beastly.* - Wed Nov 11 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: She's gone... - Wed Nov 11 06:12:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: Run up nigga i may be a pirest buy I can still whoop yoiur sleep deprived ass...  - Wed Nov 11 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: YEAHHHH!!!! - Wed Nov 11 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lyan, Bryson(Ninjagangster90210) says: -omit- - Wed Nov 11 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: SHUKAKU, SICK HIM! - Wed Nov 11 06:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *falls asleep* - Wed Nov 11 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: -omit- - Wed Nov 11 06:15:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) swiftly darted forwards; at the same time so did Muramasa. Both charging forwards like a pack of rampaging wolves; heading directly towards Izanami. Muramasa arrived first, leaping off his hind legs towards the girl arrempting to embed his teeth in her shoulder. Whilst Daiki in his feral form sent a large, wild slash vertically across her body, avoiding where Muramasa could be.* - Wed Nov 11 06:19:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) eyes noticed; even with their feral look that Muramasa was beaten away by the girl and sent out of the way of the conflict. Meanwhile his wrist was also beaten away from the girls figure; surprised by the girls speed. It signified to him that this could well be the girl he was told to find by Yan. To help him with his Katon, however there was only one way to be sure.

Suddenly dropping down to the floor and skidding around the girl he'd craft two handseals, from his lowered position. Two Tiger signs. 

Daiki swiftly parted his lips; breaking the seal and making an okay sign as fire began to be expelled from his mouth towards the girl in a roaring flamethrower. Hoping she'd react with a jutsu of her own to find out if it is her.* - Wed Nov 11 06:32:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) swiftly received a swift bash towards his head; completely setting his seals off and causing him to end up laid upon the dusty ground of the arena. Slowly his feral look seemed to disperse from his being. It seemed he was still weary of pushing his chakra low due to the concequences it could have. After so he simply laid there, placing a hand upon his head. Rubbing it to soothe it.

* - Wed Nov 11 06:39:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) arched an eyebrow towards the girl. Offering the best attempt at a nod he could whilst laid down.

"Erm.. Yeah?" he stated as Muramas approached him, biting his shoulder and pulling him to a seated position.* - Wed Nov 11 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm...word of advice..if your seal speed isn't that fast, establish distance before trying to use ninjutsu. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Shall we continue? - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Ivel(OmniKage) says: Word. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Nah. I was only using it to find something out, if I'm honest. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: Hm? - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Normally, I wouldn't rely on ninjutsu. - Wed Nov 11 06:42:20 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: What were you trying to figure out? - Wed Nov 11 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Yan said some girl could show me how to use some Katon ninjutsu. I was curious if that was you. - Wed Nov 11 06:43:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryujin, Izanami(Twerk_Tyrant) says: You want to learn how to use katon? - Wed Nov 11 06:43:12 2015
