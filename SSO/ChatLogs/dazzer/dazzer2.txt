<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) offered a breif wave towards the two before smiling and departing whilst saying.

"Make sure he knows I'm very grateful!"* - Wed Nov 11 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) performed a U-turn and left the room. Clearly they were here for privacy.* - Wed Nov 11 07:29:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) swiftly walked into the establishment making a large order of ramen, miso ramen and vegetable ramen to go. After receiving it all he headded home.* - Wed Nov 11 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) dumped off the food in his house. Putting it all in the fridge and what not.* - Wed Nov 11 08:17:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes move over the building before him; he knew exactly what he was going to do. In fact, he hadn't even considered the reppercusions of it should he get caught. Rapidly he withdrew 5 exploding tags; Four were set out on the corners of the ramen shop and the latter was slapped directly ontop of it.

Daiki would then retreate a safe distance away; where he began thinking about his plan and how it would.. In turn, make him rich! Swiftly he constructed the tiger seal. Causing the bombs to go off, and ultimately the building to collapse.* - Wed Nov 11 08:35:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) reached into his backpouch; removing several pieces of paper. Otherwise known as explosive tags as he approached the building a few meters ahead. Scrutinizing it with his hazel brown eyes as he did so. Scanning it for weak points. He highlighteded the corners primarily as the weakpoints. He wanted to be rich, so he could frequent the other lands as often as he could. A rather selfish aspect of the boy however an aspect of his personality none the less.

Swiftly he approached the building. Slapping four explosive tags on each corner. Making sure they were well set to activate when he needed before leaping up onto the roof and placing a final one directly in the center of the roof.

The dog lover had never done something like this before. Although, it was pretty exciting to say the least. Swiftly he leaped away, rejoining with Muramasa a good and safe distance away from the building before finally muttering a phrase.

"And so it begins.." whilst he created the Tiger handseal causing the explosive tags to go off. The building lost it's foundations due to the corners of it being completely blown up. Not to mention the roof caving in in the process due to the tag also on the roof.

Anyone inside the eastablishment would have to be extremely lucky to survive it. Most likely, if not certainly however. They'd die. Smoke could be seen rising up indicating for Daiki to hurry up and depart, to which he abliged.* - Wed Nov 11 08:53:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) Yep.* - Wed Nov 11 08:58:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Fuck.. They saw my face.. - Wed Nov 11 09:04:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) Begins learning the next technique scroll he was gifted by his friend Izanami. Slowly he allowed himself to sit down; opening the scroll and sprawling it out across the hard ground of the training arena.* - Wed Nov 11 09:42:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) had made his way into Konoha, simply by scaling the rockface located behind the village. The boy who had recently gained the name 'The Ramsplosion Kid' seemed set on something. Although he didn't mean to kill anyone, well he did. But that was simply just business. He however did set out now on targetting the village hidden in the leaves simply due to the astronomical bounty set on himself, which he personally found laughable. Although, he did embrace everything that had happened. For example; he now wears a mask, made out of the cloth from his old village headband and a ramen bowl with two hole cut out for his eyes and one cresent cut out for his mouth, constantly giving the impression that he was laughing or smiling happily.

It was dangerous for him to have come back to Konohagakure so early, It wasn't long ago he actually destroyed the ramen shop  and in turn killed the ramen man and all his family. However now Daiki was a rouge, so he must act like one. Survival is key. Nothing else matters. The Ex-Konoha shinobi knew full well that his bounty would lure people towards him. 500,000 yen was a lot, especially in times like this. So he had to make sure that should they come, they're restricted or have certain limits which will hinder their succession rate. Firstly starting with the most obvious, the weapon shop. Or more importantly. The weapons man.

If the boy managed to take out the weapon seller, then the people who would be coming for him. Who will primarily be Konoha shinobi would be extremely limited in their weaponry resources. Meaning he may have the edge or more specifically.. They won't have the edge on him. Which would be a reassurance to the missing nin at a time like this, however he was primarily focused on the job at hand. Taking out three Kunai, he'd swiftly attatch a paper bomb to each of them before eyeing up the shop in itself.

After scrutinizing the shop through the eye holes of his ramen-bowl mask, the now rouge shinobi made his advance. Swiftly, as if done a thousand times over. Which it wasn't. The boy tossed the three kunai, with paper bombs attatched towards the weapon store. All three of which impacting the walls in a horizontal line several feet apart. Finally the boy swiftly pulled out another kunai; attaching a paper bomb to it before tossing it towards the roof of the building. Clearly intent on making the building collapse in on itself.

Due to being a safe distance away, however cautious of his escape the Ramsplosion Kid decided to move even further away from the explosion. Hoping to use it as a diversion for his escape. Once positioned he muttered to himself in a echoed, but modulated tone; due to his mask.

"The second coming..." before swiftly constructing the Tiger seal and causing the explosions to go off once more, in a similar manner to how the ramen shop was dealt.

The weapon shop was delt three explosions at it's rear, causing the front half to come tumbling inwards due to the weight of the roof before the paper bomb on the roof exploded, causing the roof to collapse inwards also. The weapon dealer would have been crushed inside. Dead. Well that was the case in Daiki's mind. After all, he couldn't have expected the attack at all, it came from behind, right where he is normally positioned to sell his goods. Meaning he'd have been hit by the blasts along with the collapsing of the building.

By this time the masked shinobi had already made it out of Konoha and managed to reach the boarder near the forrest. However it'd be easy for people to see, that this was the work of none other than.. The Ramsplosion Kid.* - Wed Nov 11 12:15:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) leaped upon the kage mansion via the cliff just above it. Once reaching it he'd allow himself to decend further; withdrawing a kunai and begin carving into the kage building.* - Fri Nov 13 14:47:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) swiftly he darted to the next part of the building before carving another message.* - Fri Nov 13 14:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) allows himself to be seated upon the top of the building. Seated whilst his legs dangle.

"Hey there guys."* - Sat Nov 14 08:00:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Oooh. This looks fun, - Sat Nov 14 08:03:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Hey Miss! - Sat Nov 14 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: That was impressive. Hah, - Sat Nov 14 08:14:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) still wearing his bowl mask looks towards the girl through the eyeholes.

"Very good show. Say. I don't suppose you're a rouge too? If you are.. I may have a propositionw which could make us both rich."* - Sat Nov 14 08:16:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: ....Go on... - Sat Nov 14 08:19:12 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Heh.. Well, When I was in a village.. I targetted certain establishments. Establishments which I could take advanatge of their trade. - Sat Nov 14 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Once these establishments were... gone. - Sat Nov 14 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: Oh yeah? - Sat Nov 14 08:20:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: People would be forced to pay my extortionate fixed cost for goods. - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: ..I see...So basically...You're just a normal businessman... - Sat Nov 14 08:21:45 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Kinda. Kinda not. I mean, I did have something else in mind.. Although, It's all just theoretical at the moment. - Sat Nov 14 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: What is it that you have in mind? Huh? - Sat Nov 14 08:22:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Well.. I recently noticed. After going after the weapons store of Konoha.. - Sat Nov 14 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Bandit Leera(They.Call.Me.Wynn) says: Mhm... - Sat Nov 14 08:24:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: That I can cut a trade off entirely. With this, we could use another neibourning village such as Suna to show their 'compassion' by selling weapons and providing health care to the people of Konoha. Whenever they try to rebuild, we knock down their buildings and kill anyone who shows clear opposition. - Sat Nov 14 08:25:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Slowly but surely running down the village into nothingness. Perhaps even using our strengthened relationship with Suna to perhaps push us in as the governing body, or high ups so to speak. - Sat Nov 14 08:26:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) mouth created a cresent shape; along with his eyes as she approached him in a kind manner. Although this wouldn't have been visable due to his mask. Offering his hand out he'd return the shake.

"Heh. Thanks miss... I never got your name?" he quizzed.* - Sat Nov 14 08:28:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes opened wide as she pulled him towads him; more importantly  pushing her blade towards his midsection. At this point it was highly likely that Daiki was stabbed by the blade...

"Heh.." he spluttered out.* - Sat Nov 14 08:33:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) snapped his fingers as the girl attempted to toss him; From beneath his cloak's cover out jumped Muramasa! A medium sized, feral looking dog which was covered in brown fur, razor sharp teeth and long, sharp claws.

The dog attempted to bite the girls mid section whilst plunging his claws into her things. Due to how close proximity they were, it'd be interesting to see how she'd cope with both of her hands being used on Daiki himself.* - Sat Nov 14 08:41:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) reacts as fast as he possibly could to his hand being released by the girl swifty forming two handseals; Tiger seals.

"Fire Style: fireball jutsu!" suddenly the boy began exhaling a roaring flame towards the girl; knowing Muramasa was fine as he was knocked out on the floor.* - Sat Nov 14 09:01:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) swiftly rolls away from the oncoming lighting attack; blood still pouring out of his wound. Noticing the other people around. He wasn't planning on sticking around.. There was far too many people here. His face began to gain a cruel; feral look as he let out a swift snarl.

"Beast Mimicry.." he muttered as he went on all fours; still bleeding as he used his mouth to pick up Muramasa; before attempting to escape.* - Sat Nov 14 09:17:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Done. - Sat Nov 14 09:21:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) Continued to flee the area; with Muramasa in his mouth.* - Sat Nov 14 09:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: .. - Sat Nov 14 10:18:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) stumbles through the back entrance of Kirigakure; wounded from his current battle.* - Sat Nov 14 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mngh... - Sat Nov 14 10:30:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) looks towards the guards as they seem concerned; swiftly parting his lips.

"You gonna help me or not?!" he quizzed aggressively.* - Sat Nov 14 10:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ..That guy that got stabbed.. - Sat Nov 14 10:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Tsk,, - Sat Nov 14 10:34:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes roll up towards the Mizukage. A new face, that's for sure.

"I..I-I've been better.. Heh.." he murmered.* - Sat Nov 14 10:34:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: The the fuck let - Sat Nov 14 10:35:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: omit - Sat Nov 14 10:35:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes moved towards Zaire; who was being requested to take Daiki to the hospital. Interesting; an odd smirk graced the boy's face; although concealed by his mask.* - Sat Nov 14 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: You want me to take him to the hospital? - Sat Nov 14 10:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Tch, fat chance, I should kill him right now. - Sat Nov 14 10:40:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: We must get a cell ready for our visitor. Come Hachirou. - Sat Nov 14 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: Alright. - Sat Nov 14 10:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Actually...I've changed my mind. - Sat Nov 14 10:42:33 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yumiko(Ekario) thinks: A cell? Wait who is this guy? - Sat Nov 14 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) says: ---- - Sat Nov 14 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hachirou(Assassin241) thinks: Money is money. - Sat Nov 14 10:44:16 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Heiwa, when you're done here, come to my office so that I can reward you and get a debriefing. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Mizukage**(Wynokx) says: Same with you Ziare. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: I don't need a reward. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) smirked further.

"I haven't actually.. robbed anyone.. Heh.." suddenly larching backwards and making a break for it. Gaining a feral look once more, as he planned to run to Sunagakure.* - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ziare(Meekee) says: Oh he's gone.. - Sat Nov 14 10:45:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Heiwa(PythonJedi) thinks: ...We almost died getting this guy? - Sat Nov 14 10:45:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) Parted his lips, releasing a echoing voice back towards Hachirou.

"Everyone who attains some kind of glory.. Or Wealth.. Always ends up being wanted at some point. I, Will be special. I will be rich.. See you around.. Perhaps when I'm all healed up." 

His mask giving a happy look as he continued  his sprint away.* - Sat Nov 14 10:51:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) realized this individual was not capable of keeping up with him; even in his normal form. So he dropped his beast mimicary and tossed backm at the gate what appeared to be a ramen bowl with some sort of paper on it..

The bowl would have slammed against the archway of the door, at which point the Ramplosion Kid performed the tiger seal. Causing the paper on the bowl to explode. Hopefully causing the entrance to tumble down.* - Sat Nov 14 10:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) continued to run off.* - Sat Nov 14 10:57:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) arrives at the Sunagakure gates; blood now dried upon his clothes. However it's clear to see the rouge is in a deal of pain and has an open wound.* - Sat Nov 14 11:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes looked up towards the Kazekage. As he decided it was best he met him with his face; he pulled off his ramenbowl mask. Placing it upon the dog beside me before offering it a soft nod and diverting all his attention to the Kazekage.* - Sat Nov 14 11:19:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: S-Sorry to bother you, Kazekage. - Sat Nov 14 11:20:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Sorry? - Sat Nov 14 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Yeah.. When I came here previously, you were nothing but kind.. And I yet again rock up here with a request.. - Sat Nov 14 11:20:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Although; I suppose I do have a proposition. Although, I doubt that'll change much. - Sat Nov 14 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Save it. - Sat Nov 14 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You already know what's going to happen. - Sat Nov 14 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm.. - Sat Nov 14 11:21:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: B..Beware of Kirigakure.. - Sat Nov 14 11:22:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) released a subtle sigh. He really couldn't be doing with another confrontation. He already lost too much blood as it is, however this seemed inevitable. Sadly.

"Heh. Least you found the humour in what happened in Konoha. Although personally, I preferred my second strike on Konoha. As I thought you would have." A grin graced his face further.

"After taking out their only means of arment. Good 'ld Sunagakure could rock up and sell weapons for extortionate prices. They'll buy because.. Well.. they have to, anyways less of business. How do you want this to go down?" he quizzed comically.* - Sat Nov 14 11:26:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm going to take your arm as punishment and detain you. - Sat Nov 14 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you run. - Sat Nov 14 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you hide. - Sat Nov 14 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: If you look at me wrong. - Sat Nov 14 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I will murder your dog. - Sat Nov 14 11:27:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Do you understand? - Sat Nov 14 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Tsk.. My arm? - Sat Nov 14 11:28:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) was already planning a move of his own; however he wasn't really 100% for a fight. However as the man began weaving handseals; he had no choice; swiftly  his hands emerged from his cloak; both holding bowls of ramen; with paper bombs attatched to the bottom of them. Tossing them to either side of the entrance, allowing them to explode.

If successful the Ramplosion kid was set on brining the walls of the entrance down on the guards, and hopefully the Kazekage too. Or even just seperating the two for long enough to escape.

Whether Daiki would lose his arm after this. Depends if this would affect Muhammeds handseals. If not, Daiki would lose an arm after tossing.* - Sat Nov 14 11:34:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) snapped the fingers of his only hand; instructing Muramasa to collect his arm; before getting restrained by the guards.* - Sat Nov 14 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: M..Moth-Tsk. - Sat Nov 14 11:39:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Your strategy was pretty shity. - Sat Nov 14 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: It may work on low tier villages. - Sat Nov 14 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But i'm the Top Dawg. - Sat Nov 14 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: I..I wasn't planning on fighting here. - Sat Nov 14 11:41:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Sunagakure was always good to me.. So I left them be. - Sat Nov 14 11:42:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: You wouldn't have made it regardless. - Sat Nov 14 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: We have open arms to many people. - Sat Nov 14 11:44:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: But not terrorist. - Sat Nov 14 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: I'm not just 'A Terrorist.' - Sat Nov 14 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: I..I'm a business man. - Sat Nov 14 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Right... - Sat Nov 14 11:44:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: Anyway the guards will keep you here. - Sat Nov 14 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Muhammed Hassan(Ziare1) says: I'm late for my dinner. - Sat Nov 14 11:45:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Mhm.. - Sat Nov 14 12:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) thinks: Does this guy even know where he's going. - Sat Nov 14 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Think you could like.. Get me a medic? - Sat Nov 14 12:22:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: You'll have a medic come heal you soon. - Sat Nov 14 12:24:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: 'Don't do anything stupid or you'll be killed' he says. - Sat Nov 14 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Following; "Wait here for your execution. - Sat Nov 14 12:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) release a sigh.. before slumping himself down below the sink; looking upwards towards the roof. The dim and dirty cell made him realize what his life had come to, he was going to die.. He was going to be executed.. There was no changing this..

Gulped largely; as the missing nin hypothesised about how they might do it. Before going over what he did, everything he did. He was more than proud of. It was.. oddly satisfying. Pleasurable even. A smirk graced his face as his twin hazel eyes scaled down his person towards his mask. Albeit a ramen bowl with two eye holes and a cresent for it's mouth.

People.. Will remember the Ramplosion Kid.. That made this all worth while..* - Sat Nov 14 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Need somethin'? - Sat Nov 14 12:36:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) released a breif chuckle.

"Hahaa.. Odd question for a loyal pawn like yourself, wouldn't you agree?" he stated in a comical tone before continuing.

"Tell me.. Why have you committed yourself to a life of crime?" he quizzed.* - Sat Nov 14 12:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) continued to laugh; before parting his lips to speak once more.

"I'll answer your previous question. If you're asking why I'm a rouge. Simple really. I can do what I want when I want. I'm not obligated to do /anything/ I don't want to. If I don't want to kill the little farmers who are making their living then I don't have to." he paused for a moment before continuing.

"You on the other hand have to if you're told. So from what I said, I'm not commited to a life of crime. The joy of being a rouge is not being committed to anything. Although, that may be a bit hard for a little jigsaw piece to understand." his grin grew larger before talking again.

"Currently, I belong to no village. Originally I was from Konoha."* - Sat Nov 14 12:43:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) smirked.

"Read into it what you will, although. They've not bee on a whim. Each attack had meaning. Appart from me Kirigakure one, that one was just a parting present for you guys trying to kill me whilst I was injured." he stated.* - Sat Nov 14 12:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: Hmm...So you accept unto yourself, this freedom to do what you will...But you seem to not accept the consequences of your actions. - Sat Nov 14 12:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: I never said I didn't accept my consequences. I'm still here aren't I? - Sat Nov 14 12:48:51 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) sighed as the boy spoke. Daiki really didn't really want to spend his last moments talking to someone so caught up in the system. Simply he'd say.

"Soo.. Your so called freedom comes at the price of doing everything your told right?" he quieries.* - Sat Nov 14 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: If it's by someone above you? - Sat Nov 14 12:53:07 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) Smiled.

"If you mean to say, you're the Mizukage...Which I doubt.." he allowed his speach to go on.

"You should really put your robes back on, you look better all concealed away. Heh... If you want me to die in here go for it, if you want to let me into your village go for it. I don't care either way. I will not 'bow' before anyone though. Nor will I follow your way of things."* - Sat Nov 14 12:59:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) released a slight chuckle at the male's speach.

"I'm the fool? Very interesting... See, I'd say the same thing about you. You've missed something right under your nose." He confidently spoke.* - Sat Nov 14 13:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Liu Mengde(Wynokx) says: I've missed something? What do you mean? - Sat Nov 14 13:05:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: Oh no I can't say. I mean, I'm a fool right? I couldn't possibly have noticed it if you didn't? - Sat Nov 14 13:05:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) chuckled slightly as he raise himself a moved into the center of the room; tapping the sole of his foot onto the hard ground of the cell; a grin graced his face as he also began clicking his fingers.

"It's times like this, It's good to be alive. No?" he quizzed.

Meanwhile; Muramasa. His feral dog, who had managed to sneak into the village sticking close to some merchants. Still with Daiki's severed arm; in which a explosive tag was held made his way to the back of the prison. Directly behind Daiki's cell, which he found with his sense of smell and the missing nins cracking, in tune clicking, before he fled off.

Daiki parted his lips.

"See.. I'm not really one for living a boring life. Limited one even. Ya'know?" he quizzed.* - Sat Nov 14 13:11:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) Crunched his single hand. An explosion happened out side. It was true, the walls were  pretty thick. That much was certain. The walls were scalded and weakend on the outer layer. Causing a considerable amount of damage however directly towards the ground; rupturing his toilet piping causing the outside area to become water logged. Whilst inside the prison cell was as dry as a whistle.The rouge nin smirked softly.

"Part one, it seems." He murmered.* - Sat Nov 14 13:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) twin hazel eyes look at the clone before him; Was he really going to do this now? Oh well. It can't be helped. Daiki swiftly jumped into the air; thrusting a kick towards the clones face. Hopefully making it poof in the process.

"Say. Mizukage. Where did you put my stuff?... Oh well." Once again crunched his hand; Wherever the Mizukage put Daiki's items would instantly explode. Considering there was about 30 explosive tags. Ouch.* - Sat Nov 14 13:30:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Daiki(Dazzer) says: There's probably more like 40, its painful to count on here. - Sat Nov 14 13:31:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) swiftly dodged the assult from the slash at his throat; In order to complete his actions.* - Sat Nov 14 13:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) had a strike make its way towards his throat; slamming right against his adams apple. Which lead to him begin choking.* - Sat Nov 14 13:43:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) ||And stumbling backwards.* - Sat Nov 14 13:44:19 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Daiki(Dazzer) felt a kunai delve deep into his throatal region; slicing through his skin as if it was butter. Pressed in deep and hard, the missing nin's hands dart up to his neck. Placing themselves on the kunai as he slowly decended down the wall he was now pushed up against. Blood spewing out of his neck as he did so... Was this it?* - Sat Nov 14 13:52:51 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Dagu(Dazzer) says: Alright. You wanna set me up how I should start then? - Sat Nov 14 14:14:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Dagu(Dazzer) noticed the beast's attack growing bigger and bigger. Dagu knew full well he was going to have to do something; Swiftly he approached the creature; weaving through several hand seals before inhaling deeply; using his Hero Release Chakra in his lungs before releasing what appears to be a thick mist from his mouth, directed towards the beast.* - Sat Nov 14 19:50:24 2015
