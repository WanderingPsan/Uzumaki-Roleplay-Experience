<br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Had never before in her life saw someone that large. He was not just tall. Oakly from the General Goods store was tall. Legends said he was about seven feet tall.

This guy was not tall.
This was a walking, talking, behemoth. And he was a good few inches taller then Oakly.

The teenager felt frozen footed, a goofy smile on her face. The one that a prey would have when trying not to get killed.

Not unlike that of a terrified bunny.
''..O-Ohai!'' * - Mon Sep 28 19:51:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Was a good five feet and three inches. Not too short for a girl her age. But definetly nothing compared to this walking, talking mountain. She took a moment to calm herself down. That weapon of his was likely used for mass genocide. That was the only reasonble exaplanation. 

''..I..'' She muffled something incoherent, her lower lip quivering.
Valencia looked the part of a young Ninja. Physically fit. Quite pretty. Lean and small.

She was by no means a 'Lady'. This was a kunoichi. A few daggers and shurikans likely hiding in every inch of her attire.

''..I'm Valencia. I'm looking for a--''
She zipped it. Biting on her lower lip.
Idiot. She was looking for a sparring partner.
This was likely a bad choice.

Instead, she merely waved her hand in a dismissive fashion!* - Mon Sep 28 20:01:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Okay.
So I can keep underdog...?
And...Is Anteater good or should I beg for a re-roll.* - Mon Sep 28 20:03:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Wasn't one to back out of a conflict.
She was a Ninja.

She was one to sneak away-- And come back for a backstab.
But- then again. What's the worse that could happen!

She clapped her hands together and grinned. It was not that her terror had passed, in fact, she seemed to do her best to fight through it. ''..Very well.'' Her skin turned slightly purple, perhaps a side effect of the sheer horror she was going through at her next statement.

''..I want to challange you to a duel.'' 

<b><i>Fuck.* - Mon Sep 28 20:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: ...Hmh? - Mon Sep 28 20:13:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Let's go. - Mon Sep 28 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Very well. - Mon Sep 28 20:24:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Held her ground.
It wasn't often that a mice tried to take on a hippo.
She wasn't about to just give up. Years has gone by with her remaining a Genin. No one of importance.

No one spectacular. Nothing outstanding about her. A very raw, and very basic shinobi. One that was often sent on the least exotic missions. She was mostly an escort or a cat retriever. Not anymore. She set herself on a new path. This was going to be her path to glory. To real action.

She had only one -real- jutsu she could call upon. Her secret weapon.
But it wasn't like she was going to start off using that.
That'd be dumb.

The female took a moment to gauge her opponet before unhooking one of her meele Kunai. She charged at him, sprinting at the best speed she could muster--Which wasn't that much.

And then she'd go for the stab. Straight up. Through the neck.* - Mon Sep 28 20:28:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Missed the mark. Rather then the weak, deadly artery blow she sought, she struck his chest.

She didn't expect to hit him at all.
Nor did she expect the strike to do so little to him.
The sheer durability he put on display was simply mind boggling. Without much of a chance to recover from all the momentum she wasted on the strike, she was caught in his hands, her shoulders now being squeezed between his massive palms.

''..S-Shit..''

She tried to squeak out of his hold, to no avail. His sheer strength likely keeping her in place, firmly in his grasp.* - Mon Sep 28 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Widend her eyes.
She shouldn't have allowed herself to get caught up in something like this.
She couldn't even use her secret weapon like that. It wouldn't work from that angle.

This was bad.
Very bad.

With a loud crash, she was driven into the ground, blood ebbed out of her lips and her entire body shook from the tremors of pain. It felt as though her ribs were cracked, but overall, this could've ended far worse.

Smothered and crushed, she ley on the ground, eyes closed.* - Mon Sep 28 20:57:23 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Took the hand offered to her.
She was pulled up.

''..I-I'm fine..'' 
A blatant lie.
It felt as though a monster truck ran over her.
''..Good fight.'' She mumbled out before plopping to the ground, nursing the many bruises on her arms.

Her shoulders in particular ached.* - Mon Sep 28 21:10:11 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Twitched. She seemed unhappy. Most girls in these parts would react with violence. Maybe hit Harada. Make him pay.
She wasn't like that.

In fact, she seemed almost aloof to it as she walked past him, her shoulder brushing against his quite intentionally.

On the inside however.

''..Fucking asshole, I will kill him. Idiot! I hate him! I should hit him! I should just make him do something really painful, like, stick his hand inside a bathtub while I throw an electric bulb in it.. Wait, that won't work, I'll have to use something that still has energy in it...''

The murmuring in her head continued, while on the outside she seemed rather peaceful, going as far as flashing him her brilliant, innocent smile.* - Mon Sep 28 21:26:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Blinked a few times.

''..Me and you..?'' * - Tue Sep 29 06:27:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Right. - Tue Sep 29 06:29:07 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Where should we go? - Tue Sep 29 06:29:07 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Valencia White(Rosevine) says: Sure. - Tue Sep 29 06:29:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Was not one to hold grudges. It wasn't in her character. Most people would go on for days, months and years with that same ebbing feeling of anger at someone who punted them so hard. But that wasn't the case with this shinobi. Clad in a yoga like outfit, yoga pants and a tight fitting long shirt, she seemed to be ready for training. The only remarkble thing about her attire was her forhead protector.

Made from a precious metal, with the gorgeous leaf sigil imprinted onto it. She clapped her hands together and grinned. ''..Let's start.'' 

She didn't train types. She wasn't one to do that. She had something far more special up in her sleeve. The pretty kunoichi reached her thumb to her lips and shot him a wink. ''.. I don't know which element I own. But this is my fighting style.'' A quick bite created a little cut on her thumb, drawing out some blood. The sanguine, thick liquid streaked on her pristine hand before she crouched, bending both her legs.

She slapped her hand on the ground with force.
''..Kuchiyose no Jutsu---!''

A black row of signs appeared in a perfect circle around her hand. A Seal, on the ground. Her chakra was being forced out of her body. This summoning took alot out of her. It felt nearly painful using so much at once. She bit on her lower lip to halt the cascading pain from making her flinch.

A large puff of smoke cleared out, revealing her summon.

A fat, content, lazy Anteater. It had a long nose, reaching all the way to the ground, big, purple eyes, fat cheeks and a long plushy tail. ''..Gruuuu~!'' It wobbled over to Valencia, hugging her. He was about as tall as her. Pretty small for a fighting summon. But large none the less.* - Tue Sep 29 06:36:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Widend her eyes in shock. This was a perilous state. She turned towards her Anteater. He was chubby and useless. She could summon nimble ones, smaller and more effective at gathering intel. She tried to summon something big to fight this monster. This proved like a bad idea. She took a moment to consider her options.

The fat Anteater turned to her, scratching the back of his head. ''..No.. No Puffun. This won't work. We need to fight together! Or else he'll mash our heads out!'' She stomped the ground and sighed. This was bad .Puffon was still a very young and unathletic Anteater. She required something better. Bigger. But her Chakra reserves couldn't match up to that.

She drew on a Kunai from her holster. Just like last time. This was going to end badly. Or at least she thought. She performed a few handseals. The Substition jutsu. This could prove a reliable way to get out of his hold, should she find herself in it once again. And just like that, she jolted towards him. She only had a third of her chakra left. Enough for a few meaningless jutsus. Not another summon.

Puffon wasn't combat ready, and thus she had to find a different use for him. But one thing about Puffon was that he was heavy. Very heavy. A Five feet Anteater who weighted at least 400 pounds. He lazed on the ground and yawned. * - Tue Sep 29 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Didn't activate her technique right away. She had to wait for the right moment. The exact moment in which she would gain the most from using it. It was a game of waiting. You wait too much, and you're done for. You don't wait enough, and you missed your chance. An inch too soon, an inch too late and it was over. Such was the art of battle. You had to read the defense and take what's being given to you.

You had to see the offense and know what you must do to prolong this fight. She came to this fight not stronger, but smarter. As he sent his kick at her ribs, she actually reacted this time around. No momentum to quell her movements, she leapt into the air. 

The fat Anteater got up.
And boy, it was fast. 
Not a good fighter. Not likely to land any damage, but it ran like hell was breaking loose. 

A few kicks landed regardless, hitting Valencia in her belly and side. His strength was immense, but somehow due to her movements, she managed to stay close to him, latching onto his form with her left hand, a nasty strike likely enough to leave her sore for weeks.

And then-- She activated it--

''..Kawarimi no Jutsu!'' She traded placed with the large Anteater.
The fat, heavy anteater now appeared directly above Maloth, likely toppling him to the ground with his massive weight, as strong as Maloth was, the surprise gave her a chance to get him regardless. And she traded locations with Puffon, who was sprinting towards Maloth from his back--

Now behind him, a grin appeared on her lips, she seemed worn from the attack, but her tactic had a good chance of working. Behind him, while he was occupied by a massive anteater falling on his head, she aimed to stab her kunai into the back of his calf.

Aiming for the Achilles tendon.* - Tue Sep 29 07:00:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Yelped, she clapped her hands immediatly. The Antear was unsummoned before he was slammed into the ground. The Kunai was now lodged in Maloth's achilles area, doing little damage, but still stuck there.

''..Shit. This is just..'' She let out a sigh and took a few steps backwards. 
The female collapsed, landing on her rear with a sigh.

''...I'm done.'' * - Tue Sep 29 07:09:13 2015

''..I'm okay. But they want privacy.''

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Valencia White(Rosevine) Blinked a few times.

And then back at Taiga.
