<br><br><font color=teal>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) says: You can come in. - Thu Sep 24 23:18:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) || His eyes run over Mamoru as well as Kuro, inspecting them lightly and patiently as they entered through the wide and spacious leeway that the gates now parted offered them. A quick nod is offered to Kuro, who had entered.

"I am happy to meet you, Kuro. My name is Yukio, the Head Monk and Priest of this establishment. I would be glad to offer you tutelage in such areas of critique." Yukio stated, as he beckons him into the large square tiled area in front of the temple grounds, meant for the monks to practice.* - Thu Sep 24 23:26:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) glances back and forth with inspective eyes. He observes the monks that were around, training with each other. Many were in states of meditation to rest and calm their minds. 

"In the temple, patience is a virtue. I hope that you will be able to exercise this patience in your tutelage, both in the fortes of philosophy and in the fortes of physique. This is primarily not a fighting institution. We may teach self-defense in order for our disciples to not be killed, but I will not teach you how to kill. Is that clear?" Yukio pronounced, as he continued to walk in front of Kuro. * - Thu Sep 24 23:33:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) | | "Life is indeed precious. However, you will come face to face with an ordeal where you will have to make a decision; either one will result in a life being taken." Yukio stated bluntly. "We work and endeavor to protect life. Sometimes though, to protect life, one must take a life. We teach ourselves methods to restrain people, to prevent them from hurting. Even those methods are limited though."

Yukio continues to walk. "Our self-defense derives from 'kempo.' Do you know what that is?" Yukio questioned.* - Thu Sep 24 23:43:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) // "What do I do after everything is done? And what do I do with the burden of knowing I have stained my hands? I wouldn't know. I've yet to stain my hands with the blood of another. But I know this. I cannot be ridden with guilt my whole life. I must repent for my sins with work, diligence, and kindness to others. Through generosity and goodwill, I will be able to repay my sin. However, it is a great sin as human life is immeasurable."

Yukio states quietly. He glances at Kuro. "You should meet Niza. He will teach you the basics to self-defense in terms of kempo. I will teach you meditation, the proper form, and what to think about during meditation."* - Fri Sep 25 00:30:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) // "Yes. Kempo is a type of martial arts. It uses your opponent's power instead of your own. Moves of the Kempo nature are used to restrain. They are used to redirect and channel the energy of your opponent against them. The movements are very simple and are associated with dances."* - Fri Sep 25 01:13:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) nods quietly. "Not necessarily though. While you do redirect the force, you do not redirect it straight back to them. For example, you may misdirect an attack and make it miss entirely because they rely too much on power. However, you cannot parry it and force the fist to come back to hit them. Do you understand what I mean?"* - Fri Sep 25 02:33:36 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) observes Kuro calmly and quietly. He doesn't stir an inch, and keeps on patiently observing Kuro for any movement.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) | | A repulse of energy floods from underneath Yukio's body, currenting outwards like a tidal wave from its epicenter. It was akin to a miniature earthquake of chakra that flooded out in ripples; similar to what would happen if a rock were thrown into a body of water. * - Mon Sep 28 05:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Robin, Yukio(ShinraTenin) slowly nods after analyzing Niza's moves. "Your movements are blossoming to that of imitating the technique. However, mere mimicry will not lead you to the technique's perfection. I ask you to imitate it for you to gain a brief understanding of the technique. You may assume it to be similar to Suimen no Hokou Waza, but that isn't it at all."

Yukio continues to explain. "Have you ever met someone who could manipulate their strength with chakra? They release that chakra with pinpoint accuracy; you are doing the exact same thing with this technique. This technique poses no immediate physical threat; rather, it poses a mental trauma and a demoralization to discourage ensuing fights." 

"You will understand with time. I'll not only give you a scroll for you to practice, but I will give you detailed instruction on a daily basis, Niza-kun."* - Mon Sep 28 05:18:43 2015
