<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) walked through the door of his home, his motivation to become much more powerful, still running full speed through his mind. Though he'd been let down by the majority of the village, he wouldn't let that ruin his determination. Focused solely on bettering himself, he decided he would continue to better his jutsu understanding. Since he'd learned several Taijutsu techniques, he figured he would use the wooden dummy in his home to his advantage. Setting the wooden torso up in the middle of his living quarters, the boy bowed and dropped into a stance similar to a wrestler. Both arms were by his sides and out as if he were awaiting an opportunity to grab an opponent.

For his newest workout, Sho planned on mastering the technique known as Dynamic Entry, figuring if he had an opening attack, he would be able to catch most opponents off guard. Quickly shifting his form, Sho took a few steps forward before leaping up and forward with much force behind him. In the midst of his jump, Sho extended his right leg, turned to his left, and tucked his left leg underneath the right. Now in a proper flying kick pose, Sho glided toward the dummy but quickly began losing momentum. It was like he'd started off perfectly but was not able to keep moving at the same speed for very long. Upon making contact with the dummy, a soft thud was all that could be heard, confirming Sho's suspicion of not moving fast enough. It seemed he would have to try again and figure out where he lost most of the energy.

The young shinobi moved himself back into position after his last failed attempt and waited to catch his breath. In between getting prepared and catching his breath, Sho contemplated just how he would perfect such a technique in such a short amount of time. Ready once more, the boy took a few steps back and dropped back into his ready stance. Taking several quick steps again, the boy launched himself from the floor after the third and repeated the extension and tucking of his legs. This time, Sho moved forward, holding his momentum for much longer than his first attempt. All was well until he came within six inches of the wooden dummy and slowed down to damn near a halt. Almost falling to the ground, Sho quickly caught himself and landed clumsily before backing off once more.

Sho decided he would get an even greater start, backing up several feet further than he'd been starting from earlier. Now standing with a bit more confidence, Sho dropped into his stance once more and set his feet quickly. Now able to take several more steps, Sho could build up quite a bit more speed than he had once before. Dashing from his new position, Sho got as much speed as he could from the distance and vaulted himself forward and extended his right leg while twisting to the left. His left leg was quickly tucked underneath his right and he was in motion once again. A small bit of wind kicked up and Sho felt like he had finally accomplished what he'd been looking for this whole time. At this speed, Sho would slam into the wooden dummy with a thud. He'd actually connected with decent force this time, but Sho knew deep down that he could definitely do better.

Now understanding that his starting distance and beginning momentum were key factors in perfecting the technique, Sho knew he was on the right track. Now more determined than he initially was, the boy quickly got himself to his spot and got ready. Once again, he took several light-footed steps and leapt from several feet away from the dummy and prepped for his kick once more. Twisting to his left, extending his right leg and tucking his left underneath once more, Sho aimed to kick right through the practice statue. With a loud thump, the boy impacted the dummy once more but it felt like he'd put much less effort into the kick than he had before, leaving him feeling underwhelmed once more. It was sad but he wouldn't let that one mishap take away from his training.

Sho figured it was time to take a break, so he headed to his fridge to retrieve a nice, cold water. He quickly seized the cap and guzzled the contents of the container in a matter of seconds. Wiping his mouth and releasing a slight gasp, Sho felt his energy reserves returning to him slowly. He then sat in his chair for a moment, thinking of several ways he could perfect his technique. After several minutes of coming to the same conclusion, Sho told himself that he'd need to start from much further back and move with much more power behind his attack. With that in mind, the boy rose from the chair and got himself ready to start over again.

Now a distance away from the wooden dummy once again, Sho took precaution to move several steps back even further. It seemed to be way too far but it had to be tried if Sho was going to become a master of the Dynamic Entry technique. Now having much more room, Sho took off running, the distance between him and his target closing fast. With just a couple feet left between him and the dummy, Sho kicked off the floor, twisted slightly to his left and extended his right leg for the kick. Once the right leg was out, Sho tucked his left just in time to hear a resounding CRACK and feel his foot slam into the dummy. Once he'd landed, Sho realized that he had cracked the dummy a bit, leaving the chest area split a bit. He knew he was getting closer to where he wanted to be in terms of technique progression. Of course, the overachiever in him would not allow this to be the end of the drill.

Sho returned to the position he'd last started in, preparing to perform his attack once more. He quickly dropped into his stance and gritted his teeth before preparing to take off once more. His mind was now set on destroying the dummy. Wasting no time, Sho dashed forth, his arms behind his back and his head lowered to remove wind resistance. Once Sho reached a decent enough speed, he leapt forth and got into formation for his kick once again. He was moving much faster than his last attempt this time, his body nearly blurring out of view. With a massive crashing sound and the feeling of debris dancing about, the boy knew he'd went completely through the dummy and destroyed it. LAnding with a loud thump, the boy nearly didn't catch his balance but was able to stop himself before getting hurt.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) quickly turns on his heels and rushes out of the office, feeling like he now had a chance to do something useful.* - Tue Nov 10 06:42:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had made his way from the outskirts of Suna and was well on his way to going to the Land of Fire for his quest. At first, Sho felt it was a bit far for him to be going just to get some wood but it was better than gate duty. As long as he got a job to do, nothing mattered to him att that moment.  He stopped momentarily just to make sure he had everything he would need to make it there and back. 

Fiddling around through his bag, Sho listed the items he had packed, as he searched quickly. He had his bottles of water, his bags of crisps and a small bit of pork wrapped in plastic. All was well in his bag, so Sho slung his backpack back over his arms. He was now ready to continue on with his journey to the LAnd of Fire.

The boy wasn't the biggest traveler but he knew his way around due to several incidents where he needed to be taught about other places. It was, of course, going to be much different to travel there than to just read a map or something. Whatever the case was, he wasn't going to back down from the challenge. With a sudden boost of confidence, the young shinobi was ready to get goin.* - Tue Nov 10 07:02:24 2015
