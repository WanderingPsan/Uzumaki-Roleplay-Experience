<br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) trudged through the sands of the deserts and barely had been feeling fatigued at that point. It was only a short walk from where he had been to get to the Land of Fire and he felt he could go on even further. Before he knew it, he could see the trees of the green lands just ahead of him, swaying softly in the breeze. Sho quickened his pace, knowing that he would be finished with his quest soon.

Once he had reached the forested area, the young shinobi quickly got to work, scouting out the best tree for him to cut down. Spotting a monster of a tree, the boy knew exactly where this would be going. He wasted zero time, running up and unleashing his bones from his arms just to slice into the tree with little effort. Spinning and slashing gracefully, Sho aimed to chop up the massive tree in no time. With several quick swings and slashes, the boy ended up on the other side of the tree with a grin.

It took just a second or so for the after effect of Sho's onslaught to actually take effect. The large tree slowly fell apart, splitting into several larger pieces that then fell into small sections. With quick reflexes, the young warrior zipped around and gathtered as many pieces of wood he could until he was nearly weighed down. Feeling accomplished, Sho turned back toward his home and headed for the village to complete his quest.* - Tue Nov 10 07:45:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) With a calm look about it he would pop his neck and with a positive look about it he would pull out his kunai he had just recently received. It had happened to be something he so pleasantly was able to equip himself with as he would pop his neck as he looked about and then with a thin line across his face he would then look around and with the kunai drawn he would begin the training of slahes necessary for his own ability as it was. With a culminating smile he happily swung the kunai about.

he would envision seeing clones lying about as he would then hold his blade level in a stance that was perfect for the kunai itself. Keeping the wit about his he would thoroughly peer around and productively hold his kunai about as he would charge forward. Directly at the clones he envisioned as he would continue on about his hands on the blade he was equipped himself with as he actively attacked all the things around his with a great equitable form.

Staring forward he would pull the kunai down and slash apart the thing that so effectively dodged his previous blows. his kunai itself incited the great ability of which he was proactively performing as his eyes would pull downward and the kunai swings only grew heavier with each and ever attack he pulled on the situation as he maneuvered the blade in its diagonal pattern. No way was he losing out on this at all as he continued his maneuverability of the situation.

With an explicit attack and a swing directly out from under all his foes he would only smile and he would swing about the attack and begin slicing the darn things in half as he continued the maneuvers and his abilities only grew. With calming and culminating smiles flashing he killed the clones with his kunai swinging and beheading them. With such ability he would only continue on the maneuver as he wouldn't end at all as his skill level proceeded to increase.* - Tue Nov 10 08:11:31 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right well you have the honors. - Thu Nov 12 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) smiled slightly, his body moving quickly into his ready stance, in which his arms were out by his sides and his legs were spread a bit more than shoulder length apart. It seemed as if Sho had left himself defenseless but looks can always be decieving. With a quick raise of both his arms and two tightly clenched fists, Sho would focus on his ability to manipulate his bones. The ivory beneath his skin would quickly harden beyond it's normal capabilities and begin to show signs of ripping through skin at various points. Bringing his arms down in a an almost fluid motion, Sho would unleash the off-white, pointed, fairly long bones beneath his skin. Two longer bones made themselves apparent at the wrists, which both extended at least a foot vertically, following along the backs of his hands. Two more bones protruded out horizontally from his back and just above his elbows, though they were much shorter than the others. Lastly, two more bones extended from Sho's sides, just below the hip, the smallest of the set he'd revealed.

The boy wasted no time upon finishing his technique, dashing forth and leaping with a grunt. As Sho reached his opponent, he extended his right leg, twisted to his left slightly and tucked his left leg just underneath the right. Anyone experienced enough in Taijutsu could see that this was a flying kick technique, more commonly known as Dynamic Entry. With his momentum behind him, Sho aimed to plant his foot directly in the chest of Hiroshi.* - Thu Nov 12 23:49:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had whiffed his attack, of course, he wasn't as surprised by it, seeing as he wasn't that well-trained in taijutsu. His mind raced, thoughts of fighting someone this fast gave Sho a boost of adrenaline he'd never felt before. Thinking as quickly as he could, the boy quickly spun on his heels sharply. Unsure of what type of attack he would be faced with, Sho continued to spin, his body quickly gaining momentum. He was trying something he'd never done before and his hope was that he'd develop a defense mechanism against most forms of attack. 

Now spinning in place, the boy was pelted by the one shot that was aimed right for him but it seemed to be deflected by the rapidly spinning shinobi. The attack still stung a bit but it wasn't anything to knock Sho out or anything like that. While still spinning, the boy would extend his left leg and crouch quickly, aiming to start with a sweep and then follow up with a roundhouse from the same leg in succesion. This would prove to be another taijutsu technique, the Leaf Whirlwind, and SHo was hoping to catch Hiroshi off guard with it.* - Fri Nov 13 00:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) was too confident in his strikes, unable to connect once again, now being lifted off the ground by Hiroshi. It was as if it didn't matter what he did, the boy would always be a step behind his opponent. Once Sho was grabbed, he would be flipped and subsequently slammed down rather roughly. Impacting the ground with a rather hard thump, Sho's exposed bones tore into the dirt and left him stuck momentarily. He wouldn't let a surprise attack be his undoing, so reacting quickly was his only thought as he lay there momentarily.

The young shinobi put the bottoms of his feet on the gorund and forced himself up just off of leg strength alone. Once he'd freed himself of the ground, Sho would leap forth and aim to throw a simple kick toward Hiroshi. If successful, the kick would back HIroshi off of him and give the young shinobi room to work his next attack in. * - Fri Nov 13 00:47:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had successfully created space between himself and his opponent, now seeing his chance to ready for a decent attack. With a quick decision, the boy formed a handseal and utilized a jutsu that most shinobi could perform. In a puff of smoke, Sho had doubled his presence, creating a clone to fight alongside him. The clone would rush forth, performing the dynamic entry attack and Sho would make a move for the right side of Hiroshi. The clone aimed to kick Hiroshi right in the face, while Sho prepared for an attack of his own.

(Strategem of Wind) Sho then made his move, his clone most likely being pushed aside or destroyed by the much more experienced shinobi. With this seeming like his chance to land a decent attack, the boy moved forward and slid toward Hiroshi with his right leg out, coming out into a full skid to take Hiroshi down. It wasn't the best of plans but it was definitely a great strategy for someone of Sho's caliber.* - Fri Nov 13 01:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had successfully taken Hiro's feet from beneath him, but hadn't exactly thought much further than that last attack. His instinct told him to throw another attack out but it wasn't like he was as fast as his opponent. Hopping back to his feet quickly, the boy did what he could to get back on the offensive. Before Sho could even prep himself for his next attack, he had been taken down by his own strategy. Being clipped wasn't the problem but it was what followed that proved to be the boy's undoing. With a swift fist jamming him in the gut, Shokutsu was rendered unable to continue with this fight. The bones that stood firmly outside the boy's body would retract themselves before he dropped to his knees, gasping for breath.* - Fri Nov 13 01:25:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) arrived at his home and decided on getting back to his training alone, since nobody else seemed to be available at the moment. He wasted no time when it came to getting himself dressed appropriately for the occasion, donning a practice suit he'd had since he began his shinobi career. The boy then formed a single handseal before a cloud of smoke appeared beside him and dissipated as fast as it came. Next to Sho now stood an exact clone of himself, prepared to be his dummy for this first excercise.

The clone would stand just about five feet away from Sho, giving him enough space to test out how far he could start an attack from. Backing up a bit more, Sho prepared himself to take a running start toward his doppelganger. Once primed, the boy took off, gaining much speed in just a few short steps before he would lift off and lauch forward. With the momentum from his run now behind him, Sho outstretched his right leg, twisted slightly to his left, and tucked his left leg underneath to complete the form for the Dynamic Entry technique.

The boy had started from at least six feer away from the clone and he still had a decent amount of momentum once he reached his target. With a thud and a small puff of smoke, the clone had been destroyed, leaving Sho to continue flying toward the wall behind his former target. Thinking quickly, the boy brought his legs out of the formation and quickly pressed his feet against the wall before flipping back off. It seemed he'd had the distance down but he would need more power if he wanted to do some serious damage while attacking from afar.

It was the fact that his clones couldn't take a beating like the more advanced versions that led Sho to believe that they probably wouldn't be an effective method of training. It seemed he would have to return to his good, old fashioned dummy. Sho walked to his closet and retrieved his relic of a training tool, dragging out to the middle of his floor and setting it up. With his original gear now set back up, the boy dropped into his training stance to begin the next excercise.

Sho waltzed back to the spot he'd been starting from, leaving the dummy exactly where his clone once stood. Getting a running start once again proved to be an easy task, the boy almost reaching top speed in about six steps. Once he was positioned at least five feet from the dummy, Sho jumped forward and performed the Dynamic Entry technique once more. With a resounding CRACK, the young warrior had struck the dummy and managed to put a crack in the torso, just below the statues left pec.
* - Sat Nov 14 01:36:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had nearly been satisfied by his last attempt at performing a perfect Dynamic Entry, Sho was about ready to call it quits. If it wasn't for the fact that he replayed his last spar over and over in his mind, the boy would have quit training much sooner. After walking a few feet away from the dummy after his last attack, Sho turned on his heels, shifted his facial expression to one of anger and quickly pushed off his back leg to leap forward. Much closer than before, he would perform the Dynamic Entry technique with little space between himself and the dummy.

The hit was a success but it wasn't exactly what was expected. It seemed that the short space wouldn't allow for Sho to deliver the maximum damage he could with the attack. It was worth a shot but it was just not enough. The boy retreated to his original starting position, this time preparing to launch himself from a little further back but closer than his initial attempts. With another running start and a forceful push off of his back foot, the young shinobi launched forth and shifted his body into formation to perform the technique once more. Alas, he was left with another loud thump and another failed attempt at damaging the dummy, but more understanding of what he was doing wrong.

Mastering this maneuver was starting to become more of a hassle than anything and Sho wasn't feeling like he would ever move forward. His morale nearly dropped when he remembered one thing, his ability to harden his bones beyond what they already were. It was quite the stretch, but the boy would try anything to be able to attack with force. He went through the process of hardening his bones using his chakra and prepared for the final attempt of the night. At first, everything felt the same but as Sho flew through the air once again, he felt like a boulder hurdling toward a small animal. He felt like he would crash into the dummy and destroy it indefinitely. On impact with the wooden doll, Sho heard a loud, crashing sound, followed by the feeling of several splintered fragments hitting against his face. It was as if the dummy had suddenly been switched out with one made of a weaker material and Sho had made it his bitch. In any case, the dummy was now shattered and no longer useable for training purposes. If he were to elevate his skills to the next level, he would need to find something else to train on.* - Sat Nov 14 03:44:25 2015
