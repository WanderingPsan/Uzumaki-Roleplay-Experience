<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) grasps the sheet of paper, his index finger and thumb clasping together firmly.

It wasn't obvious yet, but Sho wasn't the type of fighter to use the elements to his advantage.* - Tue Nov  3 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had focused his chakra through the small sheet of paper he'd been given earlier, his hand shaking a bit from gripping tighter than he should have. It seemed like forever had passed before the paper seperated into two equal halves, indicating an affinity for the wind element.* - Tue Nov  3 03:38:52 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) holds his arms out by his sides, his baggy clothing making swishing sounds as he stretched both his arms. They boy's face quickly shifted from indifference to an expression more resembling concentration. He drew in a deep breath and closed his eyes momentarily, counting backwards from five in his head. "Five...four...three...two...." he slowly counted before his eyes shot open. "One!" he exclaimed to himself before clenching both his fists tightly. At that exact moment, several bones bursted forth from his arms, each of them ending in an abrupt point that looked as if they would hurt coming out. 

Sho looked over to see what type of reaction he'd get from everyone else, remaining just where he stood, now resembling a human porcupine.* - Tue Nov  3 03:51:40 2015

It all happened rather quickly, at least for someone of Sho's caliber. He'd barely ever seen two people of such strength before, let alone going at it just mere meters away from him. He'd stand firmly, taking in as much as he could while watching the two much more experienced shinobi duke it out. Sho's expression remained neutral, but in his head, thoughts of one day being able to contend with the likes of the upper ranks, danced around his brain. It would most likely take years of training but he now found the motivation necessary to get him to where he wanted to be.* - Tue Nov  3 04:34:20 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) ||The wooden front door of the sandy home flung open, turning inward on it's hinges, allowing Sho to step foot in his place after quite a while. It had been quite the adventure, watching a sparring match between two of the strongest in the village and being given a brief lesson by one. It was all he needed to keep his mind on his goal, and that was ultimately to find the man who'd murdered Gamen, Sho's only true friend. Once he located the culprit, Sho had plans to make him suffer as he had throughout the years. Of course, the boy could only achieve such a feat by learning to actually hold his on on the battlefield. 

With the scrolls he'd been given by Marrisa in tow, the boy approached the middle of his living quarters and took a seat on the floor. Dropping the other floor just to his right, Sho grasped and unraveled the first of the five he would have to study in order to become a better shinobi. With a deep breath, he continued forward with this next step in the process.

As he unrolled the scroll, Sho could make out the words just across the top portion, which read: "Dynamic Entry". The name sounded a bit off but it must have had some use if someone such as Marrisa utilized it. With the scroll now fully exposed, the young shinobi would read over the words carefully. The scroll explained, in detail, the exact movements one would need in order to perform the technique. It didn't seem like more than a flying kick but there had to be something else to it.

It felt like it had been hours, and Sho had only gotten down the technique partially before hitting the scroll once again to recap. He'd read it so many times andn one of it seemed to come together the way it was depicted. It was as if he had missed something throughout the scrolls text. Giving it a goodo nce over, Sho got up and practiced performing the technique, determined to figure that shit out.* - Tue Nov  3 22:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had finished working himself to near exhaustion and knew he needed to get a snack and a drink before continuing. It took him at least two hours two get the dynamic entry jutsu down but he didn't give up and that gave him the edge he needed to succeed. Heading over to his storage, the boy reached for a bag of chips after opening the cupboard and opened the fridge to retrieve a bottle of ice cold water. Quickly consuming both the snack and beverage, Sho discarded the waste and returned to his pile of scrolls. "One down, four more to go!" he thought to himself.

Plopping back down on the floor, Sho began unrolling the next scroll closest to him. The title of this next one read: Shunshin no jutsu or Body Flicker Technique. This one seemed to be a bit more tricky than the last one he'd lerned, so Sho braced himself for another long session. At first, it seemed relatively easy to perform but that was quickly disproven as Sho read further on. If Sho could get down the technique, he would easily be a force to reckon with. Continuing on, he read to the end of the page before geting up to make his attempts at performing the technique.* - Tue Nov  3 22:14:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had once again impressed himself, nearly taking half as long to move to the next technique. It seemed as if things were going to go smoothly after all. Sho wasted no time, grabbing the next scroll in line and having at it like hs life depended on it. It wasn't every day that he got this much done in the ways of training but he wouldn't let anything slow his progress down at this point.

Unrolling the next scroll, Sho read the title and it said: Misdirect. It might have been just as easy as it sounded, but then again it could be one of those tricky deals. Reading on, Sho knew exactly what type of technique he was dealing with, his facial expression changing to a smile. With something like thisi n his arsenal, the boy would surely be able to confuse his foes before delivering a crushing blow. The possibilities of even using this technique in conjunction with the shunshin technique were starting to dawn on him as well. It wasn't long before Sho had read through the entirety of the scroll and was preparing to practice utilizing the jutsu. Things were definitely on the right track.* - Tue Nov  3 22:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) stood firmly in them idst of his living quarter, sweat dripping from his brow and a look of undescribable joy on his face.He was really doing it, his dream was coming to fruition, well, at least part of it was. It was as if someone or sometthing had been guiding him on the quickest path to success and he wasn't going to pull back for anyone. Heading back to his pile of scrolls, the boy prepared to take on yet another jutsu. Grasping the closest one to him, Sho began to unravel the technique's scroll.

Upon opening the next scroll, Shoku was greeted by the words "Throat Strike"in bold lettering. This one sounded simple enough, and Shoku was okay with that. There wasn't a whole lot to read when it came to this technique but it got in depth about the correct form and position of the blow. This one could prove to be useful if a fight needed to be ended, seeing as hitting someone in the throat with enough force is almost always fatal. He quickly read over the steps a few times before hopping back up and getting ready to begin practicing this new technique.* - Tue Nov  3 22:30:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) looked over at the last scroll, his body not wanting to stop the roll it was on. There was only one more left and this would be it for his beginning arsenal. Shoku walked over to the last scroll and grasped it firmly in his right hand. His mind danced with thoughts of actually becoming much more powerful than he currently was and visions of everyone loking up to him. It wasn't too far, at least in Sho's mind it wasn't. The boy snapped out of his daydream and got back to unrolling the last of his scrolls.

The title on this last one read: Leaf Whirlwind. It seemed to be some sort of floating spin kick guided by wind and sheer willpower. This multi-hitting attack was sure to be a weapon worth using in nearly any fight. Sho read on as the steps to this technique were a bit more complicated than most of the others he'd read. The spinning part seemed a bit difficult, but Sho would most definitely put his all into being able to perform this one. It took him about twenty minutes to read through the entirety of the scroll just once. After reading ito nly once, the boy decided he'd better get to practicing the jutsu right away.* - Tue Nov  3 22:38:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had finally completed the task he'd set for himself, learning all of the jutsu from the scrolls he'd been given by Marrisa. He was truly on his way to becoming a well-trained shinobi and he felt stronger already. He figured giving one of hisj utsu some focus now would give him an advantage when it came time to use it in an actual battle. He would slowly but surely start to work on his usage of the Shunshin technique, convinced that it would take his fighting style to the next level. Concentrating on utilizing his chakra to move at high speeds, the boy would seem to flash from one side of his room to the other.

It was instant but it was clearly taxing on such a rookie to the technique. Shoku wasn't sure that he would be able to even use this one in a fight just yet. Taking some time to recover from the sheer exhaustion of the one use, he waited befoe going at it again. This time, Shoku focused on moving just a little further than he had the first time, testing the limits of his own ability to move long distances. It took a bit longer but he eventually made his way across the room in one swift motion. This time, the drain had hit him a bit harder than it had before. This was definitely going to be al ong session.

Shoku figured he might as well go ahead and try once more but his body wasn't having it just yet. He took several deep breaths and sat down briefly before getting to his last attempt. Now Shoku was reallly going for the gold on this one, at leasr, that's how it looked to a rookie. He was going to try and make it from the front door, through his living room and into the next room, all in one move. The idea of even moving that far at such a high speed gave Shoku the chills but he would definiitely tackle the obstacle with a bit of effort.

Standing at the front door, Shoku focused on moving himself from there to the back wall of his bed room. The backfire from such a usage would be bigger than the last two attempts but he was determined to make it happen. Closing his eyes momentarily, the boy envisioned himself jettisoning forth, through the living area and into the doorway that lead to his bedroom. It felt like it took forever before anything was actually felt but Shoku was quickly pushed from his front door to his bedroom but not without reprocussion. Shoku slammed into the wal, his body exhausted from such a large jump and the impact because he couldn't control himself. He hit the floor with a thud and sat there trying to regain his breath.* - Tue Nov  3 23:16:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) strolls over to the group of people, notcing that Marrisa was amongst them. * - Tue Nov  3 23:51:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had been spectating quietly from a bit of a distance away. The fight was quite intense and Sho was loving every minute of it. On top of the fact that two powerful shinobi were going at it, they were two close-quarters fighters as well. Shoku felt like he could learn a lot just from watching these two powerhouses duke it out. Things were going back and forth for a while, until the older shinobi's gauntlets began to act strange, as if they had no juice left in them. It was starting to look like the battle was in Koji's favor and Sho couldn't help but cheer on the inside for someone from his home. "Kick his ass!" he thought to himself, still watching intently.* - Wed Nov  4 01:49:13 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) watched as the two titans clashed with their strongest techniques backing them. IT was a light show if Shoku had ever seen one and he stared in awe at the magnificence of it all. Just after the two had collided, a loud crash could be heard and Koji's defense seemed to falter beneath the force of the larger man's punch. With a sudden push, Koji was sent whizzing passed Shoku, smashing right into the wall next to him. Shoku followed the flying shinobi with his eyes but didn't rush over to his side immediately. It looked as if that was it for this fight but someone else would surely step up to the plate.* - Wed Nov  4 02:28:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) stretched big, his arms extended above his head, and his mouth wide open. Another restful nap and another long day had passed without much of an issue. With nothing specific on his plate, Sho figured he would get back to his training. Most techniques could easily be mastered, but the shunshin technique was one that would prove to be difficult. It wasn't that it was a complicated technique, but the fact that it was pretty taxing on the body that made it a task. Getting prepared with a few simple stretches and breathing excercises, Sho prepped his body for an intense workout.

First up, Sho was going to improve the distance he could travel before his body grew fatigued. Of course, such a task would require one to move small distances and gradually increase the distance as he progressed. The young warrior stood just outside of his bedroom, focused on gathering his chakra into his legs. With a slow but steady pace, the boy eventually converted a little more than enough chakra to be able to perform the technique.

Sho stood firmly, his mind undecided on just where he would go at first but he quickly changed up, realizing he had left his bottle of water several feet away on the table. Setting his destination for the vacant spot just between two of the chairs, Sho imagined himself blurring out of view and reappearing at his chosen destination. IT happened much faster than before, his body quickly jumping from one location to the other but his accuracy was way off. It seemed he had botched his first attempt of many.

With a loud crash, Sho had ran smack into one of his chairs and ended up flipping forward over the back of it. His face hit the seat with a slap and Sho gut was now being jammed by the chair backing. That wasn't quite what he'd aimed for but he wouldn't let a small mistake like that deter him from getting the results he wanted. He picked himself up, endured what little pain he'd felt after the impact and reached for his water before he backed up a bit. It was not time for attempt number two.

Now back in the spot he'd initially been in, Sho prepped himself once more, focusing on the chakra points in his legs again. Setting his sights on the other side of his living room, he aimed to cross a distance that he'd crossed multiple times prior. In a quick flash, the boy had moved from the table and ended up right next to his kitchen area, the fridge barely a couple inches away from him. It seemed he avoided impact this time around but he'd have to still work on controlling the technique a bit better.

It was now time for Sho to try moving from one room to the other, something he'd had issues with the last time. Having the prior experience, he was a little fearful of ending up face first against the wall, or falling victim to an item capable of tripping him up. Sho tried his best to push those thoughts to the back of his mind and man up about it. He'd never been one to back down, especially from a little pain. With a deep breath and an expression of determination, the young shinobi stepped toward the doorway to his bedroom. 

Utilizing his chakra for this technique was starting to become a bit easier on Sho, so he quickly prepared for his next jump. Setting his sights on the much smaller bathroom, which was way across the house, Sho told himself he was going to make it. With a sudden burst of speed, the boy became invisible to the naked eye and made way toward his restroom. Suddenly, Sho felt his feet become a little damp and quickly realized where he had ended up. Looking down confirmed his suspicion that he had ended up in his tub. 

Though there was no crash this time, the boy had actually went too far, realizing that he still had al ong way to go when it came to controlling the shunshin technique. Figuring this was enough for the day, the boy stepped out of his bath tub and made his way toward the living room to rest. He told himself that he would start back up again in the morning, saving what little energy he had left for actually being functional if something were to arise suddenly.* - Fri Nov  6 00:52:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) woke abruptly, feeling as if he'd had an epiphany in the form of a very vivid dream that had occured. He leapt out of bed in a hurry and rushed to the front door of his home. He was never one to act in such a way, but he was sure that he had figured it all out. It was as if he was possessed by the will to master a technique and couldn't be stopped. Slowly and deliberately, the boy began concentraing on utilizing his chakra in his legs.

Eyes closed, focused on the prize, Sho imagined himself moving from the door where he had stood. It was sudden and precise, Sho had finally figured out what he'd been doing wrong the whole time. Instead of focusing on just a general area, he focused precisely on a single spot in said area. As he vanished from sight and jetted toward his destination, he knew this was it. He opened his eyes to reveal that he had arrived at exactly the point he'd envisioned, just next to his bed and right by the pillow and nightstand. It was the first of many times that he would do it and a sense of accomplishment washed over his entire being.* - Fri Nov  6 02:06:17 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) waltzed up to the training area, his mind still on his training and how he would have to increase the frequency in order to keep up with the village. Upon stepping through the entryway, Sho spotted Trilliam and Tetsumi partaking in what appeared to be a spar. He had been done with his own training, so he figured he would sit by and watch the two go at it. Finding a place against the wall, Shoku would slide down and seat himself on the sandy, desert floor with a thump. As he sat down, Sho noticed that Trilliam was prepping for an attack of some sort.

As the handseals were weaved, Sho knew this was gonna be a doozie of an attack. Sure enough, lightning began to dance about Trilliams's hands before racing to his fingers which were pointed at Tetsumi. Before long, an orb of lightning was quickly formed at the tips of Trilliam's fingers. Sho's eyes widened, never seeing such a technique before. As fast as it was formed, Trilliam fired off the orb, letting it whiz from his fingers aimed directly toward Tetsumi with nearly blinding speed.

"Holy shit!" Shoku exclaimed to himself. "These guys are real!" he continued.* - Fri Nov  6 02:19:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had finally gotten his act together, at least when it came to the shunshin technique and how to control it effortlessly. The only issue he still suffered from was not being able to convert his chakra perfectly when utilizing the jutsu. It wasn't as difficult as it seemed but he had to halt his training the last time, his body being worn out after a short period. Now Sho was ready to get back to perfecting his craft and become a master of the shunshin jutsu. Taking a deep breath, the boy headed toward his bed room to begin what he hoped would be his ultimate training session.

Once standing exactly where he wanted to be, Sho wasted no time and began to convert his chakra and focus on using it in his legs. He envisioned himself taking off from the side of his bed, jetting forth and ending up at his front door. It happened so quickly, and Sho smiled to himself as he shot from one room to the other with no issue. Of course, he still took a step or two after, his momentum carrying him but not too far. It wasn't entirely perfect but it was much better than his last attempts to utilize the technique. It seemed like he would have to try again.

The young shinobi planted his feet, standing next to the door with an expression of determination plastered on his face. He looked off into the bed room, noting the distance and the obstacles he'd have to move around. Sho then converted his chakra and focused on using the points in his legs to propel himself forward. Once again, in the blink of an eye, Sho was moved from his spot by the door and ended up right next to his bed, standing by the nightstand. It seemed this time he had done much better.* - Fri Nov  6 21:46:27 2015
