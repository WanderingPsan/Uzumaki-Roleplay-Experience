<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 01:31:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had been standing just a little ways away and caught sight of the body just as Akira had walked over to examine it. He'd been on his way to continue his training but something told him that would have to wait now. Nodding his head in agreement with Akira, the boy's facial expression shifted to one of a more serious nature. "I'm Shokutsu. And of course I'll stay here and await your return. After all, this is one of our comrades!" he replied with confidence.* - Sun Nov 15 01:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, the body was already moved from the scene. - Sun Nov 15 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: This isn't the scene of the crime. The scene is just eastwards of hear near the gates. - Sun Nov 15 01:48:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Because the person who found him told us, and we brought him here. - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why? - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: No idea, but the guards say that he was with a female. - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: So, we are looking around for the last female Kyushiki was with. - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Why haven't you told the Kazekage or a Jounin yet? - Sun Nov 15 01:49:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Because we just discovered his death? - Sun Nov 15 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well i'm going to go find and tell one now. - Sun Nov 15 01:50:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Let them know of the female too. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right right. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If possible, I wish to bring the body back with me to Kumogakure to bury with the others. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Mhm. - Sun Nov 15 01:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: . . . - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So apparently no one cares he died. - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Like literally no one. - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: So I have no idea who else to turn to for help here. - Sun Nov 15 02:00:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: They don't suspect a thing.....I could skip town and they wouldn't a single thing... - Sun Nov 15 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: omit-------^ - Sun Nov 15 02:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 02:03:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) was quite confused, his gut not giving off the greatest of feelings in regards to what was happening. How could no one care that a member of the village had been slain in cold blood? At any rate, Shokutsu wasn't going to just sit around without being on his toes. If people were dropping and no one was even so much as blinking about it, the three young shinobi would have to be much more alert than they currently were. 

"This....this doesn't seem right at all, Akira." he stated, uncertainty littered throughout his voice.* - Sun Nov 15 02:06:43 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I know it doesn't Shokutsu. - Sun Nov 15 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Apparently this happens all the time here so people are numb to it. - Sun Nov 15 02:07:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: That's no reason to just be all non-chalant about it. - Sun Nov 15 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Or maybe he was just hated by everyone. - Sun Nov 15 02:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: If so, why not just exile him? Put him to trial? HAve a vote on it? - Sun Nov 15 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: Anything but just murder. - Sun Nov 15 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: Maybe he just pushed someone too far? - Sun Nov 15 02:10:59 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: Is someone that thin-skinned that they would murder someone out of anger? - Sun Nov 15 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Perhaps it's because he's not of this village.  The people of this village are rather close knitted with their own. - Sun Nov 15 02:12:41 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: ... - Sun Nov 15 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Well that makes me feel better...not. - Sun Nov 15 02:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: If no one is going to find the person responsible, then I'll do it myself. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: As true as that may be, we are still allied with them. They wouldn't take kindly to us killing off their people. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: I guess I'm going with you. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: After this is all done, I'm going to cremate him and spread his ashes over Sunagakure. - Sun Nov 15 02:14:24 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I'm not going. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: This isn't my business, I just stumbled upon it, sorry. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I've had enough of death for a while. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) thinks: He doesn't want to help...he must be the killer. - Sun Nov 15 02:15:15 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: So, you got involved with this, only to turn around and back out at the last second? - Sun Nov 15 02:16:06 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Yes. - Sun Nov 15 02:16:57 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: What do you want from me? You two have it covered. - Sun Nov 15 02:16:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Akira, And it's not suspicious. - Sun Nov 15 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: The body was moved here. - Sun Nov 15 02:17:48 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You're going to blame me for this? - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: He's not the suspect. It's a woman with purple hair.  - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Aoi(ByeFelicia) says: When was I placing blame? - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Even though people found this before me and didn't report it? - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: I was the one that -went- to report it. - Sun Nov 15 02:20:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: No one cared, so why should I? - Sun Nov 15 02:21:13 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: You didn't report his death to anyone. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Akira(Ultimate_Odyssey) says: Right i'm just going to leave. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: I wasn't the one to find him. Rather it was the man with the chakram who found him, and brough us to the crime scene. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) says: This is going nowhere fast. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:04 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well I'm still going to look for the woman with purple hair. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Hopefully, she's still in the village. - Sun Nov 15 02:22:56 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) ceased movement, stopping just a few steps to Kuro's left. His facial expression showing that things weren't looking too good around the village. He stood silently, not bothering to jump into the conversation, Kuro was probably better at that type of thing.* - Sun Nov 15 02:27:12 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Huey(LolrZ) says: No. She was wearing red. Did she have something to do with his death? - Sun Nov 15 02:31:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, we are looking for a purple haired female.  The one you described is most likely Mitsunara, who isn't the suspect as she was with us when the body was found. - Sun Nov 15 02:32:19 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: And she has an alibi. - Sun Nov 15 02:32:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Shokutsu(King Scrub) had fell asleep just after his last training session and was just waking up after a nap that ended up lasting several hours. One would thinbk that Shoku had disappeared off the face of the planet, but those who knew the boy, understood that he just had an itch that would never be scratched. If he could help it, he would train while out doing other things in the village but that wouldn't work out very well. Wasting no time right from his bed, the young taijutsu user leapt up and headed to his makeshift training area, conveniently located in the middle of his living room. He was going to get an early start at his training and go until he could no longer stand.

First, he was going to stretch his body until he was limber enough to perform the advanced maneuvers involved in performing his techniques. After a short stretching session, he was now prepared to start the larger portion of his workout. IT wasn't as intense as he usually done it, but he would practice his Dynamic Entry technique multiple times over the next hour or so. If no one else was going to help him achieve greatness, he would do it himself. With each kick thrown, Shoku could feel himself being able to control the technique with much more finesse than each prior usage.* - Fri Nov 20 02:16:32 2015
