<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *walks away* - Wed Nov 25 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) knew from what Trill said that Lera was probably a very strong shinobi.  Plus he had always seen her with that big ass sword on her back.  He tried to come up with the best plaan of action before he just ran blindly into his defeat.

"Ok. . . She has a bi as sword. . . I seem to fight a lot of people with some kind of weapon.  With that she will have a reach advantage over me.  Plus I don't know how fast she is.  I mean I think I am fast but if she is faster plus has a reach advantage. .  .O god. . . I really will have to use my head this time. . This is going to be fun."

Hiroshi darted off at Lera full speed.  He was a lot faster then the avarage genin.  In fact he wasn't aware of to many people faster then him in a straight line anyway.  Once he got into stroking distance, asuming that she didn't move, he would start to throw a right high kick aimed at her left cheek.  This was more of a feint then anything else, but if that bitch hit it still hurt.  While she was focused on te hihg kick, hopefully, he would quickyl spin and attempt to take her legs out from under her with a sweeping left kick.  He would finish off this little combo with a final spin and depending on if he was able to sweep her or not two different thins would happen.  If he had swept her feet he would drive his knee directly into her back attempting to at least cause some sort of damage, but nothing too serious.  If he was not able to sweep her he simply spun and threw a sraight push kick aimed at her gut to push her back a few feet.  

"Go big or go home HIro."  He thinks to himself* - Wed Nov 25 17:41:58 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: He's too fast close range...he'll hit me sooner rather than later... - Wed Nov 25 17:51:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was right in his assumption that she knew how to use that bg ass sword on her back, but he was not exactly prepared for her to pull it out so fast.  With his impressive sight he saw her pullit out and where she was trying to protect herself.  He would stop the kick before it connected with the sword, he had had bad luck when it came to swords.  All in one swift, fluid motion he would use his left foot to hop quickly to her right side, hopefully somewhere that Samehada was not present, and throw yet another solid kick.  This one aimed at her right shoulder.  If Samehada was in that hand he was hoping to give her a slight stinger and make it harder for her to even use it.  If Samehada wasn't in that hand. . . . He was hoping to give her a slight stinger and make it harder for her to heven move that arm.* - Wed Nov 25 17:52:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked up in awe as she floated over him.  He could not get too distracted, but that shit was awsome.  He got all sparkly eyed as he watched.

"Wooooooooooooww  How did you do that?  Holy crap your flying.. . Like. . .How do I compete?  Oh?  I have an idea."

He would turn in her direction and perform three quick hand seals.  Dog! Rabbit! Snake!  Then clap his hands.  He wasn't the best at Ninjutsu but he at least knew how to use it.  Upon his hands clapping a powerful gust of wind would blow from behind him, towards Lera, hopefully.  He was just trying to mess her flying up a bit if he could.* - Wed Nov 25 18:01:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Man. . She is flying. . . That is awsome. . .  - Wed Nov 25 18:02:27 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) thinks: Could probably disable him with a touch... - Wed Nov 25 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) knew that his ninjutsu wasn't the best, but she just highi=lighted the fact with her own version of the same jutsu.  The wind was way to strong for him to just blow off like it was nothing.  He tried to keep his feet, but eventually he fell to his back and started to roll.  Unable to stop himself from rolling he rolled until he smacked the wall behind him.  He coughed up a tiny amount of blood as he hit the wall and sat there for a slight second trying to stop the world from spinning.  Slowly, he attempted to struggle to his feet.

". . . That wind was so much stronger."  He thought to himself.* - Wed Nov 25 18:08:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had finally made it to his feet, only to start slipping again.  

"Gaaaahhhh mud.  . . THis sucks. . . O god"  He would fall face first in the mud and continue to get himself together.  He rolled off to the side after flopping around a bit and sat on his knee with a smile on his face.  He liked fighting strong people and he just added Lera to the list of people he had to find a way to beat one day.

"You are strong Lera-san."* - Wed Nov 25 18:13:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Lera(DyslexicFairyDinosaur) says: ...Hm. Nah. - Wed Nov 25 18:13:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Alright. - Wed Nov 25 18:43:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nodded his head as Trill gave the instructions.  He still found it kinda odd that he was once again out of jail, but he was always happy to see his boy.  He grabbed his 5 figurines that Trill handed him and quickly put his hands together into a single seal and dipped into the ground.  He placed the first one right at the entrance of the gate for any unsuspecting intruder that decided it wa a good idea to waltz through the front door.  "Heheheh I wonder what dumbass this will get?"

He then came back to the area Trill was at and started to set one right where he had entered the earth.  This was goign to be a mine field so making sure that they were spaced properly.  If not, this entire thing would be pointless and the village might suffer for it.   Hiro could not allow that to happen and the people he had come to know and love get hurt.  So he was taking this mission extremely seriously.

The next figure would be placed about 50 yards away from the one previously set and to the north.  This was close to where that edge dude came with his army so Hiroshi was sure that if he put it there it would be very vital.  He didn't want to be there when they all went boom though.  He couldn't deal with all of those bodies again.

Only two more left to set.  He went straight to his right and then down a bit.  The three set now basically made a triangle.  He chuckled a bit as he set this one.  "Heheh I feel bad for anybody that walks into this triangle. . I gotta name it something awsome. . . Hmmm. . . I got it.  The Hiro and Trill express.  This is a one way ticket to hell. . . Haaaaa yesss that is it."  He set it down with a bright smile and went on to set the final one.

The final figure would be set on the other side of Trill.  He went about 200 paces from where Trill was and set the last one.  This one was a loner, maybe Lera would put some over here with him, maybe not.  Either way he belived in the final figure.  He resurfaced over beside Trill and assumed an army like stance soluting to Trill.  "All done Sgt. Trill Sir."* - Wed Nov 25 18:51:56 2015
