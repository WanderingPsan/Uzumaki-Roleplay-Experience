<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right. - Fri Oct 23 03:17:58 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would quickly get into his basic Taijutsu stance.  He would slighlty stagger his feet.  HIs left foot being slightly in front of his right.  He clinched his fists and did the exact same thing, only with his hands.  His knees were slightly bent at the knee and he was on the balls of his feet.  He would then start to perform the series of kicks.  He woul dstart with a basic high kick, that was more of a feint then anything else.  All in one, not so fluid motion, he would spin and throw a sweeping kick towards his imaginary opponent.  He would continue to spin and throw a final push kick.  HE would end up in his fighting stance and look at Sanoke, waiting for his say.* - Fri Oct 23 03:20:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) 's head would go back slightly from the flick.  His lightly tanned skin would instantly turn red as he grabbed his forhead.  "Ow!"  He would say, but quickly he refocused as Sanoke was still explaining what he needed to do.  He would slowly nod his head as Sanoke talked and demonstrated.  He was spinning so fast that Hiroshi was getting dizzy watching him.  

"Ok. . . So I have to loosen up and make sure I can still support my weight.  That sounds easy enough, but I'm sure that it is one of those things that is easier said then done.  One way to find out."  He would then attempt to do as he was told.  He got into his fighting stance once again, but instead of trying to spin right off of the bat, he took a deep breath to try and loosen up.  When he felt like he was in the right state of mind he would try and perform the kicks once more.  He started with the high kick and fluidly went into the low kick, at least that was what he thought.  As he spun into the low kick he lost his balance and fell face first onto the ground.    "Shit. . . "* - Fri Oct 23 03:35:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was a bit disappointed in himself.  Sanoke was right, he was a shinobi.  Falling to the ground like that was unaceptable.  He rose to his feet with an angry expression on his face.  He had listened to everything Sanoke had said and tried to apply it.  Somehow he still failed epically, this sickened Hiroshi.  He got into his fighting stance again and the tried to spin as Sanoke had instructed.  It wasn't as fast as Sanoke's, but it was an avarage speed for somebody trying to learn.  He would continue to spin for the time being, jsut trying to ge tthe hang of it.* - Fri Oct 23 03:57:13 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Faster. Faster. FASTER. - Fri Oct 23 03:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) finally started to pick up speed and was actually feeling pretty good about this.  He felt like he could spin like this for a while and not have to worry about falling or losing his balance.  

"Ok.  I think I got this spinning thing down.  I think I understand what Sanoke was saying now.  Time to put it to the test."  He would think to himself.  Then, while continuing to spin he woud throw a high kick.  He kept on spinning and all in one fluid movement he would perform a sweeping low kick.  With one final spin he would throw one last powerful straight kick aimed out directly in front of himself.  He would hold that position, his forehead shining from sweat and breathing slightly heavier then normal.* - Fri Oct 23 04:04:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would put his leg down and nod his head.  

"Yea, thanks.  That actually felt a lot better then when I used to use it.  And great!  Can't wait to get that shell and start my training."  

He would walk over and extend his fist for a simple bump of gratitude.* - Fri Oct 23 04:11:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) simply walks away.* - Fri Oct 23 16:32:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked up to his favorite spot.  He was about to do the training of a life time.  He was not moving from this spot until he felt like he was at least adequate with it.  He focused his chakra and rapidly executed the bird seal.  He would send out a barrage of air bullets at the wall and continue.

HIroshi was going to try and exhaust all of his chakra using this technique befor he decided that he was going to take a break.  So try to exhaust his chakra was what he did.  He gathered his wind natured chakra into a singuluar spot in his body, took a deep breath, and locked in the bird seal.  He then unleased a flurry of air bullets at the wall once again.  They still weren't strong enough to do much damage, so this was still a good spot to train.

The young shinobi started to sweat, only slightly, only slightly, on his forehead.  He was also breathing a little heavy from the repeated use of this jutsu.  He still had plenty of chakra though.  He was lucky enough to be born with a vast amount of it.  So he continued to practice.  He licked in the bird seal and when on with his bullets at the wall.  He loved this move.

Still standing in the same spot, he looked at his progress.  It was slowly getting better, but it wasn't where he wanted just yet.  Mari-sensei's was so much better.  Which it might always be better, but that was ok.  If he could get close to hers he would be in business.  So he unleashed nother set of bullets and then bent over with his hands on his knees.

Hiroshi's face was now dripping with sweat.  A slight puddle forming on the ground directly under his nose and chin.  He was breathing heavily now and knew he was running low on chakra.  This was not going to stop him from doing this jutsu one more time though.  So forced himself to stand back up and wiped the sweat from his forehead.  He had done this thing a lot now so everything leading up to it was becoming easier.  So he rapidly went through this and sent out another barrage of bullets. 

After unleashing this barrage of bullets he fell straight to the ground onto his back.  He layed there, arms stretched out wide, exhausted.  He knew he couldn't physically do this again, so he went to that little place in his head where he ran over the basics.

He went over the basics of the jutsu inside of his head.  Every little detail, slowly, efficiently, trying to gain a mastery of this jutsu.  He thought about how he took in the air, how he put in the seal, how he focused his chakra.  Everything had to be done perfectly everytime. 

He drifted off to sleep while in that place.  While he was sleep he was dreaming of a spar with a random person.  He dreamed of using this jutsu in a spar.  He realized that it was all too slow as he got punched in his grill as he was about to fire and it threw everything off.  So bad in fact that it woke him up.  HE would sit straight up, eyes widened.  "Damn. . . Fell asleep."

HIroshi slowly rose back to his feet and dusted himself off.  He still hadn't recovered all of his chakra, so he just opened the scroll with the jutsu, trying to get a better understanding of it that way.

Hiroshi had been at this for a while so he put the scroll away.  He decided to just chilax for a while.* - Fri Oct 23 16:53:45 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked over to the Mansion, with his trusty broom in hand.  This was the first mission that he had gotten since he had been out of the academy, so he was kind of excited.  Even though it was only sweeping the steps, it was still a mission.  He reached his destination and started to scale the steps.  As he was climbing them he noticed how dirty they really were.  "I see why Sir Hassan wanted me to clean these.  These steps are filthy."  He would quickly get to the top step and get ready to start sweeping.  There were quite a few steps so this was going to be a tedious task.  O well, you have to start somewhere.

HIroshi took his trusty broom ans started to sweep the dirt, north to south.  Knocking all of the dirt and dust from one stop onto te step directly under it.  He was being very thorough about this.  He would not only sweep the steps, but go in the little cracks and get what dirt he could out there.  After he was finished with the step he would take a step down and continue on with his cleaning.  Each step looking brand knew when he was finished with it. 

HIroshi had finally gotten about half way through the task at hand.  He looked up at his handy work and admired it.  The steps were so clean you could practically eat off them.  He still wouldn't advise you to do that though.  "Ok, half way there.  It is looking pretty good for now.  Just keep on moving like this and I will have these steps done in no time."

Hiroshi swept the last bit of dirt from the final step onto the earths sandy surface.  I mean that is where dirt belonged anyway so he figured it was a geat place to put it.  He looked up and wiped his forehead.  "Phew. . All done.  Time to go tell Sir Hassan."  He would say as he happily walks back to the square with his broom in hand.* - Fri Oct 23 17:22:46 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked to his favorite place to train.  He had some work to do, he had been slacking lately and was not too proud of himself.  He had a few jutsu that he needed to learn and he planned on doing that right now.  He wanted to learn both of them in a timely mannor, but only time would tell.  He would sit down and lean back against the wall.  He would then pull out a scroll and crack it open.  Reading the scroll from left to right, he started to soak up the information as he read it. * - Mon Oct 26 01:06:59 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was picking up the information at an avarage pace.  He had no idea how long he was going to be there, but he was determined to crack down on hismelf for being so lazy.  Even if he was smart he wasn't going to get anywhere by being lazy.  So he continued reading.* - Mon Oct 26 01:08:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) He was starting to understand the bare necessities of the jutsu.  Like what it looked like and the hand seals.  This was about it at this point though.  This was not going to be something that he was just going to be able to do just like that.* - Mon Oct 26 01:09:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) let out a loud yawn as he read.  He did not like to read, but this was going to help him so he bared with it.  It was nobody's fault but his that he had been slacking, now was the time to make up for it.  So read he did.* - Mon Oct 26 01:10:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was still in relatively the same place mentally after a while of studying.  He was not sure what was holding him back at this point.  Maybe he was't as focused as he wanted to be.  Maybe he was letting his displeasure for reading get in his way.  O well, even if that was the case he had to do it.  He was not going to be a genin forever.  He was either going to become a chuunin or possibly a Jounin, or die trying.  Whatever happened first.  He accepted that, as id most shinobi he knew.  His butt was starting to get tired though, so he stood up and flopped onto his stomach to study.* - Mon Oct 26 01:13:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was starting to get comfortable with the idea of the jutsu.  So much so that he had pulled out his kunai and started to try and use the jutsu.  It never worked, at least not yet.  He still had a ways to go before he could use this jutsu.* - Mon Oct 26 01:15:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was pretty thankful for the opportunity to learn this jutsu.  He really owed his buddy Trilliam.  If it wasn't for him he wouldn't be sitting here forcing himself to read right now.  This jutsu was something he knew he would possibly need in the future.  Even if he wished he could have learned this another way, at least Trill was nice enough to give him the scroll so he could have the opportunity to learn this damn thing.* - Mon Oct 26 01:18:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was really starting to get a sense of what this jutsu was all about.  He knew what it was, but now he was starting to figure out when he would use this jutsu.  How he would use this jutsu.  The ups and the downs of the jutsu.  With his high  IQ, he was sure that he would figured out the best ways to benefit from this.* - Mon Oct 26 01:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was almost there.  So close to getting this jutsu to the point where he could finally use it.  This scroll was not an easy one to just sit down and decipher.  But that was exactly what HIroshi was trying to do.  HOw long it would take, well that was up to Hiroshi.

HE was getting so close to being able to use this jutsu that he could taste it.  The only thing stopping him now was just not focusing hard enough.  He really had to focus just to get a small amount of the jutsu to activate.  So he knew he wasn't completely there just yet.  But the time would come, it would come sooner rather then later.

The young Sunagakure shinobi had done it.  He had finally learned this jutsu.  Now the scroll was not needed, but he would keep it anyway.  Maybe when he gets older he could pass this down to one of his students.  But for the time being, he was proud of himself and that was all that mattered to him.* - Mon Oct 26 01:25:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had had enough of being proud of himself.  He still had one more jutsu to learn and he knew that it was going to be like no other jutsu that he had ever tried to use, learn, or for his knowledge seen.  Any jutsu comin from a guy like Sanoke must be something serious.  So he cracked open the scroll, ready for the hardest thing that he has had to do as a shinobi yet.

Hiroshi was still on his stomach for now and his feet were up into the air swinging back and forth.  This was probably going to take a while, so he might as well be comfortable right?

This scroll was simply whipping Hiroshi's ass.  Even if he was smart, like really smar, this was just insane.  This jutsu was so complex, required so much chakra, looked so powerful, and HIroshi loved every minute of this.  He had never been challenged like this intellectually.  This was something that he could get used too.

At this point, Hiroshi had rolled over onto his back and had the scroll suspended in his hands.  This jutsu captivated him.  Maybe even more then the bullets that Mari-Sensei had giving him.  If he could get this thing down and show her she might be inspired to give him something else.  Plus he needed to get stronger so he could challenge his sensei to a spar.  So he kept on reading with new found inspiration.

This was probably the first time in Hiroshi's life that he wasn't bored while reading.  He was actually having a hard time containing himself.  He couldn't wait to fire this thing off and see what it was like to use it.  Then it hit him, he hoped that he had the chakra to use the damn thing.

Hiroshi was a figity little guy.  He started off on his butt, moved to his stomach, rolled onto his back, and now he had flipped over his head back onto his stomach.  This was probably the most confortable he had been in a long time.  He found joy in getting stronger, no matter how he had to do it.  If he had his choice he would have just gotten Sanoke to reach him personally but, oh well.  It doesn't matter as long as it is done.

This jutsu was called Mud Dragon Bullet and it was one hell of a technique.  Sanoke must have had a lot of faith in Hiroshi that he didn't even know about.  I mean just the fact that he gave him this dan thing means something right?  This wasn't the time for HIroshi to get distracted, so he refocused and read some more.

Had been at this for a while and was making a little progress.  He had faith in himself to learn this jutsu faster then most, but damn.  This thing was a flipping monster.  The seals by them self were starting to make Hiroshi feel dumb.  This was going to be hard.

Continued to read the scroll.  Looking at each letter, each word, each sentence, each paragraph.  Each one of these things had valuable information that would help HIroshi learn this thing.

Decided to read one last paragraph before taking a break.  He had been at this a while and needed to rest his brain, along with his eyes.* - Mon Oct 26 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had taken a long enough break and cracked that scroll back open. He knew that he still had a long way to go.  At least now he could say that he knew the seal.  As for doing them.  Now that was something else entirely.

This scroll was pretty clear and thorough in its explenation of the jutsu.  But the act that the jutsu was so difficult made a simple explenation seem like the quadratic formula.  Which isn't all that hard but it was the only thing I could think of at the moment.  Anyway Hiroshi kept on reading damnit.

Was wreacking his brain trying to learn this damn thing.  He at least had the hand seals down pact and could perform them individually.  He couldn't really chain them together quite yet.  This was not a simple jutsu remember.

This was probably still going to take a while.  So he decided to hop up onto a rock and sit down.  He had a spot on the rock that he sat down on so much it actually took the shape of HIroshi's ass.  This was the best spot to read this damn thing.

Hiroshi continued to read with a slight twinkle in his eye.  This jutsu was amazing and he was soooo ready to use it.  So he stood up and wanted to see what would happen.* - Mon Oct 26 02:17:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was totally not ready and decided to slow it back down real quick.  It was no way that he was going to be able to use it just yet.  So he cracked open the scroll and started reading once more.* - Mon Oct 26 02:25:29 2015
