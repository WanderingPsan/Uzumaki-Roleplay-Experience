<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walks away silently.* - Fri Oct 30 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked to his training spot still fuming.  He couldn't belive that Sae was actually gone.  He missed herso much already.  He didn't know what to do about it just yet.  He said he was going to be there to help her, but once again he was powerless.  "This is so frustrating. . . Damnit."  He would say as he punched the ground with everything he has.  Actually causing his hand quite a bit of pain, but he didn't care at the moment.  As he removed his hand from the ground, his knuckels were scratched and scrapped baddly.  Each one was covered in blood.  He rose to his feet with a determined glare and started to train in complete silence.  He ran through the seals that he needed and unleashed his wind jutsu.  Wind style: Great Breakthrough.  The winds would surge past him into the wall with more power then ever before.

Hiro was still standing there with the same angry glare on his face.  Even though his jutsu had been stronger then ever before, he didn't care.  His emotions were clearly boosting his strength at the moment.  Still he felt that thu jutsu was not good enough.  So he did it again.  Repition people.  Repition.

The young shinobi now had a few tears running down his face.  He was rushed.  He lost his best friend and Mari-Sensei was still out on her mission.  Not only was he angry, he felt like he was all alone for the time being.  He had never felt so alone in all of his life.  The usually relaxed Hiroshi was now fighting with himself just to not cry.  He tried to refocus and ran through his seals.  He activated his jutsu and continued.

Wind style: Great Breakthrough was not really getting a whole lot better.  Yes he was making small progress each time, but he wasn't making any noticable leaps.  Plus his mind was somewhere else. The anger tht was making him stronger was slowly turning into sadness and dispair.  The few tears that wre running down his face had multiplied into multiple tears flowing from his face.  But still, he continued to train.  He used the jutsu again.  

Hiroshi was showing off his determination right here.  But it was killing him on the inside.  h eused the jutsu one last time and then sat down on the ground.  He st there looking dead in the face with the stears still coming down.  He didn't move to wipe them, he just let them run.  He was totally out of it.* - Fri Oct 30 05:16:09 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: . . . .  - Fri Oct 30 05:18:43 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked to an isolated part of the village and got ready to do some training.  He had been doing a lot of guard duty lately and hadn't had a lot of free time to train.  This was one of the few opportunities that he had and he was not about to let it go to waste.  He started to gather his chakra and then started to run through the seals.  Tiger! Ox! Dog! Rabbit! Snake!.  With the final sign locked in he would then clap and activate his jutsu.  A mighty gush of wind would blow into the wall.  His clothes would be blown all over the place.  Eventually the wind died down and he continued to train.

HIro was still feeling the effects of losing his friend.  The only way that he had been able to deal with it was to keep himself busy.  So he continued to work on mastering the jutsu that Mari-Sensei had taught him.  He rn through the seals and activated the jutsu once again.  It was getting better with each use.

"This thing is tough.  Even for me. I always thought that I picked up on things quickly.  This is one hell of a jutsu to keep me feeling like this.  I wonder how?. . . "  He stopped talking and just started to stare at the ground.  He would then shake his head, trying to get himself together to keep training.  "No, HIro focus on your training.  Son't let your mind wander.  Focus, focus, focus."  As he staid focus he started to gather his chakra.  He could feel it building inside of himself.  Once he hit the point where he could use his jutsu he did just that.  After the final seal he signified the end with a clap of his hands.  The wind would come rushing forward towards the wall.  Hiro could hear the whistle of the wind in his ear as it moved past him.

HIroshi was still working hard.  Things were not going to go anywhere by just standing here.  So he was going to go again.  He did the jutsu again and the wind blew the sand all over the place.  

This was the last time that he was going to use the jutsu for a little while.  Rest was an important part of training also.  He ran through the seals and used it again.  He would then lean back and relax on the wall.* - Fri Oct 30 19:09:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood up and resume his training.  He had been resting long enough and time was not a luxury that he had.  So he used Wind Style:Great Breakthrough once again.  The wind blew sand all over the place and Hiro sheilded his eyes.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) 's clothes were very tattered, his knuckles were all covered in blood, and his eyes were slightly red at this point.

"Keep a sharp eye out Bry.  Never know what is going to happen."* - Fri Oct 30 19:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) shook his head.

"Yea, I am fine.  Just went a little overboard on training.  I will be perfectly fine. I am still not strong enough to protect the ones that I care about.  That was made perfectly clear to me.  I am only 13 and I lost my best friend.  That's not supposed to happen Bry.  I'm supposed to still be able to go and train with her, talk to her, laugh with her.  I'm not supposed to be here telling you that I should be able to do all of those things. . . Damnit."  

He would say as he punched the wall beside him, causing more cuts and bruises on his hand.* - Fri Oct 30 19:38:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked at Bryson with a blank expression.  His emotions were running higher then ever and Bry wanted him to calm down.  He was right, but Hiro was still young.  After what probably felt like the longest seconds of his life, he gave Bry a weak smile and nodded.

"Y-Yea.  You are probably right.  Here and thanks."  He stated as he extended both of his hands towards Bryson.  His knuckles were each swollen and covered in blood.  His fingers were all in the same exact condition.  On the real it hurt Hiro just to close his hand into a fist.* - Fri Oct 30 20:02:46 2015
