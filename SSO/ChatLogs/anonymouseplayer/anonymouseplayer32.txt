"Ok, this technique is called Earth Style: Hiding like a Mole Jutsu.  With this, all you have to do is coat yourself in your doton chakra.  When you can do that, you will be able to slip into the ground and move around under the surface at will.  You can go down as far as you want, but if you go to the core and get fried to a crisp, that is on you.  Once you get down there, you can feel the magnetic forces of the earth to keep track of an enemy.  That is basically the ins and outs of the jutsu.  When you can get this down, you can do this." 

He would slip into the ground and pop out behind Green, tapping him on the shoulder.

"For now, try and surround yourself in doton chakra."* - Sun Dec  6 22:41:55 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nodded his head and awaited for the others.  He didn't know exactly where they were going.

"This should be fun."  He would say stretching.* - Mon Dec  7 03:19:15 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood there in amazement.  He would never get tired of seeing this happen.

". . . . Whoa. . . . "* - Mon Dec  7 03:23:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Let's go. - Mon Dec  7 03:24:22 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would hop off and take a look around.  He had no idea what he was looking for, but he was definitely on the look out for any would be enemies.  With Koji here, it wouldn't really be a problem, but Hiro would look around anyway.

"So. . . What exactly are we doing here?"* - Mon Dec  7 03:29:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) hated to see people down like this.  It was not something that he enjoyed about this at all.  Still, Koji had choose him to talk to the mother, and that was what he was going to try to do.  He had recently lost his mother,  which was the reverse of her situation, but maybe he could use it as some way to help calm her down.  The relative would shoot him a glare and Hiroshi would start to talk.

"Hello, my name is Hiroshi and I am a shinobi from the land hidden in the sand, Sunagakure.  This squad has been sent here to try and get to the bottom of all of this.  I know she seems to be upset right about now, but I would really like to speak with her.  It could be the difference between finding out what happened or not.   So could you let me speak to her plese?"* - Mon Dec  7 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hassan, Trilliam(ZaVante) thinks: Why am i even here.,,..... This is like not what I do. - Mon Dec  7 04:01:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Even if she is crying. . I don't know these people. . . I am keeping an eye out for everything. . .  - Mon Dec  7 04:08:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: Nothing..strange. - Mon Dec  7 04:11:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was let in and thought to himself.  

" So. I can't upset her. . . Well that isn't fair, she is already upset. . . Oh well, at least he let me in."

Hiro was a patient guy, but even he only had so much patience.  It seemed like she wasn't even really trying to help them help her.  That did indeed make him a little angry, but he knew the pain of losing someone dear to him.  He knew what it was like to sit there, thinking back about the different adventures you had with a person.  He knew it all to well.  Just when he was about to try and change up the tactics, he heard her start to say something.  This could be his only opportunity to get some valuable information from her.  He leaned in a little closer trying to hear her, while staying fully alert, not sure what to expect from her.  He started to speak softly.

"What was that mam?  I couldn't quite hear you.  I think you said a name.  Look, I know that you are hurting, I understand.  I recently lost my mother and I was in pretty much the same state as you are.  I am only here to try and help you miss.  So please. . Tell me what you know so we can bring all of the fallen to justice. .  . . Please. . "  He would say in the kindest, most caring voice he could manage.* - Mon Dec  7 04:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) says: gasp* - Mon Dec  7 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Otorius(OtoTheChannel) thinks: Kiri...? - Mon Dec  7 05:23:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was already starting to get confused from the name Kiri, now to make things worse.  This lady was reaching out for Hiro as she continued to shout yet another name that he had not recognized.  She needed some shampoo, conditioner, and some chap stick, crusty ass lips all over the place.  He sat there, still trying to get all of this through his head.

"As if Kiri wasn't enough. . . Now she is talking about Nemus.  What the hell is that?  I mean, I am pretty sure that Kiri might be her son.  She seems to really like my hair all of a sudden and she is acting a lot like my mom.  My mom always played in my hair. . . But this, this is just creepy."  He would think silently to himself.

To make matters even worse, she wasn't just playing in his hair now, she had a senbon running it through his hair like it was a comb.  Hiro took pride in his hair, he alwasy kept it clean and soft.  He didn't let too many people play in his soft blue hair.  She damn sure wasn't about to be one of those people that he let do it.  He wanted to make a move, but she was still talking about stuff, he would hold off for a few seconds still waiting for information.

After a few strokes from the senbon, she started to speak again.  This time, she brought up the Nemus thing again.  He sat there, motionless listening to what she had to say.  The words that he needed to hear were said right after, Nemus was her husband.  Hiro had an idea of what might be happening.  It seemed like her son, Kiri, had been kidnapped, or worse.  This Nemus person was her husband and Hiro wasn't even sure if he was around or not.  This was all a bit sketchy, and he didn't like the fact that a crazy, crusty lipped woman was playing in his hair with a senbon.  But, for the sake of the mission, he tried to play along.  Deception is shinobi's greatest weapon.  He hugged her and his voice jumped up a few ocatves as he started to speak.  He was still completley on edge, hoping she would not sense it.  If he felt even the tinyest of scratches to his head, or if a peice of his hair fell out.  He would squeeze the shit out of this woman.

"I was soo scared mom.  I was so scared.  I don't even remember what happened.  What happened mommy?  What happened?"  

"This might be stupid as hell. . ."  He thinks to himself.* - Mon Dec  7 05:46:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was let go and she charged over at Otorious.  He didn't know the kind of experience that he had, or what he could do.  But, before he had a chance to continue to worry, he saw his eyes do the same thing that Mirai's did.  "Ohh. . He must be related to her or somthing.  Oh well, no time to think about it now."  

The moment that he saw what Otorious did, he put up two quick seals.  He could tell the direction that she was going in and shot out a sticky, startchy substance at the wall where she was going to land.  That way, she would be stuck there for the time being, hopefully.  This seemed like nice team combo, so Hiro just hoped that it was going to work.* - Mon Dec  7 06:23:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: I'm sorry lady. . . I hope you get stuck though. . .  - Mon Dec  7 06:25:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not going to let a rock be his teams undoing.  He was about to put everything he had into a single strike.  He put brought his hands up into the shape of an x.

"Gate of Opening, Open."  

He would open the first gate and leap up into the rock.  He woudl then deliver a mighty kick to the rock in conjunction with everybody else.  Hopefully Trill wouldn't blow him sky high. . Let's see.* - Mon Dec  7 06:44:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) landed on the ground and picked up the notes as Koji just said.  HE handed them to Koji and nodded his head.

"You can take these Koji."* - Mon Dec  7 06:51:44 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) went into his house and pulled out a scroll to read about the jutsu that Trill had taught him.  He was not going to physically be able to use the jutsu, but that was not the only way for one to learn more about the jutsu and gain a better understanding of it.  He walked into his shower as he read, he had a lot of other things he was going to do while he had some free time at home.

He got into the shower and started to bathe.  He popped open his shampoo and started to wash his silky, blue hair.  While he was doing this, he went through the use of a jutsu in his head.  He put up the seals, took a swift breath, and then imagined shooting out a stream of water.  He was so into this imagionative practice, that when he cam beck, he was actually about to do the jutsu full strength, he stopped and smiled.

"Damn. . I really am a wreckless guy.  That is probably the reason I want to fight Nami again.  I feel like after a little training, I might actually be able to take her.  This should be fun."  As he says this, he finishes bathing, but stays in the shower,  He then shot off a soft stream at the floor,  I mean he was in the shower.

He looked around his shower and noticed that he needed to do some cleaning.  He looked at his hands and smiled, I know exactly what to do.  He stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel around himself.  He would start on the east wall, he walked over and sprated down the wall with his jutsu.  The dirt and gime all starting to break up from the force of the water.  He grabbed a soapy scrubber and started to clean.  "1 down."

"On to the next wall."  He backed up and admired his own work for a bit.  The wall was glistneing.  It was the first time he had seen it like tht since he moved in.  He trned to the other wall and pulled out a bottle of soap.  He squirtedtit all ver the wall.  Then, he proceeded to soak the soap and the wall with water, casuing bubbles to form all over the shower.  He smiled and went to work.  "I'll never get tired of bubbles."

With two more walls left to got, he move on to the western wall.  This one not only had the wall, but the shower itself.  Hiro would start with the wall.  He suimened his way up the wall and started to walk from one side of the wall, to the next, dripping soap all over the place.  Soap slowly driped down the wall until he had finished.  He jumped off and shot a stream of water at it as he was falling.  "Spotless!"

He walkeed into his shower and unleased a missle of wter all around him, spinning in a circle.   The shower wasn't too dirty, just needed a quick rinse.  "Last wall then the floor."

He soaped up the final wall, and then sprayed it down.  The four walls and shower were now clean and all of the dirt had been left on the floor.  He walked around, spraying the floor in square, sending all of the dirty into the drain.  He mopped and then smiled.  "Damnit. . Now I need a shower."  He got back in and rebathed.* - Mon Dec  7 17:04:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked out of the shower and strethched a bit.  He was feeling nice and refeshed.  He was going to go outside for a little while and continue his training.  He walked outside and put up some seals, he sprayed down the dirt for the hell of it and smiled at the mud.  "I'm getting good at this."

He noticed that he and his Bro's house didn't really have much going for it.  He quickly went a brought a few flowers.  Here in Suna, they would probaly die, due to the desert being so dry.  He had to pot them in some  pretty expensive soil, but it was ok.  He watered them with the jutsu and went on about his business.  "Green should like those."

He went to the wall, pretty much right beside his house.  He thought back on that creepy ass lady from the mission.  He had never felt to ackward in his life.  He shook his head, trying to get her image out of his head.  "I should have sprayed her dry ass down too.  She really needed some chapstick."  He then sprayed down the wall and smiled.  "Just like that."

He was really getting good with this jutsu.  The selas were starting to get more fluid, the flow of water was getting more accurate and cleaner.  Everything was improving.  He sprayed the wall and began to think again.  "Hmmm, that festival is coming up.  I need to convince Nami to get into that maid outfit for me.  I also need to get her something for becoming a chuunin.. . Hmmm, what though?  I don't want to ask her, I want to surprise her.  I doubt she will have anything for me.  *shrugs*  Hell, I will be ok if she just kisses me honestly. . .Wait. . .Who the hell am I talking too?"

He laughed at himself for actually talking out loud, as if he was talking to somebody.  He sprayed the wall and he could hear Nami's voice in his head.  "You better keep getting stronger, or I am going to keick the living daylights out of you.  Hmph."  He smiled "Thanks sweetheart. You are always keeping me in line."

He didn't know how long he had been at this, but he had chakra to spare.  Plus, he was a chuunin now.  He had to put in more work if he waned to maintain the position and if he wanted to move up to jounin.  His journey was just beginning.  So he continued to work on getting this jutsu as clean and crisp as possible.* - Mon Dec  7 17:20:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was outside now and could actually work on the jutsu that Trill had taught him.  He put his hands together and started to swim around under the earth.  HIs speed being very high.  He was getting accustumed to this jutsu.  "I like swimming in this!"

He popped out and went over to the rock nearby.  He was going to try and get used to attempting to drag things under the ground.  He knew that the rock would be harder for him to grab, so he digured it would be a good training exercise.  he went into the earth and attempted to grab the rock, he missed.  He popped up and cursed at himself.  "Damnit. "

It seemed that he always had something to do against a rock.  Either one of sensei's rocks, or just an ordinary rock.  They all seemed to get in the way.  He stared angryly at the rock and went down again.  This time, grabbing the rock, but not being able to move it.  He popped up and kicked the rock, shattering it into pieces.

". . Oops. . Guess I am not using the rock for training anymore.  ."  He walked away, looking for some people to converse with.  He had been training for a while.* - Mon Dec  7 17:31:44 2015
