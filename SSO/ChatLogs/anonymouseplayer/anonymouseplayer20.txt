<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walks away to do what he said he was.* - Fri Nov 27 20:25:48 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked down towards the still incomplete hospital to help with the reconstruction of the building.  It was still a work in progress, but they were making some noticable movements towards the completion of it.  The foundation was set nice and strong and they had started to work on the outside structures.  Hiroshi was the strongest one there, so they had him runnin gback and forth to lift things for them.  He didn't mind, he looked at all of this as training and helping the village.  Which was something that he liked to do anyway.  

To start off they needed him to help them with a long wooden board.  This was going to be the piece that they connected everything with.  There were 4, one for each side of the structure.  They were extremely heavy and Hiroshi had to use all of the strength that he had in his body just to pick them up.  He hoisted the first one up and over his head, then layed it on his back with his hands at the bottom for support.  HIs body tilted at an angle so the board layed smoothly while he walked it over.  The 5 construction workers would all help take it off and place it horizontally across the ground.  He smiled and went back to get the  next of the four boards.

The next one was done the exact same way.  But since it was taking so much strength to lift them by himself he was a little slower this time then he was the first.  The workers noticed his decline in speed and started to help him out a llittle earlier.  He smiled and nodded his head in apprieciation.  They would all set the board down horozintally, perpendicular to the other board.  they formed a right angle as they layed there.  He wiped his brow and went back for the third board.

Hiroshi had taken off his shirt and jacket, not wanting them to get messed up again.  This board seemed heavier then the rest of them.  He must was getting tired and didn't realize how tired he was.  That was not going to stop him.  The village had been through a lot more then Hiro was in this very moment, so he was not going to stop.  He placed this plank on his back and forced his way over to the rest of the planks already layed out.  He place this one parallel to the first.  There was only one more left to do before he could take a small break.

This last one was the hardest of them all.  He barely even got this one off of the ground.  His face was turning red from the strain of trying to pick it up and over his head.  Some of the workers showe concern for him, but Hiro would not let them help.  He eventually got it onto his back and stood there for a second to collect himself.  One step at a time he started to walk.

Each step seemed harder then the last.  He was so close, yet he was so far.  This was the last of them so he refused to give up.  He wiled himself forward until he made it to the designated spot.  He placed the last of them on the ground and then he fell onto his back, soaked in sweat.  He was tired from all of that, but he still had to help them.  He sruggled to his feet and wiped his brow.  Time to move on to something else.

They had the planks needed, now they just had to finish sonctructin each side of the wall, that was going to take a while so Hiroshi grabbed a hammer and started to bang away.  Doing what he was instructed to do by the experienced construction men there.  

After a while they had done quite a bit to the hospital.  Hiroshi figured he had done all that he could do and got down.  he grapped his shirt and jacket as he told them all goodbye.  He was now goign on to pick up all the trash he could find.

This place was still in rebuilding mode so there was plenty of trash to be picked up.  He started with the area around the hospital.  The attack from the war had left various peices of equipment, beds, sheets, and even supplies layed out on the ground.  MOst of it was unusable, but Evey now and then Hiro was finding things that could stil lbe used.  Like a set of bandages that were not completely destroyed.  He placed all of the reusable things in his pouch and place the rest in a pile.

After a while he had a lot of shit piled up.  he had been at it for a while and they all seemed very grateful.  Now it was time to report to Sanoke.* - Fri Nov 27 20:55:40 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was a not ready for a training session as he was walking.  But, being the guy he was he never turned anything like that down.  He figured if he had to train he would go all out.  He smiled at her and stated.

"I'll do you one better sensei."

He then quickly, if she allowed him to, threw her on his back and started to run as fast as he could.

"Will  this work Sensei?"* - Fri Nov 27 21:19:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) felt her grip tighten around his neck for a slight second.  Then she asked to be put down and he did as he was asked.  Before she got to far away from him he asked her quietly.  

"Are you alright?"  He figured she would give him a simple nod yes or no so he walked over to the boulders as did she.  There were plenty to go around so he did not have to worry about running into her or anything. Plus he was sure that she would be able to break them faster then he would.  So without further hesitation he stood in front of the rock and got into his fighting stance.  He was looking at this as training since he seemed to always be hitting rocks.  He started to spin, remembering his previous training and then delivered a solid roundhouse kick to the rock and it crumbeled away.  He smiled and moved on.* - Fri Nov 27 21:40:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would nod his head and smile.  He always did enjoy fighting things, even if he was pretending.

"Sounds fun Sensei.  Let's do it."

Upon his statement he started to go to work on yet another boulder.  This one was slightly bigger then the last one that he had to break.  So he focused all of his sstrenth as he started to bounce from foot to foot with his fists clenched tight.  He threw a few punches in the air and then started to bob and weave, looking like a professional boxer.  In his imagination, the rock was fighting back.  Throwing a combination of its own.  After e avoided the final left jab that his imaginary moving rock threw he countered with a leap and a quick, solid kick to the face with his right leg.  He flew straight through to the other side of the rock and landed on his feet as it crubled behind him.  He then started to hop from rock to rock, as if he were dodging a series of things.  His feet never touching anything besides the boulders.  This kid was nimble.* - Fri Nov 27 21:54:33 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would give her a smile as he leapt to the next boulder and nod.

"Yup yup. . They say something like that.  But I think that reporters like ladies more then they like a blue-haired teen Sensei.  So they would be flooding the area for you not me."   As he said this he started to try and break multiple rocks with a single attack as he was jumping from boulder to boulder.  He did a quick flip and extended his left leg.  He had his right one bent at the knee, following behind the left.  He made contact with the rock and pushed off of it towards another one as it quickly started to crumble.  

As he flew this time he assumed a super man like pose as he aproached the rock.  His right arm fully extended and in a fist.  His left lined up along his body.  The boy was having fun destroying all of these boulders.  He owed every rock a beat dwon since they had messed up his hands.  He was never goign to forgive the rocks for that.  He burst through the rock and landed onto one more.  This was probably all he coul ddo for now.  The first two seemed easy but he was not like Paine and could not do this as easy as she did.  

The last rock sat there defenseless to the attack that Hiroshi had planned.  He filliped and laned directly on top of the rock.  he drove both of his feet down on the rock.  He did not break it just yet though. When his feet came back down he flipped backwards and onto his feet.  As soon as his toes touched the surface he darted off at it again and gave it one final roundhouse kick to send it crumbling to the ground.  He would smile and give Paine a thumbs up.* - Fri Nov 27 22:15:02 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) laughed at Paine as he continued to smash boulder after boulder.  They had been at this for a while now and from what he had seen there were only a few boulders left.  He wiped a bi of sweat from his forehead as he turned to pain.

"I don't see why they wouldn't sensei. Construction workers always like pretty girls.  I have been around them for a few days and they have said something to each of them.  Or either given them a look that said something that I don't think I am old enough to say."  He looks over at them and sees them looking at his sensei with the looks he was talking about.  "See sensei?"  He would say as he started to laugh.  

He moved on to the next set of rocks that he was about to break.  He ran to it and leaped into the air, delivering a powerful kick breaking the rock into many tiny pieces.  He then looked over at Paine and then looked around.

"Not too many left now."* - Fri Nov 27 22:44:03 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nodded and started to think about how to pull this off.  He had seen it done, by her of course, so he knew what it looked like.  But that was one of those things that was easier said then done.  He felt himself over thinking the entire situation and used both hands to slap his cheeks twice.  Each slap would sound off, echoing in the distance.  He took a deep breath, and then darted off to the last two rocks that he had to break.  

When he got close to the rock, but not close enough to hit the rock he leapt into the air and started to flip furiously to gain momentum.  He flew right past the first rock and went straight to the one behind it.  He threw a solid roundhouse kick and all without hitting the ground he spun and threw yet another roundhouse kick.  He finished the first rock off with a mighty push kick that would send it crumbling to the ground.  On to the next one.

As the name suggested, Hiro used the push kick to propell himself back towards the first rock.  He spun and performed three more flips before finally gaining complete control over himself.  He extended his left foot ready to use it for the dynamic entry that he was told to use.  There was one problem. . .He was going faster then hehad ever went before.  While this seemed like a good thing, he did not have total control over hismelf while moving this fast since this was the first time he had ever done it.  He felt his center of gravity start to move as his weight tried to shift on him in the air.  Using sheer determination and not wanting to fail his sensei he faught it with everything he had.  He faught it just long enough to deliver the kick and go crashing through the rock, reducing it to rubble.  But he was not able to catch himself as he usualy did. Instead he fell straight onto his back and layed there for a second, breathing heavily.  He was tired.  Without getting up he raised his right hand and gave her a thumbs up. . He had found a way to do it.* - Fri Nov 27 23:13:04 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) forehead started to become covered in various beads of sweat.  Each of the beads started to roll down his face as he bit his lip, fighting the urge to sit down.  His tan face was starting to turn red as he stood there.

"She said I had to look untired. . . This is going to be hard. . . Ok let's try and fake it."  He thinks to himself.  He would wipe the sweat from his face and smile at Paine.

"Boy. . I sure do fell all refreshed and what not. . . Feel like I just took a nice long nap.  Yup, yup.  Not tired at all."* - Fri Nov 27 23:50:36 2015
