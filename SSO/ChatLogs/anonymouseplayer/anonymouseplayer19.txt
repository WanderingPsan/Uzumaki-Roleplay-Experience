<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) silently walks away.* - Thu Nov 26 06:20:35 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) silently made it to the hospital. Sanoke was 100 percent right in what was going on here.  There were various jounin barking orders, buildings were being fixed, people were cleaning rubble and gathering materials for various things.  There wree even a few shinobi there serving as protectors to the medics who were hard at work on the vast nmber of injured civilians.  HIroshi just shook his head.  "This war has caused so much pain."  He thought to himself silently.

Hiro decided to try and do as much as he could while he was there.  For starters he was going to start picking up all of the rubble that he could.  His hands were still bandaged and swollen slightly.  But, due to him taking it easy the past week or so and not using his hands when he didn't absolutely have to had reduced the swelling conciderably.  He could actually open and close his hands with little to no pain at all.  He blanked out his mind for a while and started to hone in on the physical labor in front of him.  The villigers needed his help.

There were various things on the ground that had been destroyed from this war.  The hospital was not the same, there were buildings leaning sideways, and various pieces of wood were laying on the ground.  Even pieces of former homes were there.  Some usable again, others completely lost.  He started to make two piles for the time being.  A pile for the things deemed unusable.  And a pikle for the things that could be used once again to make a new home.

This was quite easy for Hiroshi since he had an impressive amount of strength, but it wasstill getting a bit tiresome.  He had done quite a bit already with each pile.  He came accross something that really caught his attention.  It was a smal paper fan that looked a lot like Mari-Sensei's.  He had tried to become an emotionless machine for the time being, but this paper fan was making it hard for him.  He felt a single tear roll down his chek and he uickly wiped it away and went back to work.  "She wouldn't want me to be sad.  Either way. . . NOw she is up there with Sae. . . You two have fun.  I will see both of you some time in the future. . . I will make both of you proud."

He finished with the two piles and various citizens of Sunagakure thanked him.  He smiled and went on to the next part of his helping.  There were people building up the hospital so that the doctors had better places to perform their duties then just keeping patients outside.  The 13 year old did not know much about building things, so he just went and joined in the line that was passing things.  He started to pass peices of wood, nails, tools, you name it.  Whatever this building needed he was passing it along the line to the person who did know what the hell they were doing  

Some time passed and the hospital was stating to at least look clean again.  They were no where near done they entire structure, but the space was once again fit for a building to be upon.  They had the foundation set and were mving on to another part of the building.  Hiro had done all that he could for this part since he had no idea what else to do with the building.  He would give them all a nice nod and walk over to the people gathering materials.

As he was picking up the materials he started to lose that robotness over his emotions and his mind started to wander.  "This war. . . I wish I could have done something to help them.  Sanoke said that I couldn't have helped Mari-Sensei, but damnit. . . I said that I was going to get stronger to protect my loved ones.  NOw I find myself in the same position that I was in wen Sae died.  Plus Iza got hurt.  Damnit. . . I need to work harder.  I have to find Pai-Sensei. . I need her to teach me things and make me stronger faster.   don't want to rush her, but I can't afford to keep training and losing loved ones.  This shit hurts. . . Damnit. . . . ."* - Thu Nov 26 06:49:36 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into the trainng area to do some serious training.  He was still pretty heated about this entire thing and he needed to blow off some steam.  He still couldn't use his hands 100 percent yet so punching things were out of the question.  He could, however, make a few hand seals.  So this was the perfect opportunity to practice with his ninjutsu some more.  He clapped his hands and a small gust of wind blew around him.* - Thu Nov 26 06:58:59 2015

"That is stupid. . . Iza got hurt. . . Plus. . . Mari-Sensei was killed. . . And on top of all that.  Ri-Senpai said she had to leave because of painful memories."

The single tear started to turn into a flow.  The young boy was clearly hurt about this entire situation.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled at her.  He was glad she decided to spar.  He needed something to help clear his head.  This was just the thing.  He darted off at Paine as fast as he could.  He knew that she could handle whatever he thre at her so he was going all out.  Once he got within range he would leap into the air quickly and attempt a simple jump kick.  This move needed some work so it looked a bit sloppy.  With her skill he was sure she would notice how bad it looked.* - Thu Nov 26 17:51:47 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) kick had no effect on Paine whatsoever.  She skillfully countered with a kick of her own that made him spin around.  Before he had a chance to collect himself he would feel another kick hit him on his other leg and take his feet out from under him.  He knew how to use suimen, but his skill with it wasn't the bestso he fell into the water, completely submerged.  Still, he felt like this might be an oportunity for a sneak attack.  He swam quicckly under her and attempted to shoot out of the water and throw a solid kick right at the back of her head.  * - Thu Nov 26 18:06:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was successful in his attempt to try and hide from her.  But he was running out of air down there and had to hurry up and make a decision on what to do.  He knew how big of an advantage she had over him so this was probably the only shot that he had to do something.  

"Ok. . .Whaat to do Hiro?  You have to do somthing and fast.  I can't hold my breath forever. . . NOw or never."  He would think to himself.

He swam up, using all of his speed to try and decided to try and do something he had never done in a spar before.  This was the new move that she had taught him and he figured now was the best time to try it.  He formed the tiger seal and shot out of the water  directly under her.  He attempted to insert both of his index and middle fingers into her bottom.  He didn't really know how she would react, but he was sure she would be proud that he found a way to use the knew move.  * - Thu Nov 26 18:23:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would have a bright smile on his face that was soon kicked away.  The moment he thought he had did something she hit him with something he had never seen before.  He was kicked direcly in the stomach and skidded along the water.  He  did not stop until he was back on the grass.  He struggled to even sit up and look at her with wide eyes.  He would give her a smile and then fall back on the ground.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Good day everyone. - Fri Nov 27 01:54:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into his house and sat on his couch after a nice, long shower.  He needed to relax a bit before he went out to train a bit.  But for now he would chill and peek at that scroll that Trill had given him.  He opend it up and allowed the massive intteligence he had go to work.* - Fri Nov 27 02:10:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) this jutsu was not the most complicated thing that Hiro had ever seen so he was picking it up rather quickly.  He continued to glance at the words, soaking in all of the information.* - Fri Nov 27 02:11:50 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) took off both his shirt and jacket and neatly placed them on the back of his couch.  He then walked into the secluded room that he had set aside for his training.  There was nothing in here that could really be messed up in here so he didn't have a reason to hold back.  Plus his ninjutsu wasn't the best anyway so messing up the house was out of the question. He startedt o gather his chakra and then clapped his hands.  A solid gust formed around him that could portcet him from weakly thrown ninja tools.

There were books scattered all over the place in the corner that he used to get a better understanding of his jutsus.  The pictures in them always seemed to make eveything so much clearer.  So he walked over and picked up the first of the books that was on the jutsu that he was working on.  Wind Style: Gale Palm.  He began to read.

The book stated.  "Wind Style: Gale Palm is a smiple technique that when the users hands are clapped together, wind is compressed and transformed into a powerful gale."  Hiroshi knew all that, so he continued to read." Thi technique, when used as an isolated attack has the power to easily knock over a human.  Though the true value comes when using it together with projectile weopons like shuriken or kunai. Their speed, power, and ability to wound or even kill are all increased several times."  Hiroshi noded as things were starting to come together.

He had learned somethin new from when he started.  He didn't use many ninja weapons, so this jutsu might be something that he used to help some of his allies.  Maybe he could use it in conjunction with Trill's little figures and help him out.  HIs mind continued to wander as he tried to figure out when to use this technique.

"Ok. . .This would help a few people that I know.  Trill, Iza if she can even do anything anymore, maybe Sanoke I don't know anything that he can't do so I am sure that he can use something that can help make this jutsu even better. . . Hmm I don't know. . . I'll just do my part and make sure that the jutsu is the best that it can be."  He would then rise to his feet and place thebook back ontop of the pile.  Walking back into the center of the room, the young shinobiresumed his training.

As he was training his senpai crossed his mind.  "I wonder if I can find an excuse to go to Konoha and see Senpai. . . Nah, I don't think that I should go right now.  She needs some space and I might bring her more pain. . . I sure miss her though.  When she comes back I am going to be stronger then ver and I am goign to have to get her something.  I owe her for feeding me and for giving me that scroll."  As he finished his thoughts aloud he clapped and more wind blew around the room.

HIroshi was beginning to perspire slightly.  He had been at this for a while and was starting to feel the effects of running low on chakra.  He had a few more good ones left in him, but he didn't want to expend all of his energy to the point where he couldn't move.  So he decided that this woudl be his last one fore a little while before he tok a break.  So he clapped and sat down, enjoying his homemade breeze.* - Fri Nov 27 02:29:45 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood up after a while of rest and decided to move on to another jutsu.  But before that he went into the drawer to change the bandages on his hands.  As he took them off his formerly red, puffy swollen hands were now only slightly swollen and almost completely healed.  HE had done a nice job of taking care of himself and he was actually proud.  He fixed them and then formed the ram seal and poofed back to his original position, getting a bit dizzy.

The next jutsu was Shunshin.  He had just used it to get back to his original spot, but he had to get better at it so he would not get so dizzy when he would us it.  That could really leave him open for a big blow.  Maybe even a fatal one.  He used it again and fell to the ground.  The entire room was spinning.* - Fri Nov 27 02:40:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had recovered and rose to his feet with a smile.  He could not belive how dizzy this utsu made him and he actually found it a little funny.  He wasn't sure if it was a sign of weakness or inexperience.  Which ever one it is, he was going to fix it today.  On a bright note, he was at least feeling the effects less then when he first learned the jutsu.  He formed the ram seal and poofed again.

He reappeared over by his books and startd to pant a bit.  This was a tireing jutsu but he was not going to stop yet. He poofed again and reappeard ontop of the bed.  "*pant* *pant* . . Damn. . .This is tiring.

When Hiroshi used this jutsu he didn't in actuality he was not disappearing.  He was just was moving very very fast.  But with his inpressive vission he was actually able to see everything very clearly.  He was workin on his senses and his sight was just the begining.  But he poofed again and reappeared back where he started.

Things were going pretty smoothly for Hiroshi right now.  The village was in its rebuilding faze, but everything was moving along.  One day at a time the resilient village continued to persavere.  Each person doing what they could to help the other person back onto their feet.  The thought of this made Hiro proud to be a resident of the village.  So he was not going to stop training now.  He owed it to the people of this village to be strong.  So he formed the seal and you know what happened.

The entire room was spinning and he could barely stand.  But sinc e he was still standing he made the seal again and used the jutsu one last time.  He poofed to his original spot and fell onto his back.  He had to get himself ogether.  He felt liek he was still moving even though he was laying on the ground.* - Fri Nov 27 02:51:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had gotten himself together and rose to his feet once more.  He had a lot of other things to do.  He pulled out his Tanto that he kepd hidden nder all of his clothes.  He always kept it on him as a last resort.  He didn't have the most kenutsu skills, but the element of surprise always helped.  He then started to surge hsidoton chakra into the blade making it even harder then it was to begin with.

He held the tanto in front of him and continued to surge his chakr through it.  His hands shaking from the extended exersion of his chakra.  He was not used to doing something like this.  In fact he wasn't used to using ninjutsu like talking about.  But he always kept it in his back pocket to try and catch people off guard when he had too. 

HIroshi was not able to keep the flow going and dropped the tanto.  he let it stay ther for a second as he tried to catch his breath.  He walked slowly over to the books that he had in the corner and started to read up on the jutsu.  Plus he stil had the scroll in there as well.  He had a lot of things to fall back on.

* - Fri Nov 27 02:57:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood up and then retrieved his tanto.  He would then start to surge his chakra through the blade again.  Making it extremely hard.  He did a few star wars like slashes in the air for the fun of it.  He would make the sounds as he did them.  "*shhhhhwwwwwwooooouuuummm*  *pzzinmm*  *szzhhwwum*  *szzwum*"

Continued his imaginary sword fight.  He ducked out of the way, narrowly avoiding a slash from the enemy.  A few of his silky blue hairs getting sliced off.  Hiroshi jump up and pun around, slashind at an angle towards his opponents lower back.  The blad sunk into the flesh and killed the man instantly.  Just then Hiro felt a slash hit him in his shoulder.  He tuenrned to see the big boss man staring him in his face with a sinister smile.

"You have done well to make it this far Hiro.  But this is where you are going to meet your end."  Said the big boss man.  He woudl then charge at Hiro, who was smiling with the tanto in both hands, still reciving his chakra.  he countered the slash and they started toweing faster then others eyes could keep up with.

After a while of this Hiroshi finally found an opening.  He attempted a sweeping kick, that the boss man would leap over.  Hiro wanted that and quickly spun around to deliver a final slash acrss his torso.  The boss an let out a yell of agony as he fell to the ground.  Hiro was victorius.* - Fri Nov 27 03:14:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was getting better at putting his chakra into a blade now.  This was starting to become pretty easy for him.  He did it one last time and decided to go outside for a while.* - Fri Nov 27 03:18:24 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) could not find his sensei so he jsut went home to do a bit more training.  He went into his shower area to train there.  That way when he was doen he could just walk straight into the shower.  He pulled out his tanto and started to surge his chakra into it.  Increasing the durability.

The chakra he was pushing throught the blade would harden it beyond it's normal capabilitites.  HE knew how hard the sword was to begin with.  So the thought of it becoming even harder was a bit scary.  He coninued to slash the water as it dripped from the shower head.

He was starting to shake a bit due to the continuous flow of chakra he was pushing through the tanto.  That did not stop him from coursng it through it though.  He started to focus even harder on the blade and his chakra started to surge through it even faster.

PUt the sword dwon and steped in the shower.  It was time to relax.* - Fri Nov 27 03:56:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stared at the rock with conviction in his eyes.  And the rock stared back with the same look.  Hiroshi and this rock seemed to be rivals in training.  He always had to do something to this rock, and it was always trying to hold him back.  He smiled at it and started to speak.

"You won't win this time Mr. Rock."

With that statement he would start to do what his teacher has said.  He started to spin as fast as he could, and then he tried to push it even farther.  He would then finally throw a stiff right roundhouse kick aimed right at the rocks eye.  Continueing to spin he would throw a left straight push kick righ at it's mouth.  The last and final kick was another push kick but with his right leg.  The rock shifted, but only a bit.  Maybe about 5 inches or so.

"Damn.. . . I wasn't fast enough."* - Fri Nov 27 17:35:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: u-umm... - Fri Nov 27 17:40:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would wipe the sweat starting to form on his face with his arm.  He was starting to sweat so he took off his jacket and shirt and folded them up neatly.  He placed them off to the side and walked back over to the rock.  Before he started to do it again he decided to stretch again.  He extended his left leg as far as he could to the side and then bent his right leg with both hands on his right knee, stretching the muscles in his leg.  He then did the reverse to stretch his other leg.  

"Alright. . . One more time."

He started to spin once again.  Going a bit faster then he did the first time.  "Faster. . Faster. . Faster!"  He would think to himself.  Once he reached what he felt was a decent speed he unleased a flurry of kicks on the rock ranging from high to low.  He finished his combo and bent over placing his hands on his knees panting.  He looked at the new location of the rock.  It had moved 10 inches.  HE did better then last time but it wasn't enough.

"Every step counts. "  HE would say as his face started to drip with sweat.* - Fri Nov 27 17:43:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: *pant. . . *pant. . . Why must this rock mock me so? - Fri Nov 27 17:45:23 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: That sounds a bit dangerous but,. . you know best. - Fri Nov 27 17:46:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would jump up and down on the tip of his toes to try and hype himself up for his next attempt.  He had moved it about half the distance he needed to.  He still had to move it another 10 inches before he reached 20.  Apparently he was doing too muchhyping and got the motion to do it again.  So he started to spin. He spun and spun until everything around him looked like it was just once continuous blur. When he reached that point, the attacks started to fly.

He started with a simple front kick with his left foot.  Next came a spinning right heel kick.  With one last quick spin he delivered a powerful lef roundhouse kick to the rock.  The rock slid back with each kick.  He stood there in his stance measuring the distance he had moved the rock.

"Psshh. . .14 inches. . . 6 more Hiro, 6 more."* - Fri Nov 27 17:51:21 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not about to let this rock hold him back anymore.  This damn thing had caused him enough trouble.  Plus, he wasn't trying to have to move it another 10 inches.  "No more games Hiro. . .Move this rock now."  HE would think to himself.

He started to spin.  Picking up speed with each rotation.  He had to make sure that he kept up his speed as he delivered his kicks, or he would never move it the required 20 inches.  With each attempt though, he felt as if it was becoming a bit easier to force himself to spin.  After a bout 5 seconds or so of immense spinning, he started to kick.  The kicks came out in a blur.  He was putting everything he had into them.  He continued to kick until he had no more kicks left in him.

"AAAAAAHHHHHHH!"  He would yell as he delivered each strike.  He finally finished the combination and stood there, panting, counting the inches.  He had done it. Barely, but he had done it.  The rock had just grazed the 20 inch mark.  He would look over at Paine and give her a smile and a thumbs up.

"I did it!"* - Fri Nov 27 18:02:27 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled upon hearing Kinami refer to herself as Miss Supa Kick.  He would let out a chuckle.

"Glad to have you here MSK."  While he was speaking he would get into his own fighting stance.  He started to spin, while keeping an eye on his training partner with his impressive sight.  The instant she moved he would srike as well with a solid straight right kick. . . The rock stayed in the same place.  Neither of them was giving an edge.

He put his foot back down and got back into his stance.  "You are strong.  Seems like we are evenly matched."* - Fri Nov 27 18:24:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: a-again... - Fri Nov 27 18:25:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) jumped from side to side loosening himself up for his next strike on the rock.  The last one was evenly matched so he decided to put a bit more into this one.  He yelled over the rock towards Kinami.

"Ok MSK. . On three we attack together."  He would start to spin as he counted.  "1. . . .2. . ..3"  As soon s he stated three he threw a powerful left roundhouse kick with everything he had at the rock.  He wanted to win this one, he didn't like ties.* - Fri Nov 27 18:28:54 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was a little upset with himself.  He felt like he had been slacking on his training.  He didin't think that Kinami was weak by any stretch.  He was just a competitive guy and always wanted to win.  He was even more determined this time then he was the last as he started to spin around furiously.  He was going to win this time, even if it damn near killed his ass.

"Same thing. . Supa Kick. . . 1. .2. . 3. . "

He would unleash the strongest kick that he could muster.  HIs foot collided with the rock with a big boom.  Did it move?  That depended on what Kanami over there had to say about it.* - Fri Nov 27 18:38:17 2015
