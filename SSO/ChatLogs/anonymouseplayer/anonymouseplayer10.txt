<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: If you think so, man. - Thu Nov 12 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Sure. - Thu Nov 12 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: In that case... let's put our heads together and strategize, yeah? - Thu Nov 12 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: A ways of to the side, whisperin so he can't hear. - Thu Nov 12 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Of course. - Thu Nov 12 05:13:10 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I am going to just stand here and calmly wait, then. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walks over towards Mitsunara and starts to whisper.* - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: So what do you have in mind? - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: A'right, so.. First thing is first. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I'm a Kenjutsu specialist, and my main deal is being /really/ fucking tough. Like, insanely tough. I take hits most often like nothing. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: What's your profession? - Thu Nov 12 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: I use taijutsu, but I have a lot of ninjutsu to support myself when needed. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: At the end of the day I just want to punch him in his grill. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Gotcha... - Thu Nov 12 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: So you fast? Cus I'm not. - Thu Nov 12 05:14:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: I am pretty quick.  Hehehe - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: How's this sound like a plan. He's mainly Ninjutsu, yeah? I'll get his attention and occupy him so you can get of some Jutsu on the side- take him from the sides while I have him distracted. - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: I'll keep his attention by being big and dangerous, and you run around and deal damage when you can. Solid? - Thu Nov 12 05:15:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) whispers: I will follow your lead Mitsu. - Thu Nov 12 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) whispers: Right.. - Thu Nov 12 05:16:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: Aight, so. - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: You ready for us? - Thu Nov 12 05:17:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled as Mitsu darted off towards Yan.  This was the first time he was getting the chance to work with anybody in a spar, so he was going to use this to get even stronger.  He didn't want to mess up the plan, but he wasn't the best at standing idly by.  So he simply just followed suit behind Mitsu, staying a decent distance away, ready to go on the attack at any given moment.* - Thu Nov 12 05:21:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was following closely in Mitsu's footsteps.  Then out of seemingly nowhere there were a bunch of Yan's all over the place.  One of these things tried to stab him from behind, but Hiroshi caught him out of the corner of his eye and quickly ducked under the clone/illusions/whatever da fuck it is attack.  He kept his focus on Mitsu, still trying to execute the plan that they had in action.  He wasn't sure if she was in any better shape then he was, but he was going to follow her blindly for now.  The moment she decided to go after one of the Yan's, Hiroshi turned on the jets and circled around behind Yan.  As He was focused on Mitsu, hopefully, Hiroshi would start his attack.

Hiroshi would throw a strong high kick aimed at the right ear on Yan's head.  This was more of a fake then anything, but if it hit that bitch was still going to hurt.  He would follow up with a swift sweeping kick aimed at his ankles to try and knock him off balance.  He would end with a final push kick that was meant to send him towards Mitsu so she could get some blows in.  "Your turn Mitsu."* - Thu Nov 12 05:53:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) and Mitu's plan seemed to have failed for the time being.  Yan was a tough cookie, he found a way to negate both attacks and effectively at that.  Before Hiroshi had a chance to perform his little combo, he started to lose his balance.  That damn Yan had spit out some mud and Hiroshi was in no position to really do much about it.  He tried to catch himself, but it didn't work.  He fell and rolled backwards, getting covered in mud.  He quickly collected himself and rose to a single knee.

"Damnit Yan. . . My clothes are ruined now. . ."  He would then quickly perform three handseals and then perform a clap to activate his jutsu.  A strong wind would blow from behind Hiro towards Yan. He doubted that he could really do much to him, he just wanted to get some of that mud that he had sprayed onto Yan so he would know the feeling of getting muddy clothes.

"Take that Yan. . Heheheheh"  He would think to himself.* - Thu Nov 12 06:22:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: ^^^^ - Thu Nov 12 06:39:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had acted on his own, letting his emotions cloud his judgment once again.  Something in fact, that Mari-Sensei had told him to work on.  He had gotten better at it, but there were still times when he had a lapse.  While he was trying to muddy up good ole Yan here he noticed that Yan was somehow lost.  He didn't know wha tthe hell was going on.  But, before he could figure it out, he was grabbed by his ankles and yanked down  

"O sh-"  Was all he had time to get out before he was just a head.  He sat there with a stupid look on his face, trying to peice all of this together somehow.  He was pretty much out of this as far as he could see it for now.* - Thu Nov 12 06:53:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: ..You utter troll. - Thu Nov 12 07:12:38 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile as she told him to get out of the ground.  Now that he had calmed down, he realized that he might actully be able to get out of this situation.  He closed his eyes and enveloped himself in his Doton chakra.  He then allowed himself to slip completely into the ground and move around freely.  His partner needed him.  He was hoping this would catch Yan off guard, so he resurfaced on the other side of him and attempted to aid Mitsu in her attacks with his own offense.  For now he just threw a solid right hook aimed at Yan's side.* - Thu Nov 12 07:22:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Akimora, Mitsunara(SephirothSage) says: -- I SAID GET OUT, NOT GO DEEPR! - Thu Nov 12 07:23:44 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Goodie~ - Thu Nov 12 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: Hmm.. - Thu Nov 12 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Rias(LionHunter) says: Who were notable people in the village - Thu Nov 12 07:45:55 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) says: *Groaned* Notable people?.. Let me think.. Notable in what way?.. - Thu Nov 12 07:46:46 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Tetsumi Jiki(Bloodline Killer X) thinks: Th-Oh yeah.. Kenshin.. But he fled the village.. Does that really count?.. - Thu Nov 12 07:47:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was successful in his attempt to inflict some sort of damage on Yan.  But, unfortunately he was not fast enough to stop Yan from hurting his partner in crime for now.  "Damn, to slow."  He would mutter to himself under his breath.  As he was cursing himself, he noticed that Mitsu was charging right back at Yan ready to attack again.  He was not as close to Yan as she was, but he was pretty confident in his ability to cover the distance.  He would run alongside Mitsu and nod his head.

"This is the most fun that I have had in a while."* - Thu Nov 12 07:48:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was  struck by a rush of water and fell back onto the sand.  The water from the attack hit him square in his chest and turned the sand beneath him into more mud.  As he started to stand and try to get himself together, he got a bit distracted by Mitsunara.  He had never really noticed until now, but Mitsu was actually a pretty curvy lady.  That was always his weakness, that hasn't changed.  He was stuck in awe for a second as he looked at her.

"Damn. . . She is-"  He was intterupted in his thought by her voice.  Now having a reason to try and impress he would smile.  "Whatever you say."  Even though he said this with the utmost confidence, he wasn't really sure how he was goign to do this at the moment.  There was still a clone up there, and he was sure that Yan and the clone were not just going to stand there as he came for them.  Either way, he decided to try a direct approach anyway.  He charged at the wall as fast as he could.  He was moving so fast that he had messed up his peripheral vision.  He could only see what was straight in front of him, which was Yan.  This speed came with the price of tunel viision.  He would actuvate his suimen and charge up the wall.  then he would try and throw a powerful jump kick aimed at Yan's chest.  Basically a bitch bersion of dynamic entry since I don't legit have the technique.* - Thu Nov 12 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: My nigga GG ova there doing his shit *nod* - Thu Nov 12 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: -omit- - Thu Nov 12 08:14:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was trying to be a good boy and listen to Mitsu.  But this was starting to become something that he felt like he shouldn't have done.  Maybe if he wasn't distracted he would have chosen a different way to go about thins, maybe not.  Either way, he was charging headfirst into a sticky ass net.  He tried to react as fast as he could.  But he was not necessarily great at the suiment technique and he was moving extremely fast.  He ran into the net and started to fall backwards.  He would hit the ground with a solid thud and start to squirm, trying to get out of this liquid.

"Uuggghhh.  What the hell is this stuff?  Why can't I move?  AGAIN?  Damnit I am stuck once again.  This time I don't have a way out either.  Sorry Mitsu I fucked up. . . Good luck."* - Thu Nov 12 08:23:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would slowly rise to his feet and look down at himself.

"Damn. . . My clothes. . . "* - Thu Nov 12 08:27:44 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Sorry guys...Heh. - Thu Nov 12 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: I had fun! - Thu Nov 12 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) starts to laugh and looks over at Mitsu.  He then quickly turns away and blushes slightly.

"O shit. . . I can't look at her right now."  He thinks to himself.* - Thu Nov 12 08:30:17 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: It's cool Yan. - Thu Nov 12 08:31:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Yan(Enigmatic_Subsistence) says: Well, I'm sure Hiroshi has a place, but you want to go clean up at my house Mitsunara? - Thu Nov 12 08:31:08 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) turned his head to the side slightly.

"Wonder why she looks so nervous?"  He thinks to himself.

"And who might you be miss?  I am Hiroshi nice to meet you."* - Thu Nov 12 19:12:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked at her kind of funny.  She sounded really nervous, but once again he was not the kind of guy to turn down anything from a female.  He started to speak slowly his voice also a little shaky.

"Uhh, s-sure.  What is it Rias?"  

"Keep yourself together Hiro. Damn.  You have to make sure nothing crazy happens."  He thinks to himself as he slowly approaches her.* - Thu Nov 12 19:23:05 2015

"But you really just dragged me here to give me a scroll?  I mean this is the first time I have ever spoken with you.  Why would you do all of this so fast?"* - Thu Nov 12 19:41:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) just stared at her.  He really didn't know what to say at the moment.  What she said sounded like he might need to be ready for just about anything.  But Hiro was never ready for everything.  Still, he went with his gut, which was usually a bad idea.

"S-Sure.  W-What do you n-need?"  He said, his voice shaking terribly from being extremely nervous.  He had planned to wave to Kuro, but now he couldn't even focus on the task at hand.

"Damnit. . . I am so damn weak. . "  He thinks to himself.* - Thu Nov 12 19:52:57 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right well you have the honors. - Thu Nov 12 23:31:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was ready for this spar.  He was actually rather excited.  The opportunity to fight someone like this didn't come along too often.  Plus, he really did find Bones's ability extremely interesting.  He wanted to see it in action for himself.  He watched on in awe as various bones sptouted forth from his opponents body.  "This is awesome!" He thinks to himself.  Then before he knew it, he was already being attacked.  He quickly jumped into action, jumping quickly to his left ot avoid the kick.  He then turned and looked at Shokutsu.  He started to run towards him but stoped after a single step.  He was planning on punching him, but there were bosed sticking out all over the place andn he wasn't trying to get himself cut up from his own attack.  Guess he had to try something else for the time being.

HIro would quickly perform a series of hand seals and quickly take in a breath.  HE woudl then exhale and send out a barage of bullets towards Bones.  3 in total.  Each Bullet would be aimed at a different location.  One directly at him, one slightly higher and aimed off to his left, and the other aimed slightly lower and to the right.  They were not flying side by side.  More of a line then together.  If any of them made contact it would just knock Bones over, nothing to serious.* - Thu Nov 12 23:57:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not totally surprised that he wasn't able to really do anything with his ninjutsu attack.  That wasn't his thing anyway. But the way that Bones handled it.  Man that was the reason that he wanted to spar Bones.  That was just what he was expecting out of him.  But before he knew it, he was back on the defensive.  This time he was getting attacked with a low kick.  But with the bones sticking out of Bones, Hiroshi had to be extremely careful about how he wanted to handle this.  Luckily there were not bones sticking out of his ankle. This would be used to Hiro's advantage.

As the low kick was coming, Hiroshi would quickly counter with his own kick.  This was not a kick aimed directly at Shokutsu, instead he aimed to kick up the foot that was being used to kick him.  The young shinobi was pretty confident in his taijutsu and this was goign to be the hardest thing he had ever done with it.  If he was able to kick up the foot, like he wanted to, then he woudl quickly grab Shokutsu's ankle.  He would then jump up, while holding on to the ankle, and perform a quick flip.  He would then use this flip to gain momentum and slam Shokutsu directly onto the ground.  He was hoping that this did some sort of significant damage.  Not anything lethal or long lasting, just something that could help Hiro win this spar.* - Fri Nov 13 00:18:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was pretty sure that Bones would get stuck in the ground.  What he didn't expect was that he would free himself with leg strength alone.  "Damn. . . That's impressive."  He would think to himself.  But while he was distracted with his own thought he was being attacked.  He realized this way to late to move, so he just put up his arms in an x shape and braced for impact.  He was struck on his arms and pushed back, his feet sliding along the sand.  He put his arms down, both of them turning red from the attack with light bruising.  He would get into a basic taijutsu stance with his feet staggered, left in front of right.  His fist clinched and in the same position as his feet.  He bounced back and forth on the balls of his feet and then extended his left hand forward.  He opened his hand, palm facing towards the sky.  Finally he curled his fingers twice prompting Bones to come.  Hiro was having a blast.* - Fri Nov 13 00:53:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not expectin a clone to be coming his way, but that was no big issue.  He made light work of the clone with a swift step to the right and a slam.  But as he was doing this, Bones would be sliding at him.  He was to preoccupied with the clone to do anything.  "Shit."  He would have his feet taken from under him.  He knew that falling on them clones was not a good idea.  So as soon as he was hit he would tuck into a flip and fall onto the ground, landing on 1 knee.  By this time he assumed that Shoku was alread ready for another attack.  So Hiro did just that.

"Damnit those bones are in the way. . . BUt they are so damn cool."  He thinks to himself.  He would quickly duplicate the same move that Shokutsu had done.  HE ran, full speed, to give him very little time.  HE tucked into a slide and attempted to take his feet from under him.  IF he was able to do that he would grab his ankle again whild sliding by.  HE would then turn and deliver a possible knockout shot right to Shokutsu's gut. (hoping there aint a bone there)* - Fri Nov 13 01:12:06 2015
