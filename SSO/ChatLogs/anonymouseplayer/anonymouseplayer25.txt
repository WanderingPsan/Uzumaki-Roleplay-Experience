He did not want to take it off right now, he needed the extra push in his training.  He quikly got into his stance as Momu approached at a good speed.  Momu was pretty fast.  A swift, sturdy punch came towards his chest, but he was not too worried for now.  The spar was just beginning, this was going to be fun.

All in one fluid motion, Hiro effortlessly knocked away the punch coming at his chest with his right hand.  Then, using the same hand he sent a swift backfist towards Momu's right rib cage.  This attack was only meant to cause some slight pain, nothing too serious, it was only a spar after all.* - Tue Dec  1 21:28:06 2015

This was the first time in a little while that he had had the chance to train with his sensei and he was excited.  Plus with the final part of the chuunins coming up, he really did need the training.  He removed the weights that he had on and placed them safely off to the side.  He did not want anything to happen to the shell that he had recieved.  He walked over to Paine and started to stretch a bit.  His body feeling a lot lighter then before.  This was the first time in a long time that he had taken off the weights. 

"Hmmm.  I feel light as a feather now.  Alright sensei.  These kicks are about to come in bunches.  I am sure they won't be a problem for you.  Anyway.  Here I come."

Smiling, he darted off towards her.  He was going with his usual combo of kicks for now.  In fact, Paine would recognize the kicks almost immediately.  He went with his usual right high kick aimed at her left cheek.  Followed by a swift spin and a swweping left kick.  Finally, with one final spin he threw a mighty push kick aimed right at her stomach.* - Wed Dec  2 01:25:20 2015
