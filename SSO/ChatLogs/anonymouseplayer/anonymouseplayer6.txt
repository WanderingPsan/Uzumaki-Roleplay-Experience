<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiles at her and nods his head.

"Sure, why not?  You haven't lost a step have you?  I can't even see your hands moving girl."

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Damn. . . Why did I agree to that?  I just can't say no to females can I? - Mon Oct 26 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Damn you Hiro. . . Damn you. - Mon Oct 26 04:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was totally ready for this shit, but he was simply not fast enough to do much of anything about it.  He was punched square in the face and before he could even let out a runt of pain he was chopped in the throat.  He fell to a knee and grabbed his throat, struggling to breath.  As he was on the ground his mind began to fill with thoughts.

"O shit. . . . This is bad. . . Can't breath at the moment. . . Damn she is as strong as ever."  HE thinks to himself.* - Mon Oct 26 04:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was in a pretty bad place at this point.  He was stuck flying through the air, pretty defenseless at this point.  He was slowly starting to get his breath back, but it was still a struggle.  For now he was just hoping for the best.* - Mon Oct 26 04:52:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was thrown by Sae.  He was flipping and spinning in the air.  He would then crash into the ground and slide into the wall.  He woul hit it with a loud crash and would fall to the ground.  He would struggle to his hands and knees and cough a few times.  Blood would come out of his mouth with each cough.  After the last cough he would spit out a wad of blood off to the side and wipe the blood from around his mouth.  He woudl slowly make his way to one knee and look up at Sae smiling.

"You are a strong as ever.  Hell you might actually be stronger. . Damn this hurts."* - Mon Oct 26 05:02:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: How about we mix this up with a bit of ninjutsu? - Mon Oct 26 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: N-No.  I am fine. .  - Mon Oct 26 05:03:21 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Saeza(Wynokx) says: You sure? I'm getting bored. - Mon Oct 26 05:04:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) laughs at her.

"I can see how this could be boring.  You know what let's do it.  But I promise you that I will be ready for you next time we do this Sae."  He says as he slowly rises to his feet.* - Mon Oct 26 05:17:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I have come to the conclusion that I just fucked up somehow. . . .  - Mon Oct 26 05:17:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) ,after being utter defeated by Saeza he went straight to his little training area and was ready to do some training.  After what just happened, he clearly needed to train.  So for now he would start to work on his ninjutsu.  In particular his air bullets.  He would call on his wind chakra and take a deep breath.  He would then send out a barrage of bullets towards the wall.

Hiroshi was still pretty upset.  He knew that he was not going to be able to accept this until he did some major training.  Saeza had wiped the floor with him and he wasn't pleased.  So he would send out another barrage of bullets towards the wall.  This was going to be one hell of a training session.

The young shinobi was starting to sweat a little, but he was rapidly gaining more control over this technique.  He always picked up things quickly and this was no different.  Still he had to put in the work if he wanted to accomplish anything.  So he sent out another flurry of bullets.

As he was training his mind started to wander.  " I wonder who Bry's student is?  I wonder why he wanted me to meet them?  O well, I will ask him the next time I see him.  For now, training."  He thought as he shot out some bullets of air.

Hiroshi shot out one last flurry of bullets and then sat down.  He kept replaying his defeat over and over again.  This was clearly a big blow to his ego.* - Mon Oct 26 05:34:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) rose to his feet with a determined glare on his face.  He knew that if he wanted to get stronger this was no time to be sitting down takin a break.  That lazy spell that he had had, had had a major affect on his progress.  Just seeing how far Sae had left him in the dust, he knew that he had no time to dilly dally.  So he would send out yet another flurry of bullets at the wall.

This poor wall was starting to look like a shell of its former self  The bullets were now starting to leave an impring in the wall.  He still was not strong enough to crush the wall, but he didn't want to do that anyway.  He was proud of his progress, but knew that he had a ways to go still.  So you guessed it, he shot some more bullets.

The tan, blonde headed, Sunagakure shinobi continued to train.  He wanted to get this down as fast as he could so that he could show Mari-Sensei.  I'm sure that she would be proud of his progress already.  But if he was able to master it, she would be thrilled.  So he gathered his chakra and ran through the seals.  Then sent out 3 bullets of air at the wall again.  The bullets would hit the wall and peices of rock would fly from the wall.  He would wipe his brow and get ready to continue.

This was really turning out to be a successful training session.  With each use of the jutsu, he was starting to really feel like he was gaining more control over it.  He was progressing at a rate that surprised even himself.  This was usually how things went with him though.  This was just what he got used too.  So he shot some more bullets.  It wasn't like they were going to shoot themselves.

He was starting to get a little tired and decided to take a short break.  But not after sending out another barrage of bullets.  They would smack the wall and he would hop onto a nearby rock to relax.  He layed back and looked up at the clouds.* - Mon Oct 26 05:47:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was involved in the greatest training of his life.  He had to be if he wanted to catch Sae.  That was his only goeal for right now.  He at least wanted to be able to pose some kind of challenge to her.  This whole getting his ass whipped thing was not something that he was going to let keep happeneing to him.  So you know what he was going to do.  So he did it.

HIroshi was almost at the point where he felt like he was a master of this jutsu.  He was o so close, yet so far away.  So he continued to push himself past his limits.  He broke through the dams of his limts with the waters of his determination.  And the waters at this moment, was wind, but who cares about that.  That wall did cause it was getting hit by these waters.

This jutsu was almost perfect.  At least as perfect as Hiroshi could get it.  The only way it could happen was through the repeated use of this jutsu.  This was going to be a jutsu that he could use whenever, wherever, however he wanted too.  So he shot some more bullets.

He gathered his chakra and took a deep breath.  He ran through some hand seals and shot out some bullets.  This was starting to get extremely easy to him.  Which was a good thing.  He could pull this out whenever he wanted too and  enjoyed every minute of it.

Did this jutsu one last time to see if he could get it to where he wanted.  He would then pop a squat on the rock and chill out again.  Break time.* - Mon Oct 26 06:03:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not where he wanted to be.  So back to the drawing board it was.  He would gather his chakra and run through the seals.  He would then send out a very controlled barrage of bullets.  He didn't have complete mastery over them just yet.  But he did at least have a very high understanding and control over the jutsu.  This was the start of a new era in the life of Hiroshi.

This 13 year old kid was going in right now.  He was training like never before.  This was the most efficient training sessino that he had had in quire some time.  This was probaly the most efficient one since his academy days.  Either way he show some more bullets at the wall.  You know it.

This was getting really cose to being a perfected jutsu.  He knew that it was only a few things missiong from the jutsu before he would be doing it like Mari-Sensei.  Or at least close to what Mari-Sensei was doing.  Just had to keep on firing.  So fire away he did.

This was starting to really get annoying to HIroshi.  He didn't know what he was missiog from this jutsu, but he knew it was something.  Guess he had to just keep on training.  So he shot some more bullets.

This was the last barrage for a while.  So he shot them and then he sat down.  He had been working hard.  He deserved a little break.* - Mon Oct 26 06:13:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had finally done it.  He had a mastery of his air bullets finally.  Now it was back to his good ole Hide like a mole jutsu.  He woudl put his hands together into a single seal.  He would then slip into the earth and swim around underground.  He would pop up and look around.  This jutsu always made him happy.

This jutsu was so useful for his survival.  He was alway able to escape things simply because he could go under them.  So the mastery of this jutsu was going to be essential to his development as a shinobi.  So he would put his hands together into a single seal and slip into the ground.  He popped back up and dusted himself off.

Hiroshi put his hands together into a single seal and slip into the ground.  He was not going to stay down there long.  I mean it wasn't like he was going to stay up above the grond ong anyway.  So he got ready to go again.  This was like going to the pull.

HIroshi was laying on the ground and wanted to see if he could do the jutsu this way.  He put his hands together into a single seal and coated himself in his doton chakra.  He would then slip into the earth onto his back.  HE was actually pretty happy it worked.  But he came right back up in the same position.

He slipped into the ground one last time and popped up.  He had used a lot of chakra and was getting tired.  So he took a break.* - Mon Oct 26 06:34:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was getting better with each use of this jutsu.  He still had a ways to go but every step forward was a step in the right direction.  The only way to truly get better at it, was to keep on doing it.  So he dipped into his little earthly swimming pool and came back out.  This training was really simple after all.

This was one of the easier jutsu that Hiroshi had in his arsonel.  This jutsu only needed a isingle seal and he would then slip into the ground.  That was the only thing this jutsu did, but it was sooooo useful.  So he slipped into the ground.  He swam around and then popped out.  This was so efficient.

Hiroshi could not believe that he was still training this jutsu.  This was probably his second favorite jutsu he had at this point.  Well maybe the third.  Either way he put his hands together and slipped into the ground.  He swam around like a land fish for a while and would then pop up.  This was starting to really get tedious.

He started to wonder how many times he had to do this before he felt like he was a master of this technique.  It could take forever, it could be the next one.  Only one way to find out.  So he dipped in and out real fast.  This was an amazingly boring jutsu to train.  O well, he has to do it sometime.

Hiroshi yawned as he slipped into the ground again.  He probably should be trying to do two jutsu at once.  But if he did that he could fuck up to the point where he might actually die.  So he just layed there on the ground and relaxed.* - Mon Oct 26 06:49:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) awoke in his little training area.  He still had some things that he wanted to get better at.  So you know what he was going to do.  He put his hands together into a single seal and envelped himself in his doton chakra.  He would then slip into the ground and swim around for a little while.  He enjoyed his sand pool.  After a while he would pop up and get ready to try it again.

The young shinobi put his hands together into the only seal that he needed for the jutsu.  This activated the jutsu and he slipped into the earth's cool surface.  He tried to go down as far as he could.  He started to feel a change in the temperature after a while and decieded that he had been down there long enough.  So he made a U'ie and went back to the surface.  He sat down on the ground and started to let his mind wander.

Was sitting on the ground thinking.  "Hmm. . . I wonder what woul happen if I went all the way to the center of the earth?  I mean I know it is extremely hot there.   As a matter of fact I am pretty sre that it is molten rock there.  Yea, totally not going to be the one that tests out my theory.  I am still going under though."  So he put his hands together into the required seal and slipped into the ground and immediately resurfaced.

HIroshi wanted to test his jutsus speed.  He wanted to know just how fast he could go under and come back up.  The faster that he could do that the better it will be for him.  He slipped into the ground and came right back up.  He did it pretty quickly, but it could be a lot faster.  This just showed his inexperience with this technique.  Training training ttraining.  Well damn let's get it going.

He was starting to get a little winded, but he was still playing catch up.  Plus he had heard from Trilliam that he had missed the chuunin exams.  That was not good.  He always chose the worst times to disappear.  He couldn't blame nybody but himself.  With that being said he pushed through his fatigue and dipped into the ground once again.  This was something he had to get under control.

Hiroshi resurfaced and wiped the sweat from his forhead.  He was starting to run low on chakra.  He had a lot of it, but it wasn't an infinite amount.  Still he had a few more uses in him before he knew that his body would make him stop.  And that was when he was going to stop, not a minute before.  So he used the jutsu one again.  He resurfaced and bent over, placing his hands on his knees.  He would force himself to stand up straight and get ready to do it one more time.

Hiroshi wiped his face again and looked up at the sun.  It was beaming down, but it wasn't really all that hot.  "Nice day for this. . . Ok I only hve one more in moe for a while.  Better make it a good one."  He would say as he put his hands together into a single seal and slipp into the earth.  He would resurface and lean back against the wall.  HE slid down to hsi but and took a well deserved break.* - Mon Oct 26 19:17:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had taken a long enough break.  He was still playing catchup so long breaks were not a luxury that he could afford at the moment.  At least with all of this training he was starting to really get control over some of his ninjutsu.  That was the point of this training session.  So he rose to his feet and dusted himself off.  He ran his hand throuh his blue hair and smiled.  He was acutally having fun.  He collected himself and put his hands together into a single seal.  He would slip into the ground and then pop up.  The speed at which he was able to do this was imporving.  Almost to the point where he was surprising his damn self.  Either way, that was a good thing.

Putting his hands into that same seal he had gotten so accustumed to doing, Hiroshi coated himself in Doton chakra.  He woudl slip into the ground and start to throw a simple combination.  He wasn't planning on being in a fist fight underground. but you never know what you wold see in the shinobi world.  He ended with a mighty uppercut tht woudl drive him out of the ground and into the air.  He would land on his feet and continue to train.

Things were pretty slow here in Sunagakure for the moment.  At least to Hiroshi's knowlege it was.  So he just stayed in his little training area and kept on hammering away at this jutsu.  He put his hands together into a seal and slipped into the ground.  He popped back up and got ready to go.

This was starting to get on Hiroshi's nerves a bit.  He felt like he had hit a wall in his development.  Maybe he was just being impatient.  Maybe he wasn't.  Either way he was gettting a bit irritated.  Just as he was about to cuss himself out he remembered the reason he was here.  He stood there for a second, stonefaced.  He would then slip into the ground and pop up.  Things had to change and now.  

Hiroshi was starting to tire only slightly, only slightly.  He knew he couldn't do this forever, but he could damn sure keep this up for a while.  So he smiled and tried something a bit different.  He ran up onto the rock he always sat on and leapt off of it into a swan dive.  As he was falling he activated his jutsu and dove into the ground as if he were diving into a pool of water.  He laughed as he entered the earth, that was the most fun he had had since he started training this particular jutsu.  He got himself together and resurfaced.  he was going to do that again.

Standing on the rock, the wind blowing through his spikey blue hair.  He outstretched his arms as far as he could to each side.  He would then jump into the air performing several frontflips.  As he was flipping he put his hands together into a single seal and encased his body in Doton chakra.  He would enter the earth in a  simple dive.  He resurfaced and decied to take a break.  This was getting close to being what he wanted it to be.* - Mon Oct 26 19:54:14 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile as he saw the shell.  It looked good and he couldn't wait to try it on.  He needed the training.

"Thanks!  It looks great.  So can I put it on?"* - Mon Oct 26 20:36:03 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Sanoke(Gamuhz2) says: Go for it. - Mon Oct 26 20:45:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) tries to pick up the shell without using all of his strength at first.  The shell doesn't even budge.  He looked down at it flabbergasted.  "Damn. . . This is going to be tough."  He would take a step back and crack his knuckles.  Then he walked back to the shell and squated down with his hands underneath of it.  With everything that he had he lifted up, picking the shell up and put it on.  From that point it tooke everything he had not to fall over backwards.

"T-Thanks. . . This thing it heavy as shit Sanoke. It is going to be great for some training."  He says as sweat starts to pour down his face.* - Mon Oct 26 20:48:51 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) started to shake his head no as the water and fan came his way.  He wasn't expecting them so reacted a bit late and barely caught them.  As he caught them he lost his balance and toppled backwards.  He was stuck on his back like a turtle for real.  Accepted his fate for the time being and gave Sanoke a thumbs up. 

"Nah. . . I'll be fine.  Thanks.  Can you help me up though?"  He says as he quickly changed the thumbs up into an open hand calling for a little help.* - Mon Oct 26 21:00:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) got a look of complete shock on his face.  This was a lot of imformation to take in all at once.  Upone hearing that she was raped he instantly became furious.  Then to make things worse he heard that his dear friend had done some terrible things of her own.  

". . . Ok. . . Ok. . O-  Where is Susumu?  I have something I need to discuss with him."* - Tue Oct 27 01:50:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was actually kind of glad to hear it.  That was what he was going to try and do anyway.

"Good. . . But Damnit. . . I should have been there to help her.  That bastard Raped her."  As he spoke he started to shake from anger.  He had never felt this way before and didn't know how to deal with it.   He continued to speak as tears slowly started to fill his eyes.

"I-. . Shit. . How could. . "  He staightened up real fast and wiped away the tears.  "Mari-Sensei. . I need to get stronger. . . Help me.  Please."* - Tue Oct 27 01:53:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled and nodded his head.

"I am not going to lie. . . That is a lot easier said then done.  Forsaking my anger is going to be difficult after something like this.  Still, I will do my best.

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Thanks for answering all my questions. - Tue Oct 27 02:20:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Marrisa(Roxinea) says: Your welcome - Tue Oct 27 02:26:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would walk up to his personal little training spot after talking to Mari-Sensei.  He had learned quite a few things that he didn't know before hand that had really rubbed him the wrong way.  But he told Mari that he would learn to control his anger.  As well as get stronger on his own, so that was what he was going to do.  For now he was going to work on his Mud Sihouette jutsu.  He used this one occasionally, but not too often.  Maybe if he got better with it he would use it more.  So lets put it to the test.  He would quickly perform the seals and spit ou a river of mud.  The mud would slap the rocks in front of him and splatter all over the place.  He would be hit by a few of the splatter but he didn't really care.  It was only mud at this point.

HIroshi would start to gather his chakra inside of himself.  He woudl take a quick breath and throw together a tiger seal.  He would then spit out another river of mud.  The river would flow to the base of the mountain and start to spread out there.  He looked at the wall and was not really too pleased with what he just did.  This wasn't a very difficult technique, but he was not going it nearly as efficiently as he wanted to.  So he got ready to do it again.

He stood there beside the cactus training his ass off.  It was a nice day with a slight breeze.  The village hidden in the sand was relatively peaceful for the time being.  This was the perfect time for HIroshi to work on some of his ninjutsu.  HE would rather just worry about his taijutsu, but he still needed to be able to use his ninjutsu as he needed.  So he put up a single Tiger! seal and spit out a river of mud.  Dirty.

The wall was covered in mud at this point.  This did not concerned Hiroshi in the slightest.  I mean dirt on dirt was no big deal.  Plus this wall was Hiroshi's punching bag.  He needed to cover up all of the spots he made when he was training his air bullets technique.  With that in mind he show off come more mud, but this time at the locations on the wall that needed to most hiding.

Taking a deep breath, Hiroshi shot out some more mud and then sat down.  I was break time.  He couldn't just train forever.* - Tue Oct 27 02:48:06 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) awoke from his long slumber.  He had fallen asleep while training and didn't even feel himself getting too sleepy.  Either way, he had fallen asleep and still had some training to do.  So he slowly rose to his feet and dusted himself off.  He would then put his hands into a single Tiger! seal.  Then he would take a deep breath and spit out a river of mud.  The md would slide across the ground and eventually hit the wall in front of him.  He would then continue to train.

Spitting mud was not really the most interesting thing in the world.  It probably wasn't the most deadly thing either.  But used by a master this jutsu could potentially be very deadly.  So he spit out some more mud, hoping he could increase the amount that he spit out with each use of this jutsu.

The young shinobi had to work to remember his nindo.  Which was the same as hsi Sensei's.  To protect this village and the ones that he loved.  The only way he would be able to protect the people is if he could protect his damn self.  The only way to protect his damn self was to get stronger.  The only way to get stronger was to train.  Right now that training was his Mud Sihouette jutsu.  So he put his hands together into the Tiger! seal that was needed and took a quick breath.  He would then spit out a river of mud.  It was slightly bigger then the last river, but still not very impressive.  So he continued to train.

Hiroshi was still not where he thought he could be with thi jutsu.  If only he was a master of the Earth change in chakra nature.  He wasn't so he had to compensate with other things.  Like pure grit and determination.  He had that, so he fired off another river of mud.  He would then jump into the mud and flop around.  He enjoyed the mud like he was a little piggy.

He had used the jutsu quite a bit and chakra wasn't something that he could just use forever continuously.  So he used the jutsu one more time and took a short break.  This was not going to be a long break, just long enough for him to recover.* - Tue Oct 27 06:09:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) 's short break was over.  It was time for him to start training once again.  He was still working on the same jutsu.  This was not one that Mari-Sensei had taught him.  This was one that his buddy Sanoke had showed him.  Speaking of Sanoke he had just gotten a shell from him, but that was something for another time.  For now he would work on his ninjutsu.  He would put up the Tiger! seal and would spit out a river of mud.  The mud would slide on the ground until it hit the wall He would watch it as it slid quickly along the ground.  He was getting better.

Things were starting to pick up with his training.  He seemed to be getting this jutsu even faster then the other ones that he had woked on.  This was probably due to the fact that this jutsu was a lot easier.  He still had work to do, so he fired off another shot of the mud and continued training.

Hiroshi was enjoying this nice relaxing day here in the Sand village.  He was stil playing catch up but training was something that he actually enjoyed.  Hell if he didn't he wouldn't survive as a shinobi.  So he would shoot off another river of mud and then continue training.

This was a rather basic jutsu.  So in probably a short amount of time, Hiro would have this thing down pact.  When he did maybe he could use this jutsu more effectively.  If he could do that it would help a lot of people.  So he shot out the river of mud that he was getting so used to.

was about to take another break.  But first he sent out some more mud.  He then hopped on his favorite rock and looked up into the sky.  He let his mind wander as he recovered.* - Tue Oct 27 06:30:49 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had taken a longer break then he thought that he was.  He somehow got distrated in the clouds.  So once agian he was playing catchup as fat as he could.  He had to get this thing mastered, I mean it was taking too long.  So he shot out that good ole river of mud and went on with the training.

He was almost there.  Almost to the point where he was going to be able to say that he had mastered the jutsu.  He just had to use it a few more times.  So use it he did.  This was what he was planning on doing for a while anyway.* - Tue Oct 27 06:53:52 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had finally gotten that river of mud under wraps.  Now he was going to make some clones.  This was a technique that he had started to utilize in battle quite often.  There were strength in numbers.  So he put his hands together into a seal and made 3 clons.  The three clones would come and surround Hiroshi.  They would all give him a high five and go on about their business.

HIroshi was going to have some fun with his clones.  He knew that this would take a whole lot of clones.  A whooole lot.  But he wass goign to try and spell his last name with his clones.  He already had three out there and they started to form the H.  He made three more and they lined up diretly across from the other three.  The H was only mission one thing now.

With the H being near compleshion he made three more clones.  This seemed to be the limit on the amount of clones that he could make at on time.  So one of them would go and complete the H.  The next two would start to form the I.  They would line up to the right of the H.  Only a few parts of it left.

Three more clones were made.  Two would go and complete the I.  The one that was left would start to make the hardest letter of the bunch, D.  This was probably going to take the most clones to make.  Time to start.

He made three more clones and they joined the lone clone making the D.  The four of them made the stem for the D.  At this point all of the clones were just relaxing in place.

Hiroshi made three more clones and they would make the circle on the D.  Now the clones formed the word HID.  There was only two letters left now.  This was clearly going to be something that Hiroshi was proud of.

E was not too hard of a letter.  So he made three clones and they started to form the semi-circle for the E.  This entire thing was almost done.  Hiroshi looked at his progress and started to think.  "Hmm. This is starting to come together.  I need a few more on the E though.  Let's get too it."

Hiroshi made three more clones and they completed the E.  This was the second to last letter in his last name.  Only one more letter to go.  But this was going to need 6 clones.  

Hiroshi continued his quest to spell his last name.  He needed to make some clones, so make them is what he did.  There was HIDE and half of an O.  There were a hell of a lot of clones out here right now.

Hiroshi made the last three clones and stood there admiring his work.  He had done it.  This was not easy, but he did it.  That was some grit and determination right there.* - Tue Oct 27 08:13:13 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) awoke from his slumber and prepared to train once more.  Last time he spelled his last name, this time, he might go all out and try to spell his first name.  He sat there contemplating the idea of this.  Thinking how many clones it might take, how much chakra it might take, this was proably going to be way harder then spelling Hideo.  So he started by aking three clones just as he did last time.  They would line up and start to form one end of the letter H.

The clones stood there goofing off like any normal 13 year old Genius.  Hiroshi didn't mind this too much, since he things that they were doing were things that he did on a regular basis.  So he just smiled at them, thinking it was funny.  He put his hans together and three more clones came out of the earth.  They would join the three and form both handles on the letter H.  Now all that leter needed wa the middle handle like thingy and it was on to the I.

Hiroshi made thee more clones, since that seemed to be his limit at one time for now, and they would separate for the first time.  ONe of them would go and complete the H.  The other rwo went on to start to form the I.  Hiroshi then started to wonder if he could get away with having a really short I and just moving on.  "Only one way to find out."

Three more mud clones were made.  They walked by the tiny I members, highfiving all the way to the top.  They would then form the dot of the I and it actually looked alright.  HIroshi nodded in acceptance of this.  "Ok. . ok. . This is coming together."

"Now I have HI.  I just need Roshi.   Damn, this is going to take a while.  But it will help me train thes clones.  If we can all get on the same page things would get done so efficiently.  Time for some more."  He stated as he quickly made three more clones.  They began to form the stem on the R, just to the right of the I.  "Moving on"

Things were going smoothly for now.  He only neede 2 more clones for the R then it was on to the O.  Sohe made the clones needed and the two went over to the R.  The single clone for the O stood beside Hiroshi, watching just what was going on.

Poof, three more clones.  They were all excited to see each other.  I mean Hiroshi did enjoy seein himself.  They woudl quickly go form the O.  It looked more like a diamond, but who cares.  This shit was looking good.

Now on to the s.  This was oin to be a tricky letter.  The amount of clones it would take for this letter alone would probably be more of the issue then anything else.  Knowing this, Hiroshi wiped his slightly shiny forehead and put his hands together to form three more clones.  They would then start to form the first arch at the bottom of the letter.  That part looked alright for right now.  "*sigh*  Ok. . "

All of the clones at this point were sitting down, just relaxing.  This was probably for the best because Hiroshi was really focused on making this and wasn't paying too much atention to what they were doing.  He just wanted them to be in position.  Anyway, he made three more clones and the would start to turn the corner and make the second part of the S.  You know the part that goes back the way it started and then starts to go in the direction it started going in in the first damn place.  S is a confusing ass letter.

Three more clones were made and they completed the dreaded S.  Hiroshi smiled and gave all of them a thumbs up.  They all returned the thumbs up with a thumb of their own.  "Ok just another Hi and I am done.

The little H's stem would be formed with three clones from Hiroshi.  This letter seemed like it was going to be a breeze compared to that damn S.  The clones joined the others in their relaxing.

The H was completed with thi addition of three more clones.  Now that little I was all that was needed and Hiroshi would be done.  He stood there looking at what he did.  He had never seen this many of himself in one place.  ". . . . Damn. . . This feels wierd. So many me's.  I'm not sre how I feel about this."

The last little I would rrequire six clones.  But since little Hiro could only make three at a time it would require two uses.  He was starting to really feel the drain of doing this and two uses was probably all he had left anyway.  He made three and started to pant a little.  They would start to form the line and the dot.  ONly three more.

"So close. . . Gotta do this one last time."  He would say as he made three more clones and Hiroshi was completed.  He smiled and quicly got rid of all of them.  he then fell to his back, exhausted.  That was a lot of work.* - Tue Oct 27 17:11:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had taken an extended break from his training.  He had earned it though.  Spelling his long ass first name with his clones was not an easy task.  That really took a lot out of him.  Still he rose to his feet, slowly, and stared to make some more clones.  He put his hands together into a single seal and produced three more clones.  They would all come out and just relax.  Hiro didn't want to do all the stuff he just did again.

He decided to watch his clones fight to see if he could pick up on any flaws in his Taijutsu himself.  So he made three clones and they started going at it.  it was a three on three taijutsu contest.  The first set each ran at heach other and were throwing jabs left and right.  Both of them were effortlessly knocking their fists away as they came.

The next set of clones were both engaged in some kickboxing.  There were kicks coming from all angles.  They wer jumping around and over one another so fast that Hiro was pretty impressed with their athleticism.  He thren remembered that they came from him and he felt a sense of pride that didn't last too long, but it was there.

The final set of clones were doing a mix of punching and kicking.  Some of the punches wer being met with kicks and the other way around.  They were all fighting hard and Hiro was picking up some good information on his own Taijutsu.  After a while of watching he let them stop and poofed them away.  " I have some work to do."* - Tue Oct 27 17:41:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) found out that his taijutsu was not wher he wanted it too be.  But that was not his focus for now.  Mai-Sensei sad that she would send him to someone that could help him out with that.  He believed in her more then he believed in himself.  So for now he would just focus on what he could help himself with.  He put his hands together and made three clones.  Then he woud instruct all of them to come at him, trying to hit him.  H e needed to work on his reflexes.

The first clone came at Hiroshi with a simple one two combination at first.  He skillfully knocked both of the punches away with each hand and all in one motion threw an elbo towards the clones face.  The clone would be knocked back and disappear.  The other two would nod, taking in the inormation that the first had gathered.  Next up was round two.

The second clone came at Hiroshi a little harder.  Throwing a flurry of punches at Hiroshi.  Hiroshi dodged the first few, but was not able to get aay from a powerful hook that kncocked him onto his but.  He didn't just accept it though.  As he was falling he placed his hands on the ground and then used them to shoot himself back up at the clone.  Aiming a solid kick right to its face.  The clone was not ready and would be passed through, destroyed.

The final clone would come at Hiroshi before h was completely on the ground.  Throwing a stiff elbow into his gut.  Hiro woudl crash to the ground and grab his stomach.  He opened his eyes just in time to see a foot coming towards the same exact spot.  He caught the foot with both hands and tried to flip the clone over head.  The clone hit the ground facefirst and disappeared.  Hiroshi sat there panting.  "I think my clone just tried to end me. . . "* - Tue Oct 27 17:50:56 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had finally gotten his clones straight and pretty much use them however he saw fit.  Now it was time to work on some of the things that Mari-Sensei had took the time to teach him  This was a rather simple jutsu compared to the last one that he worked on.  It formed some small tornadoes that could be enhanced by flames.  Too bad Hiro couldn't use flames, but that was a problem for another day.  Like most of his techniques so far, this jutsu only required one seal.  The Ram! seal.  He locked it in and called forth his wind natured chakra.  Then by releasing his chakra and activating the jutsu.  Several small tornadoes would form.  Nothing too agressive at this point, he wasn't too good at this just yet.

Hiroshi looked on as the small tornadoes cause the sand to rise just a bit.  He clearly had some work to do if he wanted this to be used in battle.  A slight breeze ain't gonna hurt nobody.  So he stopped the jutsu and activated it once more.  Three tornadoes surrounded him and picked up sand.  The sand would paint the tornadoes a sligh brown as they spun around.  Hiroshi enjoyed the display, but knew that it coud still be stronger.

This was not a difficult jutsu to understand.  So Hiro knew that in due time he would be able to call upon this in battle.  He just had to work on it.  Simple as that.  You get out what you put in.  So if he put in a lot of work on this jutsu, he could easily get out a lot of success.  Wind was something that could help him in his battles, a lot.  So he stopped the tornadoes flying around him and the sand fell back into place.  He gathered his chakra, locked int eh Ram! seal, and made some more.  Each time the tornadoes got slightly stronger.  They would pick up a bit more sand and Hiro was starting to feel the breeze from the tornadoes.  Something that he could not say at first.

Sweat started to slowly trickle down the side of his face.  He wasn't tired or anything and had plenty of chakra.  But shit like this always made him a little sweaty.  That was something he had gotten used to.  He was clearly goign to go jump in a lake or something and take a nice relaxing bath.  But until then he had to do some more training.  So he stopped the jutsu and did it again.  The tornadoes once again started to swirl around him.  This time it blew his hair all over the place.  This was a step in the right direction.  HIro stopped the jutsu and continued on training.

"Ok. . These tornadoes seem to be getting stronger with each use.  I wonder how strong everybody elses Divine Wind Jutsu is?  I know that mine isn't the best.  But I wonder if it might actually be the worst?  Fuck that shit."  He would say as he would quickly activate the jutsu again.  Putting more effort into this one then any of the last ones.  He refused to be the weakest.  He needed to be strong for certain reasons.  Plus he was not going to disappoint his sensei.  That was one thing that he was not ever going to let happen if he had any control over it.  He has all of the control for now.  So he expects himself to be one of her star pupils.  he wouldn't accept anything less then that.

The wind swirled around him.  Picing up sand and some of the unsuspecting beetles that just so happened to be crawling by.  Hiroshi watched as the tornadoes grew stronger and stronger.  HIs clothes were actually being blown all over the place.  He stopped the jutsu and wiped his forehead.  He was staarting to get slighly winded now.  But he had no time to rest.  He had to get these jutsu under his belt before Mari got back.  That was his goal.  If it was realistic or not he honestly didn't know.  But he was going to try it anyway.  So he made some more sandy tornadoes and watched as he continued to make progress.

Hiroshi had been at this for a while now and decded to take a break.  so he stopped the jutsu and made some more tornadoes really quick.  These were pretty much bitch tornadoes, but he did it.  Then he layed on the rocks and let the breeze blow as he took his well deserved break.* - Tue Oct 27 18:15:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sat up and stopped the tornadoes from swirling around him.  HIs break was over so he needed the breeze no more.  He jumped off of the rock and stretched a bit.  This was going to be another long training spell.  He still had so many things to work on, but time was not something he would always have.  So now was probaly the best time to train.  He loked in the Ram! seal and gathered his chakra quickly.  He would then unleash the jutsu and send out a trio of tornadoes around himself.  This was the strongest bunch of tornadoes that he had produced this entire time.  He nodded his head upon the activation and watched to see what they did before he stopped the jutsu.

Watching the tornadoes spin around him, Hiroshi tried to pick up the positives and negatives of this jutsu.  As far as he could tell, this jutsu was not necessarily strong enough to serve as a sheild for him.  But it was damn sure something that could slow things down, depending on where they are thrown from.  Being a wind technique, it could help some of his Katon natured allies also.  This was probaly a jutsu best used for support more than anything else.  Still if it was not up to par with everyone elses it would be useless.  So he cut it off, put his hands into the seal, and activated it again.

HIroshi was making some impressive progress.  He was proud of himself, but didn't show it.  Like he could trick himself or something.  He was the only one there in his little trining spot.  At least the only person that he knew of.  So trying to hide his emotions was probably pretty stupid.  But he thought that if he could learn to control all of his emotions, then the overcoming anger thing was not going to be all that hard.  He refocused after letting his mind goo off to far and cut off the jutsu.  He would then activate it again.  The tornadoes swirled around him ripping up some of the few plants that were there.  Hiroshi stopped and looked at the dying plants on the ground.  "Oops. . . Didn't mean to do that."

Hiroshi picked up the plants and planted them off to the side where he felt like they would be safe.  He didn't want to kill the few plants that were in this desolate land.  That would be terrible.   After replanting the plants, he went back to his spot and conitinued with his training.  He took a deep breath and calmed himself.  Then started to gather his chakra.  Performing the seal required, he unleased the jtusu once more.  

This was going to be the last time he did this for a while.  He had pushed himself maybe a littel too hard and could barley stand.  He cut the jutsu off and leaned against the rock behind him.  He put his hand up and did it again.  It came out but it cut off instantly.  He didn't have the chakra.  "Heh. . That's my limit"  He said as he slid down the rock to his but.  He then cloesed his eyes and started to slumber.* - Tue Oct 27 18:27:37 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) awoke from his slumber still in his training area.  He had been here for a while training everything that he could as fast as he could.  He still didn't know when his other training would start, so he made sur that he used all of this time to train on his own.  He started to gather his chakra and put his hands together into a single Ram! seal.  He then released his chakra and activated his jutsu.  A trio of mildly powerful tornadoes would start to swirl around him.  The sand would fill up the tornadoes and paint them a simple brown color.  They would continue to swirl until he decided to stop it.  For now he would let it go.

The tornadoes would be stopped by HIroshi and the sand would start to to fall back into place.  The tornadoes were starting to increase in power and Hiroshi was having a hard tim ekeeping the sand from blowing all in his face.  That is a good thing, but he didn't like the sandd all up in his grill.  But for now, he would use the jutsu again.  The sand would start to blow around again.

Hiroshi closed his eyes as sand started to hit him in his face.  Not wads and wads, but singular grains that actually stung slightly as they hit.  He would stop the jutsu and open his eyes.  He pulled out a sinle towel that was in his infinite pouch and wiped his face.  The towel was turned completely brown from the amount of dirt that was on his face  "Hmm this wind is dirry."

"All this dirt is kind of annoying.  But this is my home so I just have to eal with it.  It's not like I am going anywhere anyway.  Enough thinking, I need to go back to my training."  Then quickly he would put up the seal required.  This would cause the jutsu to activate and then he would be surrounded by towers of wind.

He had been at this for a while so he stopped the jutsu and started it and stopped it.  He wasn't too worried about this jutsu anymore.  He was really starting to get a solid grasp of it.  He still wondered what everyonelses was like.* - Tue Oct 27 21:19:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was done with those tornadoes finally.  Now it was on to something that he thought was pretty neat.  If he got this jutsu together he would be able to control some of his weapons without even touching them.  He could infuse this into his taijutsu.  Just imagine the things that this brain of his could think of.  O well it was no point thinking about it until he could do it.  So he pulled out a single shuriken and started to try it.  He tossed it up into the air and formed a single seal.  The shuriken started to spin around him, suspeneded in the air for a while as he held the seal.  But, due to his inexperience he wasn't able to keep it going very long and the shuriken fell to the ground beside him.  He looked at it and picked it up.  "Let's try this again."

Hiroshi tossed the shuriken up into the air once again.  He quickly put up the seal and tried to make the shuriken continue to rotate around him  He was able to start it once again and hold it out for a while.  He dropped the seal to see if he could at least keep it up while he was not holding it.  He couldn't the shuriken would fall to the ground once again.  He woul dlook at it with slight disappointment in his eyes.  He quickly sucked it up and picked the shuriken back up.

Until he could handle one shuriken, it was no way that he would be able to do what he wanted with this jutsu.  If he was able to command 10, 20, maybe even 30 shurikens and or other weapons.  This could really be something for his opponents to deal with.  The thought of this excited Hiro and he quickly tried to do this technique once again.  He threw up the shuriken and put up the seal.  He released the seal, but continued to concentrate.  At first the shurkien started to slow down and fall to the ground.  But by increasing his concentration he was able to at least keep it suspended for now.  That was a step in the right direction.  He woult the try to move into his fighting stance.  Once he wa in it the suriken fell.  He was not able to do all that just yet.  But he was going to get there.

Once again Hiro had to pick up the shuriken.  If he could get this down then he could move on to trying to control two of them. But for now one seemed like it wasn't even goign to be possible.  This was a bit irritating, but he had to control himself.  He closed his eyes and took a nice, deep breath.  This calmed him and he gor ready to try again.  He threw the shuriken up into hte air and put up the seal.  He dropped it and the shuriken kept on going strong.  At least he was able to do this much now.  He woudl slowly start to get into his fighting stance and the suriken woul dslow, but not fall.  This was another step in the right direction.  He would then try to command the shuriken to go out towards the wall.  When he did the shurikien took a straight path towards him.  He dove out of the way and the shuriken would hit the ground where he once stood.  e shook his head.  "Ok. . . That was clearly not what was supposed to happen."

Hiro walked over to the shuriken and picked it up.  Repeating the same process he had been repeating for a little while now, he ended up with the shuriken flying around him while he was in his fighting stance.  Once again he tried to command the shuriken to go straight out.  It shot out in the direction of the wall fto the left of him.  He shook his head and sat on the ground.  "At least it didn't come at me this time.  Break time."* - Tue Oct 27 21:43:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sat on the ground starin gat this shuriken in his hand.  It was an ordinary shuriken.  Nothing was special about this thing.  But the more he loked at it, the more he felt like this shuriken had an important meaning in his life.  If he could make this shuriken do what he wanted it to do, maybe he could get other things that he wanted done.  Maybe he wouldn't have to hear any more bad news about his friends.  He popped up to his feet nd thrw the shuriken up into the air.  With new found inspiration he put up a seal and had the shuriken floating around him.  He got in his fighting stance and threw a few jabs.  Jus tot see wha twould happen.  The shuriken continued o spin strong.  He would then try and command it to go straight once again.  It went straight, but at an angle, so it hit a different spot then he wanted it too.  This was the best result that he had gotten so far.  So he smiled and wen tto pick the shuriken out of the wall. 

"Ok, at least I got it to go forward this time.  That is a start.  Just have to increase my aim with this and then I should be good to try and use two shuriken.  Baby steps Hiro,baby steps."  He dug the shuriken out of the wall and returned to his original placement.  Instead of throwing the shuriken as he had been doing.  He instead jjust held the shuriken out in front of hims and let it go.  Quickly he put up the seal and the shuriken started to fly around him.  He would once again aim at a singular point on the wall and sen d the shuriken out towards that spot.  The shuriken hit that exact spot and he nodded. 'I can do this"

Once gain he retreieved the shuriken and retruened to his spot.  He didn't want to move on to two shuriken until he was sure tha the was able to control one with complete precision.  He would walk over behind the cactus with the shuriken spinning around him.  he would then try to aim the shurriken around the cactus and to the same spot on the wall.  He unleasehd it and it hit the cactus directly.  He shook his head and picked it out of the poor flower.  "Damn."

Making this thing curve was not something that he was able to do just yet.  So he kept on working at it.  He had the shuriken spinning around him once agian.  Then tried o curve it again.  He unleashed it and it curved gracefully around the cactus.  Then went directly into the ground.  This wasn't the result that he was looking for.

He decided to take a break while keeping the shuriken spinning around him.  This would help him work on sustaining this jutsu.  So he layed back and let the shuriken do it's thing for now.* - Tue Oct 27 22:00:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) took an extended break from his training with this thuriken still floating about him.  He stood up and stuck his hand out.  As the shuriken came by he stopped the jutsu and caught the shuriken.  He seemed to be getting a grasp of the concept of this jutsu.  But he still didn't have the complete control that he wanted.  So he returned to his position behind the catcus that he was just in.  He still needed to make this thing curve.  he tossed it up into the air and put up the eal.  The shuriken started to swirl around him once again.  He would then attempt to make it go around the cactus and to the same spot on the wall.  The shurkien shot around the cactus and straightened its course.  Then just as it got to the wall he lost control of it and it took a sharp left.  It missed the wall completely.  He shook his head and went to go and get the shuriken.

This was not easy.  Controling this shuriken precisely with just his chakra required quite a bit of control.  Maybe he had put too much on his plate at once.  The simple task of controlling one of them was rediculously hard.  It was no way that he would be able to contol more then three tops at this point.  And he honestly felt like he was pushing it with three.  Either way he went and got the shuriken and returned to his spot with thei shuriken already spinning around him.  He really concentraied on controlling his chakra.  The more he did that eh better his control of the shuriken would be.  He then fired it off at the wall, around the cactus.  It darted around the cactus and then straight into the wall.  He had finally done it.  He ran and got the shurkien and then returned to the cactus.  This thing was going to be the centerpiece of his training for now.

Making the shuriken fly around himself was no biggie now.  Now he wanted to know it he could make it fly around another object, such as this cactus.  He fired up the jutsu and the shuriken started to swirl.  He would then try to make it go around the cactus as fast and close as he could without hitting the cactus.  He started off very slow and not too close to the cactus.  It was going wel so he increased the spped and closed the distance.  Let's see hos this goes.

The shuriken was still spinning around the cactus.  But it was going slow and was not to close to the cactus.  This was all good for now it was training after all. He focused and made the shuriken move faster and get closer.  He did too much and it got stuck inside of the cactus.  "Shit."

He deciede to take another break with the shuriken swirling around him.  He did a good ob last time, but let's see if he could increase his duration.  * - Tue Oct 27 22:50:27 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was still training his ass off, trying to gain a mastery of this jutsu.  This was only thing he was focused on for the moment.  He pulled out a shuriken and threw it into the air.  Quickly locking in a single seal, he would activate the jutsu and the shuriken would start to swirl around him.  He would focus on controlling this shuriken precisely for the time being.  ONe he could do that he would be able to move on to trying to control two of them.  He used his chakra to try and make the shuriken fly around the cactus to his left as fast as he could.

The shuriken would continue to zoom around the cactus at a high speed.  This was a lot harder then Hiro thought it would be.  Just trying to make this shuriken do exactly what he wanted it too was truly a struggle.  Stil he continued to work on it.  It was the only way to get better.

Hiro was starting to sweat slightly.  Focusing this hard for an extened period of time would be hard for anybody.  The shuriken continued to swirl, getting closer and closer until he got too close and it would hit the cactus and stick into it.  Hiroshi sat on the ground and started to catch his breath.

He pulled the shuriken out again and threw it up.  He diecided to relax while maintiaining the jutsu.  Endurance training it was.* - Wed Oct 28 02:41:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was still working on his endurance of this jutsu.  If he could keep this up for a little while longer then maybe he would be able to use this for entire battles and not just for short bursts.  This was a rather interesting technique.  So he let the shuriken coninue to spin around him for the time being.

He stood up and would keep the jutsu going.  The shuriken would continue to spin around him.  Ready to go forth and strike at any moemens notice.  He would then command the shuriken to go straight forward at the wall.  The instant that the shuriken was about to hit the wall he would make it turn completely around and come back to him.  It would once again start to swirl around him.  He was getting used to this.

Hiroshi pulled out another shuriken as the other one still circled him.  He tossed the other shuriken up and put up the seal needed.  This sshuriken would start to swirl around him also.  But the speed of which they swirled slowed, a lot.  He was not used to controling two and it took everything that he had to keep it going.  He stood there with the seal locked in.

This was taking a lot out of poor little Hiroshi.  He had never had such trouble with a jutsu.  This entire thing was complicated.  It was probaly because it required such delacate chakra control.  That was definitely not Hiro's strong suit.  So he continued to work holding in this seal.

He tried to put the seal down and the shurikens swirld for a few more seconds.  Then they would fall to the ground.  Hiroshi would stand there collecting himself.  This was one hell of a technique.* - Wed Oct 28 02:54:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) returned to his training spot to train.  Nothing was really goign on at the moment as far as he knew and he was so close to getting this jutsu completed.  He was at least able to start two shuriken going.  Now he just had to be able to maintain it.  He pulled out two Kunai and would throw them up.  Quickly he would put up the seal that he needed to actuvate the jutsu.  When this happened the two shuriken would start to sworl around him quickly.  He held the seal for now, this required focus and precise control.

Slowly, Hiroshi started to release the seal.  The shuriken woul dcontinue to swirl and he had pretty good control over them for the time being.  Now he had to be able to command them to go where he needed them too.  They would be fine just wirling around him, but if he could use them for offense as well, he would be in business.

The shuriken continued to swirl around him quickly.  They were each going in opposite directions, but they were moving very fast.  He would then try and command them to go forward at the same time.  One went forward, the other just fell to the ground.  Even the one that went forward did not go very far or fast.  He picked up his shuriken and got ready to do this again.

Hiro tossed the shuriken up again.  This was followed by him putting up the seal to make the jutsu go.  The two shuriken would fly around him quickly.  He had them flying as close as he could without hitting him.  He once again sent the shuriken forward.  Or at least that was his plan.  One did wha the wanted full throttle.  The other went half way at about half speed.  This was a step in the right direction.

Picking up the shuriken and throwing them up once again, Hiro got ready to try again.  The only way he was goign to do this was repeated use.  This was just something he had to do.  There was no way around it.  He tried to send them forward again.  They did what he wanted them too and he smiled.  He was getting better at this.  

One last time he did this and then he sat down.  He deserved to take a break.  Maybe he was finally ready for the three shuriken he thought might be his limit.  That would come after his break.* - Wed Oct 28 03:12:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stood up and quickly performed this jutsu again.  The shuriken swirled around him furiously.  All three of them.  This was going to be the biggest test that he had yet with this jutsu.  But he was ready.

Hiroshi was jus tletting the shuriken swirl for now.  HE had no intention of moving them for the time being.  He just wanted to make sure he could at least maintain three of them.  This by itself was very difficult for him to do.  This required a lot of focus.

The shurikens shot forward and hit the wall.  He had this shit down.  He could control all three of them with precision.  Mari-Sensei was goign to be so proud of him.  He put them away and satdown for a break.* - Wed Oct 28 03:18:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was about to go into the training session of a lifetime.  He didn't know when mari-Sensei would be back, so he knew that he needed to hurry with all of the things that he wanted to do on his own.  He would start off with his Genjutsu defense, Genjutsu:Kai.  To use this effectively he had to be able to stop the flow of chakra in his body and then apply an even stronger powr to disrupt the chakra that was causing the genjutsu.  This was another one of those basic ninja things that he had to hurry and get under his belt.  So he put his hands together into a single seal h would thn try to stop the flow of his chakra.  nothing happened.

Hiro stood there with a confused look on his face.  For a genius he sure was stupid sometimes.  "What happened?  I don't think that I did this righ.  How am I even supposed to know?  Maybe this is one of those things that Mari-Sensei had to help me with.   . . . No.  I have to do this on my own.  I told her I would train alone till she got back so that is what I am going to do."  So he tried it again.  This time he felt something, but it wasn't the jutsu.

"Damn. . . This is going to be hard as hell without being put in a Genjutsu first.  I just have to suck it up.  If I can do it now, I am sure that I will be able to help myself when the time comes."  He started to concentrate and stopped his chakra.  He then reactivated with as much force as he could.  It wasn't much.

Hiro wanted to move on to something else, but he knew that he had to at least try this one more time.  So he did it and it was a little better then last time, but it was still nothing to be that impressed with.  he shook his head and continued on with his training.

* - Thu Oct 29 03:12:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) moved on with his training.  He had done Kai for a while and wanted to try the other genjutsu out that he had.  he wasn't really sure how that was going to work.  I mean it's not like he was the one being put in it.  For now he would just make  clone and see how it reeacted.  He would then put up a few seals and would put the clone in a genjutsu.

The clone would start to swing furiously, fighting the imagionary versions of itself.  it actually looked pretty bad to be honest.  Teh poor clone was no match for all of the hiro's goign at it.  The clone eventually succumb to the genjutsu and woulld fall to the ground.

Hiro let that clone rest and brought up another.  This time he did the same thing.  This clone did basicallly the same as the first.  All Hiro could do was stand there and watch.  "I must be doing something right.  i mean they look like this is terrible."

He wasn't too fond of genjutsu . but he needed to have an understanding of it.  So he tried this one more time and then called it quits with that.  This was goign to be a lot more then a simple genjutsu training session.

The next thing he was going to ork on was his Wind release great breakthrough.  This was one of the few jutsu that required him to lock in more then one seal at a time.  So he ran through the 5 seals and then unleashed a gust of wind at the wall.  The wind would hit the wall and be stopped.  He wan't that powerful yet, and his ninjutsu might not ever be.

Hiro wiped his forehead and would continue on with his session.  This was the hardest he had worked in a long time.  he had to catch his buddy Sae.  That chick got so strong so fast that it was a little upsetting.  But Hro was not one to hate.  He was happy for his friend.  Plus he felt sorry for not being there to help her when she needed it.  with that in mind he unleased another gust of wind and kept that determined glare on his face.

"I'm sorry Sae.  I promise I will get stronger and stop that from happeneing to you ever again.  if only I were stronger already.  Then maybe you would not have wnet through what you did.  I promise I will do better.  That is what this is all for.  Protecting my friends."  As he was speaking his mind he was gather ing hsi chakra.  He woul then clap as the final sactivtoin of his jutsu.  This as going to be his thing.  The wind would come rushing into the wall.  Damn.  This was getting better.

Hiro was still working on his Great Breakthrough.  But he knew that he had to move on to something ee.  The shinobi world was not just a one jutsu kind of thing.  Shit was always complicated around here.  He activated the jutsu one final time and then wiped his forehead.  He slung the swat away from his hand and took a deep breath.  "What next?"

Wind Style: Gale Palm, a jutsu that could be used to help projectiles.  This is something that could really be useful for support.  Teamwork was a basic quality that all shinobi should have.  So he gathered his chakra and three up a few kunai.  He activated the jutsu and the kunai shot off into the wall. They gouged into the wall deeper then if Hiro had just threw it himself.  This was an amazing thing for hism to see.

"Holy smokes.  That is what this is?  That is flipping awsome.  i wonder if it would work with some of my other jutsu, or even somebody elses.  Ooooo the possibilities. \"   He would let his young mind wonder for a while then realize that this was not time for games.  he would run through the seals and activate the jutsu once more.  

This was quickly becoming a jutsu that Hiro wanted to gain complete control of like now.  He was fallingin love with it almost as much as the air bullets.  Thy were still probably his favorite.  But this was damn sure a close second.  So he did it again.  Reptition was the key to success.  At least for not it was anyway.

:One lat time."  He thought o himself as he did just what he thought.  Gale palm one last time.  He went and retrieved his shuriken and then would put them away.  "This is actually turning out to be pretty fun."

Hiroshi put his hands together into the Ram seal, I think.  I'm not 100 on this but I m oign to use that shit today.  Anyway, he actuvated his shunshin no Jutsu.  He appeared to disappear and appear behind the cactus.  in reality he was just moving hella fast.  This was still something that fucked with his head for now and he had to lean on the cactus to not fall. . . Bad idea.  

"Owwwwwww"  He would yell as the cactus stabbed his poor little arm.  There were about 7 needles sticking out of his arm and he wa not happy.  He quicly pulled them out, if he did it slow that shit would have hurt worse.  eh then anted to get away from that damn plant as fast as he could, so he shunshined again.

This time he ended up back where he first started.  he still felt the affects of this jutsu and everything around him was spinning.  This was clearly something that he woudl have to work on.  No way around it.

Hiro finally collected himself and would shunshin again.  Away from that damn cactus this time.  But nothing was there and he busted his ass. He was like a drunk old man at this point.  "Glad I am alone for now."

He dtood up after a while and sdusted himself off.  He put up the seal again and shunshined one last time.  This was not something his body could take a lot of. This was just something he had to pace hismelf with.  he leaned against the rock for support and collected himself for now.

He had finally collected hismelf and would pull out hsi kunai.  The next two techniques were relatively the same jusst dir\fferent elements.  first he would work on his chakra flow Wind.  He allowd his wind natured chakra to flow through the blade.  This incresed the power of the blade ti its hieghest point.  At least the highest point that he could manage.

This was something that was not going to be easy for him to master.  This required chakra control for somthing like this was simply staggaring.  He had to get them to grind agains tone another all like.  "Punnnn shi punnshi puunshi"  Hir actually got into it and started to party with the kunai in hand.  he stil lactivated the jutsu and slashed away.

Hiro finnally got hismelf togther and refocused.  His mong wandered sometimes but it was ok.  It was atually becoming a bit easier to do tihs.  The concept of the chakra grinding against one another actually was starting to make sense to him.  Since that was the case he was able to do this pretty quickly now.  So he did it again.

This was goign to be tha last time for a little while that he would use this jutsu in training.  So he did it again and placed the kunai on the groun.  He had to catch his breath.  This was a lot of shit to be doing all together.  He would pick the kunai back up and resume his trainng.

This jutsu was esentially the same but it was earth natured rather then wind natured.  So he did the same thing and the blad ewould harden to an almost unbreakable point.  This would be good to use to try and protect himself.  So he tried it, the blade did nothing.

This tanto was not hardening in the slightest.  he needed to be able to do this quickly and efficiently  If he was able to do that he would be ale to use this in battle.  this ight catch someone off guard as Hiroshi was a taijutsu fighter.  So he tried it again.  Again nothing.

Hiro was starting to get a bit upset.  Like how could a so calle dgenius not be able to do something as simple as putting his chakra into a blade.  he refocused and tried it again.  The lade got slightly harde as if it wre a.. . . .Nah not goign there.

This was goign to be the last time he tried it.  If he didn't get it right he would have to get help from someone for this.  so he activated the jutsu and the blade hardedn more then last ime.  He stood there panting, holding the blade.  "Ok this is progress.  This is some draining stuff man."

Hiroshi didn't realize it but he had a lot of jutsu.  Time to move on toe the next.  This was probably his most powerful jutsu.  As a matter of fact when he got it down it would definetely bee his most powerful.  He used his mud river technique and then activated the jutsu he really wanted to use.  Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb.  The mud would rise into the shape of a dragon head and shoot out powerful bombs of mud at the wall.  he stood ther in awe of what he jsut did.

"Damn Sanoke. . . This is what you gave me?  My nigga."  He was so happy to see this thing in action that he started to do it again.  The image of a dragon was just so amazing for Hiroshi to see.  i mean he was only 13.  

the bobmbs smacked the wall and he shook his head.  "This shit is amazing.  You thikn I am not goig nto use this on every enemy I see?  You probably right.  This is me we are talking about.  i will probably just punch im. or her."  He still did the utsu again.

Thisngs were piking up as Hiro did the jutsu one more time.  The mud was actually strting to crack the wall a bit.  So he stoppd and looked at the cracks. "Damn. This thing is strong.  I have to be carfeul not to use it around here in simple spars.  i might actuallyhurt somebody."

The last jutsu that Hiroshi had to work on was some taijutsu. this was what he liekd the most.  Plus Sanoke had helped him out with this one so he was really getting shit good with this.  He stared to perform a series of kicks all in one fluid connected motion.  He came to a so upn his last kick and nodded his head.  "Good job Hiro.  Now faster."

He started to spin as fast as he could.  trying to increase his mobility and balance in this technique.  He then picked up the pace adn then started a flurry of kicks.  The kicks woul dmake the sand around him start to pick up from teh force of them.  This was a rather simple technique.

A series of kicks were performed again. Each time he did theis things were getting better, smoother.  Sanoke would be proud to see his progress.  He was alomost done with his training, so he collected hismelf and got ready.  

This was it.  The last thing that he was going to do for now.  he unleasehd the series of powerful kicks and would fall to the ground.  He wa done.  He was so tired that he ground felt like a bed.  "*pant* *pant*  I did it."* - Thu Oct 29 04:04:54 2015
