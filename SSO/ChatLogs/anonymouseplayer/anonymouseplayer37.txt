<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) stands up and leaves in search of these big ass worms.* - Thu Dec 10 23:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) started his survey of the area, looking for the big ass worms that Koji wanted him to take care of.  Hiro could recall the worms from the Chuunin exams, and knew that they were no joke.  He remembered all of the acid and crap that flew from them and everything.  He had to be careful, he was alone this time.  It should all go well though, he was also a lot stronger then he was then.  He placed his left hand on his right shoulder as he started to rotate his arm in a circle.  "All right,  Time to go worm hunting."

He walked around for a while, and was starting to get a little upset.  He had great vision, and the worms were huge, why could he not find them?  He didn't know what was going on.  He leapt onto one of the giant rocks that surrounded the village.  He placed his hands over his eye's, sheilding them from the glare of the sun, as he looked around.  He noticed a distrubance in the northeastern part of the village.  It seemed as though there was a whirlpool of sand.  He smiled and started to run in that direction.  "Finally, some action."

Arriving at the scene swiftly, Hiro got into his fighting stance, looking at the whirlpool with a smile.  "Come on out you big ass worms.  I'm here to kill ya."  That seemed to make the worms mad, because two of them shot out of the whirlpool at the same time.  They were even bigger then what he thought they would be.  They towered over him, side by side.  He looked up, a bit surprised, but still full of excitement.  "Whoaaa.  You two are so not dog sized."

The fight was on.  Both of the giant worms spat out a glob of acid at Hiroshi.  The globs spun and flipped through the air as they approached Hiro quickly.  He quickly leaped out of the way and onto a nearby rock.  The area that was struck by the acid started to sizzle and dissolve.  "Note to self.  Don't let that shit touch me."  His focus then returned to the worms, it was his turn to try and attack.

"Ok, if I can take at least one of them out with one attack, I should be able to deal with this quickly.  I do have this Tonto, I am not all that great with it though.  Maybe I can just, power my way through it.  I know that worms have the ability to regenerate, so I have to cut it in half more then likely.  Alright, enough thought, let's get this show on the road."  Hiroshi pulled out his tanto and dropped his shell.  The shell smaking the ground with a solid thud.  Now, able to move at full speed, he darted off towards the worms.  He ran behind it quickly and started to run up the worm, as if it was a wall.  The second worm caught wind of him and attempted to smack him off, as he was running.  He jumped and performed a quick flip over the worms tail and continued to scale this tower.  He got to the top and started to push his chakra through the blade.  His wind natured chakra to be more exact.  With a mighty yell and a slash, he came down towards the worm attempting to bisect it perfectly down the middle.

The increased power of the Tanto proved to be helpful, he effertlessly started to cut throught he worm, head first.  A screech would be heard, unbtil he reached it's mouth.  He continued to go down until he was standing in the whirlpool of sand.  The moment he hit the ground, there would be more acid flying at him from the single worm that was left.  he darted out of the way, as the bisected worm split into two.  "Heheh, one down.  One to go."

A staredown ensued, even though the worm didn't have eyes.  Then, the battle resumed.  Glob after glob of acid started to come towards a sprinting Hiroshi.  He was jumping, sliding, flipping, twisting.  Everything you could think of to not allow this acid to touch his clothes or skin.  One of the globs was aimed too well, and got on the edge of his jacket.  It completely ruined the right corner of the jacket.  Hiro looked at it and let out a cry of defeat.  "DAMNIIIIIIITTTT.  MY JACKET. . .YOU ARE DEAD!!!"

He charged at the worm and leaped into the air.  With everything he had, he got into position for a mighty jump kick.  He made contact with the worm and continued to push through, bursting through to the other side.  The worm exploded from the force of the kick, and Hiro stood there, worm blood on his shoe.  He wiped it in the dirt and tucked his hands into his pockets.  
"Mission. . . Complete."  He would then walk back to the others in the square.* - Thu Dec 10 23:24:35 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked into a pretty rundown building.  It looked as if shady things went down inside of it, and they did indeed.  The moment Hiro and Green walked inside of the place, they could almost taste the weed from the power of the smell.  Hiro shook his head in disappointment.  "I can't believe I am briinging my little brother into a situation like this.  Even if it is a mission.  Oh well, he has to learn somehow."  Each of the gang members stopped what they were doing and turned their attention to the two of them.  Hiro did not flinch at all and stared back at them.  The negotiation is on.

The so called leader of the ground stood up, and made his way over to the two of them.  Hiro stepped in front of his brother, not wanting that man to get close to him.  It seemed as if the leader knew what was going on and he smiled, as he started to rub the gun he had in the gront of his pants.  " So how can I help you two fine gentleman today?  You haven't been here before.  New customers?"

Hiro squinted his eyes at the man.  He did not like him in the slightest.  He was too cocky, too sure that his little gun could handle everything.  He shot him a glare and started to speak.  "No, we are not customers.  We were sent here to tell you that Sunagakure does not approve of what you are doing.  We would be very greatful if you stopped what you were doing, and leave.  Just go away and all of this will be forgotten.  Can you do that for us?"

The gang leader erupted into laughter as the rest of the members started to walk up behind him.  The leader, stopped laughing and walked straight up to Hiro, trying to get all up in his face and what not.  He started to speak, attempting to intimidate both of them.  "Who the fuck do you think you are?  You think you can bring your happy ass in here and make demands?  Boy, I should kill you and your little friend here right now.  How about I make you an offer.  You get the fuck out of here and I will let you live.  Hows that?"

Hiro stood there, not fazed by this man at all.  All he could think about was how bad that man smelled.  He listened to his words, not really caring about a single one.  Once he finished he started to speak. "So, you aren't going to listen to us huh?  Alright, guess we are going this the hard way."  Hiro quickly threw a right hand at his face, sending him flying back into the pile of his own men.  He would then cover the floor in front of them with a stream of water.  He smiled and looked at his Bro.  "Do it."* - Fri Dec 11 00:10:40 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had started a brawl, and he had to end it now.  As his brother had said, there were around sixteen guys in here.  The punch hurt the boss, but it didn't drop him in one shot.  Not only that, there were people behind him and his brother now.  "Shit. . ."  He would think to himself.  Just as he was about to turn around, the leaser pulled out his gun and pointed it right at him.  He squeezed the trigger and a flash came from the barrell, along with the swirling bullet trying to end Hiro's life.  Hiro's reactions were impeccable, he ducked and the bullet grazed his hair as it flew by and took out one of the men behind him.  By the time the bullet had hit the man, Hiro was right on top of the boss again.  He gave him a demonic glare, as he started to speak.

"You just tried to shoot me. . .Bad move.  My brother is here too, you could have hurt him.  If it wasn't for this mission, I would kill you right now.  But, I will just have to accept knocking your lights out and bringing you in.  Night night."  He would pull back, and throw a devastating right hand to his face, knocking him out cold.  The rest of the members surrounding him would attempt to attack, each one pullin gout some sort of bladed weapon, or a bat.  This was indeed a brawl to remember.

"Green, handle that last guy, then bring you ass.  I will hold them off."  At that moment, he would duck as a bat came whizzing over his head.  He threw an elbow, and combined it with a simple back fist.  The man fell to the floor, they were not as tough as the boss man was.  One by one they were dropping slowly.

With only around 6 of them left on his side, more people started to file in.  This was indeed starting to get annoying.  Hiroshi decided to get them all into one area.  He grabbed one of them, and used them as a club. Knocking each of them into the man that Green was gogn to handle.  The men filing in all seemed to gather into tha spot too.  Hiro walked over beside his brother as the staredown of a lifetime went on.  "2 versus 20.  I like our odds bro.  Follow my lead, we will end this quick." 

He started off with two quick seals, then he spat out a giant wad of sticky substance directly at each of them.  The starchy substance would glue each of them into place right there.  He smiled and then went on to perform another set of seals, and sprayed each of them with powerufl strem of water.  They were each now stuck, and soaked to the bone.  "End it Green, give them all that you got."* - Fri Dec 11 00:45:39 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sat on the ground, staring at the rocks.  He was knew what all of this was, he remembered it clearly.  It wasn't too long before he started to picture breaking the rock.  His mind started to wander.

"Ok, just how to break a rock should be easy enough for now.  Hmm, so how does a rock break?  Is it from the force outside of it?  I wonder if something can go on inside of the rock.  Hmmm, I never really did put too much thought into how the rock breaks when I break them.  I just hit them hard and then Boom!  millions of tiny pieces.  Alright, now how to put that into words for Sensei?. . . Hmmmm.  Well, here goes nothing."

He intensified his staring at the rocks for now.

"Hmmmmm."* - Fri Dec 11 01:48:48 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) continued to stare at the rock, while listening to Paine's wise words.  His mind once again starting to fill with thoughts on how to answer her question.  

"Ok. . Sooo, I guess just punching it was not the way to go about this situation.  She said that blunt force does not break the rock.  It is the force that carries me huh. . . Well, I know what carries me forward.  I know exactly why I push myself the way I do.  I'm sure they know too.  I don't have to say anything about it."  He thinks to himself as he looks over his shoulder and glances at his reason for training.  He would smile and then rais his hand.  Hoping that his sensei would acknowledge it.

Assuming she did, he would begin to speak.  "Uhh, Sensei.  I think I have an idea.  The way that we break the rock, is more about precision then strength, right?  I mean, everything has it's weak points.  Rocks are no different.  If you can find the weak point on the rock, and attack that with a decent amount of force, and good accuraccy.  Then the rock will go bye-bye, and boom!  Lots of tiny pieces.  Is that at least close if it is wrong?"* - Fri Dec 11 02:11:50 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was at least on the rigth track, but his head was starting to hurt from all of this thinking.  He was more of a jump in and see how things turn out, then a sit back and think about it kind of guy.  He scratched his adn let out a yawn.  "This damn rock. . . Ok, back to thinking."

He sat there for a while, keeping everything tha she had said in his mind once again.  He was really trying to figure out what she wanted.  He thought he was going to get a "G-Good job. . H-Hideo *in Sensei's voice*  But he didn't it was ok.  She was usually right when it came to these things, so he was happy with the fact that she told him that he was at least close.  Deeper and deeper into the rock he gazed.  How the hell do you break these things?

"Ok. . .So, the least amount of force.  How do you break it, with the least amount of force?  You need, precision, accuracy, Aaahhhhhh she already said all of this.  Damnit, this is starting to get really confusing.  I don't think about hitting the rock and breaking it.  I just do it.  I just hit it and break it.  What else could be happening?  Maybe, you use. . Umm. . . I don't know.  Do I use . . Uhhhhh. . . Hmmm.  What do I use?  I wonder if timing has anything to do with this.  One way to find out."  He thinks to himself quietly.

He looked up into the sky as he started to talk to his sensei once again.  "Ok, so if you want us to emply the least amount of force.  Hmm. . . I'm not going to lie Sensei. . I'm confused."* - Fri Dec 11 02:48:32 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked over to the rock and stared at it.  He had to fiind the weak point in the rock.  He tapped the rock in various spots.  The eyes, the mouth, the front of the rock, the top, everywhere.  The more he looked at the rock, the more he remembered all of the pain that it had caused him.  He looked down at his hands and recalled his swollen hands from trying to jam his fingers in the rock.  he remembered all of the kicking that he had to do to learn various jutsu.  This rock was the one steady thing in all of it.  It held a lot of memories for him, but he wsa still about to break that bastardly thing.  He hit a spot that sounded a bit different then all of the other spots.  "Hmm, let's try here."

HE pulled back his fist, and sent a jab at the spot.  He didn't put his all into it, he was trying to make sure he hit that spot precisely.  Plus, this was a thing about him not using his full strength to break it anyway.  He made contact with the rock and it shattered.  Seemed like he had found the spot pretty quickly.  "Haaa, like that Sensei?"* - Fri Dec 11 03:14:08 2015

He looked like Yoshimitsu out this piece.  He would smile and then start to twirl the sword at an amazing speed over his head.  He didn't even have Kitana prof but. . .FUCK IT. . . He was now flying with his sword.  He would fly over and poke Geo in the eye.

From the way Geo was running towards him, to the way that he was about to make Hiro try and play jump rope with his leg.  He smiled, as this was not about to be a slow starting spar.  As Geo went down to perform the first kick, Hiro casually stepped back, otside of the attack.  As he was still spinning, he launched a mighty kick of his own towards Geo's face.  His second kick would most liekly make contact with Hiro's grounded leg, and Hiro would wince a bit from the pain.  He accepted this fact and was trying to trade blows.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had not made contact with his attack the way that he wanted too.  Before he knew it, he was about to get hit in the chin with that big ass punch again.  He brought his hands up, to take as much damage from the punch as he could.  He knew that this one was not one he could just step out of the way of.  He was hit in the hands and chin, and his head snapped back.  He was now looking at the sky and was actually about to fall.  He caught himself and stumbled backwards.  He looked at Geo with a smile.
