<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) says: ... - Sun Nov 29 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Momura(JustCallMeGnar) thinks: I see.. - Sun Nov 29 19:56:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Lot of sand. . .  - Sun Nov 29 19:57:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Good luck. - Sun Nov 29 19:58:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) says: . . . - Sun Nov 29 19:59:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had very good sight, so the moment that Kuro started to weave signs he made his move.  He wanted to draw all of the attention away from Momu for the time being.  He charged towards Kuro, as he was doing the seals.  He was hoping that with his impressive seed he could get there before he finished the seals.  Once within range, he remembered the time he and Kuro were doing a little training together and thought about how fast his sand was to defend him.  He didn't want to hurt the kid too badly if he hit him, but he did not want Ai to figur out that he was not going full tilt right now.  So with about a third of his full strength, he would send a mighty roundhouse kick towards Kuro's rib cage to send him flying over towards Momu.  He was hoping to send him to her faster then his sand could follow and leave him open for Momu to attack.

"Here he comes."* - Sun Nov 29 20:04:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Mom should use her techniques to overpower the sand. - Sun Nov 29 20:19:50 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Hey, Kuro. Hows it going? - Sun Nov 29 20:31:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: And don't worry about me, Ai! - Sun Nov 29 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Aye. - Sun Nov 29 20:32:38 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Nothing special I suppose. I've started to travel again. - Sun Nov 29 20:33:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not going to be able to hit Kuro due to the clones coming his aid.  Hiroshi had total control over his body and stopped the attack from hitting the clone.  Having the same type of clones in his aresonal gave him a complete understanding of how it all worked.  He didn't want to deal with the mud reforming around him so he just simply avoided them and kept on his track to the real Kuro.

While he was goin through all of this he noticed a few golden shuriken flying towards Momu needlessly.  He was not happy about it and figured that Kuro needed to learn something fast.  Causing pointless harm to his own fellow comrades was not something that Hiro was a fan of.  When he got within striking range he attempted to kick the living dy lights out of Kuro with a mighty left roundhouse kick.  It was not intended on being fatal, but it was damn sure goign to be a one hitter quiter if he hit him.

"You bastard!"* - Sun Nov 29 20:35:12 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) dodges them.* - Sun Nov 29 20:36:03 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) saw the kunai coming his way and pulled out one of his own.  They were moving in slow motion to Hiro and he easily knocked both of them away with his incredibley fast hands as he was running.  The rest is in the first rp.* - Sun Nov 29 20:39:28 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Oh really? Where you thinking of going? - Sun Nov 29 20:42:01 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hokuma, Kuro(Ichigo10101) says: Well, I was going to go check up on Kumo. I heard it's rebuilding. - Sun Nov 29 20:44:35 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) thinks: Taking it too far. - Sun Nov 29 20:47:08 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: Whoa sounds pretty far. - Sun Nov 29 20:48:00 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) thinks: Fight to win. - Sun Nov 29 20:49:42 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kuro(Osmanesanogo) thinks: Win to live. - Sun Nov 29 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was kicking instead of punching Kuro.  So he had both of his hands free.  He saw each of the shuriken coming his way and still had the kunai in his hand.  He used it to knock away the Shuriken coming for his arms, legs, and his head.  His hand was moving in a blur.  Kuro probably could not keep up with it.  The kick went forward as planned since he procted himself with the kunai in hand.

"They are too slow Kuro."* - Sun Nov 29 20:49:42 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Chikyu Kasanari(Crimson Cresent) says: ....Yeah, they just normaly do that. - Sun Nov 29 20:52:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Ryutou, Ai(Sennalove) says: Quite easy too. - Sun Nov 29 21:51:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was flung back by the attack from Kuro.  He recovered and landed on his feet, sliding on the sand a short distance.  He took note of the water coming in from the arena.

"Where the hell did that come from?"* - Sun Nov 29 21:52:00 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was also cut by some shuriken.* - Sun Nov 29 21:52:51 2015

His momentum took him towards Kinami.  Not really what he was hoping for, but he was going at her none the less.  He knew that if he held back, not only would it probably not harm her in the least, she might get mad at him.  He didn't want that, so he performed a quick flip and got himself into position for his attack.

As he was falling he extended his right leg out completely and bnt his right leg at an angle.  He was simply attempting a Dynamic Entry aimed at Kinami's chest.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) made contact and watched to see what exactly what Nami was doing.  HIs eyes widened upon seeing her open the first gate.  He was a mixture of happy, scared, impressed, and excited.  He didn't know how he was going to handle all of this right now, but he was going to have to try and do something.  While he was thinking of a counter she darted at him.  He could see her the whole time, but keeping up with her physically was another story.

The attack came faster then he could react to dodge, but he had a chance to do something.  He brought his hands up to lessen the damage as much as possible.  The shit still hurt and he went flying back to the ground.  Sliding a few feet before finally coming to a halt.  The impact immediatly bruised both arms and send shockwaves through both of them.  He slowly rose to his feet, his arms dangling from the amount of pain that he was in.  He smile at her and and spit out a bit of blood.

"That was one hell of a hit bae. . . That shit really hurt."

He stood there, not able to attack again at the moment.  All he could do now is hope to recover again before she came at him again.* - Mon Nov 30 02:31:02 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had been given a bit of time to recover. From the attack that Iza had used.  While all that was going on, he attempted to move his arms.  The amount of pain that shot through them was staggering.  He would wince from the pain and then chuckle to himself.  "Guess I have to use my feet."  

Just as he thought this Nami was coming back, full force.  He knew that this was going to happen.  Holding back wasn't something that was goign to happen in a situation like this.  They were oth fighting to be chuunin.  With his sharp eyes he watched her close in on him, arms dangling.  Then she sent a punch towards his chest.  He had the use of his arms taken away, but he was very adept with his feet.  He quickly threw a front kick aimed directly at her fist to knock it up and over his head.  He followed up with a quick backflip kick with the other foot.  This kick was aimed at her chin.  He was hoping that all of this was going to catch her completely off guard.* - Mon Nov 30 02:42:59 2015

He tried to move them as little as possible.  Still, that was not going to stop him from going on with his training.  He got out of his bed and thought back on the events from the Chuunin exams.  He hadn't done the best he could, but he wasn't too upset.  He just needed to do some training.  He got into a squating position and started to squat away.  This was going to be a long ass day.

Hiro had started his squats.  He had to push himself past his own breaking point.  Kanami had opened his eyes to what the gates could do.  He never really took trying to get them all that serious.  After finally getting hit by an attack from a gate user, he wanted to be able to do it, and he wanted it now.  Now having done about a hundred squats or so, he was starting to sweat a bit, but he was still going strong.  HIs legs were feeling the burn.

This entire not being able to use his arms at full strength was getting in the way.  This was not going to deter him.  He had his legs and they were burning.  With each squat he could feel someone light a match in his quads.  His braced arms extended all the way out to the side on each side of him.  Feet shoulder width apart.  HIs nice new floor creaking slightly with each squat.  "Mnueeeerrrrr*"  All this activity was for one sole purpose.  You know what it is already.

"301. . . 302. . . 303"  Hiroshi would say as he continued to work and work and work.  Bending at the knees until he was in a sitting position in his imagionary chair.  With a mighty thrust he would rise back up to a full standing position.  When he hit that point he would continue to rise until he was on his tippy toes.  This was just a glorified calf raise but every small detail helps at this point.

Came to a halt and shook his head.  The sweat flung from his face and hair all over the place.  He stood there for a second letting his fuck up sink in. ". . . Damn. . Now I gotta clean that"  He shrugged his shoulders and then went on back to his intense excercise session.  This gate shit was not going to happen on his own.  He started to perform a set of jump tucks.  This was just the beginning.* - Mon Nov 30 15:52:19 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) felt the healing powers of Bryson go to work.  It felt a little odd at first and a bit painful, but he was ok.  When he had finished he healing Hiroshi would look at his arms and start to bend them.  Having full activity over them again he quickly broke out of the braces.

"Holy shit Bry.  You did it!  My boy.  Thank you.  I needed that."  He would say with a huge smile while stretching out his arms.* - Mon Nov 30 17:26:11 2015

He wanted to see how he was going to react to this.

"Come on buddy. That's not gonna cut it.  Show me what you really got."* - Mon Nov 30 19:54:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: Let's test him a bit. . .  - Mon Nov 30 19:55:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) did not play when it came to explosive tags.  He had a bad experience with them.  But, he could not sense anything so he had no idea which on had a fluctuating chakra signature and which one did.  The instant he saw both of the Kunai with the tags he pulled out two kunai of his own, one in each hand.  He would throw both of them at the respective Kunais and meet them half way.  The first one was hopefully deflecte into the wall to Hiroshi's right.  The one on his left would fly straight into the cactus.  He would still stand there and smile.

"Come on Green.  Show me what you got already."  He would say in a playfully egging him on.* - Mon Nov 30 20:07:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would notice the wire along the Shuriken with his incredibly sharp vision.  He finally decided to make his move now.  He leapt backwards and out of the way of the danger.  The flashing wires now on nothing but the air, Hiroshi would smile as he landed on the ground a few paces away.

"My turn buddy.  Hang on tight."

He would perform three quick hand seals. Dog! Rabbit! Snake!  Then just for the hell of it he clapped his hands.  Then a gust of wind would come from behind Blue Hiro and straight towards Green Hero.  The power of the wind was great, but nothing too damaging.  Hiro had hopes of just knocking Green off of his feet and onto the ground.* - Mon Nov 30 20:25:23 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would smile and start to speak.

"I never said I had only water.  But I am a taijutsu user.  Ready to see?"

He would then charge over there full speed and throw a massive right straight aimed right at his forhead.  Inches before contact he would stop and gentely tap Green on the forehead.  He would then start to laugh.

"I wouldn't do you like that buddy.  Good fight."* - Mon Nov 30 20:31:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) gently placed his hand on his head.

"You did fine man.  That trap would have worked on most people. But if you ever need anything, come to Blue Hiro.  I gotcha."* - Mon Nov 30 20:36:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) lowers himself down to the ground to offer Green a piggy back ride.  He wanted to use him as training, but he ain't need to konw all that.

"Get on."  He would say with a smile.* - Mon Nov 30 20:39:53 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) started walking.* - Mon Nov 30 20:40:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked back into the area with Green on his back.

"Sup everyone?"  He would say as he lowered himself down to let Green off.* - Mon Nov 30 20:41:36 2015
