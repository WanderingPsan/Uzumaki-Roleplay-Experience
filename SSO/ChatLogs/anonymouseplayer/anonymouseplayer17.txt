<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) Runs along* - Mon Nov 23 20:20:41 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had been given quite and unusual mission.  This was the first time that he had ever had to sit in a listen to anything political in his life.  He was only 13 so he usually didn't pay to much attention to most of that stuff, but now that he had to do it for a mission, he was not going to let a single detail past him.  The meeting was taking place in a small room in the academy.  There were 4 big time political figures in the room with him and he actually felt a little intimidated.  He silentely gulped as he held his pen and paper to jot down notes.

The four politicians quickly got themselves situated and in their seats.  Then the big time leader took his spot at the one chair with a desk.  He had an assistant at each side of him, both dressed professionally.  He cleared his throat and then started to speak.  "We are here today to discuss the well being of our home, Sunagakure.  While in this meeting we will also touch on subjects going on outside of this village that might be of concern to us."  He would then fix his tie and take on a rather serious posture in his seat  "Now let us begin. . . . "

Things were flying around the room so fast that Hiro could barely keep up.  He was hearing things that he had no idea about, but knew would be useful information for him to remember.  "This is insane. . . . I had no idea that there were so many things to worry about in our village. . . I need to really be thankful for the life that I can live.  These people seem like they work really hard.  Seems like they want to increase revenue so we can build our defenses for any attacks so far.  That isn't much but it is a start.  Now I just have to listen how they are going to do it."

Things started to slow down as they discussed the current topic of revenue in this meeting.  They had several ideas from increasing taxes, opening up a few more smaller shops, openning one giant shopping mall,  and various other ideas that actually didn't sound all that bad to Hiro.  In the long run they decided to go with opening various small businesses that would have to pay a set amount of their own income to the village.  That way the more people suppoerted the small businesses the more money that the vilage would have.

Hiroshi found himself dozing off a few times and quickly shook his head to clear the cobwebs.  He had gotten lucky nd did not miss all that much.  He started to write in the notebook along side the other notes.  "The Decision that they have made reguarding the revenue is openning more small shops and taxing them moderately.  They feel as though people would support others in the village which in turn would support them and the village."

They moved on to the next subject. . Village protection.  They started to speak on how Sir Hassan was doing as a lader and all of his known accomplishments.  HIro was amazed at just how much Hassan had down since he had become the Kazekage.  HE wrote down a single line from this entire conversation on Hassan.  "Sir Hassan is amazing. . . ."

quickly the conversation shirfted back to the village defence.  They wanted to increase the amount of guards around the perimiter due to the lateset atacks by the man that they called Edge.  Hiroshi didn't know who Edge was, but the more they talked about him, the more he seemed to not like that guy.  He had done some terrible things and Hiroshi didn't respect that.  He jotted down some more information.  "Edge is bad. . . They want to increase guards around the perimiters.  Also wants to increase the shinobi army strength as a whole."

This was turning into a pretty educational meeting.  HIroshi was glad that he had gotten this mission.  They were now starting to talk about things going on outside of the village that might concern them.  There is a lot of things happeneing that concerned them, but the most important is seeming like a possible attack.

The attack was possiibly going to be soon and they then heard a boom. This mission was going to be over for now and Hiroshi had to move.  He ran to where he was needed as told.  "Shit. . . "* - Mon Nov 23 21:08:28 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) slowly walked up to his old little trinainign area.  This was like a second home to him.  He had to do some training to get his mind off of the gruesome scene he had just seen.  He had never seen so many dead bodies and lose limbs before all at one time.  He wasn't fully aware of the horror of war.  He never wanted to deal with it again, but he knew that he was going to have to.  So he gathered his chakra and simply clapped his hands.  A small gust of wind woul dblow from behind him.  It was nothing impressive, but at least he could protect himself from weakly throw shuriken.

While he was training he felt his cheek start to itch. He brought his hand up to scratch it and noticed that his fingers were wet.  Then he focuesed on himself and realized that his eyes were et also.  "Am I crying?  Why am I crying?  Was it really that bad?  You are pitiful Hiro."  He would say as he performed the jutsu once more.

He now had a Taijutsu trainer.  So trainng the few ninjutsu techniques that he had became something that he didn't have uch time to do anymore.  He also had to try and break this rock with his fingers.  With his fucking fingers.  They deserved a break for now so he clapped instead and used the wind to cool himself off.  He was hot.

"I wonder How Mari-Sensei is doing?  I haven't seen her in a little while.  I hope she is ok.  The next time I see her I want to show her how far I have ome with all of her techniques.  So I have to push myself.  Let's do it Hiro."  The chakra he had within himself began to stir.  Then with a signifying clap of the hands wind blew.  

HIroshi was starting to get a little winded.  Hehehe winded.  . . Back to RP.  But his training was causing him to tire a bit.  he used the technique one more time and then sat on the rock looking at the ground.  He was not fully recovered from that sight.* - Tue Nov 24 04:49:16 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: So you want me to just try it again right now? - Tue Nov 24 07:03:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would blink blankly a few times before turning to the rock.  He looked at the damn face on the rock and spit on the ground.  He was not happy with this damn thing.  It had hurt his hand and slowed down his training.  He got tired of this staredown with the rock and got into his fighting stance.  "NOw or never. . . . "

He tucked his elbows in and pulled each hand back to around waist leverl.  The fingers on each hand were extended fully, ready to strike.  HE took a deep breath and then thrusted his hand at the rock again. . . It made contact but the rock didn't do much of anything.  Instead his hand was on fire again.  He grabbed his hand and looked at Paine with a sad face.

"This hurts like hell Sensei."* - Tue Nov 24 07:08:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: . . . She his awsome. . .  - Tue Nov 24 07:32:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would ignore the pain in his hand and give her a full bright smile.  He enjoyed training even if it did hurt sometimes.  This was the only way he was going to get stronger and accomplish his goal.  "Right."

HE went over her instructions in his head as he completed each action.  "Ok. .  Use both hands. . . So I will put them together and form a simple Tiger! seal.  That should keep them locked up pretty tight.  Next I will have to make sure I don't pull my hands back when I make contact.  I can't afford to break a finger out here training.  Alright now it is just one thing left to do. . . Thrust."

As "Thrust" crossed his mind he sent his fingers forward with all of the strength in his young pre-teen body.  HIs fingers made contact with the rock and he held his fingers there.   The rock did not have a hole, but he didn't hurt himself as bad and he actually did dent the rock.  He looked down at his fingers and then at Paine with a bright smile.

"Look Sensei!!!! I dented it.!"* - Tue Nov 24 07:38:14 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would nod his head and look over at Rias.  He walked over beside her and assumed the position she was in the best he could.  He then smiled at Rias.

"Who would have thought we would be training together Senpai?"* - Tue Nov 24 07:53:36 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: ONe question. - Tue Nov 24 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Do I punch full speed? - Tue Nov 24 08:11:31 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) started to do as he was told.  He needed to punch the air in front of him at full speed.  He smiled.

"This seems easy enough.  I know how to punch things. . .At least I think I do.  I mean I do it all of the time.  I'm going to break that bastardly rock one day. . . But for now, punches."

He started to throw his punches in a flurry.  His hands blurring from the sheer speed of his punches.  "Ok Sensei. . . How long do I do this?"* - Tue Nov 24 08:40:32 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>***Concealed Figure**(TheSecretary) says: if y-your wind...is d-distrubed in a-any way...then y-your punch...is u-useless.. - Tue Nov 24 08:46:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nodded his head and continued punching.  Maintaining focus to make sure that he kept the spacing that he needed.  To do this he had to slow down a bit, but it was ok.  This was trianing not a life or death battle.  As he punched he would hear the snap of his black, sleevless jacket hitting his jeans.

"You mean like this?"* - Tue Nov 24 08:49:55 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) smiled at Pain and started to increase the speed of his attacks once again.   As he was punching a bright smile would form across his face.  He wa having fun training like this.  He wasn't used to somebody telling him how to do things but it was al good.  He smiled at her as he punched.

"I won't let you down Sensei."* - Tue Nov 24 09:24:54 2015
