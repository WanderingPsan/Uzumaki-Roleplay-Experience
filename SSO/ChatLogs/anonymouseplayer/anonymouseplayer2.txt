<br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was not as smart as he thought he was and this damn scroll was whipping his ass.  He didn't like it one bit.  He had all the time in the world as of right now, but he wasn't the kind of guy that liked reading and stuff.  But if he wanted to get stronger, this was what he had to do.  So he sucked it up and kept on working to learn this jutsu.

As he was reading he realized that Trilliam had mastered a jutsu of this caliber.  It gave Hiroshi a newfound respect for the guy.  THe man was pretty smart.  Just as he was reading he noticed Saeza and looked up.  He waved and smiled then went back to looking at the scroll.  "What's up Saeza?"* - Thu Oct 15 18:12:16 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) looked was still looking at his scroll, trying to learn everything.  "Trying to learn this jutsu that Trilliam gave me.  This thing is whipping my ass.  O well, gotta do what you gotta do.  What you doing way out here?  You came just to see me?  Awwwww how thoughtful."  He would say with a smile and a laugh.* - Thu Oct 15 18:19:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would see Saeza charge at the rock quickly.  "Shit. . . "  He would jump out of the way and land on his face, slide on the ground, and finally on his back.  He would stand up holding his face.  He would look at Saeza with a what the fuck face and start to speak.

"Wow, what the fuck?  Damn it was just a joke.  Did I make you that mad?  My bad, but damn you could have let me move before you did that."* - Thu Oct 15 18:30:11 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) sits down where he stands and opens the scroll back up. 
"Don't worry about it.  It's in the past.  What are you doing to that sword anyway?  It looks different then from when we sparred somehow."

HE would continue to read the scroll, trying to learn the contents* - Thu Oct 15 18:35:18 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nods his head.  "That's cool.  you think you could show me how to do that?  Please?  Pretty please?  I mean who else could teach me but a strong and beautiful woman like yourself?"  

He was still reaing that scroll though.* - Thu Oct 15 18:40:25 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) just shrugged his shoulders.

"I'ts fine.  Thank you anyway.  JUst let me know when you get better with it.  Until then, guess I just have to wait.  Back to this scroll.  Aaaaaauuuuggggghhhhhh I hate reading."* - Thu Oct 15 18:46:24 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) got the full smile on his face.  

"Holy shit. . . You are a genious.  Damn, why didn't I think of that.  Thanks Saeza.  You're the best."* - Thu Oct 15 18:54:04 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player)  put his hands together and slip under the ground.  He would go and appear directly beside Saeza and handed Saeza the scroll so she could see for herself.

"It was the Earth Style Shadow Clone.  I think I can put it to good use.  Because honestly, I don't show it but I am really smart.  Like. . . Really smart.  Don't tell anybody though, I like to keep it on the low."
 He would then lay down and chill out his damn self* - Thu Oct 15 19:00:54 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) closes his eyes and laces hsi hands behind his head, as he lays down.

"Yea, thanks.  Still if everybody knew then everybody would be asking me all these questions and shit.  I ain't for all of that.  Anyway we ain't doing shit, tell me about Saeza.  I'm all ears."* - Thu Oct 15 19:05:10 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) opens his eyes and looks at Sanoke and the woman with him. 

"Sup.  Who is that?  And why are you towing her?"* - Thu Oct 15 19:11:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) laughs at Sanoke's look and his comments.

"Well I could have said that.  O well to late now.  But we weren't doing anything just training.  We are taking a short break for now though.  It is nice to finally meet your lady friend.  Too bad I can't speak to her at the moment.  But he man. . . Good for you."   He says winking and giving Sanoke a thumbs up.* - Thu Oct 15 19:16:16 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nods his head.

"Yea you are right.  I mean I have decnt reflexes, but that girl is still way to fast for me.  I have to get faster if I want to have any chance at all against her.  You have any suggestions?  I mean if I remember correctly you are even faster then her."* - Thu Oct 15 19:19:40 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You asking us both or just him? - Thu Oct 15 19:20:32 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Nice to meet you I am Hiroshi. - Thu Oct 15 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm . . . What do you specialize in? Need to know so I can help out depending on your abilities. - Thu Oct 15 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Taijutsu. - Thu Oct 15 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Taijutsu? - Thu Oct 15 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm. - Thu Oct 15 19:21:23 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Well . . . Train your leg muscles. - Thu Oct 15 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Some were born to run though if you train them hard enough then you'll achieve what they can. - Thu Oct 15 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Makes sense. - Thu Oct 15 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Thanks. - Thu Oct 15 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You should also try to find out how to take advantage of your arms. - Thu Oct 15 19:22:14 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You obviously will want them faster. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Yea I mean I am strong, but just not as fast as she is. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Train their muscles . . . If you add weight to your arms then it'll just make them slower and not faster. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I don't think I am particularly slow but. . . .  - Thu Oct 15 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Therefore . . . Your training has to not increase your muscle size . . . Just efficiency. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:05 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ok. . Ok. . . I got you.  Thanks for that. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It'll give you not only strength but better speed with your arms. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But yeah. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: The best advice I can give is for elementalists or ninjutsu specialized folk. - Thu Oct 15 19:23:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: ? - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: If you really want even more advice on what to work on. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We can spar and i'll see what you can do. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: And what your priorities should be. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I never turn down a spar. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I have a mission to spar someone anyway. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Let's do this. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: It'll be good for both of us. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Where do you want to spar? - Thu Oct 15 19:24:48 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Ummmm.  Right here if you are cool with that? - Thu Oct 15 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Sure. - Thu Oct 15 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Try going over there. Doesn't seem like I can be in front of you since Sasuke is standing there. - Thu Oct 15 19:25:39 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) rises to his feet and walks away from the crowd of people, not wanting them to get caught in the crossfire.  Just as he was getting up Kilm said what he was thinking.

"Great minds think alike there Kilm."* - Thu Oct 15 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll give you the first move. - Thu Oct 15 19:26:30 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) knew that from the way that Kilm was talking that he was probably a lot stronger, and more experienced then he was.  This did not make Hiroshi worry though, in fact it excited him.  He was happy to have a chance to spar someone like that, it could only help him, if it didn't kill him.  "Ok Kilm. . . Let's do this."

  Hiroshi darts off as fast as he could towards Kilm.  He wasn't extremely fast, but he was faster then the avarage genin fresh out of the academy.  Just as he would get withing striking range he would attempt to throw a solid right hand, towards Kilm's stomach.* - Thu Oct 15 19:30:46 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was unable to make it to Kilm and instead was met by two clones.  This was the same techinique that Trilliam had used against him.  Keeping that in mind he remembered that the clones were actually pretty durable, so if he wanted to do anything to them he had to use pretty much all of the strengh in his body.   As he approached the first of the two clones he would reach into his pouch and pull out a smoke bomb.  He would hold his breath and throw it directly at the ground.  He did this in hopes of hiding himself from Kilm inside of the smoke and to try and stun the clones.  The down side was that he couldn't really see inside of the smoke either.  As the smoke hits the groudn he would put his hands together into a single seal and slip into the earth, so he could try and keep track of the clones that way.  He would lock onto one of them for now and head in that direction, preparing to attack.* - Thu Oct 15 19:39:18 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: If I don't hold back. - Thu Oct 15 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: My ninjutsu will emancipate him. I have to hold back a lot. - Thu Oct 15 19:43:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) knew that this enitire spar was set up by Kilm to help him, keeping that in mind he needed to get to the real Kilm.  While he was underground he didn't feel any movement, so he assumed that Kilm was still in the same place that he had been since he jumped back.  Hopefully the clones were still didn't know where he was either and were still in the smoke.  He would continue on his path, underground.* - Thu Oct 15 19:46:08 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) noticed that some things on the surface had changed, but still the Kilm that he figured was the real one was still in the same place.  He smiled and got ready to launch an attack.  He knew that Kilm probably would be able to handle a straight forward attack, so he decided to try and use the element of surprise.  He would go behind Kilm, but off to the side to avoid that cactus thingy that is in Hiroshi's way at the moment.  He would then quickly attempt a swift right push kick aimed at Kilm's rib cage.  * - Thu Oct 15 19:49:32 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would relax and smile.  

"Yup. . . That is what I was thinking myself.  Thanks for that Kilm.  Really appreciate it bro."  He would walk over to kilm and extend his fist for a fist bump.* - Thu Oct 15 19:56:22 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: I will work on my speed for now then we will see what happens next. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) thinks: . . . Where is Nozumi? He's been missing out on training these last few days . . . I hope he's mastered that B rank by now. I ain't buying him more ice cream if he doesn't have it mastered. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Do that and you'll be able to start focusing on strength again. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Since you'll hit people better. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: O yea could you teach me that clone jutsu some time? - Thu Oct 15 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: We'll see about that. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) says: Right. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:04 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Hm. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Alright. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:56 2015

<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: He could be a rival. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: For Nozumi. - Thu Oct 15 19:58:56 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: But yeah. - Thu Oct 15 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: You're right. - Thu Oct 15 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I need to train these new generation shinobi. - Thu Oct 15 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Even though I'm still learning new things myself. - Thu Oct 15 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Should just share the knowledge I have. - Thu Oct 15 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: Anyway. - Thu Oct 15 19:59:47 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Kilm(Vysasi) says: I'll see you later. - Thu Oct 15 19:59:47 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) followsteh ladies into the area to watch the spar.  He would sit down and lean backagainst the rocks.  He would place his hands behind his head and cross his legs.  He took a nice deep breath and exhaled slowly to relax himself.

"Tjis should be interesting.  Two pretty ladies sparring in front of me. . . Yup as a man I could never pass up this opportunity.  Now to sit back and enjoy. . . Wonder who is going to win?"   He thinks to himself.* - Fri Oct 16 08:15:21 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) watched the spar closely, soaking up all of the information that he could.  Saeze, as usual, was doing things that Hiroshi knew he could try and use in his future endeavors.  That girl always did something that caught his eye.  Marrisa on the other side of the spar was also impresssive in her own rights.  Hell he would even go as far to say that she was outshining Saeza at the moment.  Her reflexes and speed were on point.  HIroshi kept both of these things in mind as he continued to watch the spar.  

"Man this is intense.  Saeza is being pushed back, first time I have seen that.  Marissa is not someone to be trifled with.  I like that, I can learn a thing or two from her.  NOt now though, she is clearly busy.  I just need to watch and make sure I don't get in the way for right now.  I wonder if Saeza will bi- . . . . . Damn I hope she-. . . .Wait. . . .No Hiroshi get that shit out of your mind.  Clean thoughts. . .Clean thoughs. . . . "   he would think to himself.

In an effort to clear his mind he would start to sway back and forth like Stevie Wonder and start to hum a tune while singing the words in his mind.  "I'm a little teapot short and stout~.. . Here is my handle here is my spout~. . . "  It was his jam. . . Don't judge.* - Fri Oct 16 08:39:15 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) took a small sigh of releif upon Marrisa finding a way not to hit the wall from Saeza's throw.

"Phew. .  . . though I was going to have to go and try and stop her from hitting the wall.  She is good. . . Really good.  I'm glad I cam to watch."  He thinks to himself* - Fri Oct 16 08:54:36 2015

"Hey wait.  What the hell is that thing?"* - Fri Oct 16 21:09:20 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) had some free time and decided to do a little training of his own.  This would be the first time in a while he had a chance to do anything alone.  For the time being he was going to work on mastering his HIde like a mole jutsu.  He rather enjoyed the jutsu and knew that he needed to get the jutsu completely under his controp so he could better use it in battle.  Since clearly his taijutsu was good, but now good enough.  There were too many people able to beat him in a straight fist fight and he didn't like it.  So until he got it up to par he would focus on this for right now.  He would put his hands together into a single seal and slip into the earths surface.  He would swim around down there for a while and then get a great idea, maybe he could practice with the resistance o the earth itself.  Maybe that would get his speed up quickly.

Hiroshi was still under the ground, but he was going to train his taijutsu while he was under there, hoping that it would exponenially improve his abilities with continued practice.  He woudl start by throwing some simple punches and kicks.  The earth moving around his body as he attacked his imaginary foe.  The earth was acting as a small resistant though and Hiroshi was glad it was working like he thought it would.  He would then move onto more complicated things such as combinations.  He woudl start with a quick left jab followd by a right hook.  He would use the momentum from the right hook and continue to spin.  The spin would augment the right spinning round house kick that came next.  He would end the combination with a right uppercut.  With each movement he could feel his chakra sapping out of him from being under ground.  This seems like this is going to help him in more ways then one.
