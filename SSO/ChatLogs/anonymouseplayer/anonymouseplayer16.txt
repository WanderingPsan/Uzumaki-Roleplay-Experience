<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) nervously looks at the rock and then down at his open right hand.  Then back at the rock.  Then at Paine.  Finally he focused back on the rock.  Encouraging himself mentally before going through with the action.

"Come on Hiro. . . You can do this. . . Somehow you have to.  She told you to so you have to find a way.  But damn. . . It's a rock how do I break it with just fingers?  She really is amazing.  She made it look so easy.  Maybe it is?  Maybe I am overthinking this?  Screw it.  Let's go."

He then got into his fighting stance and pulled his right hand back until his open hand was lined up perfectly with his waist.  In one quick motion he threw his hand forward with his fingers extended, keeping what she said in mind so he wouldn't harm himself.  They made contact with the rock. . . . Nothing happened but his fingers were on fire.  He would start to shake his hand, trying to rid himself of the pain.

It was mocking him, laughing at him.  Big blue eyes and shit. . . The rock was actually making him a little upset.  He tensed up and focused all of his strength into his hand.  Then once again he thrusted his hand into the rock.  His fingers colided into the rock once again.  He made a small indent but the pain of his fingers hitting the rock shot through his entire hand.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) decided to join Momura in repeated strikes.  Ignoring the pain, he started to throw a flurry of finger strikes at the rock.  His hands moving as fast as he could make them.  He aimed each attack at the same spot.  Trying to find a way to make progress on this damn rock.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked back into the training area and to the rock.  This rock was still just looking at him with the same damn glaze in it's eye.  This rock seemed to be enjoying Hiro's failures.  If only he could just put a single hole in this bastard he would be able to stop.  he could not keep this up for too long because he was goign to break his fingers if he did.  HIs fingers were already hurting from this training that Pai-Sensei had him doing.  Still, he ignored it and fought through the pain to continue to train.  

He got into his fighting stance and took a deep breath.  He opened up his hands and pulled his hands to each of his sides, waist level.  He closed his eyes and visualized the end result of his training.  He saw a slightly older Hiroshi with strength far beyond that of what he has right now.  This made him smile both on the inside and outside.  Then quickly he threw a mighty finger stright at the rock, keeping waht sensei had in mind to avoid any serious injuries to himself.  His fingers colided with the rock and pain shot through his hand again. . . . . "Shit. . "* - Sun Nov 22 21:20:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) moved off to the side and sat against the wall, watching the two closely.* - Sun Nov 22 21:20:51 2015
