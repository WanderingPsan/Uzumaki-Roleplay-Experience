<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked to the gates with his mission partner Yuda.  He didn't know the kid all too well, but a mission was a mission and he didn't have a problem with Yuda as of now.  A light conversation between the two took place until their client had gotten there.  It was an older gentleman dressed to impress.  He walked in as if he was looking for something.  When he spotted the two shinobi he took off his hat with his right hand and held it in front of him as he bowed and introduced himself.  "Good day gentlemen.  I take it you are my escorts?"

Hiroshi would nod to the older gentleman and start to speak.  "Yessir.  I am Hideo, Hiroshi.  I and my comrade over here will be escorting you around the village as requested."  He then turned around and instructed the gentleman to follow.  This was goign to be a nice, slow tour.

The first thing that they passed was the training area.  The gentleman peeked in and saw various shinobi inside training to their hearts content.  "Seems like you all have a nice place to traing here sonny."  Hiroshi would nod his head and start to explain the area.  "As you can see this is the training area.  This is where most of our shinobi come to do some training.  Most spars take place here and sometimes we actually jsut hang out.  Right now there is a class from the academy working on things.  That is our next stop."  

They arrived at the academy and Hiro started to once again give him the run down.  "As the sign on this building says.  This is the Academy.  This is where all the children that were training in the training area came from.  This place is used to bring up our shinobi.  They learn the basics of being a ninja, as well as the history of their home and the shinobi world.  Now the next stop is a place that I really like.  The hungry ant."

The three got to the Hungry Ant and went inside.  Hiroshi got them a table and handed each of them a menu.  "This place is our hottest restaurant, The Hungry Ant.  It is owned by a young lady named Momura.  You can order whatever you would like.  I will pay for it as part of the tour.  Yuda, when we are done you will be the one doing the talking alright?"  He would say with a smile.* - Mon Nov 30 23:47:37 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) and Yuda had finished the first of the missions that Sanoke had given them.  Now they had to deliver a package outside of the village.  This was one of the few times that Hiroshi had gotten to get outside of the village and he was a bit excited.  He was smiling from ear to ear as he strolled outside of the village with the materials held tightly in each of his hands.  They weren't too heavy, but this was going to be a long trip.  He turned to Yuda and started to give him the precise instructions that he had been given himself.

"Ok Yuda, we have to go and take these materials that we just picked up to a Samurai Settlement south of Konohagakure.  This will be quite a walk so we have to make sure that we pace ourselves.  Plus we have to be on the lookout for anything that might come our way.  This should be a pretty easy mission but we are shinobi.  We have to be ready for anything. Now lets hurry up and do this so we can finish everything else that we have to do."  He would then walk outside of the gates expecting Yuda to follow.

Once they left the outskirts of Sunagakure and entered the forest, they took a short break.  Hiroshi wanted to make sure that they were both well rested for the duration of this trip.  Plus, he didn't know the extend of Yuda's stamina and physical ability.  So just to be on the safe side, the break was on.  Hiroshi placed his boxes down onto the ground and sat under a nearby tree, relaxing in the shade.  "Ahhhhh, nice day today."

After about a 30 minute break Hiroshi rose to his feet and dusted himself off.  "Ok Yuda, back to work."  Off they went again to the Samurai Settlement.  After a little more walking the settlement came into view.  A few Samurai were guarding the entrance and asked their reason for coming.  Hiroshi explained what was goign on and the samurai examined the materials for safety.  They then let both of them inside.

Hiroshi saw the client and introduced them both to them.  "Hello, I am Hiroshi and this here is Yuda.  We were sent here to give you these.  They have been checked already at the gate, but if you would like, we would be glad to open them and show you that these are indeed what you wanted."  The cliend nodded his head and requested that we opened it up and show him right then and there.  Hiroshi complied and opened up the box.  * - Tue Dec  1 00:24:19 2015

You must cut down a tree in the forest and take the wood to a small village in the south of the Land of Fire.

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo, Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) returned to the village, just to go back out and complete one last task.  They both had to go and cut down a large tree, then take the wood to a small village in the south of the Land of Fire.  They went to the village store and were given the proper tools for the task at hand.  Hiroshi thanked him and went on towards the tree.  While they were walking he breifed Yuda on the final mission that they had to accomplish together for the day.

"Ok Yuda.  This is the last one that we have to do.  We have to go into the forest and cut down a tree.  Then we have to take said tree to this village in the south of the Land of Fire."  He pointed to the location on a map that he had been given from the store manager.  "Once we take the wood there we are finished and can go back home to do whatever we need to do.  This also should be a pretty simple mission.  It is just goign to take some effort.  Now let's find that tree."

The reached the forest and the tree was very easy to find.  It was literally the biggest tree that was in the forest.  Hiroshi looked up to the top of the tree, holding the supplies in hand.  He would marvel at how big the tree really was.  "Wow. . This tree is huge.  We will have to work together to take this after we cut it down."  He handed Yuda a single side of the double handled saw that he had been given.  Then, working together, they started to cut the trunk of this big ass tree.

Back and forth the two shinobi went.  Pushing, then pulling.  Pulling, then pushing.  The teeth on the saw digging further and further into the tree with each motion.  The two seemed to be working in sync and were actually moving at a better pace then Hiro had once thought.  He called out to Yuda on the other side of the tree.  "How are you hanging in there Yuda?  We are almost done with cutting it down.  Then all we have to do is carry it to the place."  He would continue the motion needed for the cutting of the tree.

Finally, after a while of cutting, the giant tree started to fall.  With a loud crackle and multiple leaves falling to the ground, the tree started to tip down towars the ground.  Both Yuda and Hiroshi would move out of harms way and let the tree fall onto the ground.  They would head over and use all of their combined strength to pick up the tree.  They then started to head to their destination.* - Tue Dec  1 00:49:04 2015

"Ok.  This is called Dynamic Entry.  In all honesty, it is just a glorified jump kick to your opponents face.  Just make sure that when you do this you keep yourself balanced.  Before you jump right into it, practice your balance for a second.  Make sure that you can jump up, full speed, and keep yourself under total control.  If you can't do that then you might hurt yourself.  And I don't want that.  This is what it should look like."

He would then demonstrate the jutsu on the wall behind him.  "Now start practicing that balance."* - Tue Dec  1 01:56:28 2015
