<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) Saeza nods her head as she throws her hands into a single seal. She creates two clones. The two clones immediately begin to perform a string of seals.

"Katon: Goukyakyuu!" The clone on the right roars as it lets off a rather sizable fireball towards the two individuals directly in front of the real Saeza.

"Fuuton: Reppushou!" It exclaims as it releases a massive burst of wind into the back of the fireball causing it to expand and move faster towards the two individuals.

The real Saeza begins a string of seals to respond.*)* - Thu Oct 22 06:41:29 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was glad he expected things to always take a turn for towards danger whenever Sae was involved.  I mean the last time he faught her she used her swords, so this display honestly wasn't too surprising.  He really didn't want to do what he was about to do, but if he didn't he might not make it out of this spar alive.  So he quickly put his hands together into a single seal and coated hismelf in his Doton chakra.  He would slip into the earth, to avoid the flames coming his way.  As he was under ground he would start to move towards the area that Sanoke and Sae were.  As he was swimming along he would think to himself.

"Damnit. . . I am not going to be stuck down here like last time. . . I refuse."* - Thu Oct 22 06:51:44 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was clearly out of his league in this entire situation.  Still, that wasn't going to stop him from trying.  This was something that would help him after all.  While he was underground, he continued to feel more and more people appearing on the surface.  He had no idea what the hell was going on up there, but he didn't want to stay under the ground forever.  He would move away from the collection of people he felt before rising back above the ground, looking in their direction.  What he saw when he resurfaced was not pleasing to him at all.  Multiple Sanokes and multiple Saezas.  That was clearly not what he wanted to see.  He knew that the element of surprise was probably not going to work with either of them.  So he put his hands together into a bird seal and took in a deep breath.  He would then spit out 5 bullets of air.  One aimed at each of the people there, and an extra aimed at the Saeza closest to him.  He didn't know who was real and who was not at this point.* - Thu Oct 22 07:07:05 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was completely out classed by Sanoke, in both speed and attack speed.  Before he knew it there was a kick coming at his chest.  He tried to react to it, but was too slow.  He was hit, then before he knew it he felt his legs being swept away from him.  He went umbling to the ground.  He struggled to his feet, whipied the blood from his mouth, and went back at Sanoke.  He knew that it was not going to work out in his favor, at this point it was just to try and get a little better.  He would attempt to use the same exact move as Sanoke did.  Seeing Sanoke as a superior to himself,Hiroshi figured that the way Sanoke did it would be way better then anything Hiroshi could do at the moment.  So he sent a bitch as imitation of what Sanoke just did right back at him.  * - Thu Oct 22 07:25:52 2015
<br><br><font color=teal>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) thinks: If he hits me like that again its a wrap. . . .  - Thu Oct 22 07:27:34 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) would have his kicks blocked skillfully, as expected.  He would then feel a massive heel drop onto his dome.  This was clearly all the young shinobi could take.  He would go crashing into the ground face-first.  He was wavering on the brink of conciousness, but could not move a muscle.  He just lay there on the ground, defeated.* - Thu Oct 22 07:36:57 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) tried to speak, but all he could get out was a mumble.  

"I. . .B.e.. . . F. . i . . e. . . H. .l. .p. . . e. . . up. . . p. . . s. . .e"* - Thu Oct 22 07:51:28 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) gives him a weak smile.  He wasn't to happy about being carried, but he was to tired to do anything about it.  

"T-Thanks. . . "  He would say as he lost his fight with his conciousness.* - Thu Oct 22 07:57:26 2015
<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) was carried in by Sanoke and layed onto the bench, out cold.* - Thu Oct 22 08:00:00 2015

<br><br><font color=yellow>*Hideo,Hiroshi(Anonymouse player) walked up to his usual area he seemed to be the most comfortable in.  He was going to do some more training.  He stood there in front of the mountain, about to try and demolish it with his bullets.  He would lock in the required seals and call forth his Wind natured chakra.  He would then take a deep breath and send out a barrage of bullets at the wall.  The bullets would leave tiny dents into the wall, but nothing too serious.  He wasn't the most powerful just yet.

HIroshi looked at the wall, a little disappointed in himself.  He felt like he could do better.  Maybe he just had to put some more effort into it.  That might work, might not, only one way to find out. He would focus his chakra in his lungs, as much as he could.  He would take a deep breth and turn towards the cactus not far from him.  He wanted to see if he was able to break the cactus as Mari-sensei did.  He would then send out 3 bullets.  Each one would hit the cactus and disappate.  He shook his head.  He had some work to do.* - Thu Oct 22 18:28:54 2015
